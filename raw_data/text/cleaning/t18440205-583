                  </hi>. I am butler, in the service of a nobleman. About three months ago I was residing with my master at Brighton—I there became acquainted with the prisoner by meeting him in the street accidentally—we fell in conversation about the different sights that were passing in Brighton—I met him and conversed with him several different times—he did not know I was in service—I did not know how he was getting his living—I never visited him or he me, we merely spoke casually in passing—I came to London on the 2nd Jan—we put up at Grillion's hotel, Albemarle-street—about a fortnight after I came to London I met the prisoner in the Strand, he re<lb></lb>cognised me, and said, "What, you have come from Brighton," or something similar to that—I said, "Yes"—we entered into conversation a little time in walking up the street together—it was raining very hard—I asked if he would like a glass of ale—he said he should prefer a glass of gin and water, and I gave him one at a public-house close to Charing-cross hospital—before we went to the public-house he asked if I would take a parcel to Brighton for him—I said with great pleasure, for I should be returning there—he said it was a present that he intended to give to the person where he was lodging in Brighton, who had behaved very civilly to him—he asked me my address in town—I told him where I was staying—I then parted with him and went back to Grillion's hotel—I think this was about the Wednesday, and on Satur<lb></lb>day the 27th he came to the hotel—there is no room or place of reception there for the servants, except the front ball where persons are passing to and fro—I had a bed-room there—my master was labouring under a disorder for which he had undergone an operation—about nine o'clock, or a quarter to nine, on the evening of the 27th, the prisoner came to the hotel—he was shown up to my room—he did not bring any parcel for me—he said he would send it—we were talking together in my room for twenty minutes or half an hour—his con<lb></lb>versation was about travelling, where he had been, and what he had seen, at Ireland, Liverpool, and several places, and about what he bad seen at Brighton—I never took, or attempted to take, any liberty of any kind whatever with him during the time he was in my room, or in my company—I went down stairs with him and let him out—I should say he did not drop in my room any brown pocket-book with three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Bank of England notes in it—he could not have done so without my finding it—he did not drop any on the stairs, nor were any such afterwards found—on the following Monday morning, about eleven, I received this letter—it came by the post—as soon as I had read it I went down to Mr. Grillion and asked his advice about it, which he gave me—that was about ten minutes after Ireceived it—when I met the prisoner in the Strand he gave me this card of his address, "Mrs. Walters' and Mrs. Hunt's private lodging-house, No. 116, Drummond-street, opposite the arrival side of Euston-square station."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Wright and Smith, attornies, Golden-square. Iwas applied to on this matter on the evening of the 31st of Jan.—a letter came to our office, directed to the firm, which inclosed a letter which I have, and which brought my attention to this—I afterwards saw Robinson on the subject, and received from him this card, and one or two letters—the letter in question I received from Mr. Wright—in consequence of an arrangement that was made, I went to Grillion's hotel, and saw Robinson—in consequence of what he told me, I went to Vine-street station, procured the assistance of Mount, the constable, and went with him and Robinson to No. 116, Drummond-street, the address on this card—I knocked at the door, and asked whether a person named Smyth lived there—I found that he did, and was at home—I was asked into the passage, and the prisoner came down to me—I introduced myself as a friend of Mr. Robinson's—he asked me to walk in, which I did, into the back parlour—I told him I understood he made a very abominable charge against Mr. Robinson—he said, "Hush, hush, there are gentlemen in the other room, they will hear what you are saying"—I told him that rather than avoid any exposure in such a disgraceful matter, I had called to endeavour to arrange it—I produced a letter to him, not the one in question, and said, "I believe that is your handwriting, Mr. Smyth?"—he said it was—I then asked whether he had written a letter dated the 28th of January, in which he said he had lost 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, and claimed three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes—he said he had—I asked what was the reason that he claimed those three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes—he said that Mr. Robinson might have settled it at that time if he thought proper—I then asked if he had written a letter the following day, in which he claimed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said, "Yes, I certainly did write the letter"—I asked why he wrote that second letter—he said that Mr. Robinson had not acted in a gentlemanly manner, and that was the reason he had doubled his demand, or the reason why he asked 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I said I thought it was a great pity a thing of this sort should become publicly known; that I had seen Mr. Robinson, but, unfortunately, all the money he had in his pocket was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I had promised to go to a friend of mine and get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; more, in which I had failed—he then asked, if I was a friend of Mr. Robinson's, why I did not pay the money myself; at the same time adding, "If your friend won't advance money, why don't you go and get it?"—at the latter part of the conversation I drew my purse from my pocket, and said, "All the money I have is about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;"—I then produced a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, and said, "Will you take this on account, and I will pay the other 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in the course of to-morrow?"—he said, "I have no objection to take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, pro<lb></lb>viding you promise me faithfully to bring the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to-morrow"—I asked what time it would be convenient for me to see him, and one o'clock was fixed—I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note of the Brighton Union Bank—the policeman was waiting opposite the house at this time—I asked the prisoner if he would be kind enough to show me the way to the door, (for the purpose of giving notice to the policeman—all the story about bringing the money to-morrow was a scheme for the purpose of giving him into custody with the note on him)—he came to light me to the door—he put the light down on the ground—I took off my hat, which was the signal agreed upon with the policeman—he came up immediately, and I gave him into custody—Robinson was waiting a door or two from us—I made a motion to him, and he came up and identified him—when the policeman came up, the prisoner ran from him, down the passage, and into the back parlour—the policeman and I followed him—he made a motion with his arm, as if to throw something out of his hand, and, as I fol<lb></lb>lowed him in, a piece of paper dropped on the table—I took it up, and it was</p>

               <p>the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note I had given him—when I gave him into custody he said, "Hush, hush, don't make a noise, this thing may be settled."</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—" Sunday, 28th January, 1844, Mr. Roberson, Sir, It gives me the greatest pain to be under the necessity of writing to you on a subject I am now about to do, but I think it better to apprize you of the circumstance before writing to his Lordship, your master; as I lost on Saturday night, in your bed-room, or on the stairs of the hotel, a small brown pocket-book, containing three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Bank of England notes, of which I have not the numbers, and having a call for a large demand of cash on Wednesday morning, will, I assure you, greatly injure me; and that dread<lb></lb>ful insult offered by you on that night, in wishing me to let you commit such a crime on my person as you did, is much against you, and unless you for<lb></lb>ward to me the sum lost, by Tuesday night, my solicitor will write to his Lord<lb></lb>ship on Wednesday morning concerning your base conduct. I am bent on going to the utmost extremity of the law, should you fail in sending it to me at my lodging, 116, Drummond-street, Euston-square, by the time named. I feel so disgusted with you, that I sincerely hope, you will not attempt calling on me; for a man of your years to be guilty of such a crime, was you now here, I am sure I should give you in charge; return me what I have lost, and keep out of my way, and no one shall ever hear of it. Mr. Roberson, Grillion's Hotel, 7, Albemarle-street, Piccadilly, London."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp, (Counsel for Walsh).</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband's name is Robert? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it fince you saw him? - A. I suppose a year and a half; he has followed the sea fourteen years; he never was sent abroad near Botany Bay; he is now on board the Kent, of 74 guns; I never saw Blake till he came after the house in October, when he came with another person, but I am sure he did not stop all night: on the night of the robbery there were plenty of people in the house, and I called loudly, but they did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the dining-room over the tap-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any men in the house? - A. I dare say a dozen below.</p>

            No; I stopped Blake, Walsh run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart, (Counsel for Blake). Q. You say you never saw Blake till the 22d of October? - A. I never saw him but three times before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in the coach, who went out to him? - A. The coachman came, and asked for a quartern of gin, and said, a gentleman wanted to speak to the mistress of the house; I went out, and Blake said, don't you know me, my name is Evans; then I said, oh then, Mr. Evans, you mean to have the house; then he told me to take the reckoning out of that piece of paper, or to take it out of that which was in the paper. (Produces a gilt ring).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he go up stairs, without Walsh? - A. Yes; but I was not above two minutes up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let a man go up stairs, that offered you a two-penny ring at the door? - A. It was a drinking-room for any body.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been to see Blake since in prison?-A. His wife has been to me to offer twenty pounds, thirty pounds, or any money to go out of the way, and not appear against him, and I went to him in prison two or three times, for the poor woman came and cried, and said, she was with-child, and had three children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never offer that you would not prosecute, if they would give you fifty pounds? - A. No; I said, the truth I would stand to the longest day I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What prison did you go to? - A. I never went without the woman; I went twice to Tothillfields, and no more, and once to Newgate, when they begged me to keep away, but I said, I would take no bribery; I did not eat or drink with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these notes? -(Produces several letters). - A. No; I can neither read or write.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it for granted, when a woman cried out, murder, or that she was robbed, in your hearing, you would give your assistance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought so, you appear like a man of gallantry - now, did you hear any thing like that at this house? - A. I heard a noise of Mrs. Thompson singing out for assistance, for that she had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes, as she was going out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise over head? - A. I heard a noise over head, but I could not say what it was, I was busy with my company; there might be between twenty and thirty.</p>

               <p>- BLY sworn. - I am a constable, and apprehended Walsh on the 11th of November; I searched him, and found this duplicate, (produces it); the Magistrates desired me to take care of this letter, directed to the worshipful Magistrates at Queen's-square, (produces it); Walsh acknowledged it to be his writing.(The property was produced, and identified by the prosecutrix).</p>
               <p>Blake's defence. Wanting to take a public-house, I went to the Plough, and asked that woman the terms; we could not agree about it then, and on the 22d of October I took a friend with me to see whether he liked it; I had 98 guineas in my pocket, which I took for to pay in case we agreed; she took us into a back parlour, and brought in a bottle of brandy, of which we all drank; I went to pay, but she said, she had no change, and I had better look over the house; she then took me up stairs, and at last shewed me into her bed-room, where she kept me for about two hours, and there said, meet me at 4 o'clock to-morrow, at the Crown and Thistle; in the Haymarket, which I did; she kept me out drinking till between eight and nine o'clock and then she told me to call myself Evans, as she knew a captain of that name; we went home in a coach, and she took me up stairs, and locked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020033"></xptr>me into her bed-room; by and by she came up, and stripped off, and made me go to bed with her; she had brought up a bottle of brandy, and she and I had three glasses a-piece; in the morning I asked her for change, she said she had not got any, but, says she, here are three rings, and I will meet you between ten and eleven o'clock, at Westminster-bridge; she gave me the three rings, two of which I sold and gave her back the other, on which I had had my name and her's engraved by her desire: On the 4th of November, when I got to the door, I told the coachman to call for a quartern of gin, and desire the mistress to come to me, she did, and I said, here is the ring and the money I borrowed of you, I cannot stop now; but she took hold of me, made me get out and go to her bed-chamber; then she ran down stairs, brought up the brandy bottle, and she and I drank about six glasses a-piece; she then said, there is a man of the name of Wade, who is a young man, and lodges in the house; I will leave him and go with you; you can tell the maid the person in the coach is your mate, and he can draw up a letter to shew to Wade, and I will go along with you this night; I told her that would not suit me, but I would think of it, and as I was dry, would have a pint of beer; she run down stairs for it, and when she came up, she took up this parasol, and said, I will go with you, and will throw these things to your friend in the coach; I opposed her doing it, and said, I would not agree to it; upon which she charged me with robbing her; I thought she was joking, till this very man, Wade, came up, and knocked me down, saying, you rascal, I will get forty pounds for swearing your life away; they then sent for a patrole and took me away; while I was in Tothil-fields, she said, if I would give her fifty pounds, she would forgive me.</p>

               <p>Walsh's defence. My Lord, on the day this circumstance happened, I met with Blake, who asked me to go to the Plough with him; I agreed, and we took a coach at Charing-cross; he desired the coachman, when at the Plough, to tell the woman of the house she was wanted she came, and Blake took something out of his pocket, desiring her to take charge of it, she then began exclaiming, "my dear husband, where have you been so long from me?" and so on, and made him get out of the coach; after I had sat a considerable time in the coach, near to falling asleep, I heard a tapping at the coach door, and Mrs. Thompson said, she wished me to walk up stairs; on coming into the room, "is this the mate of your vessel," said she? "yes," says he; we sat down and had some brandy and water; what passed between them, upon my word I am ashamed to relate, it was so bad; I was obliged to go down stairs, where I saw Wade; the way they went on, forced me to come down; soon after, the maid called out, saying, her mistress wanted me up stairs; I went up, and she said,"Mr. Walsh, see how your friend has robbed me, all these things I have taken from his person;" "I don't think," said I, "that he would be guilty of it, if I thought so, I would give him up;" yes, says she, he has, and you must go to prison with him; as to the duplicate I never saw it till at the Magistrate's; the officer picked the ticket off the ground, for Mrs. Thompson came up to me and laid hold of me in a very violent manner; she certainly put it under my coat; it was not pledged till six days after, and it is very unlikely that I should keep it in my possession so long, if I had stole it.</p>
               <p>Bly. When we searched him, he made a slip, which I suppose was intentionally done, and the papers fell on the ground; the woman was against the door, she could not possibly do it.</p>

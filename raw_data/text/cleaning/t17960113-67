               <p>Q. Did you observe the men? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not take notice of the other two? - A. The man that stands next to him, Hall, I know was one, because he laughed at me; the other I cannot justly say to him; he is very much like the man, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive to those two men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see them again? - A. The Saturday following at Bow-street; I was robbed on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the men you saw on the Saturday, were the men who attacked you on the Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>

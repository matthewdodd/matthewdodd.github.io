                  </hi>. I live at Penge, in Surrey, and am a gardener. On 15th Nov., about half past 12 o'clock at night I was in Tooley-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up to me—I am sure he is the man—he asked me for something to drink—I wished him to go away, but he would not—he kept staying about me; he followed me—he went away for a minute or two, and came up to me again in Tooley-street—he wanted me to give him something to drink—and another man came and joined him—I said, "Surely there is no public house open"—he said, "Yes, there is, I will find one"—he kept talk<lb></lb>ing to me all the time, but I kept leering away from him—he walked more behind me than beside me—he was joined by the third party between the Town Hall and St. George's church—he said, "Surely you will give us something to drink?"—I told him there was no public house open—he said, "Yes, there is, if you will come with me, I shall find one"—he said, "Follow me"—and I followed him—he went down a court, and the man that had joined him kept behind-me, and the prisoner before me—when I entered the court, I said, "Surely there is no public house here?"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Yes, there is, I will find one"—he went on a little further—I thought I was in danger, but I thought the best way was to be as quiet as I could—the prisoner then knocked at the door of a house which appeared to me to be a private house—the door was opened, and the prisoner went in—he said, "Come on"—I went in, and the third man followed me—I gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some gin, and some beer—the gin was brought in, and some was offered to me, and, from the scent, I thought it was a drug—it did not at all smell like gin—I did not take any of it—I put the beer to my lips, and tasted it, but did not like it—I did not take the gin or beer—they did not drink the beer or the gin in my presence—shortly afterwards there were twenty or thirty persons in the room—I went out of the house—my suspicion was raised, and I thought it better to leave—I left, and got a few yards from the house—I was walking on, the prisoner was close by, and there was one man slipped his hands over my head, and throttled me—I know that was not the prisoner—the prisoner was at my pocket—this was in the court, not far from the door—I might have got twenty or thirty yards—before I came out of the room I said, "I wish to go," and got off the seat that the prisoner had presented to me when I went in—some person in the house, not the prisoner, told me to stop longer—when they saw me determined to go the prisoner was close by the door—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther he opened it or not—I went out, the prisoner followed me, and the man that joined him, and two others—yes, there were four men—one was on each side of me—the prisoner was at my side, at my pocket—I am sure he was one of the men—he was rifling my pocket at the time the man seized me by the neck—and one of the men. kept hold of my other arm—the prisoner</p>

               <p>laid hold of me—there was another man on the other side, and the man be<lb></lb>hind me that had his hand round my neck—he pressed me very tightly indeed—I could not call out—not a word—after being about my pockets, they immediately ran off in different directions—the prisoner was awere that I knew him before, so I kept by him—I stuck close by him—I called the police—the prisoner ran off, and I followed him; I laid hold of him, and kept him till a policeman came up—I did not lose sight of him—after they had gone I looked in my pocket, and missed two half crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my neck handkerchief was taken away, and my umbrella and pocket handker<lb></lb>chief—these things were all safe after I left the house—the man that held me by the neck, and another man loosened the handkerchief from my neck—the policeman came up to me immediately—the house I was in was not a public house—it appeared quite private—the court is in Redcross-street, on the right hand side as you go from London Bridge—my proper side was the other side, but I went across with the prisoner—when the other man joined the prisoner it was not discretionary with me, it appeared quite com<lb></lb>pulsory—the turning we went in is not a cart way turning—the entrance is quite narrow, and the street is wider.</p>

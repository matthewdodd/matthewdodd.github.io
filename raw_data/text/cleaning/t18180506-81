As he was helping me up again he must have drawn the watch out of my fob. I had my hands in my breeches pocket, and could not help myself - I did not suspect him at that time. He asked my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060028"></xptr>pardon, which I willingly granted him; we wished each other a good night, bowed, and parted. He went one way and I the other. I went ten or twelve yards further, and missed my watch. I had seen no other person-he must be the man who took it. I looked round, but he was out of sight, and I thought it useless to pursue. On the 13th of April I was coming down Oxford-street, just below Stratford-place, and met him. There was a strong light from a cheesemonger's shop - I had a friend with me. I said he was very much like the man who took my watch. I went back, and walked by his side two or three yards - I was not certain that he was the man. I asked him how he was, and if he did not know me? he said, No. I said, "I think I know you; and if I am not mistaken, you are the person who took my watch the other night." At these words he said, "D-n it! if you will walk a little way I will settle it with you"- this convinced me that he was the man. I took hold of his arm; I suppose he thought I intended to walk with him, which I did for a few yards, till we met a watchman, I then gave him in charge-we took him to Marylebone watch-house - He then said that he knew where the watch was. He did not choose to tell where it was, but he had pledged it. He asked me to go to his friends, I refused. My watch was found at a pawnbroker's in Prince's-street.</p>

            . I am a constable; the prisoner was given into my charge - I found nothing on him but a latch-key. I locked him up. About a quarter of an hour after, he knocked at the prison-door, and asked if there was any person I could send for a friend of his? I told him there was not at that time. He then asked me what I thought of his case? I told him I thought it would go very hard with him. He then said he had taken the watch from the young man, and it was pledged at a pawnbroker's, of the name of Dobree, be believed, but did not rightly know the name. I asked him where the duplicate was? he said a person had got it, but he should decline telling who it was, as he did not wish him to know where he was. Next day I found the watch at Dogherty's, in Prince's-street, pledged in the name of Maclean. He said

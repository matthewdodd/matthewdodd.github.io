               <p>Q. Before you went in did you observe whether the prisoners were there - A. Yes. I saw them there just before the doors were opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the money go from you - A. No, I did not. As soon as I got upon the step I missed the money; it was in my breeches pocket; I found my pocket had been turned out. When the officer took the prisoners there were only seven shillings found. Both of the prisoners were near me. Heally was the nearest to me; Oliver was of his side. When I missed my money I laid hold of Heally; I said, you have robbed me. I saw nothing in his hand. I then laid hold of Oliver; I said, you have got my money. At the time I seized him he was not near enough to take my money without the other had handed it him. Oliver had seven shillings in his hand. When he was taken he said he had it of his master in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer at Sadlers Wells. When I was called Brown and Gavis had got hold of the two prisoners; Oliver had got some money in his hand; I saw it shine through his fingers; I told him to open his hand; he opened his hand; it turned out to be two three-shilling bank-tokens, a shilling, and a farthing. Garvis observed if it was his money there was orange-peel with it; he had some orange-peel in his pocket. On examining the hand there was orange-peel with the money. I looked at Oliver's hand and saw orange-peel. I then told the two prisoners they must go with me to Hatton Garden office. We searched them after they got to the office; Heally had two shillings about him and some halfpence. Oliver had nothing but halfpence in one of his pockets. Heally gave in his name as Brown, at the office.</p>

            . I am a stationer; I live in Token-house-yard, Lothbury. On the 27th of February, at about half after four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the end of <placeName id="t18160403-88-crimeloc439">Buckler's Bury</placeName>

I observed the prisoner attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket. I crossed to the other side to watch the prisoner. He tried several others but did not succeed. I then observed a gentleman go along with his handkerchief just peeping out. They immediately surrounded him, and the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18160403-88-person741">drew</persName>
             the handkerchief out of his pocket, clapped it to his breast and ran away. I caught the prisoner as he was going down Wood-street. He threw the pocket handkerchief away directly. An officer named John Brown came up soon after. The gentleman has never appeared.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. The prisoner and handkerchief were delivered to me.</p>

               <p>(Handkerchief produced.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Cheapside, and I took my handkerchief out of my bosom to wipe my nose, and the young man came up and said I stole it, which was very false; and they went after a gentleman and asked him, had he not lost his handkerchief, and he said no, don't bother me; I never stole it.</p>

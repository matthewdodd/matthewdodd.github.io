On Sunday night, 22nd Oct., I was in Tower-street, Westminster-road—Price came up to me and said, "How are you?"—I said, "Very well, how are you?"—he said, "Who would have thought of seeing you here"—I said, "I don't know that any one did"—he said, "Thomas, you certainly know me"—I said, "No; nor you don't know me; nor I don't want to have anything to say to you"—he directly put his hand to my pocket—I put my hand to my trowsers pocket, and five or six came round me, and one of them snatched my watch from my pocket—I heard the guard snap from my neck—when I came to myself a little from the struggle, Sunter had got hold of my stock, and shoved me backwards against the rail, and Price was standing by the side of him.</p>

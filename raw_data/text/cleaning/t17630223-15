             this silk was delivered into the care of the servant that has the care of raw silk before it is put to do; several days after the silk came in, he came to us in the counting-house, and told us the last parcel of silk weighed 16 lb. upon which I said he had tied them in separate bags, which I was sure had been untied; he said, they were done up different to what they were when he did them: I did not at that time suspect they were stolen, but thought that (it being evening) he might have mixed them together himself, so told him to let it alone till morning; in the morning we examined and weighed the other parcel, which wanted 1 lb. 2 oz. in the whole was wanting 2 lb. 1 oz. this made me suspcious: the prisoner had warp'd one parcel of silk that day; my man asked me if I had ordered him to warp another cane? I told him no; he said there was as much silk gone as goes to the warping. A cane contains 126 yards of silk and worsted together, this silk is only a part; I was more suspicious, and in the morning went to a neighbour that had frequently been in things of this sort; we went and got a warrant of Justice Somerville, but he desired us to lay a trap for him; accordingly my partner and I threw a parcel of bobbins in the way, marked, and the next morning found them in the same condition we left them: we had the day before sent for some bobbins to wind silk, and there not being enough, we put them in a drawer; my apprentice came in the morning, and asked me, if I had taken one of the bobbins out? I went, and found one missing; my partner said, he thought it was came to serve the warrant; for, though we could not fix upon any one, it was time to search: he was obliged to go out, so the whole weight of the affair fell upon me. I went to the gentleman's I mentioned first, and we went and searched the house where Holden lived; when we searched the lower room, we found small quantities of worsted that was our property, this was upon the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did it lie?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. There was some in a trunk about 18 inches broad, I know it to be my property, it being a peculiar sort: Mrs. Holden wanted to go up stairs, but was refused, I insisted upon going with her; when we came into the room, it appeared more like a warehouse than any thing else; there was worsted on the floor to a great amount; upon opening a hat-box we saw several bobbins of orange-colour silk, together with some pink, we had missed the pink the first thing, but we had not missed the orange, they were worth about 2 s. 6 d. a bobbin; in a trunk I found, I believe, 60 bobbins more, and I think some of the pink silk, there was in the same box a large painted Christmass-box, on the opening of which we found 14 l. 2 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that these things you found were your goods?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I am positive that these things we found in the box, &amp;c. were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I took him up on the same day that I found these bobbins, and delivered him into the custody of the constable; he asked me what he must do with him? I told him to carry him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. He said it was the first time, if I would forgive him he would do so no more: these bobbins are most of them mark'd with my name, (produc'd in court) besides they are mark'd with our windster's mark. We took the mother to the alehouse, and told her, that the way to have favour, would be to confess. She confess'd that he dealt with

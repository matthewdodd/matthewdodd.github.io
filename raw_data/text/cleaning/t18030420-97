That is all I know about it.</p>

             sworn. - I was an officer at the time, but am not at present: Upon the 4th of April, about four o'clock, a man came for me, and I found at the prosecutor's house the prisoner; the prisoner was searched by Thomas Grubb, and he found this check shirt in the crown of his hat.</p>

I was working down at Ryegate, and I came to Wapping to get a job, and I met a bricklayer, who told me he could get me a job; he said, I had been treating him, and he would treat me; I said, never mind, if you can get me a job; he went into this house, and said, take hold of these shirts, and go and pawn them; I said, I would have no concern with them; I said, I would stop till his wife came; in came this woman, and I asked if her name was Johnson; I told her that her husband was just gone out, and I did not offer to go out till such time as somebody came in. I have a wife and family at Ryegate.</p>

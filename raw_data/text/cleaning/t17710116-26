             No, there was a light in the adjoining shop. A man working in that shop heard the glass broke, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Samual Freeman. I am porter at an oil shop in Whitechapel. I was going by the prosecutors house with a load. I saw the prisoners about the window. I stopt at a wine vault about fourteen or sixteen yards distance; I staid there near a quarter of an hour. There were three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they stand?</p>
               <p>Freeman. About three quarters of a yard distance from each other. One was at the door, another at the window, and the third at the dead wall. I saw one of them hawl the things.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160036"></xptr> out, and put them into the waistband of his breeches. He at the wall said, What, have you done it? The other swore a bitter oath, and said, Hold your wiz. There was no creature passed by at the time; at last a man that carries coals came up; I told him them villains had broke the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the window brake?</p>
               <p>Freeman. No; he said he would knock at the door; then I went about my business. When I came back again, they had shut up the window shutters, I said; Now the steed is stole. you shut up the stable door. My mistress asked me, it I could swear to them; I said I could. I saw them the Saturday following; this was Christmas eve. The Monday night I saw them again; the Saturday following I could see them very plain; there was a lamp over their heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Which stood at the window?</p>
               <p>- Gannon. Hopcraft stood at the door, and Muston at the dead wall; I saw them taking something out at the window, but could not distinguish what.</p>
               <p>Q. from Gannon. Did not you say I had a white waistcoat on?</p>
               <p>- He had a white jacket on, with black spots on it, and he had leather breeches.</p>

            . I am a milk-man: I was going by Mrs. Benjamin's house with my milk pail: I saw the ribbons lay drawn out into the road; I walked a little further, and there I saw the three prisoners and another lad; they crossed the road into Great Garden Street, which is about one hundred roads from Mrs. Benjamin's. The ribbons lay from Mrs. Benjamin's that way. Gannon said, D - n my eyes, how the man after me through the mud, and how the ribbons draw'd along; and clapp'd his hand upon his knee. When I came opposite Black Lion yard they stopp'd, and I passed them; they crossed the way towards Whitechapel church; there was a watchmaker at his own door; I told him of the four boys; he ask'd me why I did not take them. When I came down lower there was Muston and Hopcraft following (I supposed). to Gannon and the other. I put my pails down, and took one in each hand; and when I accused them with being concerned in stealing the ribbons, one of them began a crying; I went for a constable; in the mean time Mr. Cresser took Gannon.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I missed a great many things; I have got a part of them; a great many little articles are entirely gone; here are a parcel of ribbons, some needle boxes, and six rows of necklaces (producing them.) These I found in the street; the others are lost entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The constable searched them, but did not find any thing; he did not search their breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ribbon they stole all loose?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; it was upon blocks; they hung upon a string; they pulled one and they all followed.</p>

On the night of the 2nd of March, at half-past eleven o'clock, I fastened the back-parlour door which leads into the passage—the panes of glass in the window were perfect at that time, and the win<lb></lb>dow quite secure—the screw of the window was in—I placed the key of the back parlour door on a drawer in the sitting-room, locked that door and took the key up into the bed-room with me—my husband came home at twelve o'clock—there is a yard door at the back of the house inside the passage, on the ground-floor—I believe that was not fastened but it was shut, and latched—we never bolt it—we generally bar it at night, but it was omitted, I believe, that night.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 126.) On the 8th of March, about eleven o'clock, I went with Mr. Edwards to No. 9, Elgar-square, and found there a German silver tea-spoon over the mantel-piece—we re<lb></lb>mained there till between two and three o'clock in the morning—we then went up stairs to the same room, and found Pearce and Hawes in bed in that room—I told them what I wanted them for—they made no reply, but on coming from the station Pearce said, "I am not in it, and that you will find out"—I had charged them with breaking into the house—I found Davis at a coffee-shop in Church-lane—I told her I wanted her for pledg<lb></lb>ing tome spoons—she said, "I did pledge them; I don't deny it; the boys gave them to me"—I went to a field pointed out by Mason, and found the two candlestick-sockets there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I examined the parlour window—the pane of glass was taken quite out, and laid against the fence—the glass had been fresh put in—either of them could get through, but in my opinion they put an arm through and unfastened the screw, and opened the window, but I found the screw fastened—the pane was large enough for Hawes to get through—he must have come into the yard, and got through the square or taken the screw out, opened the window, and put the screw in again war getting out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pearce's Defence.</hi> I did not break open the house; I did not know the goods were stolen, but on Thursday morning, about seven o'clock, I got op, and was asked to go down in the field to have a game at ball, and these things were shown to me in the hole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's Defence.</hi> I was sitting in the coffee-shop on Wednesday, and the witness came in to me with this boy; I had only seen them once be<lb></lb>fore; they asked me to have a cup of coffee; I said, "Yes;" I was in great distress; the witness asked me to pledge some things; I said, what are they?" he made no answer, but afterwards said, "Will you go?" I said, "Yes," and outside the shop-door he showed me the sugar<lb></lb>tongs; he said, "You go in, I will come for you in about a quarter of an hour," and in about ten minutes he came again, and they asked me to Pawn some things—he took me to Limehouse fields, and told me to wait while he got the things—he brought me the spoons, and asked me to go and pawn them—I went to one pawnbroker's—they would not take them in—l took them to another, and pawned them for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I came out</p>

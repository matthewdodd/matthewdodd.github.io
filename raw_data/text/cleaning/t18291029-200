            . I am a parish-constable. On the 15th of October I saw the prisoner, whom I knew, and another person with him - they followed the prosecutor and two gentlemen who were with him for some distance; the prisoner took this yellow handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and was putting it into his flap; he came round the coach-stand, and I took him; I went to the prosecutor, who said he had lost a handkerchief of this description.</p>

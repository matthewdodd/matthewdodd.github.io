The prisoner is a neighbour, and visited at our house - we had two watches, which hung in the parlour behind the shop - I went out on the 24th of January, and saw my own watch a few minutes before, but I did not notice my husband's; my watch hung over the mantel-piece, and my husband's finger ring and a key, hung over it; I came home rather late, a customer asked what o'clock it was, and I was going to see when the prisoner ran out of the room, rushed by a customer, and got away. My servant told me he had taken the watch; I went and found my own was also gone - my husbands' has been found since, for the prisoner has been good enough to say where it was. I do not know the value of mine - my husband values his at 4l. - mine cost 3l., and he values it at 2l. - he had his watch in 1807.</p>
               <p>Cross-examind by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Had you a seaman lodging in your house? A. Yes; the prisoner used to come and see us. I do not remember that he wanted ever to borrow money of me - I once heard my husband say he wanted to borrow 5s. of him - I did not see him there that day before my return. I never said to him "I cannot lend you any money but you may take the watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Try and recollect, madam, and then say whether you persist in saying you never gave him such leave?. A. Oh, dear, no! I never did. I did not miss my husband's watch till he came home - only my own - when I missed my own it was about seven o'clock in the evening, as near as I can recollect. My husband keeps a general chandler's shop. I do not know what parish our house is in.</p>

            . I am eleven years old, and live with Mr. Philpot. The prisoner often came to my master's house. I remember the day the watch was miss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160061"></xptr>>ed, about seven o'clock in the evening - the prisoner had been there about half an hour before; while he was there he stood up by the fire-place all the time; there were two watches hanging over his head, by the mantel-piece: I saw him take the watch. He told me once to go out of the room to teize a little girl. When I was in the shop I could see through a window into the room; there was a key and a silver spoon on the mantel-shelf; I saw him take my mistress' watch down with his right hand. I then went into the parlour - he had his hand in his pocket- he then took up his hat, and rushed out of the room, ran by the customers in the shop, and nearly knocked them down; I saw my mistress' watch at tea time, about five or six o'clock - when I looked afterwards I found both the watches gone. I told little Harriet, and she told my mistress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this young man at your master's once on the day before? A. Yes; my mistress was not at home, but my master was, and the little child; the prisoner had been there half an hour before this happened - he talked once about a young girl who was going to a mad-house; he said he would take her down to Gravesend. My master and mistress, and this young man, have been very intimate.</p>

               <p>MRS. PHILPOT re-examined. These seals belong to my husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Have you not been in the habit of going to the play with the prisoner? A. No; on one occasion my husband had a couple of orders to go to Sadler's-well - he intented to go himself with Hinkin. I never went with him more than once, and that was with my husband's permission.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are the woman who kept me from sea, and said I should not want money. Witness. Good God! is there no law? Upon my solemn oath there is no truth in these insinuations. Before this I always thought him a good lad. I did give my daughter 2s. to give the prisoner, which she took to him in Newgate, because he said he was in want.</p>
               <p>MOSES SOLOMON. The gentleman who came to me after the tickets said there should be no prosecution.</p>
               <p>MRS. PHILPOT re-examined. Neither myself or husband have a residence in North-street, City-road - he has a freehold there, which is let out in tenements, and my uncle receives the rent altogether - we have let it to him, and he pays the rent to my husband. My aunt lives in the house when my uncle and his family are there; I have not been there for several days - for two or three days; there may be gentlemen and ladies lodge there for any thing I know. When I had the house I let it to ladies and gentlemen too - we gave it up because we did not wish to keep it any longer - it is not a house of reception for company.</p>

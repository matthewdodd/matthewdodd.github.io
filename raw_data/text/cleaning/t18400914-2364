                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francisco de Pina de Melo. I have lived at Portsmouth, but not for some years—I boarded at Mr. Mills's, No. 67, Hatton-garden, for a month—I afterwards went to live in Hatfield-street, Blackfriars-road—I was going to the house of Dr. Rigby, in Spring-gardens, on a Saturday, I think it was the 29th of August—I was standing at the end of Stamford-street—my niece stopped me, on account of a horse, from crossing, but a person came to me and for<lb></lb>cibly led me across the way—I have lost my sight—he then kept my arm, and said he was going my way and would direct me—I had not told him I was going to Dr. Rigby's—I asked who and what he was, whether he was a po<lb></lb>liceman, I wished to know who was assisting me—he said he had lost one eye, that he had been blind, and felt so much afflicted at seeing a person in the same situation, that he had offered to assist me—my niece is only thirteen years old, and was afraid to say any thing—I asked him how he got his living—he said he worked at the Bolt-in-Tun inn, at the Portsmouth coach—I said, "Oh, we are going down by that coach"—he said he was the Ports<lb></lb>mouth coachman—I said I had a trunk at Hatton-garden—he said he should drive the coach, and should think it no trouble to take my luggage, whatever it was—I said it was very little, that it was at my landlady's, in Hatfield-street—he inquired the nature of it—I asked if he was a porter, and if he had a ticket—he said, at his house they did not wear tickets—I said my trunk was at the house in Hatton-garden—he asked if I would allow him to fetch the luggage from Hatton-garden, as it would be more convenient to have it together, and convey it to Hatfield-street, but I de<lb></lb>clined allowing him—I had said that my niece was very small, and I wished them to take her at half price—he said he could arrange that, for, if he was not the proprietor, he was connected with the coach—he went as far as Dr. Rigby's with roe, and said, if I would allow him, he would see us back again, but my niece said he was dirtily dressed, on my asking her, and I asked Dr. Rigby's servant to send him away when he came to fetch us—when I got to Hatfield-street I told ray landlady what had oc<lb></lb>curred, and not to let him see me—he came there, and she sent him away—he came a second time, wishing to see me—I heard him tell the land-lady he wished to see me, as he had brought a receipt for the payment of the fare—it was the same voice—I did not exactly hear what he said, I paid very little attention to what he said—he pressed for the whole fare—I said I had a friend opposite the Bolt-in-Tun, and he would arrange about the fare—he asked me repeatedly on the road before, to give him the money, and at the house he said he could not book the place without the fare—I knew by his voice he was the same person who spoke to me in the morning—he asked the landlady to sign some paper to say he had been, and asked how to spell my name, as he should look foolish in book<lb></lb>ing the places without knowing that—she gave him a pen and ink, but we told him we did not wish him to book the places, and he went away—he asked the landlady to write something, and she did write something, I understand, and she read it afterwards—it stated that we did not know what day we should go, but it might be Sunday—I have only been a short time from abroad.</p>

Mrs. de Melo lodged at my house—the prisoner Phillips came there on Saturday, the 29th of August—I saw him between twelve and one o'clock the first time—Mrs. de Melo had been out and was come home—he asked me if there was a blind lady lodging at my house, I said, "Yes"—he asked if she was come home, I said, "No," by the lady's wish, as she wished me to hear what he had to say—he said he had been to Dr. Rigby's with her, and had been round to his employer at the Bolt-in-Tun, to endeavour to get the little girl's fare at half-price—he produced a paper—I wished him to leave it—he said he must not leave it, for there was a receipt to it, and said, "Is the lady at home?"—I said, "No"—he said, did I think he should meet her if he tried to meet her—I said I could not say—he said, "Well, the best thing I can do, will be to go and get a pint of beer and smoke my pipe, and call again"—he left the house—he returned at half-past three o'clock, and said, "Is the lady come home?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Can I speak to her?"—I said, "I do not know; is that note for the lady?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then give me the note, the lady cannot read it herself, I must read it for her"—he gave it to me, I read it—I do not exactly know what was in it, but it stated at the bottom, "Pay my man 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in part fare"—I read it to the lady, and returned it to him—he said, "Can I speak to the lady?"—I said, "Yes, you can speak to her, she is here at dinner"—I brought him to her—he said he had pro<lb></lb>perly arranged that the little girl should go for half-price, that he belonged to the Bolt-in-Tun, and that was what they generally did for each other—he then pressed for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Really, ma'am, I should not pay it; you don't know the man, he does not look respectable; I would not trust him with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" and she did not pay him—I told him I knew that note was not written by a book-keeper, it was not like a gentleman's hand<lb></lb>writing—he said, "I know that, it was my old governor that wrote it"—I said, "Who is your old governor?"—he said, "Why Henry Gray, don't you see his name?"—he said, "Well, I must not go back; if you don't pay me, you must deliver up the paper;" and I gave it him back—he wished a note should be sent to the proprietor, saying that the lady would not go—I asked the lady, and I wrote to say it was quite uncertain what day she would go, and he went away—he had some conversation with the lady—he said, "If you will not trust me with the money, I will pay it myself, for I will take great care she shall go"—he wanted pen or pencil, that she might ask for him when she came to the Bolt-in-Tun—he said, by asking for him he should get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the passage, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the pro<lb></lb>prietor—I do not know whether the prosecutrix's name was written at all—I cannot say her name was not put at the bottom of the note—he wrote nothing in my presence—I was not in the room all the time, but the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's name was mentioned to him—I generally called her De Pina.</p>

               <p>she said she had bought them at different times—that was in reference to the jewellery—I took up the dial of a watch, and said, "Did you ever see the watch belonging to this?"—she said, "No, I never did, that belonged to my grandmother, and has been gone many years"—I took up some mourning ear-drops and rings—she said, "They are what I had for my poor mother when she died;" here is more than one suit of mourning jewellery—I said, "Here is a mourning ring, what is there on it?"—she said she had forgotten—there is an inscription on it, "Elizabeth Taylor"—I took her in charge, and ordered her to be locked up—I then called the male prisoner into the station-house, and asked him his name, and where he came from—he said he came from Westminster—I forget the name he gave—it was not his right name—I said, "What are you?"—he said he worked at a wine-merchant's—I asked his master's name—he did not choose to say—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "I might as well tell you his name as where he lives"—I said, "Where is the woman that was with you yesterday?"—he said he had left her in bed at the King's Head—I said, "Is she your wife?"—he said, "Yes, I have been married to her these four years"—I heard his brother and father say, in his presence, that they were not married, and the female prisoner said she was not married, the female prisoner said that evening that there were handbills out about the trunk that was lost in London, that while she was in at a pawnbroker's to pledge a scarf, she saw the policeman come in with a handbill, and she saw it was about a trunk—that she went back to the male prisoner, and told him of it, and they directly left and went to Green-wich, and then on board a Gravesend steam-packet to Gravesend—I went to the west end to see if I could get a hand-bill, which I did, and gave information at No. 67, Hatton-garden, and on returning home the female wished to say something to me—she said, "It is no use, I may as well tell the truth"—I said, "I don't wish to hear any thing"—she said, "I had rather tell you"—I said, "I will give you pen and paper, and you can write what you like"—I went to her in about an hour—she said she had written a line or two, but was so agitated she could not write more, but would tell me the pawnbrokers' where the property was—she named seve<lb></lb>ral at Greenwich, Pimlico, Tothill-street, and various places—I went to the pawnbrokers', and found the property, as she said—she said the trunk was brought home by Phillips on the Saturday night, and was in his room, at No. 20, Ann-street, Westminster—I went there, and found this trunk in the room, under the bed—these papers were in it—she mentioned pawning three gowns at Jones's, near the Queen's palace, Pimlico; and at Denman's, a coral necklace and scarf; and about four doors from there, a silver ink-stand, two forks, and a table-spoon—she said they had destroyed all the duplicates, and could not give a better account of the pawnbrokers—oppo<lb></lb>site Astley's theatre, she said, was a cloak, a shawl, and two large night-gowns, for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and near the College, at Greenwich, two silver salt-stands, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found, on inquiry according to those directions, the things she had mentioned, except that Denman's was Debenham's—I had made her no promise or threat in the least—here are the few lines she wrote.</p>

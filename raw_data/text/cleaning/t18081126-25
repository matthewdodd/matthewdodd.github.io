            . Q. What are you - A. I am shopman to Mr. Potter. On Friday the 16th of September, between the hours of five and six in the evening, Collins suspected a woman in the shop; a few minutes afterwards I went into the front shop and waited upon the prisoner myself; I sold her a towel for eight pence; she gave me a shilling and I gave her four-pence in change; she seemed very much confused and scarce knew what she was doing; she went out of the shop and I followed her; when she was out in the street I tapped her on the shoulder and desired her to step back; I thought she had got something she had not paid for; she immediately came into the shop, and between the pile of goods which stood in the shop and the counter, she let the goods fall from under her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the goods - A. A piece of gingham, twenty eight yards, and a length of muslin, about four yards; I asked her if she knew any thing about them; she denied it; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

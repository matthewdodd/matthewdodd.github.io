On Friday morning, the 6th of May, I went from home—I locked my shop—I returned about nine, and missed two pairs of boots, a slipper, and a shoe—the following morning I went with a warrant with an officer to a house in Peacock-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and found the boots in the first-floor room—these now produced are them—I do not know whose premises they are.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of May I examined the lock of the prosecutor's door, and found it forced—I then went to No. 1, Pheasant-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and met the two prisoners coming out from the passage—I and another constable took them into custody, and took them to the back room first-floor—I knew by the search-warrant where they lived—they both lived there—I found one boot on Green, one boot under the bed, and one on the bed—and on the top of the ceiling I found ten skeleton keys—the house is not on my beat.</p>

                  </hi>. I have the care of this house—I do not know who the landlady is—I have known her some years but she only comes to the house once a week—a young man named Driscoll and a girl named Eliza Welstead lodge in the first-floor room, according to the statement of my charwoman, who does business in the house in my absence—Driscoll did lodge there—I believe the policeman took him and the young woman away on the day this occurred, for I have never seen him since—my charwoman let two rooms to Driscoll and Isabella—I do not know her other name—I understood that Bartlett was a tenant of the house, but I understand since that he was not a lodger—he only came there occasionally—I never saw Green—I do not remember their coming on the morning of the 7th of May—I never saw them till the policeman brought them into the house that morning—I think I should have seen them if they had come because my room is in the front, but I might perhaps be out of the way—they might pass into the house without my observing them, but I should scarcely think it possible—I am an unfortunate woman—the house belongs to a man named Jones, who generally comes once a week—it is a brothel—I did not swear before the Magistrate that any one took the room—I considered Bartlett was an inhabitant of the room by his going in and out.</p>

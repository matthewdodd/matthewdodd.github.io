            . I live in Artillery-passage, Bishopsgate-street, in the county of Middlesex. On Sunday, the 9th of February, the prisoner came to my private door about nine o'clock, and brought me a piece of broken glass, he asked me if I would buy any, for he had some to sell. I said I did not want them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SIMONDS. On the 8th of February the prisoner came to my shop, about ten o'clock at night, at Ravenrow, Spitalfields, and asked if I wanted to buy any broken glass - He asked me a guinea a cwt.; he said they were very stout pieces, and that he sold them for chandelier drops. I told him I would give 1l. a cwt.; he said as he wished to get rid of it I should have it. I told him to bring it immediately - He and another man brought it in two baskets. I told him I could not conveniently weigh it then; he said he had weighed forty of them, and they weighed ten pounds; and he calculated that the whole would weigh two hundred and a half. I gave him 2l. on account until I could weigh it, and told him to call next morning for the rest. Next day he came I told him there was a great many small pieces, and I would only give him five shillings more - He took it. About a week or ten days after I was apprehended myself, when I gave this account. I never saw him again until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They charged me with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been charged here as a receiver of stolen goods - A. No.</p>
               <p>JUDITH SIMONDS. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner is the man that brought the glass, and received the money. I afterwards met the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and told him the glass was not weight, and asked him to go to Mr. Mosely's where he would see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180047"></xptr>it weighed. I told him that to get him apprehended. He said he did not like to be seen, as there was a reward of 5l. offered. He said he could not stop.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ATTFIELD. On the 17th of February I apprehended the prisoner at the Jolly Weavers, public-house, Angel-alley, Long-alley, where the glass was found. I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing glass; he said he knew nothing about it, and would not go with me. He was in the skittle ground, surrounded by twenty persons, whom I knew to be common thieves - They rushed on me and rescued him; they had called to him to know what the charge was for. He was taken that day.</p>

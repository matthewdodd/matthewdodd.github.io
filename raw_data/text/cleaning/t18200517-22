            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Long-alley, Moorfields. I saw a mob, and heard that the prosecutor had been robbed. I went along St. Paul's Church-yard, and was informed that two men were gone along with a basket. When I got as far as Cripplegate I saw a basket on a man's head in Fore-street, ran as hard as I could, and saw the prisoners with it in Moorfields; Finch had it on his head, and Johnson was by his side. I went by them, and they put it down - I stood by the London Institution, and watched them; one of them took the basket up, but I do not know which. I saw Stone who went after them. I took Finch with the basket on his head, and Stone took Johnson. I told them they had taken the basket out of the cart, but they said they had done nothing - we took them to the Mansion House. I went and found Edwards, who claimed the property. I first saw them about ten minutes after I had heard of the robbery.</p>

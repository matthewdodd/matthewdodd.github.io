            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. On the 4th of September, the prisoners came together to the warehouse, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked to see some blue cloth - I shewed them two pieces; the man enquired the price, and said he should buy for money, he spoke English, and understood me; I think the woman understood very little English - he bought nothing that night, but went away, saying, he should call next morning, but did not - on Thursday morning, a little past nine o'clock, when I got to the warehouse, I found them both there, they had been looking at cloth; when I went in, the man asked me to shew him some black cloth, and said, he had had the rheumatism, which was the reason he had not been on Wednesday - I shewed him some, he wished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120045"></xptr>for patterns of the blue which he had seen that morning - I went into the back warehouse to get them; on my return, the woman was gone, he remained for the patterns - he said he would come again in fifteen or twenty minutes, and pay for what he wanted, not having then fixed on any thing, I had left the female standing within six yards of the door - there was a quantity of cloths in the warehouse when I left her - while I was speaking to the man, she was brought back (before he had quitted the door), by Stevens - the cloth was nearly covered by her gown - by her side, she had a large shawl also, which seemed to hide it, she appeared pregnant; immediately on her coming inside the warehouse, I saw the cloth drop from her, it was eighteen yards and a quarter of blue cloth - we are the manufacturers of it; seventeen yards and a half would be the payable length - I saw it on the previous evening in the back warehouse; where they had been looking at cloth - Stebbing was with them when I came. The cloth had not been sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man do any thing when she was brought in - A. He appeared angry, patted her on the bonnet, and said,</p>
               <p>"What did you do this for?" An apron was found in the warehouse. I did not see her take any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is this a warehouse for retail business - A. No, wholesale; we sell goods there - each piece is kept separate. The porter sleeps up stairs, and lives there. There is always somebody there to show goods.</p>

            . I am employed in the prosecutors' warehouse; I was there on the 6th of September; the prisoners came in together about nine o'clock, the man apologised for not coming before, saying he had the rheumatism in his leg; he asked to see some blue cloth - which I showed him; Kendal came in just as they were going away; he was then shewed black cloth. The woman was then standing in the front of the warehouse, against the door - she appeared pregnant. I took the counting-house stool down for her to sit on, if she was disposed. I believe she did not sit down. There was a number of pieces of cloth, standing on their ends on the ground; Kendal went back to cut patterns, while he was gone I was in the front warehouse - the man opened the door for the woman to go out, and shut it after her. Stevens brought her back. I did not see her take anything, nor had I any suspicion - there is a yard which they must cross from the warehouse and on the left hand is the carpet warehouse, the door of which they would pass. When she was brought back I saw the cloth drop from her; it appeared suspended from her right side; but when she got in it dropped upon the warehouse floor. The male prisoner slapped her bonnet, and said,</p>
               <p>"What did you do that for?" He did not ask for any thing after he let her out. Kendall was gone for the patterns, only he and I were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Her being pregnant prevented your suspicions - A. Yes; the man slightly slapped her bonnet, and said, in an angry tone, "What did you do that for?" He stood at her side.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you observe her when she moved to go to the door - A. The man stood behind her - I was behind him, within five yards of him. He opened the door and shut it after her.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. My suspicions were excited by something before; and on Thursday I saw the prisoner come in, and heard the door open, and saw the woman go out by herself - I was in the carpet warehouse in the passage; she came along close by the door - I ran to the window, looked at her, and thought she looked rather more bulky on her right side than when she came in - I went up to her, and hit my left hand against the cloth, and said. "You have got it, have you, and I have got you" - she sighed, I took her back, it dropped from her - I produce it, having kept it ever since.</p>

               <p>MR. LESTER. The cloth is ours, and contains eighteen yards and a quarter. We charge it at seventeen yards; it cost us upwards of 16 l., as the manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the cost price - A. As near as I can guess, 16 l. odd shillings. We do not expose goods for sale; our names are on the door, and woollen warehouse - our chief trade is on commission; we never sell less than an end.</p>

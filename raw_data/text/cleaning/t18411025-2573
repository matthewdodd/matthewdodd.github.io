On the 9th of October I got up at half-past two o'clock in the morning to go to work in my cow-yard—I heard something rattling on the tiles of my stable-loft—I looked out of the door, having nothing on hut my shirt, and saw the prisoner Webb on the tiles of the loft—I drew back into the house, slipped on ray boots, looked out again, and saw him stepping off the tiles on to a gate at the end of my house—I said, "Holloa, how came you here?"—he made no answer, but jumped off the gate, and rushed by me—I called a policeman to stop him—I ran out in my shirt through Robert-street, Mary-street, and William-street—I saw him in Hampstead-road—he was stopped at last—I saw him in custody of a police<lb></lb>man about a minute after I had seen him running along Hampstead-road—I said to him, "How came you in that yard?"—he said, "What yard?"—I said, "I will tell you what yard"—the policeman then took him away.</p>

               <p>- HANSON. I live in Henry-street, Hampstead. A man asked if I wanted a job, he took me to Palace-row, where there where four sacks of beans. I took them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120107"></xptr>to Camden-town - Mason told me to carry them to be weighed; Mason said to me "Come on" - I shot some of the corn at his house, he sent me over the way to get a pot of beer, and the man who employed me gave me 1 s. 6 d. I cannot say that the prisoner is the man, he may be, I left them at Mason's, sacks, corn, and all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 12th of April, I went to a lime wharf at Paddington with my cart, stopped at the Red Lion, public-house, Edgware-road, and met a man who called himself Mr. Wilson, a corn-dealer, of Edgware-road. He said he wished to exchange his cart away for a good horse; my horse came to 7 l. 10 s., and his cart to 4 l. 10 s. He proposed to pay the 3 l. in about a week, I refused; he said he would furnish me with two quarters of beans, at 30 s. a quarter - I agreed, and was to meet him next morning, and on the way, I met him; he said he was going to Tottenham-court-road, and expected the beans would be there soon, and authorized me to take them in my possession. I went to the White Lion, public-house, saw the cart, and asked the carter if the beans were for me, he said, "Yes." I asked if he had brought any bran, he said, "No;" I received the beans, and left them at my house.</p>

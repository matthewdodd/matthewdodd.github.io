               <p>Q. Did you go into a house there? - No, in no house; I was come to our own door, and was ringing at the bell, standing at the door, and she came aside of me, and I found her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and I put my hand to pull out my watch, and I missed my watch; I ran after her along George-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a silk string, a stone seal, a metal watch key, and a steel key? - Yes. I met a watchman and asked him if he saw a woman go past? In ten minutes the watchman took up the woman; then I said, this is the woman, and she put the watch on the ground, and bid the watchman take it up and say no more about it. I did not see her put it down, the watchman see her; I took up the watch from the ground myself, near her; I heard her say, watchman, take up the watch and say no more about it; and then I see it on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the watch ever since? - Yes, I have. I know the name of the man that I bought it of; I know it is my own watch; I gave it to the watchman to keep it till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return it to you the next morning? - Yes, before the justice.</p>

            . Do you know him? - Yes, perfectly. On the 15th of last month, August; I see him in the street, Prince's street, Westminster; he was walking along towards meeting me; he asked me if I see a woman pass me? I said, yes, just gone by, about a minute since; says he, she has picked my pocket of my watch, I insist on your going along with me. I turned back, and we got up to the woman; and he says, this is the woman that has picked my pocket of my watch; she said, she had not got it, nor had not seen it; I said, Jane, you must go to the watch-house to be searched. She stooped down and dropped the watch by the side of us; Roper, says she, there lays the watch, take it up and say no more about it. I did not see it go out of her hand, but she said, there it lays, take it up and say no more about it. The prosecutor took it up himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along George-street; I am a poor unfortunate girl; I met this man, and he asked me where I was going? I said, going home; says he, will you take me along with you for a walking stick? I said, no; says he, will you take me with you? says I, sir, what compliment will you make me? he said he had but a small trisle of money about him; he said, he had some things of his fellow servant's about him, and he gave me eight-pence halfpenny, and he unbuttoned his things, and wanted to be very rude, and he wanted sadly to prevail with me to go along with him to his master's kitchen; and I would not go with him, and I wished him good night; and he came after me and said I had got his watch, and he went to the place where we were standing, and he picked up the watch, and he said, will you go home with me? I said, no, I will not; and he said, then I will have my revenge of you one way or the other, and he met with the patrol, and said, there is that b-ch has robbed me of my watch; and the patrol said, where is the watch? and he said, I have got it; and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

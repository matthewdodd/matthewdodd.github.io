                  </hi>. I am employed at Dixon's Repository, in Barbican. On Friday morning, the 21st of September, the prisoner brought two cart mares to the yard—he said he had brought two cart mares for sale, and gave his name Thomas Ford ham, of Romford—he said, probably he might attend the sale, but in the event of his not doing so they were to be sold the best bidder—the sale was the same day, and from the shortness of the time I advised him to attend the sale—he then asked me what I thought they would fetch at the hammer—I looked at them in a hurry, and said I thought about fourteen or fifteen guineas each, but still advised him to attend the sale—Mr. Scholes had applied to me to send him two mares, and I ultimately purchased these two of the prisoner for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and expenses—Mr. Scholes was to pay Mr. Dixon's expenses—it is a rule with us to pay for horses only on Monday, and not under any circumstances at any other time—on returning to the counting-house, about an hour after, I found a bill describing two cart mares as having been stolen—I sent the bill to the Elephant, in Fore-street, where Mr. Scholes lives, and he came to me—in consequence of what he said I wrote according to the directions in the hand<lb></lb>bill, and stopped Scholes from using the mares—I saw the mares on Satur<lb></lb>day in the Old Bailey—they were the same—Mr. Julian and his man came to me on Sunday morning—I sent them to Mr. Scholes, and they owned the mares—we sent for Herdsfield, and met him on Sunday morning in Lad-lane on Monday morning he was attending in my house, and I received this letter by a porter, requesting the money for the mares—I wrote a cheqe with out a signature, enclosed it in a note, gave it to the man, and informed Herdsfield, who followed him.</p>

On Sunday evening the 15th of April, about half past seven o'clock, the watchman came and enquired if I had moved any sashes from my new house; I went round with him to the house, and at the beginning of the street I looked up to the house, and saw the prisoner Newland in the act of taking a sash out of the first floor window of my house; on looking at the other window of the room, I saw Stevenson taking the sash out of that window - I saw them actually doing it; the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"They are now in the house." He ran round to the back of the house - nobody lives in it - it is just finished: I unlocked the door; the watchman said I had better wait outside. I ran out and saw Stevenson attempt to jump out of the window; the watchman went up and took them both in custody in the room. I examined the back door, and found a bolt wrenched off: I had seen the windows safe in the morning. We found a chisel and a bag there.</p>

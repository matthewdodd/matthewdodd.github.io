            . I am steward of the Alfred. About half-past ten o'clock on Sunday evening, the 22d of March, one of the maids told me, there was a man in the maids' room. I went up and found three of the room-doors open, which are usually kept shut. In the first room the clothes had been littered about a great deal-this door was always kept locked. The linen was taken out of the drawers in the second room, and laid on the floor. In the third room, the servant's clothes were taken out of her trunk and laid on the floor, and the watch. I found the watch in one place and the case in an another. The prisoner was in custody. Our door was open from eight o'clock till twelve.</p>

            . I am a waiter in the house. One of the servants said there was a noise up stairs. I went up, and found the prisoner in the third room, sitting on the bed, either asleep, or pretending to be so. I asked him what he wanted there? he said he wanted Captain Campbell, of the 91st regiment. I took him down, and gave him in charge.</p>

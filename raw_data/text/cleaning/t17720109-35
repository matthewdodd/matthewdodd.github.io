I was determined to watch who stole it. I watched several nights. In the night between the 2d and 3d of December I heard a noise on the tops of the house; at last I heard a piece of lead fall; then I heard another piece fall. After some time I heard the lead rattling below. Accordingly I went to the place; there I saw the prisoner with the lead upon his shoulder. On seeing me, he threw the lead down, and ran away. I pursued and took him. I examined the house where the lead fell, and it appeared that it had been cut from a house lately occupied by Mr. Peters; that was the only house of five or six that had not been plundered.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think he got up?</p>
               <p>Bannister. By the wateredge of the next house.</p>

               <p>I went to find a place to sleep in. I took this bag up, not knowing what it was. I had not been a-top of the house.</p>

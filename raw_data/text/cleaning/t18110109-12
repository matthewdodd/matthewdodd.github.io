            . I am an East India labourer; Mrs. Tyler lodges in my first floor. On the 8th of December, between five and six, Mrs. Tyler informed me that she was robbed and told me the articles she had lost. I found the blankets at Mr. Attenborough's; I got an officer; the prisoner came to redeem some things and then I took her in custody, we then went and searched her apartment, found the quilt, two sheets, and a tablecloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you found these things what did she say - A. We found a person in the room, we were in agitation whether we should take him in custody, the prisoner cried and said he was innocent and she was guilty.</p>

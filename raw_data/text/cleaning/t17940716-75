            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of May, between nine and ten, or at any time in the day, did you send this man with any order to their house? - I never did, nor I never saw him afterward. That morning he set off col<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160128"></xptr>lecting large sums of money in the country. I never sent him for goods to this house. On the 6th he had goods there that he never brought to us; on the 6th he had not left our house. He had lived with me near three years; the first part of the time we approved of his conduct very well, but we soon thought very different, in the course of half the time perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did ever any of these stockings come to your hands? - None of them, till Mr. Hudson took them from him, when he apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he never sent me for goods more than once, twice, or thrice? - Never</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Hudson. Are you sure you did not send him the 8th of May? - I am sure I did not. I apprehended this man at Liverpool; I pursued him on purpose, I went after him, hearing that he was collecting our money unlawfully. Afterwards I heard he was at Birmingham, and from Birmingham I pursued him to Liverpool. These were five pair out of nine I found, two pair of which he had sold to his taylor, at Birmingham; they are three pair of cotton, and two pair of silk and cotton: this and another pair was found in his trunk or portmanteau, which was owned by him, and has been brought up to town since with his pretended wife, and which he has had delivered to him by a peace officer, in prison.</p>
               <p>Blunston. These are the kind of stockings that I let him have, but they have no mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I was a servant to Badger and Hudson, and had no notice to leave. In the morning of the 8th of May, I went to Messrs. Haynes and had nine pair of stockings, they never asked me who they were for, nor did I tell who they were for; I rather was afraid of going home again, afraid of meeting a person I did not like to see. It is not likely that I should go to this shop for stockings in an assumed name, where I had been more than twenty times; there are the rest of the young men in Badger and Hudson's house that can prove that I have been sent there many a time, an I those that I had on the 6th of May. I think I can remember who they were for.</p>
               <p>Court to Badger. Is there my entry of these on your journals? - Not that I know of, it is no matter to us.</p>

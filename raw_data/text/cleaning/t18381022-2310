                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Bank-place, Bays water. I was near the phaeton—I saw the prisoner and three others walking about, looking at different places, and talking together—they went to where the phaeton was—two of the party stood at the head of the horse—the prisoner and another kept behind—after a few seconds the prisoner and the other went round on the road side, the prisoner then looking cautiously round, went again, and in a dexterous manner drew the cloak from the seat, and gave it to another man—I crossed, and took the man—he struggled vio<lb></lb>lently, and I took the cloak from him—the prisoner turned round, and I let go of the other, and took the prisoner—I said, "You are the thief, I will take you."</p>

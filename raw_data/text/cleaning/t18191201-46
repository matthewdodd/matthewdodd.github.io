On Saturday, the 27th of November, about twelve o'clock, I had two crates of glass and three boxes in my caravan. I left a box in Warwick-lane, I then proceeded to the Cross Keys, in <placeName id="t18191201-46-crimeloc268">Wood-street, Cheapside</placeName>

A man stood against the wall, and said I could not go down. I said I would take the box and leave it, and asked him to mind the horse that it did not go any further. I left two crates and a box in the caravan - I took the other box to the coach-office; and when I got within a dozen yards of the corner of Wood-street, coming to Cheapside, I saw the prisoner take the box from the caravan, put it on his shoulder, and walk outside the caravan in the road. I collared him on the pavement, about a dozen yards from the horse. I had asked him what he was going to do with the box? he said a person had hired him to carry it. I said that was impossible, for I saw him take it out of the caravan, and put it on his shoulder. Another man took the box off his shoulder. He said,</p>

               <p>"Now, as you have got your property, why can't you let me go?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Had you made your escape with this glass you did not care if I had lost my place, and died in a workhouse." Worrall took him.</p>

He ran up Wood-street - I missed a box, and ran after the carman, and saw him secure the prisoner with the box on his shoulder - I took it off and put it in the caravan. I did not see it taken.</p>

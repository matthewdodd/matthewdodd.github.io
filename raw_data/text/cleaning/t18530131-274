                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the General Post-office. I know the prisoner as being also a clerk there for many-years—it was his duty to receive bankers' parcels at the Post-office; they are received between the hours of 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock every day except Monday—it was the prisoner's duty to take the parcels and to check them, to see that the amounts were correct—he was to receive the money, and to weigh them to see that the weight marked on them by the bankers was correct—he would then mark the amount of postage on them in red ink—I see the red ink marks on these envelopes that have been produced; they indicate the amount of postage—I believe them to be in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no red ink mark of the weight, only the amount of postage—the prisoner has a book in which to enter the parcels; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—here is an entry on 4th Jan. in the prisoner's handwriting—it is, "No. of the parcel, 29; addressed to Thomas Griffin, Wolverhampton: weight, 1 oz., postage, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is a number, "29," on the parcel; that is put there by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable, attached to the Post-office. I took the prisoner into custody on 20th Jan., at the Post-office—Mr. Peacock told him, in my presence, that he was charged with embezzling the postage on bankers' parcels, and directed me to take him to Bow-street—I took him there, and from thence to the Mansion House, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I found 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—as we were going along in the cab he asked me what was to be done with his money—I said it would be in my possession until I received instructions from Mr. Peacock to know how it was to be disposed of—he said, "Because I want some money to employ a solicitor"—I said, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> You can do so by applying to the Lord Mayor"—he said, "I don't think it is necessary; it is a clear case, and I shall not give the office any trouble"—after being examined at the Mansion House he was remanded till the next week—I brought him to Newgate—on the way he said, "It appears this has been a long time inquiring about"—I said, "Yes, so it appears; but I know nothing about it; neither do I know how it was found out"—the prisoner said, "I can see how it was found out; I was in the country some time ago, and Mr. Nash performed my duties while I was away, and they must have seen that his takings must have been about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than mine"—he then said, "This would not have occurred if it had been in the old Presidents' time; for they always came into the room and examined the parcels by the book; but since the present Presidents have been appointed they have not done so"—there was an observation made by the Lord Mayor with reference to the amounts in the book, when Mr. Nash was giving his evidence, and the prisoner said Mr. Nash did not explain the amounts correctly—he said that to me; it was all in a running conversation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310039"></xptr>
               <p>—he said Mr. Nash did not explain the correct amounts, "because," he said, "eight ounces is considered nine, because we don't write the word exceed eight ounces; if it exceeds eight ounces, it is nine"—he said, "With reference to the thirty-one ounces, where there is only one, that was a mistake; I intended to make it twelve"—I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then this is the first time you have given this evidence in Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; I appeared before the Lord Mayor, but did not give evidence; no deposition of mine was taken—I have not been on terms of personal intimacy with the prisoner—this running conversation took place in coming from the Mansion House and going to Newgate, and from Bowstreet to the Mansion House—I have stated what he told me—I have been a witness in 141 Post-office cases—I do not remember anything happening to me when Sir Frederick Thesiger was Attorney-General; there was no remark made—it was some representation of yours to the Jury, but they did not believe it—I do not remember Sir Frederick Thesiger telling me to stand down, and saying he would not act on such evidence—I never had a censure passed upon me—I will not swear it was not said; as far as my knowledge goes, I am quite certain it did not happen—I did not make any memorandum of this running conversation—I explained to Mr. Peacock what the Prisoner said on each occasion, as was my duty—I did not state before the Lord Mayor that I could prove this</p>

            . I am a watchman; I saw the last witness on the twenty-first of June very early. I was calling the hour of three; he called to me to stop them: I stopt Dummy Jemmy and Jennings; he said they had got his fowls: I took them back to the dunghill; we went there: he picked up a silver spoon first; the next thing was a silver waiter; that was all that was found at that time. We took them to the constable; the two women were gone another road. We took the dumb one to the watch-house, the other we took to pursue after the women. Jennings went with them to shew us the door where the women were to be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you some information from Jennings?</p>
               <p>Hammerton. A little; he desired to be admitted an evidence; I said, after some time, I thought we had better go again to the dunghill. The constable said, he thought it was not worth while. I went back; the other watchman, Green, went with me. I poked my stick into the dunghill, and poked out this candlestick (producing it) I brought it down to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with Dumb Jemmy before?</p>
               <p>Hammerton. I have seen him in the street before, but never conversed with him.</p>
               <p>George Green. I am a watchman. I was upon my stand. I went, upon Mr. Surray's calling out to assist. I saw the candlestick found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Green. Not that I remember. I was at the taking of the women. Allen delivered me that hat and apron: she put her hand in her bosom, and took out a pair of silver nosles for candlesticks: the three girls were by at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon Beeks?</p>
               <p>Green. No. (The nosles are tried, and fit the candlesticks exactly.)</p>

            . Between three and four o'clock on the twenty-first of June, Surray and two watchmen, and another who is not now present, called me up. I threw up the sash, and saw Dummy Jemmy. I had never seen him before to my knowledge. I saw in Surray's hand this waiter and silver spoon. Jennings said, if we would admit him an evidence, he dared to say he could take all the rest. I told him it was not in my power to admit him an evidence, but if he would shew me where to find the others, I would speak to the justice for him to be admitted an evidence. He asked if I would go after the girls first; I said, By all means. He took me to a house near Hog-lane: he asked at the parlour door, if Sall was come in; they said, No. He went up one pair of stairs, and asked there; they said, No. He came down, and looked into the yard, and said they were there. He desired not to be seen himself, but told us to go into the yard. We went into the yard; there the three women stood. I saw the parlour door open as we came in, and saw it shut afterwards. I thought they might be there; I forced the door open where the old woman lay: I said, Where is the bundle that was brought in here? She said, God bless you, Sir, it is under the bed. Allen gave the watchman the two nosles of the candlesticks, that hat, and an apron or two I found in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Allen give the nosles to the man?</p>
               <p>Hawthorn. I did not; I was searching about the room. They were all tied together in one bundle, except the tea-chest, that was dropt on the road, and picked up by a carpenter. They are separated, Mrs. Bradshaw's and the maid's in two bundles; they were in one before.</p>
               <p>Court to Hatton. Look at the things.</p>
               <p>Hatton. These things are mine (repeating them) I carried the woman to the round house, and went with Jennings in search of the other women, but could not find them. I put Jennings in the round-house, and then went to Mrs. Bradshaw's and alarmed them. When Allen and Beeks were examined before the justice, they acknowledged that she had waited upon Jennings three or four times, in order to break open this house. Jennings had told his story then, and they acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no threats or promises?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No; none. The justice asked whose knife that was; Beeks said it was Altop's. Jennings was asked if that was true; he said, No. Beeks pulled it out of her pocket, gave it him, and he gave it to Allen; then she owned that it was hers. Allen owned that he opened the shutters with that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Saytuss say any thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030018"></xptr>Hatton. Only said, Me, me: I apprehended he wanted to be admitted an evidence. We had a suspicion he was concerned in the robbery and murder at Chelsea; we asked him if he was, and said he might be admitted an evidence, if he was. He said, Not me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q That expression, Not me, might fit any other question as well as that.</p>
               <p>Hatton. By his answer I apprehended he understood that question.</p>

               <p>Jennings. Yes. We went away about half an hour after ten, and were there by eleven.</p>

               <p>Jennings. Better than an hour. There was a woman looked out at her window, and saw us walking about; she called the watchman to her door. When the clock struck three, while the watchman went his rounds, they came out. Allen came out of the house; I was in the fields when she came out, she had a b undle and two silver candlesticks with the tops. Dunny Jemmy came out first, to see if the way was clear about, a quarter of an hour before the others; then Allen, and then Altop came out. Malloney had the waiter, the spoon, and tea chest; I took the tea chest out of his hand, and put it into Beek's hand. Dunny Jemmy took the bundle from

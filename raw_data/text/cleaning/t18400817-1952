                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Matthews, a plumber, and live in Russell-street, Mile-end. On the 9th of July, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Aldgate—I had a handkerchief and a crown-piece tied in one corner of it—I felt a tug at my pocket three times, turned round, and saw the prisoner and three others behind me—they ap<lb></lb>peared respectable, and I did not give them into custody—a person came up and asked if I had lost any thing—I went into a shop and found the handker<lb></lb>chief and crown-piece were gone—I have not got it again—I am quite sure it was safe before I felt the tug—I had other things in my pocket, which were not gone.</p>

I was walking with my wife, and saw the prosecutrix on the opposite side, and saw the prisoner in company with three others—a gentleman directed my attention to them, and I saw the prisoner's band at the prosecutrix's pocket—I watched them some time, and then went and collared him with his hand in her pocket—I did not see him take the handkerchief out—the others were close to him, and could have received it from him—I took him into a shop, and the prosecutrix there said she had lost a handkerchief and a crown-piece.</p>

I was in Dover-yard, and heard the prisoner making a noise - I went up, and the prosecutor said she had robbed him, and he had just taken this money from her mouth; he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310095"></xptr>wanted another sovereign and a sixpence, but they have not been found.</p>

               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>HAVING received several sums of money, and not having accounted properly for them, I beg to inform you that I have supplied a countryman of mine, who is in the King's Bench; he deceived me with promises of payment every week, but has deceived me. I have to inform you that I have an assignment of 250, which I will not part with till I have received all that I have lent. I hope next week to be able to refund you the sum of 32: 14: 4, which is your just demand upon me; I have now received 12: 13: 7, which I will settle on Monday. Having so much deceived you, you need not wonder at my leaving, which I should not have done but for the disgrace.</p>

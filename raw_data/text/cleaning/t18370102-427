                  </hi>. I am clerk to William Norsworthy, builder in Cambridge-terrace—his counting-house is in Oxford-terrace—it is not part of his dwelling-house—it is in the parish of Paddington. On the evening of the 7th of December, I left the counting-house at eight o'clock—I left nobody there—I saw the windows all fastened before I left—they were fastened with a bolt—the two outer doors were both locked—one door was fastened inside—I saw them fastened, and took the key with me—I went next morning, at half-past seven o'clock, and found the door as I had left it, and all the shutters were up as I had left them—the labourer took them down—I did not observe that the office had been broken into them—not till the evening—it was then found out that the fillet which fastened the shutter had been wrenched off—the shutter would then come down though it was bolted—it would lift up—I missed an instrument-case, containing three steel-pens, two pairs of compasses, and a pencil-holder—they are used in our business—I am sure they had been there over night—they were in a box in a drawer—the glass of the window was broken—I dis<lb></lb>covered that in the course of the day—I found an iron bar under the win<lb></lb>dow, outside, and the marks on the fillet fitted the end of the bar—the bar belongs to Mr. Norsworthy—it had been at the other end of the office the day before—not where I found it—I observed foot-marks on a chair in<lb></lb>side, which always stood under the window—the prisoner had been a clerk</p>

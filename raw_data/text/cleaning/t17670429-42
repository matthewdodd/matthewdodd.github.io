I am a watchman; I stopped the prisoner, with this bag of things produced here, about three o'clock that morning; I asked him what he was about; he said he was a poor man in debt, that he was a clog maker, and was taking his things away, fearing he should have them seized, and that his wife was gone with a parcel before; I put my hand to the bag, and found a pair of sheers; then he said he was a breeches-maker, and a glover; I thought proper to take him to the watch-house.

               <p>On the 8th of June I had been at a friend's house; I stopped there till past twelve o'clock; I live in Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your friend's house? - In-street, Clare Market. I met Esther Jackson in the street, I went home with her, and she wanted some money for sleeping with her, I was not satisfied to give her any that night, she and I rather disagreed there, and she sent the prisoner at the bar in to me; I did not see her before she came into the room, and wanted money of me, I did not like to give her money at that time, till the morning, and I lay on the bed with my clothes on; I soon fell asleep, I was not very sober, nor yet very drunk; I had my recollection so as to know what passed. When I waked in the morning I missed my watch, and my money out of my pocket, and a pair of silk stockings out of my coat pocket. I awoke about three or four o'clock, my clothes were on me; I missed also some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all your money gone? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was missing? - One shilling and three-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. And how much left? - Seven shillings and six-pence. They were in the room when I awoke, cursing and swearing, asking how I came there?</p>

            Who were they swearing at? - At me, for being there. They each of them denied knowing any thing of my coming there; and then I had them taken to the watch-house, and gave charge of one, and not the other; I gave charge of Esther Jackson. I had her to Bow-street in the morning; I could not swear that she took the watch out, but I lost the watch in the room in her company. I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170181"></xptr>no more of it till Mr. Gastrel, the constable informed me of it. I have seen it since at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I keep the King's-head, in Wych-street, On the 19th of June, Whitsun Monday, the prisoner came to my house in the morning, about half an hour after eight she came in and called for a pint of purl, which I made her. There were several people there; I suppose as many as a dozen. She took the watch out of her pocket, and asked if any of them wanted to buy a watch, she had got one to sell; they took and looked at it, most of them round the tap-room; she asked two guineas for it; and none would give her the money. Then she came to me, and asked me if I wanted it; she said it was her own, at least her husband's, a person, that she called her husband, a young man that was a carpenter, but at that time had enlisted for a soldier, he called at my house the night before; he went away for Staffordshire; and she said that he had given her the duplicate of the watch, and she had been this morning to get it out of pawn, and she thought she could make more of it than letting it be there, and she seemed much distressed for want of her clothes. I laid her down a guinea and a half upon the table for it, before all the people that were there; I looked at the watch before I bought it, and saw Mr. Perigal's name on it, and said, I knew Mr. Perigal; and I took the watch to Mr. Perigal's that evening; and he said he made it for one Daley. I bought the watch of the prisoner.</p>

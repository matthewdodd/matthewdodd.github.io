On Friday the 16th of September, between one and two in the morning, I heard a noise in the room I lie in; I got up in the bed, but could see nothing; I lay down again; I heard a noise again; I jumped up, and caught hold of the prisoner by the hand, at my trunk; he said, he was locked out; I called out to one of the boys; my master came up with a light; I found my box open, and missed a crown piece and two shillings, out of the pocket of a pair of breeches that were in it. I charged the prisoner with having it; he denied it; I found it afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180017"></xptr> on the bed. The prisoner had lived at the house, and was my bedfellow two or three months; he has been gone from the house a month or six weeks. I asked him how he got into the house, he said, he got over the wall, and in at the cellar window.</p>
               <p>Charles Poulter. I am a peace officer. I was charged with the prisoner; he confessed he took the key, and unlocked the box, and took the money out.</p>

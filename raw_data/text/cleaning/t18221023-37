On the 22d of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a noise in the shop, I was down stairs, and sent the boy up; I went up after him in a few minutes, and saw the prisoner at the entrance of the parlour-door, behind the counter; he said he wanted a penny-loaf. I looked into the parlour and saw both the drawers open; I found the pelisse lying behind the door, about a yard from the drawers, and two table-cloths on a chair, two shirts and a pocket were on the floor; they were all taken out of the drawers. I had been across the room at four o'clock that morning, they were not there then. There was nobody in the shop; I heard him open the parlour-door. I had not seen the things, in the drawers, for two or three days before. My wife was not up till just before eight o'clock, and had not been in the parlour till he was taken.</p>

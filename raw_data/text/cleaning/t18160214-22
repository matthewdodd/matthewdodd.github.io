            . I am the brother of the last witness. I had seen the prisoner with a good many with him, but he was not sitting at all in our company in the public-house. As we came out several followed us. We crossed over the way, and we were standing at the other side when they came up to us. The prisoner came by my brother's side, and snatched the watch out of his pocket. I ran after the prisoner immediately, and halloed Stop thief! The man who came up to us with the prisoner ran after me. I had the prisoner in my view all the time I was running after me. There might be about four or five come up to me. I did not see or hear the prisoner speak to any of them. I caught the prisoner, and called the watch. The watch has never been recovered.</p>

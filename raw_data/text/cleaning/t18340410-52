            . I was near St. Mary-at-Hill, on the 7th of April - at the corner of Cross-lane, there were six or seven boys - the prisoner and another, (a kind of a sailor boy) left them, and went through Church-passage - they winked at one another, and when they came to the prosecutor and a gentleman walking with him, the prisoner pulled out a handkerchief from his pocket, and gave it to the sailor boy, who went on by the gentlemen - I went and told the gentleman that the prisoner had picked his pocket - he pursued them - I am quite certain I saw him do it - he said, "I have not got your handkerchief," before any charge was made against him.</p>

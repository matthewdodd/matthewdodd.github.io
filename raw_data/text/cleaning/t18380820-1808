On Friday night, the 13th of July, I went to No. 11, Parrot-court, about eleven o'clock—that is the pri<lb></lb>soner Williams's apartment-Davis, G 192, and Tate, G 133, went with me—the street door was open—there was alight in the bottom room, the par<lb></lb>lour—I listened, and heard a noise resembling the tearing of paper—I looked through the key-hole and other vacancies in the door, and saw the five prisoners all there—they were engaged in undoing packages of drugs—I saw a basket there under the door where I was looking in—I told Davis to look as well, and satisfy himself—he looked—I knocked at the door, which was fast, and the female prisoner asked who was there—I said, "The po<lb></lb>lice, open the door"-at that time Davis was in the act of forcing his staff between the jamb and the door—I pushed the door myself-Matthews was at that time standing behind the door, pushing it against me—I was trying to get in—I saw Gayton take a red book off a table, and throw it in a hole in the floor, and also a piece of tarpaulin, or one of the cloths pro<lb></lb>duced, I will not say which—he kicked it into the hole—he immediately jumped down the hole in the floor, followed by Dee—I had seen Dee hand<lb></lb>ing the parcels of drugs from one to the other, and placing some on the table—I forced my way into the room, and on doing sol received a violent blow on the side of the head from the prisoner Williams—I asked "Why did you not open the door? how came these things into your possession?"—Williams answered, "They are country things"-Davis went in with me-Tate I left outside the window—after I had procured more assistance Tate and Davis went down the hole—I saw Gayton and Dee brought up from the cellar—I found the property I have brought here, a jemmy, a file, a chisel, three skeleton keys, and a number of others, some bottles and jars—I found some pieces of paper, and produce them—I found on Wil<lb></lb>liams a bag, and a file, and a key on Bacon.</p>

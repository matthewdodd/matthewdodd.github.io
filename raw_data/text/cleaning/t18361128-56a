                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen James, a saddler in Berwick-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster; Collier lived in the next room to us. On Tuesday, the 1st of November, I left at two o'clock in the afternoon—I locked the door when I went out, and left it perfectly secure and safe—I took the key with me—when I went away, Collier was in her own apartment, and I met Morgan coming up stairs as I went down—I had seen her previously several times—she could be going to nobody but Collier—I returned at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and went in as usual—I put the key in and turned the lock back; it was dark, and I did not observe the box then—my husband rang the bell soon after, and, on taking up the light to let him in, I discovered the box of the room-door lock was forced off, but the bolt had not been turned—we searched the room, and missed the articles stated—they are worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of them had hung on nails in the room, and there were two boxes entirely entirely stripped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and live in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials—Morgan has lived in the house about five months, with a per<lb></lb>son named Adams, who I let my apartment to—she was taking care of the room for Adams, who was in the hospital—I have seen Collier there—on the evening of the 1st of November, about half-past seven o'clock, she came there with Morgan, and staid for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not observe whether they had any thing with them—they then went out together, and I saw no more of them till next day, in custody—after the examination before the Magistrate, I went into Morgan's room, it being left unlocked, my wife turned down the bed, and out fell a bundle of clothes—I went and told the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday night, the 1st of November, at about eleven o'clock, I went to Collier's apart<lb></lb>ment, and met Morgan coming down stairs from the second floor as I went up—Mrs. James said, "That is one of the women"—I stopped her, and turned her back into Collier's room, and took them both into custody—I went and looked at the prosecutor's door, and found the box of the lock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280092"></xptr>
               <p>forced off, and one of the screws broken in the middle—in consequence of what Mrs. James said, I asked Collier's husband for the tool which had been spoken of—he produced a screw-driver from a drawer, very much bent—I tried it to the door of the room, but could not see no marks to correspond with it—there were several marks of blunt instrument—I went to the fire<lb></lb>side, lifted up the poker, which was very much bent, and asked the pri<lb></lb>soner Collier how it became bent—she said it had been bent before, but on it I found a portion of paint which corresponded with a portion of paint which was off the door-post—I compared the poker, and it cor<lb></lb>responded exactly with the marks—it is my belief they were done with that instrument—I searched Collier's room, but found nothing—I went next day down to No. 5, Great St. Andrew-street, and there found the property—it was tied up in this shawl.</p>

            . About half past eleven I was coming down the Strand, and just as I came by Essex-street, this gentleman was coming along by himself, and I fancy he was rather in liquor; so with that the gentleman stopped and asked me where I was going to? sir, says I, where you please; says he, my dear I live in the Temple; so I laid hold of his hand, and went down Essex-street with him, and he began to be very rude, and he made me a present of a couple of shillings, and he said he had not a penny more, and next night he would give me another shilling; he put his hand up my petticoats, and as soon as he put his hand up my petticoats he said, there was something there that was very uncommon, and he insisted on having the two shillings again; with that I put the two shillings in my mouth, and he said if I did not give him the two shillings, he said he would charge me with the watch, or take me to the watch-house himself; so with that he began to take me to the watchman, and give charge to the first watchman he saw, and he wrenched the two shillings out of my mouth. It is the first time that ever I was here, nor I never was guilty of any such thing in my life; I have not had a friend to see me all the time I have been in prison for this two weeks.</p>

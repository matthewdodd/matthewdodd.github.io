                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a tobacconist's shop, in York-square, St. Pancras. On the evening of the 4th of Sept., I went out and left my shop door open—my shop had been shut up from nine o'clock—I turned when I got across the street, and saw a shadow—I turned back and saw the prisoner coming from behind my counter—I stepped back into the road till he came to the door—he had his pockets full—I said, "Halloo, what brings you here?"—he said, "I want a farthing pipe"—he went in—I turned and served him; he paid me—I put my hand to the cigar box, and he ran out like the wind—I missed some cigars, and ran after him—a person said, "It is no use your running after him, he is gone"—I said, "Never mind, I know him"—he was taken next day—no cigars have been found, except one, which was dropped in the shop—no one else was in the shop or could have taken it but him.</p>

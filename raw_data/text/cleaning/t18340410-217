            . I am clerk at a Manchester warehouse, in Wood-street, Cheapside - I was in Chiswell-street, and saw the prisoner and another following the prosecutor and his friend - I thought the prisoner was making too familiar with the prosecutor's coat - I saw him lift the tail of it up, and then take out the handkerchief - it was a red one, but I was not near enough to observe whether it was silk or cotton - I gave notice to the prosecutor - he turned and took hold of the prisoner, who was not half a yard from him - when the prisoner took the handkerchief out, he passed it behind him towards his companion, who was on the left side of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to the prisoner? A. About twenty yards - I was on the other side of the way - it wanted about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock - I crossed over and told the prosecutor - I did not see what became of the other man - I did not see any one run away - I said I supposed the prisoner might have put it into his pocket - I saw him take the handkerchief - if I had looked after the other man, as well as the prisoner, I might not have taken one of them - the street was full of people.</p>

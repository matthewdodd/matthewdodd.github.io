               <p>Did you trace any money to his hands that he had taken away? - Never before.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Bishopsgate, I had this guinea at my Lord Mayor's, before Alderman Plomer, he had it from the baker, the baker is ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Largent. Did you tell him you had received ever a guinea from the baker? - I found this guinea at the baker's.</p>
               <p>What is the mark? - I never knew it, my wife marked it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. LARGENT sworn.</p>
               <p>I marked the guinea with a black mark on the fleur-de-lis.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure of that mark again? - Yes, I could pick it out of five hundred if I had them; I am sure this is the guinea.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you receive that guinea your wife has in her hand from the baker? - Yes, the baker's name is Corneck.</p>
               <p>After you had got this guinea from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070043"></xptr> baker, did you ask the prisoner any questions about it? - Yes, I did, and he said before Alderman Plomer that he changed it there.</p>
               <p>Did you make any promises to the prisoner before he made his confession? - None at all; when Alderman Plomer said, how many do you think you took out of the drawer, he said about ten, then said the Alderman you are like to be hanged, and I said I hope you will recommend him to be sent abroad, and not take his life away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I changed the guinea there the over night, my master picked it out of more gold and silver, the prosecutor then said he could not swear to it.</p>

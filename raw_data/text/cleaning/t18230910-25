            . I am a night patrol. I saw the prisoner with another, older than himself, in Long-lane, and watched them with Baldry, till he got to Holborn-hill, and saw them go up to Mr. Ensor, and just by Hatton-garden, I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Mr. Ensor's pocket, turn back, and go down the hill; the other went down Hatton-garden. I was on the opposite side, and I called to Baldry, who was on the other side - he stopped him. I went after the prosecutor, and found the handkerchief between the prisoner's legs.</p>

            . I was with Carlisle, and saw the prisoner in Long-lane, with another boy, and followed them to Holborn, by Carlisle's desire - I saw him attempt a gentleman's pocket on Snow-hill. I afterwards heard Carlisle call out, Stop thief! and stopped him. The handkerchief was found on him. I am servant to Mr. Barnstaple, of Long-lane.</p>

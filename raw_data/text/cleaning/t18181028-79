I took it to the counter, where I found the prisoner. I asked him his address, he said Davis, tailor, Bridgewater-square, Barbican, which I wrote on the note,(looking at one) this is it. I told him it was bad, and asked him who he took it of. He said, of Mr. Silvester, at the blanket warehouse. Goswell-street. I asked him if he had any money to pay for the tea, he said he had only one shilling, I returned him the note, and he left the shop. I afterwards thought he might offer it elsewhere, I followed him down Butcherhall-lane, I there met Honey - He secured him - I never lost sight of him. Nobody had joined him.</p>

            . I am a constable, I took the prisoner in charge in Butcherhall-lane, by the desire of Mr. Eagleton. I told him I must go and see if he had given a right address to the note, as Mr. Eagleton had said, he said he took it of Silvester. I told him I knew no blanket warehouse, in Aldersgate-street. He, said, "What! you an officer and not know Silvester's". I said there was one in Goswell-street. He said that was it, he supposed. We took him there, and found Mr. Silvester at the Horse-shoe public-house, We enquired of the landlord if Mr. Silvester was there; he said he did not know. On my repeating the name, Mr. Silvester came out, and I asked him, if he had given the prisoner a 1l. note that day - He hesitated and said, he had paid him a great deal of money; but did not say he had paid him any that day. I asked the prisoner to let Mr. Silvester see it. He took it out of his pocketbook, and handed it to Mr. Silvester - He looked at it and said he did not think it was a bad one. The prisoner said, "Do not you know that you paid it to me to day, for a pair of breeches." He made no answer, but seemed a good deal confused, and shewed the note to several people in the room. A person on looking at it, said he would lay me a bottle of wine that it was a good one; another said he wished he had a hundred of them. I said, if he had, he would have reason to be sorry for it - He was holding it up, and told me to look at the water mark. I took it from him, and told the prisoner he must go back with me. He sat down, said he should not, and called for a pint of beer-it was not brought. He got up in a minute or two. I said, "We will go to your lodgings." He took me to a house in Bridgewater-gardens, which is a different place from Bridgewater-square-the square is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280032"></xptr>very respectable place. The house he took me to, is an old iron shop, with a curtain across it to separate the bed from the shop. He called to a man, and said, "Mr. Newman you know me very well." I said "does he lodge here?"-the man gave no answer. I asked again, he then said, he is a great deal here. I could not get from him whether the prisoner lodged there or not. I told the prisoner he must go back with me to Mr. Eagleton - He said he would be d-n-d if he would, and he said would have a pint of beer. which he did. He then said he would not go without a coach - I got one. They wanted to persuade him to go - He got up, and attempted to go round a passage - I seized him, he resisted. We did not get into the coach. When we got a little way he was quiet. I took him to Mr. Eagleton, and then to the Compter. As we went along, he said he was taken ill all of a sudden - He gave me a blow as hard as he could, and ran away. I pursued, and secured him immediately (looks at a note). this is it, I marked it,</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Did not Mr. Newman say I carried on business there - A. No. - Bridgewater-square and Bridgewater-gardens are separated from each other by a street.</p>
               <p>HARRIET LACK. I live at No. 41, Bridgewater-gardens. The last witness brought the prisoner there - He did not live there, nor had he lived there for the last nine months before, as I have lived there that time. Newman lodged there-the prisoner carried on no business there.</p>
               <p>MARY BROWN. I have kept the house No. 41, Bridgewater-gardens for eighteen years, Newman and the last witness lodged there-the prisoner did-not carry on any business there. I have seen him there, but not at work.</p>

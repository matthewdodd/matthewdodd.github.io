                  </hi>. I was in the employ of John Cheek, of the Strand, at the time of the robbery, and had the care of a shop of his in Burlington Arcade. I left the shop at nine o'clock, on the night of the 7th of November—I secured and locked it—I left every thing in its place as I went next morning, at half-past nine o'clock I met a person living in the Arcade, who gave me information—I went to the shop, and found the lock had been forced—the door was open—I went and found Mr. Cheek there, and Slark, the witness—seventeen umbrellas had been moved from the glass case, and some from the window—I found them lying on the counter, packed in a cloth-bag, and nineteen whips—the prisoner is a stranger—I saw him at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whip-maker, and live in Burlington Arcade. On the morning of the 8th of November I went to Mr. Cheek's shop, at half-past eight o'clock, from information I had received, and found the prisoner behind the counter—the door was, to every appearance, fast, and the padlock and staple in its place—I had no idea I could get in at the door—I went and peeped in through the window—I then gently pushed the door, and the padlock fell down, and the staple with it—I went and found the prisoner behind the counter—he seemed in a confused state, but was doing nothing then—he was standing there, with the goods on the</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Gapp, a livery-stable keeper, in Duke-street, Manchester-square. On Sunday, the 24th of June, I lost some glasses from a landau in our yard—we lost two pairs of cabriole lamps the same night.</p>

I met the prisoners in Manchester-street, Manchester-square, at a quarter before three o'clock in the morning of the 24th of June—each had one of these glasses under his arm—I asked them where they brought them from—Bedford said, "From Mr. Peter's, North-road"—I asked where he was going to take them to—(I was speaking to Bedford the whole of the time)—he said, "To Earl-street, to be lined"—I said it was rather a curious time in the morning to send carriage glasses to be lined, that I was not satisfied with what he said, and took them to the station-house—on the road there Bedford said that he had brought them from Mount-street, that a coachman had given them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each to take them from there to Earl-street, Lisson-grove—Smith was near enough to hear what was said.</p>

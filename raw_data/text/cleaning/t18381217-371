                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Fleur-de-lis-street, in the liberty of Norton Falgate, and am the wife of James Chamberlain—he occupies the house—the back of the house looks into Mr. Cave's yard. On Wednesday, the 28th of November, I was at home washing at the back of the house until between six and seven o'clock, and then I was eugaged with my family in the back parlour—about seven o'clock I found the win<lb></lb>dow broken looking towards Mr. Cave's yard, and both the drawers open—the window was broken from the outside—a man might put his hand through and unfasten the window—the sash was opened from the outside—I</p>

               <p>cannot say whether it was fastened before—there is a fastening, but a very temporary one, it is a drop, which is out of order—I had not been into the room after ten o'clock in the morning—the sash was then down—when I found my drawers open I went and told Mrs. Cave—she went round, and I saw her pick up a silk stock, a piece of silk, and a bundle of pieces of my children's frocks, in her passage—I know they were in the drawer on the Sunday, but the card-case I put into the drawer that very morning, and a silk gown was there—I had seen a man in the same dress as the prisoner about the premises that day, which was Wednesday.</p>

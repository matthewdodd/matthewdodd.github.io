            . I rent the ground-floor of Mr. Henley's house. The 16th of August. I went home about six o'clock in the afternoon, and found a pane of glass taken out of the back window, and the door open; and I lost all these goods. (I never had any of them again but one coat, which a woman brought to me, and said she found it.) I asked the neighbours, whether they saw any body carry any clothes away. They said, they saw 2 young fellows go up the yard between 4 and 5. I made enquiry, and described them; and the woman at the

I enquired after the Prisoner, and found that he was impressed and carried to the Savoy. The Waterman, who carried the men over with the clothes, being very positive he should know them again, I desired him to go to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120010"></xptr> Savoy; and when he saw the Prisoner, he was positive that he was one of the men he carried over with the clothes. I got a warrant from a Justice of the Peace, and took him out of the Savoy. He acknowledged before the Justice, that he was aiding and assisting in carrying away the clothes; but that he did not go into the house. - He did not mention any particulars of the clothes he took away.</p>

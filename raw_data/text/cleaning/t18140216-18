He came to our house on the 24th of January, with a load of goods from Messrs. Evans and Company, it happened at that time that I was in the accompting-house; upon stepping out shortly afterwards seeing there were people in the warehouse, I returned into the accompting-house; I did not remain long there. I went into the warehouse again, and saw that he had dragged his load of goods to a counter adjoining, and emptied the bag on the floor, and was then in the act of placing them on the counter, his apparently bag was laying near; I laid my hand upon it, and asked him what he had got there; he said, it was something that he intended to take to some other house.

The parcels could not have fallen into his bag; they were placed on a shelf two yards off.</p>

The prisoner appeared something intoxicated. He said, no, he would bring them to the back counter; I said, it is no material difference. He went to the back counter; I then could not see him where he stood; he continued taking the goods out. The witness came and said to me, I have found these goods in this man's bag. These are the goods that he produced at the time; they are my employers property.</p>

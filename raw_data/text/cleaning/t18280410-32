I saw the box after it was brought to Stafford-street; it was in our lodging there - I saw the prisoner put it off his shoulder in the room, and leave it there; I do not know how he got into the house afterwards - I locked the room daor after he left the box there, and left the key in the door - I lighted him down stairs, and shut the door after him; I did not go to the room again till my sister came; I returned with her and missed the box; I believe Fawcett's Christian name is Thomas.</p>

            . I lodge at Fawcet's house; his Christian name is Thomas; neither he nor any of his family lodge in the house - it is all let out in lodgings; I recollect the evening that Walker came there; about nine o'clock that evening a man put his head in at my room door, and asked if my name was Anderson; that was not the prisoner - after that I saw the prisoner and another man in Walker's room; I went and spoke to them, as their noise disturbed my husband, who was ill: I went into the room - they were in the dark; there were two men in the room, but no light - I had a candle in my hand, and asked them who authorized them to move that chest - the prisoner was then helping it on the other man's shoulder; he (the prisoner) said the lady had made a mistake - that he was going to take that chest away and bring a bureau - he said he was the man who had moved the goods; the man who had the chest ran down stairs, saying "Come along, all is right - we will bring back the bureau," and both went down together - thanking me for lighting them down. Walker came very soon afterwards.</p>

I was at the Yorkshire Stingo, where I get my living; I moved several things for these young women, and the last was this box; I delivered it there - the young woman went with me and saw me go out - I went to Homer-street and was paid; I went home directly, as I was expecting a place at Sir James Cochrane's; my father let me in - I went to bed, and I never had a coat on at all from that day to this; I always went in a sleeve waistcoat; when the officer brought me to the watch-house, he asked the watchman if I was the man; he said not, and told him not to come down to the office - another young woman came to the office and said I was not the man. Webster went and called after her, and said she was concerned in the robbery: another woman in the house can prove I was not there; she is not here; her name is Taylor.</p>

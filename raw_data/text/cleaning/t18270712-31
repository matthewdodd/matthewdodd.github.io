            . I am shopman to Mrs. Reeve, No. 118, Fetter-lane. On the 5th of June I was dining in the parlour; my young master called me out, took me to the corner of Rolls-buildings, and pointed out the two prisoners; they turned a corner into White's-alley - I followed, and turned round; Coughlan was going up a place which is no thoroughfare - I collared him, and called Stop thief! after the other; I dragged him after me, and caught hold of Richards, who was about ten yards off - they were both close together before; I charged them with picking a pocket; they said they were innocent, that they were both looking for work, and were strangers to each other. They were running close together when I first saw them.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my parents, in Fetter-lane - they keep an oil and Italian warehouse. On the 5th of June I saw Mr. Giles at the corner of Rolls-buildings; the prisoners were close to him; I saw them draw a pocket-handkerchief out of his pocket - Coughlan was the one who drew it out; he put it into his breast pocket; I was four or five yards off; they turned down Rolls-buildings. I went into the parlour, and called out Pollett; I then went and told Mr. Giles what I had seen; I did not pursue; I afterwards saw them in Pollett's custody, and was quite sure of them - they were taken in four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICHARDS. He said at first that I was not with Coughlan. Witness. No; I said there was a third one behind them.</p>

I was coming up Fetter-lane, and on turning down Rolls-buildings it came on very wet - I ran; a man came and pursued me; I stopped at a window to look at a bill, and he said I had picked a gentleman's pocket - I said I was innocent. They searched me three times, but could not find the handkerchief; I never saw the other prisoner before in my life.</p>
               <p>RICHARD's Defence. I heard a gentleman halloo Stop thief! I immediately stopped; he took Coughlan towards me, and said it was for picking a pocket.</p>

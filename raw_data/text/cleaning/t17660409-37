            . I saw Borne go into Bank's shop; then I went and called Mrs. King: when we first went into the shop, they all denied that any tobacco was brought there; afterwards Borne said, if Mrs. king would not hurt him, he would confess, so did Brown; Borne said he sold it to Brown, and Brown gave him half a crown of the money. Mr. Banks bid Mrs. King take her tobacco; she said she was not a porter, and would not. Mr. Conner was were present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Butler. I am headborough of St. John's Wapping: I was sent for to take Borne in custody. Banks would not let me in at first; I rapped very hard, then he came and let me in: they were quarrelling one among another; I saw a parcel of tobacco lying by the counter. Mrs. King said, there is the thief, I deliver him into your hands. Borne owned to me he had stole the tobacco; some was in a sack and some loose; he said he got into the shop of Mrs. King, under pretence of buying a pennyworth of tobacco, and saw the parcel in a sack, and he took it away, and that there were two of his companions on each side the door watching; he said he had sold it to Brown. Brown said he had not sold it to him; Borne said he had received half a crown in part; I saw him have half a crown in his left hand. I know nothing against Brown.</p>

               <p>This man came into the shop, and asked me if I would buy a parcel of tobacco; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had it of two sailors; I said I would weigh it. I thought it had been smuggled tobacco; I did not agree for any price, neither did I give him any money for it.</p>

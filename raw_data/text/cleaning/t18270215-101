               <p>MICHAEL EDWIN FELL. On the 18th of January, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was endeavouring to get into the Palace to see the Duke of York lay in state; my pocket-book was in my left hand trousers pocket - I passed the barriers to get into the gate - I then felt for my book, and it was gone - I had not noticed the prisoner - I afterwards found the book at Marlborough-street - I am sure I lost it in that crowd.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were not all these things returned to him? A. I believe so; they were sealed up at the first examination. I am a patrol. - Gook was with me - he is a parish constable; there was a great crowd. I first saw him in St. James'-street; I saw him throw his hand out, and immediately the book fell.</p>
               <p>MR. FELL. This is my book - it contained memorandums, which were in it when it was found, and here are some marks on it, by which I know it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there any thing in it besides papers? A. No.</p>

            . I was in St. James'-street about a quarter to three o'clock, on duty with Reardon; Yates came up - I had seen the prisoner about an hour before, and lost sight of him for ten minutes or a quarter of an hours; I then saw him come out of the crowd with four or five others; they went up Pickering-place; Yates and Reardon went after them - I attempted to take hold of two of them; Reardon took another, and Yates took the prisoner; I saw the pocket-book fall from the prisoner, but did not see Reardon pick it up, nor hear the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you once prosecute the King's postillion? A. No - it was a helper in the King's stable; I was prosecuted myself afterwards, and acquitted. Several people were up the court - I will not swear how many; there was no pressure from the soldiers - the soldiers were in the road - this was on the pavement; I stood without pressure; there was no particular crowd there. I was engaged with the other men, who ill-used me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is Pickering-court? A. On the right hand of St. James'-street; the book fell four or five yards up the court, in the narrow part.</p>

            . I saw this pocket-book dropped, five or six yards down Pickering-place - I was holding the prisoner, who tried to get from me; he said nothing then; but when we put him into a coach, he said, if we could do away with the pocket-book it would be all right - he said this two or three times as we went up St. James'-street - I was knocked down in the court, and did not see it picked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were a great many people there - I suppose forty or fifty? A. I dare say there were; the court was choked full of people, who were getting away from the trampling of horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a great pressure besides that, from the persons who endeavoured to rescue the prisoner? A. Yes - he said nothing about his wife and family in my hearing.</p>

            . The prisoner said what I have stated, in the court, and he said it again in the coach - I heard something drop, and looked, and saw the book - he spoke about his wife and family two or three times in the coach - his conversation was addressed to me, but I think Yates must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What they have stated is false - was pressed into the crowd, and could not get away - this man never picked up the book at all - it was brought up to them.</p>

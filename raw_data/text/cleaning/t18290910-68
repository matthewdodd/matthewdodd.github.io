I suspected the prisoner, who was in his employ - when I returned from breakfast on the 21st of July, I ordered the other man out, and marked 12s. with a cross; I went down stairs, and ordered the prisoner up to the shop to call me if any thing was wanted - I staid about ten minutes, then came up, and sent him down; I missed 3s. out of the till: I waited till Mr. Tucker came from Kensington, and told him of it - he wished to have some farther confirmation, and told me to mark some more money; I then marked five half-crowns and four shillings, with a W. - I stationed myself at the back of the shop, and saw the prisoner come through a private door, open the till, and then go down again; I then missed four half-crowns and two shillings: my master desired me to go for an officer, who searched him, and found four half-crowns and two shillings of that silver, and the three shillings which he took in the morning - this is the silver; it has the marks which I put on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long has he been in your service? A. About nine months; he was frequently sent to the banker's with money - he was a <rs id="t18290910-68-deflabel390" type="occupation">melter</rs>

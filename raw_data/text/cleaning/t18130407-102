On the 9th of March, I was in the servants hall, busy, about a quarter before twelve, in the middle of the day. I heard the plates rattle in my pantry. I halloaed out, who is it in the pantry. I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear. Nobody answered. I ran to see who was in the pantry. He got to the side door, and in the passage, before I got to the area door, I heard the silver rattle. I ran up the area steps. I ran over two large gravy-spoons that had fallen from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them fall - A. No, I did not. They were on the area steps. I saw one spoon fall from one step to the other. I pursued the prisoner; he ran very fast indeed. He had got about forty yards when I overtook him. I collared him, and took him to Marybone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself when you laid hold of him - A. He said it was through want. I never lost sight of him from the area steps until I collared him.</p>

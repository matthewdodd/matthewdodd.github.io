                  </hi>. I am single, and carry on the business of a tailor and draper, at Newark. The prisoner was my journeyman for about a year and a half—he lived near the premises where I carried on my business—I used to pay him for each article he made, according to the usual prices—about two months ago 1 hired a room in his house, to deposit some of my property in—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—the rent of his house was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a-week—I put the goods in that room, which I have since seen in London—perhaps 1 had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in the room—I fastened it with a padlock outside, and kept the key myself—on Wednesday, the 11th of Jan., I went to the prisoner's house to tell him I wanted him to make a coat—he said he would go, cut it out, and make it, and come to me next morning—he did not come next day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300126"></xptr>
               <p>—in consequence of that, I went to his house the next Friday—he was not at home—the door was locked—I thought he was gone to some friends—I went again three times that evening, but always found the door locked—I went again on the Saturday, and found it still locked—on Monday morning a parcel came to my house—it contained the key of his house—I went to his house with the key, and went into it—I went to the room in which my pro<lb></lb>perty had been deposited—the door was locked, the same as usual—I unlocked it with my key, and on entering the room I missed all this property stated in this indictment—I have seen the articles mentioned in the indictment, and I identified them as being mine—the prisoner had no authority from me to re<lb></lb>move this property, or do any thing with it—he had no business in the room at all—I communicated with my brother, who came off to London.</p>

I might owe 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my brother, but I do not know—I do not keep the books—these goods were not removed exactly for the purpose of avoiding an execution for these debts—I was rather afraid of my brother, or of the Bank, at least—I might have told the prisoner that I wished these goods to be put into his house to avoid an execution that I ex<lb></lb>pected from my brother—that was not my only reason—another was that I had let part of my house—the Bank had threatened me with law proceedings—I partially removed the goods to avoid the threatened execution—I have never paid the prisoner with cloth when I owed him anything—I do not know that he told me he did not understand the law, and was afraid of getting into trouble—I will swear he did not—I do not recollect that he ever said so—I did not tell him he need not fear, I would make it all right—I do not believe his wife said so, nor that either of them did—I never knew from him that these goods had been booked at Deacon's warehouse, for London—on Sunday evening, the 15th of Jan., I saw a woman named Sarah Crawley at Newark, between six and seven o'clock, I went to her house to inquire—it was dark—there was a man with me—he had a bunch of keys—I bor<lb></lb>rowed a candle from Mrs. Crawley—she might have asked me who the man was—I do not recollect that she did—I might have told her he was a particular friend of mine, a Mr. Gibson—he tried the lock of the prisoner's door—we had asked leave first of the landlady—I sent for another man named Revell—we picked the lock, and went in—Revell picked it—I believe Mrs. Crawley paid the man for picking the lock—the prisoner had been very kind to me in opening the shop for me, and I gave him flannel, and several things—I thought I was indebted to him for what he had done—I think I gave him a</p>

               <p>coat to come up to London, about three weeks ago—he said he would come and work six weeks in London, till work was brisker, and then he would re<lb></lb>turn—I never told Mrs. Crawley that I had entrusted the prisoner's wife with the key, in order to remove the goods, nor any thing to that effect—the lock was picked, because they had taken the key away—they returned the key in a parcel with a note—I gave the parcel which contained the key to my brother—I employed the prisoner to teach my son the art of cutting—I gave him one waistcoat piece for that—I only gave him one—I paid him what he demanded—I paid him with this waistcoat—he was only an hour or two teaching him—he made no charge at all—I do not believe that my son brought the key of the room on the 27th of Dec. to the prisoner's wife—this is the first word I ever heard about it—the prisoner's wife might have removed some of these things from the room to my house—if she did it, it was by my directions or my son's—if I wanted them either to sell or use, I should have them again—she never got them unless I was with her—I do not know whether I ever went to the prisoner's house of a night to remove goods to my shop for the purpose of sale on the market days—I might fetch some—I will not swear whether I did or did not on the 12th of Jan.—if I did they were my own—I swear I never employed the prisoner and his wife to bring my goods up to London, or to remove one single article.</p>

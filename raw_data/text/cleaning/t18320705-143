            . On the evening of the 14th of June, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming from the prosecutor's shop, with these two pieces of print under his arm - the end of one of them was hanging down; I followed him - he dropped one, which I took up: I could not quite reach the prisoner with my hand, but I struck him with a small stick, and about six yards further on he dropped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050073"></xptr>this other piece; I took it up - he got away from me then, but I took him about half-past three o'clock the next morning.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for the last four years; I was talking with Marchant when he went by with the prints - I saw him drop one of the pieces; he turned a corner, and I said I need not run after him, as I knew him.</p>

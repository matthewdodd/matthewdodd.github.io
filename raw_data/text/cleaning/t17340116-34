            , the Younger (aged 12) My Father sent me with a Bottle of Rum in a Basket, to carry to Black's- Fields. The Prisoner follow'd me from Layton's-Yard (where they build Ships) to a bye Alley, close by a Pond, and there he said he belong'd to the King, and must have my Rum, and so he laid hold of it, and made me set it down, and then he took it up, and walk'd a little with it; I cry'd for my Basket, and a Gentleman coming along, the Prisoner took to his Heels and run off - This is the Basket, there was a Handkerchief in it, and he took that too.</p>

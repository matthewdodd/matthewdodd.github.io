On the 10th of August, about eleven o'clock, I was passing homeward from Fleet-street, up Fleet-market, I met the prisoner and two others - they pressed me to give them gin. I refused, but at last consented - I went into a house and gave them some - I had none myself. I came out and saw no more of them till I got about fifty yards, when the prisoner rushed by me, and took out my purse with five sovereigns and a half in it from my pocket - the silver was loose in my pocket; she ran away. I pursued her up the market calling Stop thief! and caught hold of her gown at the top of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130137"></xptr>market - she turned round, and said "There is your purse," giving it to me, but it was empty; the watchman came up and took her. I said, "You had better give me the money, or you will be transported;" she said, "That is just what I wish."</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BROWN WESTCOTT. I could not find the sovereigns - we searched the market all over. I never lost sight of her. I gave charge of a man who was said to be acquainted with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - a friend gave me the silver; he brought a woman to Guildhall to swear falsely against me, and promised her a new gown.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. It is false - a woman said, as I was going along, "Are you the gentleman who was robbed?" I said Yes - she said, "I saw that woman soliciting money from other people for gin," and I thought her evidence might be of use. <rs id="t18270913-332-verdict1854" type="verdictDescription">

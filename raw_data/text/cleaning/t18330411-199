             then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you often seen him write? A. Only on the 27th of September; I employed him as my agent, and had numerous letters from him, but without comparing it with them I believe it to be his hand-writing; I am not in his debt - there was a running account between us; he has sold property and paid bills for me at Boulogne - I have never had a satisfactory account from him; he called on me on the 27th of September, and said the person who had my property at Boulogne was likely to become a bankrupt, and I requested him to take charge of my property - I never authorized him to pawn any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you learn from him that he was going to Boulogue on the 27th of September? A. He said he was going that evening - I never saw him afterwards; I received letters from him, and acted on them.</p>

             there; I saw him there better than a month ago - I have seen him write directions, but nothing more than five or six words; I have often seen him do that - I cannot swear these papers are his hand-writing; they are similar to what I have seen him write - I believe them to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You never saw him write letters? A. No, only directions to put on baggage; I lived six months at Mr. Starr's hotel, Wood-street, about three years ago - I did not leave him without informing him I was going; I have not heard that he has been looking after me - I owe him 14l. which I lost of his; I went to Boulogne to avoid it - I lost it in an unfortunate house, about eight o'clock at night; I went back to my master that night, but would not tell him of it - I made him acquainted with it through some friends.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City. I tried to find the prisoner before last September; I took him into custody at Brompton, and took him to the Mansion-house to be examined - I took him on the 23rd of March, I took him to the Compter, and then to the Mansion-house; he was fully committed from the Mansion-house to Newgate; I preferred a bill against him last Friday here - he has been in custody ever since; I apprehended him on another charge, not on this.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in his Defence, complained of statements made in the public prints respecting him, and that he had not time to bring witnesses to his character from France, but did not enter into the subject of the charge.</p>

I know Howley-place Villas—I went there on 7th July last, about half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, to deliver a parcel—I rang the bell of the garden gate—the servant, Emily Luker, opened it—I gave her the parcel—I saw the prisoner there, he was standing at the corner of the street—he came to the gate—as soon as I had given the parcel he drew out a pistol—I seized hold of it by the barrel—he was then, I think, about two or three yards from the young woman—he pulled the pistol out of ray hand, and I jumped on one side—he then levelled the pistol at the servant's head, and fired—she fell—the prisoner walked off—I went into the house—the girl was taken into the house, and I left—I did not see where she was wounded—I heard the report of the pistol.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there in the beginning of July last—I was called down stairs, and found her in the waiting room lying on a couch—her face was covered—I uncovered it, and found it very much blackened, and there was bleeding from the right eye—the face was also very much swollen—she was removed into the ward—I afterwards examined the right eye—it was destroyed, the iris was protruding; the eye itself was completely destroyed—there was a lacerated wound over the outer part of the orbit, above—the bone was bared—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description tired from a pistol—I considered it a dangerous wound at the time—she has been under my care nearly up to the present time—she has completely lost her eye—I cannot say that she is out of danger yet, she might have a relapse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you in making your examination of the parts, discover any stone, or fragment of stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A discharge of powder so close to the face of the girl would cause the same injuries without any atones at all, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must be very close; no, I do not think it would—it would not—the periosteum would not have been denuded from the bone, unless it had been touching the face—if the pistol had been touching the face, it might hare done so—supposing that the pistol was close up to the face, and then discharged, the appearances I observed might be caused by powder alone, without any stone being in the pistol.</p>

KIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that at the distance of two or three yards the powder alone could have inflicted a severe wound of that sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb></lb>tainly not—if the pistol had been touching the akin, the bone would very probably have been denuded, but I cannot say that it would; certainly not at the distance of a yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D., of the University of Edinburgh, and live at No. 1, Howley-place, nine doors from where the prosecutrix lived. I heard the report of the pistol as I was reading in my own room—I went out into my front garden to see what it was, and a woman came in a great hurry—I went to see the young woman; I found her lying on a bed bleeding pro<lb></lb>fusely from the eye and the forehead—I examined it; I found the integu<lb></lb>ments severed from the frontal portion of the bone, and falling over the cheek, and a small portion of the bone exposed—the eye itself was burst and gone—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description fired from a pistol—I should say it could not have been caused by powder alone; you might have had a contused wound, but not the integuments dragged from the bone—I-should think powder could not have done that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose that a stone had struck the face, would it have lodged there, or gone away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend upon circumstances—the pistol must have been fired very close to the head, or she would have been killed; if it had been a few yards from her she would have been killed; in fact, so near must the pistol have been to her, that a great portion of the powder even did not explode—it is possible that the stones might have been fired from the pistol, and have struck the face, and then dropped, on account of the close proximity to the face—there would be no windage, and there would be no momentum; if it had been at any distance it would have gone into her brain—the pistol must have been very close indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurseryman and florist. I have known the prisoner since Feb. last—I knew him in Covent-garden market for a year or two before, but I have known him more particularly since Feb., and until the time this took place—he has always been an amiable, well-conducted, moral young man; honest, sober, and industrious—he was in my employ—as I came here voluntarily, I think there is one thing that I ought to state.</p>

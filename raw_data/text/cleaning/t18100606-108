            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 5th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Oxford-street I observed the two prisoners at the bar. I observed the two prisoners and another in company with them, standing at the corner of Chapple-street, leading into Orchard-street, and having seen these prisoners before caused me to stop; they observed me and went away; they all three went down Great Chapple-street. I crossed Oxford-street, and looked down Chapple-street to see which way they turned; not seeing them I walked a little way up Oxford-street, in less than five minutes I saw them all three coming on the opposite side of the way, on the same side of the way they were on before; I hid myself by the side of a hackney coach; I saw each of them, as though they took it by turns, walk as far as Mr. Wyer's door; they did not go altogether. Gates took this portmanteau from off others that were placed at the door where it was standing for sale; immediately that he took it, Man and the other that is not apprehended ran off; they followed Gates, who had the portmanteau. Gates, on turning his head off, saw me coming after him; he ran with it as far as the corner of Titchfield-street, there he dropped it opposite of Mr. Leaf's door; he ran down Titchfield-street, I passed the portmanteau, into Dean-street, he took up Dean-street into Oxford-street again. I called out, stop thief; he crossed Oxford-street and ran to the corner of Rathbone-place, where he was stopped. I took him in custody. The prisoner asked me, what I wanted with him, he had done nothing; and as I was conveying him to the place where I saw the portmanteau drop, I found he had his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and he seemed very uneasy; I clapped my hand upon his hand as he had it in his pocket, and he brought out this clasped knife half open. I conveyed him back to the place where I saw the portmanteau drop. Mr. Leaf came out of the shop and said, you are looking for this, and gave the portmanteau to me; then conveyed him to the office. Man was not taken till the Wednesday night following. I know no more than seeing him in company with Gates.</p>

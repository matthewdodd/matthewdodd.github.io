               <p>Q. I believe he is in an extremely ill state of health, unable to help himself? - A. He is; I attended him, and helped him in and out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before this got any money for Mr. Tattersall from the bankers? - A. Yes, I got change for a check of 30l. the week before the prisoner was taken up, but I cannot say what day: I gave the change to my master, and afterwards put it into my master's purse; two 10l. notes, a 2l. note, and four ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was it? - A. It was a red Morocco purse, with the head of Buonaparte upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken ill, so as to leave the care of your master? - A. No, but the prisoner assisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200060"></xptr>in taking care of my master, and pulled off his clothes of a night.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after did you entertain any suspicion of him? - A. On Friday the 4th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did any of the servants say any thing to him? - A. Yes; when I came down on Friday, the prisoner shewed me his watch-chain, and said, Matthew, don't I cut a swell here.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he a watch and chain before he came into the service of your master? - A. He had none; he told me he had put in half a crown at a raffle, and had won this watch; I asked him where it was, and he said in the Haymarket; he afterwards said it was in a street at the back of the Haymarket; I asked the landlord's name, and he said he did not know. As soon as I had taken my breakfast, I enquired after my master's purse, and my master missed it in the evening; I got some constables, and took up the prisoner on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q.When the constables came, did you hear him say any thing respecting the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when any search was made? - A.The purse was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was your master's purse or not? - A. Yes, I can swear it was my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give any directions where to find it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.The prisoner is quite a lad? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he made use of this expression - Do not I cut a swell? - A. Yes.</p>

            , Esq sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. In consequence of suspicion, I searched for my purse, and missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it shewn to you after it was found? - A.No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner now at the bar assist you in getting off your clothes? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>RICHARD LOVETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you one of the Marlborough-street officers? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sent for to take charge of the prisoner? - A. I was; on Friday, the 4th of March, in the forenoon, I took him in custody on suspicion of robbing Mr. Tattersall of notes to the amount of twenty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you took him before the Magistrate, did he say any thing respecting it? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you tell us any thing he said, had any body said any thing to induce him to confess, or threatened him? - A. No; when I apprehended him, I told him my business, and I searched his box, and found a great quantity of things; he did the box; I asked him how he came by such a quantity of things; he said, he had picked up a ten-pound note in Oxford-street; I said, the things must have come to more than ten pounds, and asked him how he came by his watch, and he said, he had won it at a raffle in the Haymarket; I asked him where, but he could not, or would not tell me; I then took him to Marybone watch-house; just before I got him to the lock-up house, he said, Oh dear, gentlemen, I will tell you how I came by it, I certainly did rob Mr. Tattersall.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you make any search for any thing, in consequence of what he told you? - A. Yes; he told me he had thrown the red purse down the privy; after I had put him in the watch-house, I got a candle and lanthorn, and found the pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew it to Mr. Tattersall's servant? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you kept it? - A. No, it was too bad to produce.</p>
               <p>Q.You found a great number of things in his box - did he say how he got them? - A. Yes; he gave me an account of things to the amount of the money within about three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got there, did you acquaint him with the nature of the charge? - A. Yes, I did, and I asked him what money he had got in his pocket; he pulled out a five pound note, a guinea, and some silver - nineteen shillings, three six pences, and a half-guinea; he denied the charge then, and going along Cavendish-square, he turns his head to me, and says, Oh dear, oh dear, what shall I do. I told him it was not our duty to advise him what to do; I told him he must make that up in his own mind, and he said, "I did rob Mr. Tattersall;" I searched for the pocket-book with Lovett, and we found it in the necessary.</p>

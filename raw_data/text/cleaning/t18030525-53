            ? - A. Yes; I know nothing of the property; there were two rooms taken by the Westminster regiment, at Brentford, as an hospital; the prisoner was in that hospital; I have an apartment in the same house; he came down to me, and asked for a few halfpence to get him a little nourishment, for he was quite low, till his serjeant came back; I let him have nine-pence, and he left a bundle with me for it; the serjeant gave me the money in a week, Serjeant Howell; it might be about a month ago.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKINS sworn. - I bought a jacket of the prisoner five weeks ago last Saturday, as I was going to work in the morning; I overtook the prisoner in Blandford-street, Marybone, about ten minutes before six in the morning; he asked if I knew any one that wanted a jacket; I told him I wanted such a thing; I bought the jacket, and paid for it, and a pair of breeches; I agreed to give him a guinea for them, but I never had the breeches; he said, he lived in Baker-street, No. 8; I went there, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>OWEN HOWELL sworn. - I am a serjeant in the Westminster Militia; the prisoner was a soldier in that regiment, and the prosecutor also; I never attend the regiment, I am always in London; on the 6th of May, I was at Brentford; on Saturday, the 7th of May, the Colonel ordered me to find the property, if possible; the prisoner was in the guard-room; Colonel Cluthero ordered me to take Price, and he would make an example of him for robbing his comrade; he told me where to find the property; I went by his direction to Mrs. Newton's house, and found it left for eight-pence or nine-pence; I paid it, and shewed the handkerchief and waistcoat to Driver; he claimed it; the jacket I found with Mr. Perkins, in Grosvenor-square, on his back; I have kept them ever since.

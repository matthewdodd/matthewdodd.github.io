                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six—the signature to the check is a disguised hand, but it is like the prisoner's writing—there aro let<lb></lb>ters in the body just like his ordinary writing—the "oo" and the "k" in "Cook" are precisely like his—the whole of the order is his writing—I swear to them both—I can swear to some of the other letters, but am more certain about those—I do not consider the order a disguised writing at all—I have been at the prisoner's counting-house in Size-lane, eight, ten, or a dozen times—I will not swear I have not been there twenty times—I never used it as a place of business—I went there in consequence of a card he gave me, about a rich partner he bad got, and cash being advanced on all descriptions of property—I should never have been there if it had not been for the card—I think I did write one letter there; I will not swear I did not write two—I did not write three or four—I never authorised the prisoner to purchase goods for me from Moses's, or Bousfield's, or Amos's, or anywhere—I know a person named King, by seeing him at the prisoner's counting-house five or six times—I never saw him but there—I never wrote a letter in his presence—I once gave the prisoner a bill to get discounted; he kept it a great time, and I was fearful I should never get it back—I never gave him but one—I have been in my place at New Cross five years—I went through the Insolvent Court five years ago—I have dealt with Mr. Aldred about sixteen years—I have dealt with him since my insolvency—(<hi rend="italic">card read</hi>, "Burge, Chislett and Com<lb></lb>pany, Commercial and General Agents, 4, Skinners-place, Size-lane, Bucklers-bury—Cash immediately advanced on every description of property").</p>

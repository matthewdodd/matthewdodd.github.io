               <p>I saw him on the evening following; he then confessed to me that he had married Miss Timson. He has since then lived now and then with his wife; she is now pregnant by him. At that time we did not believe him; we thought he said what was really not true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say you heard me aay I was married to Miss Timson - A. Certainly I do; my sister was present, and almost in fits; you told me so when you returned on the Monday evening. You told me you had married Miss Timson, and could not live any longer with my sister.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is not my intention to deny an intimacy between myself and

            , which intimacy has been with a perfect knowledge of my wife, nor is it I conceive any consequence to the present charge; it is not in my power to employ counsel, being by this prosecution deprived of assistance. I am sorry to have heard the evidence gone through as it has; I do not say there is a conspiracy among the witnesses, some of them having been mistaken, and the other part have not corrected the mistakes; but my innocence or guilt is to be determined by the evidence. There has been no positive evidence before the court of any marriage between me and Miss Timson; there is evidence of a person calling himself

I am surprised at that, for I have been at that church several times to search the book of marriages. I would defy any two persons of the name, who were not very dissimilar in the advantages of that part of education, to write their names without being able to trace the resemblance of each to the other; a man's name being usually written with rapidity, and are very negligent of the form of the letters. I entreat the jury to consider the nature of the evidence is by no means positive. Miss Timson, if her attachment to me was so violent would have spurned at my disgrace, when she knew her own character could not have escaped in such a compromise; and one of the papers given in evidence against me was in pencil writing, which I submit is not cognizable in a court of justice, and whatever I have said at best is evidence; I submit whether that might operate against me; it has not been misproved that

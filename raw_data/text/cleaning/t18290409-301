            . I know the two prisoners - they live at Hammersmith: I went to their house with a search warrant, on the 3rd of April, with a man of the name of Hallett and Mr. Phillips - I went up stairs, and was going into the room on the first floor, but was prevented by John Goodrick and his wife, who said there was a woman who had lain in but a few days - I said I must insist upon it; they begged me to wait a few minutes while they got the room fit for a man to go into - I placed a man at the door, and went up stairs; I found no property relating to this indictment; I came down again, and with very great reluctance they let me go into the room - in fact I was obliged to force my way in; I proceeded to search every part till I came to the bed: I lifted up one corner of the bed, and saw the mattress - I then went to the other corner; I saw nothing there - as I was putting it down again, I saw a small hole in the straw mattress, I put my hand in, and felt a plate or a dish; I pulled it out - Mr. Phillips claimed it; I put in my hand, and found I believe, seven, which I put into Mr. Phillip's hand, who identified them; John Goodrick took up the plates and dishes, smashed them on the floor, and said "There you b-rs, now can you swear to them;"I called for assistance - John Goodrich got the poker, and said he would smash my b-y brains out; Robert Goodrick then ran up, passed my man on the stairs, and caught up another poker - John said "Come on Bob, let us beat their h-y brains out, if they do not get out of the house;" I got out, and sent for three of my own men - the prisoners were then apprehended, I found a dark lantern and a cutlas, but nothing more relating to this indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Robert did not come up till there was a row? A. As soon as I called for my assistant, Robert ran up, and passed him; I believe John is married, and has one or two children - these are the broken plates and dishes.</p>

They say it is a dwelling-house, when I know the house has been locked up for months and months, and not a soul has been seen there, but the woman has come and unlocked it in the morning, to give it air; it is a summer-house, about four hundred yards from the dwelling-house - I have had that dark-lantern for many years; I use it in the boat, to sort my fish at Billingsgate, in the winter.</p>

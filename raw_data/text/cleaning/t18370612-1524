I felt a tug at my pocket—I turned round instantly, and saw the prisoner walking away from me—there was another person between him and me, but I was confident that the prisoner took it, and followed him—he turned into St. Martin's-lane, and ran 100 yards, I then saw him throw the handkerchief down—he was taken in about ten minutes.</p>

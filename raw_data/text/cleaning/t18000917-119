               <p>Q. Had you made them over to him? - A. No, to another gentleman; it was a bill of sale to Mr. Palmer for fifteen pounds, but I never received any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Palmer? - A. I don't know, he is a lawyer, I believe, and as soon as the paper was made out, I was to have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live? - A. I don't know, Mr. Watson knows, they both pretented to be my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the bill of sale dated, the 21st or 22d of July, I lost my goods upon the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. What has the woman prisoner to do with it? - A. The woman him upon the road, and assisted in moving the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Your poor husband don't know anything of this prosecution? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You had sent your poor husband down to Sunderland for the benefit of his health? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in your husband's absence, you thought proper to make a bill of sale of your goods to Palmer, the broker, and the prisoner? - A. I did not know any thing of his being a broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not take that house for you in Plumber's row? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q.You helped to pack up these goods for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire the prisoner to take the goods to Wellclose-Square, in order that it might not be discovered where you were going; and from there to the West end of the town, and from thence to Plumber's-row? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never apply to get any body pressed? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never applied to get your husband pressed? - A.No; I was advised to get him to sea, to try if it would do him any good; he was out of his element when he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the prisoner spent almost all his time with you, in the absence of your husband? - A. No, he has not.</p>

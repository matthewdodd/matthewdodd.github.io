On the 28th of July I detected him in selling some waste paper, and on the Saturday, the day after, I desired him to deliver the keys up to me. On the Monday morning I was informed he had been seen to carry out a bundle of paper, and he ran so fast, that he was soon out of sight. I told him of it, he denied it, but at last owned he had taken a parcel, and that it was some of Atkins's Reports; but said they were rathe waste than otherwise (though that I knew to be false.)

Sir John ordered a warrant to apprehend Brown; he came; then there was a warrant to search his apartment, and he living in London, it was backed by my Lord Mayor. There was nothing found there, and Brown was discharged. These books in sheets are the property of

                  </hi> I am cook to Mrs. Isabella Lowes, a widow, of South-well-place, in the parish of Paddington—it is her dwelling-house—on 18th Nov., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was coming down the kitchen stairs, and saw the prisoner running along the passage from the pantry—I ran after him into the street, and called "Stop thief"—he had a bundle under his arm, in a red handkerchief—I saw several people after him, and returned to the house—he was brought back by a policeman with this property—I missed four half-crowns and two pence, which were mine—they had been on the kitchen dresser.</p>

I was on duty about half-past twelve—heard a cry of "stop thief," saw the prisoner running, ran after him, and saw Bosworth stop him—I took him in charge, and took him down the area—I had not seen anything thrown down there—I found this plate there (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this red handkerchief which was open, and the plate all exposed under the area window—I asked the prisoner if he knew anything about it—he said "No"—I searched him and found half-a-crown and a halfpenny, but having the plate I could not search him thoroughly—I took him to the prosecutrix's house, and then to the station, searched him again, and found three half-crowns, a penny, and a halfpenny.</p>

               <p>Which of the prisoners was that? - Floyd; I had seen the clock there when I left the shop.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of the clock? - Four guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>I live in Dartmouth-row; I saw the two prisoners coming down the row, at the bottom of the row there was a coach standing; when they came there, Floyd called out, balt; I thought they were upon no good intent; I was willing to perceive what they would be at, and I watched them; they came past Mr. Wilkinson's door, and returned back again; I saw them both go into the shop; Hawley came out first; I did not perceive that he had any thing of property on him, so I let him go; I waited for the other, and he came out in about a minute, with this clock in his apron; (producing it.) Hawley had got about twenty yards off; I collared Floyd, and asked what he had got there; he said a clock, he had found it behind a shutter place; says I, I know where you found it; and I brought him back with the clock.</p>
               <p>What became of the other? - Another man pursued him, and took him.</p>

               <p>Hawley. That was the first time I ever saw him; I asked him the way, and he said he was a stranger as well as I, and could not tell me.</p>

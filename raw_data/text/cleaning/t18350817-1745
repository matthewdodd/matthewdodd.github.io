                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live in Craven-buildings, City-road. On the 31st of July, about ten minutes before four o'clock in the morning, I was coming up Barbican, going home—I was quite sober—I had three sovereings, a five-shilling-piece, a half-crown, and a shilling in my pocket—it was broad day-light—I saw the prisoner with another man coming after me—as I went along, the other man said, "Good morning, sir; you are out late as well as us, "—I said, "No, I am out early"—he said, "We have been to Westminster, and been in company, and did not know what time it was"—This conversation lasted about two minutes—they came walking on, one on each side of me—I saw both their face, and am quite certain of the prisoner—he then pinioned me—the pri<lb></lb>soner put his arm round me, put his hand in my pocket, took out my money, and ran off directy—it was done in an instant—the prisoner did it all—the other man did nothing at all—both ran down Whitecross-street—the other turned up Beech-lane, and the prisoner down a court which has no thoroughfare, and was caught under a bed in house he ran into—I had called out" Whtch" and "Police"—I only lost a half-crown and a shilling—I thought at first I had lost all my money.</p>

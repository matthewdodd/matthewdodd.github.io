                  </hi>. I am a type-founder, living at No. 14, Skinner-street, Clerkenwell. On the morning of 2nd March, about one o'clock, I was in Holborn—I had been drinking—I was not sober nor yet tipsy—the female prisoner came up to me, and asked where I was going—I said, "Home," and with that I was put on my back—she was not talking to me two minutes—she was not walking with me during that time—I stopped for a moment to answer her, and I was knocked down by three or four men, as it appeared to me from behind—when down, they robbed me of all I had, and gave me a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> as well—I had from a sovereign to 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my pocket—I know it was safe in my pocket when I was knocked down—I felt the male prisoner's hand in my pocket, and I held him—I never let go of him—I was on the ground on my back—I called out for the police, and gave him into custody—I do not know what became of the others—I also missed a pocket<lb></lb>handkerchief, and a knife with a comb in it, from my coat-pocket—my coat and trowsers were very much torn—there are marks of violence on my face now—I have a black eye—I could not open it on Saturday—that was from a blow that was given me when I was knocked down.</p>

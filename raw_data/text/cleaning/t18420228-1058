                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Jones, a milkman who lives in Compton-passage, Clerkenwell—the prisoner was in his service—at a quarter before four o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 27th of February, I came home, and the prisoner was gone—I missed seven shawls and the other articles stated in the indictment—my box was broken open—some of the things are here—they are mine—I missed 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have never been a servant <hi rend="italic">to</hi> her—she asked me to lend her 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to furnish two rooms, and on Wednesday I gave her warning that I would leave on Sunday afternoon—the clothes that she has claimed do not fit her. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> she had been my servant, she came to me on Monday afternoon and did this on the Sunday—I do not let furnished lodgings—it is not true that she gave me warning to leave—I will take my oath these are my clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JAMES WELLINGTON</hi>. I live in Denton-buildings, chapel-street. On Sunday night, the 27th of February, I was driving a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> no. 211—I was in Pantone-street—a man passed towards my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I asked whether he wanted my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "Yes"—he opened my door, and got in—he told me to go on—I went on till I came to the corner of Park-street—he then went into the public-house there, and I followed—I saw the prisoner and another female very much in liquor—the bar maid assisted them out—they got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with assistance—the man then ordered me to George-yard, against the Angel-inn—I drove them there—the other fe<lb></lb>male then got out, and the man ordered me to the new-road—I was going there, and he ordered me to drive to the patriots public-house at the bed of the White Conduit house—they did not go in there, but he went on to the third house from there, and told me to get a light, which I did at that house—I then saw a quantity of silver at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner and the man were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the man picked up the silver—the prisoner held a bag, and the man put the money into it—the prisoner said it was hers—the man of the house then came out, and began to abuse me for knocking at his door and asking for a candle—he snatched it out of my hand—I then told the prisoner if she could not tell me where to go I would take them both <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the station—she ordered me to No. 9, Angel-court—I was proceeding towards there, they called to me to stop at the Rodney arms public-house—I did so, the prisoner wanted a glass of the best rum, and I was to get what I liked—I got a drop of gin, and as I thought she had bad quite enough spirits, I got her a glass of vinegar which I thought would sober her—I demanded ray fare—she broke a glass, and wanted me to drive round high gate till she got sober—i would not, but spoke to the policeman.</p>

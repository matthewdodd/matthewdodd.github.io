                  </hi>. I am a porter and messenger. On the 29th of June, about half-past two o'clock, I was delivering letters in the Hampstead-road</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184007060015"></xptr>
               <p>—I was attracted by a man going into every garden he could find open, with sealing-wax in his hand, and going up to the houses—I was delivering letters at the same houses—I watched, and saw the prisoner lurking very close behind him—a short time after, I saw him join the young man in conversation—I was coming in the same direction as them, and at the corner of Arm wood-street I told them if I caught them in that situa<lb></lb>tion gain I would lock them up—they immediately separated—the pri<lb></lb>soner went down Armwood-street and the other towards London—my business took me down Armwood-street with my letters—I went after him, came up with him, and asked if he had any thing on his person—I think his answer was "No"—I was not satisfied, and commenced searching his coat pockets—I did not put my hand into them, but felt outside—he pulled out of his trowsers' pocket a sovereign and some silver—I pulled his hat off, and saw a handkerchief with something wrapped up in it—I took hold of it—he immediately ran away—I pursued, calling out, "Stop him"—he was stopped at the top of Armwood-street—I sent a man for a policeman, but no one came, I took him down to a public-house at the corner of Park-street, where he made a struggle and nearly succeeded in getting away—three policemen came up and I gave him in charge—the handker<lb></lb>chief contained a pair of sugar tongs, a knife and fork, and a spoon—when I saw him with the other man they were about a mile from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's house, which is on Downshire hill.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Ewen Cameron.</p>

               <p>Q. Were all these articles in this indictment in the trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they lost? - I am the groom; I was driving through St. Paul's Church yard last Tuesday was a week, a one horse chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this box that contained all these things? - It was strapped behind with two straps, not patent straps, and one of the witnesses called after me, John Hayes, and said I had lost my trunk. I turned back and went into Mr. Baylis's, the linen draper, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and there I saw my trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the trunk been opened when you saw it there? - It was open when I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was done with it? - It was given to the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman. As I was coming home from the other end of the town, coming up Ludgate hill, I heard a whistle, between seven and eight in the evening, looking about I saw a chaise going along something hanging underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark? - It was. I observed something under the chaise, which I supposed to be a basket; and behind was a trunk, and at the same time I see the prisoner run by, on the curb, on the foot way, and my fellow servant says to me, let us go after him, and see what he is after; his name is Joseph Thomas; and the prisoner made up to the chaise, and my fellow servant went and took hold of him, and sent me to call the chaise, and I went and stopped the chaise, and returned back to Mr. William Baylis's door; I gave notice to the groom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any things done to the trunk at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the trunk? - Coming up Ludgate-hill, behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did you observe any body take it from behind the chaise? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170227"></xptr>Yes, I observed William Morgan take it from behind the chaise; I see him when he had the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ran by the curb had he the trunk then? - No. The prisoner made up to the chaise, and took the trunk from behind the chaise; I see him do that.</p>
               <p>Q. After he took the trunk from the chaise, did you at all lose sight of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the trunk? - He let it fall to the ground just as he was laid hold of, in the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the trunk? - It was carried into Mr. Baylis's shop, and my fellow servant had hold of him; he let it fall to the ground by the weight of it, and rose with it again.</p>

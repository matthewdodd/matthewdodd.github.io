In May last I entered into an agreement with the prisoner to occupy my house at Windlesham—I have a copy of the agreement by which he became a tenant of Windlesham-hall, at the rate of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for six months, or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months—he took pos<lb></lb>session of it on the 5th of May—I deposited my plate in a cabinet in my library, in the prisoner's presence—it was a large high cabinet standing against the wall—there were about forty-six forks, seventy-six spoons, and the other articles mentioned in the indictment—I considered the whole of it to be worth about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there were two articles of presentation plate, which had my name in full length on them, which were also in the cabinet—I went abroad with my family, and returned in July—I then went to France again, and on my return, after some communication with the pri<lb></lb>soner, I went down to Windlesham on the 13th of September—I found the prisoner and his family there—the prisoner said to me, "I am sorry to say an unpleasant circumstance has occurred, I observed some person had been attempting your cabinet, and I therefore thought it necessary to take out the plate—I sent it to London, and deposited it in the hand of a friend"—I had never given him the slightest authority whatever to take any of my plate and pawn it—I had communications with him from time to time on the subject of the plate—I afterwards found it at Mr. Kir<lb></lb>wen's, a pawnbroker, in the Strand—it is here now.</p>

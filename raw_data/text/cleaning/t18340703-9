            . I am a policeman. On the 19th of June I was coming down the middle of the Portland-road - I saw a man who has escaped beckon, and Black, who was at the corner of Devonshire-street, crossed from one side to the other, and looked into a cabinet-maker's shop - I followed the other man up Carburton-street - Black turned back and went up Portland-road - I turned back and met the two prisoners - when they saw me they turned short back, round by a dead wall, out of my sight - I ran to the top, and Palmer informed me that they were gone up Osnaburgh-street - I pursued to Frederick-street, and somebody had stopped them there - I took hold of Black - he had his hat doubled up in his arm, with part of the plate in it - I took it from him, and delivered it to Dringle - when I collared Robinson I asked what was under his arm - he said,"What is that to you?" he took it from under his arm, and threw it up in the middle of the street - it was a paper parcel - it was picked up and put into the hat with the other - Dringle walked with me to the station-house, and there I searched Black - he put his hand in his pocket, pulled out some more plate, and threw it on the table with the rest - I produce it - I found a pair of scissors, a knife, and latch-key on Black, and a latch-key on Robinson.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE TODD re-examined. I have not the least doubt of these being master's property - I know them very well - they are not marked - I only know them by their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030013"></xptr>general appearance - I have two spoons which were left in the kitchen, and they are the very same pattern and every thing - I know nothing of the scissors - here is a cheese knife, which I know by a scratch on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the policeman point out the scratch to you? A. I have washed it repeatedly and know it - I observed the scratch repeatedly before - I knew Robinson before - he used to come backwards and forwards to the house as a porter - his wife was servant there before me, I believe.</p>

               <p>Black's Defence. I have been the dupe of Robinson - he prevailed on me to join in the business, and in an unguarded moment I consented to his wishes - I was never accused of any thing in my life before - his offers to render me different services induced me to place confidence in him- I knew nothing of his intention, till two hours after he says the offence was committed - I trust the character I have always sustained will weigh in my favour - I do not deny participating in the offence, but I have been made the tool of Robinson.</p>
               <p>Robinson. Instead of my leading Black into it, he led me into it - as he speaks against me, I think it right to speak against him.</p>

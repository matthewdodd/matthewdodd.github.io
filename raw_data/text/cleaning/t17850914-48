               <p>I know nothing of the feathers nor the prisoner, she came to offer them for sale through poverty and distress.</p>
               <p>When did you buy them? - I do not know the day, I bought 35 lb.</p>
               <p>What did you give for them? - Four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140073"></xptr> pence a pound; I had known her for about the space of half a year before that time.</p>
               <p>Did you ever buy any feathers before? - No, not of the prisoner, nor in any respect but in whole beds.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprised? - Not considering her distress, she said they were her own feathers, and told me where she lived, in Heydon court, we catechised her how she came by them; I remember the witness Harvey came to our house, and asked me if the prisoner had sold any feathers, I said yes, I never attempted to hide anything, it is well known I dare say to the prosecutor, and all that has any business with me, that I have not attempted to hide any one thing, because I never buy anything, knowing it to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They were my own feathers, I sold to him last summer.</p>
               <p>Court to Crooke. What does your family consist of? - A wife and one child, and my house consists of creditable lodgers, and I believe my lodgers and neighbourhood in general will give me an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon my word it has a very bad appearance? - Undoubtedly it may have an indifferent look upon me, but I hope it will be rightly considered that it was not meant - .</p>
               <p>Court. It can only be rightly considered if it is considered by you, and that the event of that consideration should be that you never will traffic in this way again: I desire Mr. Clerk of the Arraigns, that you will take down this man's name, and if ever he appears here again, that it may be mentioned, that he has been twice examined here in one day, as a receiver of stolen goods, and you know the punishment of that, to be transported for fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Crooke. I am much obliged to your Lordship, I will readily resign the business, for I find I cannot carry it on without being deceived by crafty people.</p>

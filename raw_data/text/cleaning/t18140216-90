The prisoner, after he had taken the pots, he went up to the bar to pay for what he had had. I ran and knocked my elbow against him; I felt the pots.</p>

            . I was sitting in Mr. Poundfoot's tap-room on the 1st. The prisoner and another man came in together, and they went out together. Mr. Poundfoot hallooed out, stop thief. I went out, and brought the prisoner back again; he had one pot in his pocket, three in his breeches, and one in his jacket pocket. These are the pots.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this public-house with a man, and had part of a pint of porter with him. He persuaded me to go down the yard and take some pewter pots, which I denied. He took five pint pots and one quart pot; he told me to put them in my pockets; he gave me eighteen pence, and when the boy missed the pots he ran away. I humbly beg your lordship to shew as much mercy as you think proper.</p>

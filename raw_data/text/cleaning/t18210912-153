            . I am a watchman. On Monday, the 10th of September, at half past one o'clock at night I was on duty in Leicester-place, and met the prisoner carrying this lead tied in an old apron and an old handkerchief. I asked what he had there. He said a parcel which a gentleman gave him sixpence to carry for him to a coffee shop in Crown-street, Soho. I said, "I must take it and you to the watch-house." - He said the gentleman was coming behind. I said I would leave word with the rest of the watchman to tell him where he was gone. Next day I took the lead to Mr. Woods, it tallied and fitted with two pieces the plumber shewed me.</p>

My father's name is Richard; he does not live there, but we are both proprietors. On Monday morning, the 10th of September, about half past six o'clock, I was looking out of window, and found a considerable quantity of lead cut away from the back of the premises; about two hundred weight was rolled up, and the rest taken away. It was safe the night before between six and eight o'clock; it was the covering of an out-building. I sent to

            . I am a plumber. I took the lead from Mr. Thomas's roof, and on Tuesday morning the officer brought some more. I compared them, they corresponded exactly in every part. I have no doubt of its being part of the same - it is both cut and torn.</p>

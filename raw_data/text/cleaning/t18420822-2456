I am a coffin furniture manufacturer—my father carried the business on before me to the time of his death, on the 25th of February last—the executors carried it on till the 22nd of March, and on that day I took possession of it on my own account—the prisoner had been in my father's employ, and then I took him at a salary of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it was his duty to carry on business at a house in Compton-street—he conducted that branch of my business—he entered in a book the money he received for things sold, and he had to collect money from persons out of the house, and to enter that separately—he never accounted to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as received from Mr. Douglas, on the 16th of May, and there is no ac<lb></lb>count of it in the book—he never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received on the 27th of May, and on the 6th of August of Mr. Butler—in consequence of some other matters, I directed him to be spoken to by Mr. Nonie, on the 15th of August, and he was taken into custody on the 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live in High-street, St. Giles's.

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Price. In consequence of some other transactions, I spoke to the prisoner about his account on the 15th of August—this book of his was before me—I asked him whether it con<lb></lb>tained all the money he had received—he said, "Yes"—I have looked through it to see if it contains these three sums mentioned in this indict<lb></lb>ment—there is no entry of any of them—here is a settlement at the end of the week after the 16th of May, at the end of the week after the 27th of May, and at the end of the week after the 6th of August—there is a ba<lb></lb>lance on the week after the 6th of August, but that does not contain the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Butler.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of settling the book with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not go to demand money of the prisoner—I asked him about it—he generally brought the book down on Monday mornings, and took it away with him—I do not recollect one instance when he left it—he has never complained to me about his accounts being irre<lb></lb>gularly kept, to my knowledge—the book was never kept from him, to my knowledge—I had nothing to do with the book—I do not know of any bill transaction between customers of the prisoner and my master—I never knew my master to discount bills for coffin-makers at the instance of the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner never mention to you about the irregularity of Mr. Price's accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might have said something—he did say some<lb></lb>thing at one time about one trifling thing, but I cannot tell what it was—it was of no consequence—I cannot say whether that was in old Mr. Price's time or young Mr. Price's—I believe the prisoner has taken a house near my master's, on his own responsibility—this case has been got up since we knew that—we never had any suspicion of him previously, but found his accounts regularly kept.</p>

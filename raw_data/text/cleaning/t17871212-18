               <p>I am wife of Robert Trotter of Norfolk-street, in the Strand; he is a <rs id="t17871212-18-viclabel106" type="occupation">Taylor</rs>

               <p>MARGERET JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to our house with an old lady that she had lodging with; her name is Duffey; and she asked me if I wanted two silver spoons; she said they were in pawn at Mr. Dixon's; they were pawned singly for eighteen pence a piece; I gave the old lady half a crown and sixpence to fetch them; and she went and brought them.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Duffey pretend to have any interest in these spoons? - No; I had a child in my lap; and she said she would fetch them; the prisoner said she was very much distressed; I have seen her up and down our Court; but never knew any thing of her; the prisoner said they were her property; I asked her, three times over, if they were her own, and she said yes; she said she would take 4 s. for them; and I gave her a shilling more than the half-crown and the six-pence. (The spoons deposed to by the mark R. E. T.) I am very sure they are mine; these are the spoons I missed a day or two after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Trotter. Do you know what sort of character she bore? - I have heard Mrs. Forster say, she had a very good character with her.</p>

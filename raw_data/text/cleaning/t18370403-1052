                  </hi>. I live in Westborn-street, Pimlico. James Howard has lodged with me eighteen months—the prisoner came, on the 13th of March, and asked if I had a lodging to let—I said I had half a bed—I showed him the, room, and told him it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said he was an engraver, and worked in Piccadilly, but his friends lived at Putney, and be wished to get lodgings half way—he came that evening, and on the Tues<lb></lb>day morning James Howard's things were lost—when I went down the door of the prisoner's room was open, and no one answered—I went in, and saw a pair of stockings anda handkerchief on the ground, which I had pot into the shirt the night before—I then found Howard's box was open—I had seen it safe the night before—Howard did not sleep there that night; he was gone out for a week—the prisoner slept alone that night—the door had been shut at seven o'clock, and it was opened in a few minutes—the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken on Good Friday—he was knocking at a door in Riding-house-lane—I stopped, and heard him inquire for lodgings—I passed him, and saw the policeman, and told him, and he stopped him—I asked if he knew me—he said, no, he had never seen my face before, and never knew where Pimlico was, and I must mind what I said, as it was a very wrong thing to take a man on a false charge—when we were going to the station-house he asked what I had lost—I said he was the best judge of that—he said he would make the property good sooner than be exposed in the paper.</p>

On the 13th of March the prisoner came in the evening, about half-past seven o'clock—he knocked at the door—I went answered it—he said, "I believe I have taken lodgings here to-day?"—I asked him in, and gave him the paper—he said he was an engraver, and wanted lodgings about half way to Putney—he conversed nearly an hour—a friend came in, and he took a candle and went to bed—he had been shown the room, and knew the way—I had been in the room at seven o'clock that evening, and saw a box of mine—it stood on Howard's box, and his box was quite secure—on the following morning I went out at half-past six o'clock—the room door</p>

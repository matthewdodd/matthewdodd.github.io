On the 3d of April I went out; on my return, at a quarter after twelve at noon, I found the street door open; I locked the door and went into the back room; when I had been in about three minutes, I was going out in a hurry, I met this man coming out of the shop; he had unlocked the door; he was going into the street; he had got in in my absence; do you sell knives? says he; no, my friend, says I, I sell no knives, what brought you into the shop? he said he saw no one in the sho p; I looked at him and saw his hand down by his side; he was shifting it; I laid hold of his hand and found the five spoons in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>
               <p>Molloy. I do not know; I left them at Justice Sherwood's; they are Irish made spoons.</p>
               <p>Court. They may as well be in Ireland as in the hands of the Justice.</p>
               <p>Molloy. I know they were my spoons; he put the spoons in his mouth cross-ways, and laid hold of me, and gave me a blow in my mouth; then he took the spoons out of his mouth again, and I took them out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon them?</p>
               <p>Molloy. Yes; there was the Irish mark and my name on the back of every one.</p>

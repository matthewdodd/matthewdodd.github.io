I am a traveller, and live in Paddington-street—between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday, the 3rd of May, I was near Well-street—I went to a public-house to take my orders—Bourke came in, and said if I would come to her house, she would give mean order—I went with her to Well-street—she took me to a public-house, and tried to get some orders, and then asked me to give her some<lb></lb>thing—I said I would give her 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of gin—she then said, if I would go to her place, I might get an order from the landlady—I went up stairs with her, and Norris came in, and took my watch, which was on the mantel-piece—I do not know what induced me to put it there, but I did—she gave it to Ward, who came into the room, and Bourke held me, that I could not run after him—I told Bourke I had no objection to stop with her if she was not married, but there was nothing improper between us—the watch has not been found.</p>

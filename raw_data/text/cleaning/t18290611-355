               <p>JOHN MURREY. I am a letter-cutter, and live at Westminster. On the 30th of May, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I was near <placeName id="t18290611-355-crimeloc1861">Furnival's-inn, Holborn</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. Murrey gave me information - I saw three persons together; I took Rosetta, and the third ran away - I gave Rosetta to the witness, and followed him up Union-court, into George-alley, but he got away; in the mean time, the prisoners were taken to the watch-house; I was beset by twenty bad characters in George-alley, and I believe if I had not made my escape, I should have been killed.</p>
               <p>GILMORE'S Defence. I was coming home - I was taken hold of, and shoved into the watch-house; I was searched, but nothing found - I never saw this prisoner in my life.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Rosetta a good character.</p>

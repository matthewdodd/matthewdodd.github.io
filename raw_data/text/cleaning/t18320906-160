            . I am a partner in Coutts'<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060073"></xptr>banking-house, and was there on the 2nd of August - my attention was drawn to this cheque, purporting to be drawn by Mr. Paxton; I went to the prisoner after the cheque was shown to me, and told him a difficulty had occurred respecting payment of the draft, and begged he would sit down till it was cleared up - he followed me immediately to a chair, which I pointed out inside the counter; I do not recollect his making any answer - I then desired Mr. Partride to send for Mr. Paxton; the porter was sent for him, but Mr. Robinson, his clerk, came, and made a communication to me: after remaining on his seat about twenty minutes, the prisoner was taken into another room; the door between that and the room I was in was always open; I happened to look into the room, and saw him emptying a small phial into his mouth, the contents of which he had almost drank before I saw him; I do not think he had had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Robinson - it was about half an hour after he presented the cheque; I sent him to an apothecary close by, who gave him an emetic, which proved effectual; the cheque was placed in my hands by Mr. Partridge: I believe that produced to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he sitting for the first twenty minutes? A. In a room within the office, not in the banking-house; there were two clerks in that room; I took the cheque in my hand when I asked him to sit down: I then gave it back to Mr. Partridge; I believe he parted with it afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you compare it with other cheques? A. Yes, with five or six - it was under my notice about five minutes; I have no doubt in my mind that this is the cheque.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the Police. On the 2nd of August the prisoner was brought to the station-house, Covent-garden, on this charge - I received the cheque the following morning from Mr. Colthurst, one of the firm, in Mr. Partridge's presence; Mr. Paxton marked it at the time - I had a conversation with the prisoner; I cautioned him that I was about to put a question to him, and that he had no occasion to answer it unless he thought proper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he not at that time in an extreme state of suffering, both in body and mind? A. He was - my opinion is that he was in that state of mind I could not depend on his evidence in any case; I had a second conversation with him about three-quarters of an hour after he was in my custody - I think he was then considerably excited; I told him he was not obliged to answer any questions affecting his case - he said, "Then I suppose I am not obliged to answer at all?" I said, "Certainly not."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When this took place, was he in his senses, so as to know what he was saying? A. I conceive he knew what he was saying, but was certainly considerably excited; he spoke as if he knew what he was about - I told him whatever he said would be used against him on his trial, and that he was charged with uttering a forged bill for payment of 200l., on Messrs. Coutt's; he said, "Oh yes, oh, yes, I did;" I said, "Was it a good cheque?" he said "Yes, it was" - he was at that time crying very much; I searched him, and found this note on him, enclosed in this I envelope - I marked them at the time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The cheque was brought to you next day, and then Mr. Partridge put his name on it? A. Yes; there was no mark on it before, that I am aware of - the prisoner was in a back room at the station-house when I put these questions; they were put within an hour after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. He was under the operation of posion and counterpoison at the time the conversation took place? A. He was - his answers were quick and sharp, but at the same time he was under so much excitement, I could not depend on what he said; the room was full of officers, and one or two surgeons - I asked the questions, because I had the previous assurance of the surgeon that he was in danger, and I thought it my duty to put them; I had no idea of giving evidence at the time; I certainly considered if he survived I should have to give evidence; I put them from a sense of duty, considering him in danger, and that crime might attach to other persons.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he make any statement to you before you cautioned him? A. No; he answered as if he understood my questions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you had a very good opinion of the prisoner, and recommended him to a situation? A. I spoke to a person to give him one, in consequence of Mr. Watts speaking well of him.</p>

            . I am a stockbroker, and live in Tokenhouse-yard. The prisoner came into my service the middle of March, 1830, and remained till the time in question - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his handwriting; this note, and the envelope, appear to be in his writing; I believe them to be so - the body of the cheque seems to be the same hand-writing; the signature and all the written part of the cheque, I believe to be his writing; I saw him at the station-house about six o'clock on the evening he was taken - I held out no inducement or promise to induce him to say any thing to me - the first question I put to him was, where he had got the cheque, it being a printed one; he told me it was one remaining cheque in an old cheque-book, which was put away with my old books in my office - I asked where he had written it; he said he wrote it at his desk while I was washing my hands in an inner room - I had not sent him that day to Messrs. Coutts'; I beg to add, he was not my clerk, but my office boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he not been above two years with you? A. Yes, he bore a very excellent character - he was about fifteen years old when he came to me.(The note produced was here read).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant, at Irongate-wharf, Padding<lb></lb>ton, and No. 108, Edgeware-road; Bowden was in my employ. On the evening of 10th Oct. I gave him directions to go to Mr. Jones, my lighter<lb></lb>man, at Horsleydown, and take twenty-two quarters of oats to a customer of mine at Notting-hill—that would be forty-four sacks—I never knew Bodding<lb></lb>ton, nor had any dealings with him, nor authorized any persons in my employ to have dealings with him—on 11th Oct. I was sent for to the Westminster Police-court, and this sack of oats was shown to me—these sacks were new to me; they had originally been hop-saekt, and I had them turned into corn<lb></lb>sacks—I gave Bowden twenty of them the night before—the valve of these oats is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they are Archangel oats—this is my sack.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, B</hi> 11). On 11th Oct., about twelve o'clock, I was on duty, and saw Bowden with a wagon near Westminster Abbey, going towards the Horseferry-road, in an opposite direction to Notting-hill—I followed him about half a mile—he stopped at the corner of Peter-street, about fifty or sixty yards from Boddington's—he left the wagon there, and went to Boddington's shop—the wagon was out of sight of the shop—Bod<lb></lb>dington is a baker, and deals in corn—Bowden stopped there two or three minutes—he came out and took a sack of corn off the wagon, and ran with it to Boddington's shop—I was obliged to run to keep op with him—he went directly through the shop—there is a loft at the back to which you go up by a ladder—I followed Bowden—Boddington was up in the loft; I had known him for eight or nine years—when Bowden was at the bottom of the ladder Boddington said, "Bring it up here"—I went to the bottom of the ladder and I could see them both—when Bowden got up, Boddington said, "Put it down here," and he caught hold of the sack to help it off his shoulders—I heard Boddington say something which I did not distinctly hear—I heard the words "much" and "last"—I thought he said, "I cannot give you so much" for this as for the last"—I went up and the sack was on the floor—I consider that Bowden saw me before I got op, because his face was towards me; he saw me when I got up at all events, but Boddington's back was towards me—I asked Bowden, who authorized him to bring the sack of corn there—he said no one; that he ought to have taken it to Notting-hill—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing it, and Boddington for receiving it knowing it to be stolen—I said, "I have seen that game going on for some time"—I had seen the cart stop there before, and Bowden go to Boddington's, and bring out empty sacks, and I have seen Boddington and him coming out of public-houses—when I told Boddingtou I should take him for receiving it knowing it to be stolen, he said he had not received it—I said, "You have; I heard the conversation"—he said no more—I took them both—I afterwards took the delivery notes from Bowden—there were forty-three sacks of oats in the</p>

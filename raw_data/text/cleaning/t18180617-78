            . I live in Lucas-street, St. Luke's. On the 27th of May, I spent the evening at the Swan, public-house, in the Strand, and was returning home about nine o'clock at night - I was the worse for liquor.

            . I am a constable. On the 27th of May, about half-past eight o'clock, I saw the two prisoners in the Strand, about three hundred yards from Templebar. They followed a gentleman; I suspected them, and followed them through Temple-bar - They then left that gentleman and followed another, crossed over, and came up the street again on the right-hand side. When they got to the Bolt in Tun they met the prosecutor, who appeared to be in liquor - They immediately turned round and followed him. I saw Bruce go up and try his pockets - He put his hand in, and pulled the handkerchief out about four or five inches: Rothburn immediately closed up to conceal him. Bruce then took the handkerchief out, and both darted into a court together. I followed, and caught them both. Bruce threw the handkerchief down; I pulled them towards it, and picked it up. Owen came and took charge of them while I went after the prosecutor - I found him in five minutes; he missed his handkerchief, and claimed it when I shewed it to him at the Compter.</p>

Bruce said, "Why do you collar me? I am a tradesman's son, and have done nothing." We took them to the Compter. The prosecutor was brought there and claimed it.</p>

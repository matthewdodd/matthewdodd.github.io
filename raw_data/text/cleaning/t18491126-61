On 7th Nov., about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was at Mr. Dawes' farm there, and saw his foreman Webb—I heard the report of a gun about half-way down Hanworth Little Park—I and Webb went to the park and placed ourselves against a tree—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard footsteps, and saw the prisoners within three or four yards of the tree, I threw my light on them, and started from the tree towards them—(I have known Lovegrove and Allen nine years, and Emmett two years; they live at Feltham)—Allen had a gun—directly I started, he held it up as high as his breast, not to his shoulder, and shot at me—I was not more than</p>

               <p>two yards from him—he missed me, as I was moving about, scuffling with Emmett—it was quite dark; I could not have seen but for my light—Emmett had a short stick which he struck me with, when the gun was pointed—Allen and Lovegrove ran away—Webb began striking me in mistake in the dark, and Emmett, not knowing he was my assistant, said, "Give it them! give it them!"—Webb struck me on the arm, and I let go of Emmett—he got away—I picked up Allen's cap—the prisoners were taken next night—I produce the bark of the tree—here are shot marks in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Dawes, at Sir Frederick Pollock's at Hanworth Little Park. I was with Lawn, heard the gun fired, and went with him to the tree—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour we saw a man about twenty yards off, and two more came up as fast as they possibly could—when they were within three or four yards of the tree Lawn turned his light on, and I saw the prisoners—I had known Allen and Lovegrove five or six years—Allen had a gun—he held it up towards us, but not to his shoulder—it went off—I was between three and four yards from Lawn—Allen and Love<lb></lb>grove walked away—Lawn caught hold of Emmett, scuffled with him, and knocked this stick out of his hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up, and struck Lawn with it by mistake—Emmett called out, "Give it him! give it him!"—he got away—I am satisfied the prisoners are the men.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Did the light cover the whole of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, down to their feet, they stood so close together—when Lawn was struggling with Emmett, his light was hanging to his strap, and I could see the men very plainly—I struck Lawn on the arm and hat—I did not see the gun till I saw the fire come out of it—I saw it directly afterwards—I was three or four yards from the tree, and Lawn about the same distance—I searched under the tree for the shot, but found none—Allen had not his face towards us when he fired; he was turning to go away.</p>

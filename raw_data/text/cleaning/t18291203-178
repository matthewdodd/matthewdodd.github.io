On the 16th of October the prisoner applied to the overseers for relief, and having known him when he was an apprentice, I employed him to nail up some palings and make some rustic chairs for my garden - I bought the tools mentioned new for him to work with at my house, but he was not allowed to take them away - he worked there on the Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, and came on Wednesday morning, the 21st - in the course of that day he went away, and the tools were missed; I have never seen them since - he was taken two or three weeks afterwards; I asked what he had done with the tools - he said he had left them on the premises.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ELLIOTT. I am a servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came on the morning of the 21st of October, but I missed him about nine o'clock - he had given no notice of going; I missed the tools, which I had seen in the coach-house that morning, where he was at work.</p>

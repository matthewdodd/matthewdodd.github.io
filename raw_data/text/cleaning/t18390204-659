                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of police. On the morning of the 31st of December, I was in Sharp's-alley, St. Sepulchre—I met the prisoner about half-past ten o'clock, about seven minutes walk from the prosecutor's, with this part of a looking-glass frame tied up in this pocket-handkerchief—I asked him what he had got—he said, "A looking-glass frame"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he bought it in Petti<lb></lb>coat-lane, with some rubbish—I said I should take him to the station-house, and at the corner of Field-lane, he got his leg between mine, and tried to throw me—I took him to the office, and he was discharged for want of evidence—he was taken again in a week afterwards—I found in his pocket the screws of the looking-glass stand,</p>

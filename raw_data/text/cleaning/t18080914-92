             came to buy some articles in the shop that came to five shillings and sixpence, and when he was gone, the prisoner only gave half a crown. When any body serves the customers, we have a boy that takes the money from us; then the prisoner took eight shillings of a lady. Instead of taking the thirteen shillings and sixpence to the book, he only took ten shillings and sixpence, and only made a check of ten shillings and sixpence in the check book.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you only know that the prisoner gave you half a crown - A. Yes; the prisoner took eight shillings of another customer; he brought me half a guinea, and I gave him half a crown change.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with Mr. Green in the capacity of a shopman twelve months, and finding that he did not settle with me, I was under the necessity of purchasing a few articles. I kept back that money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Were there any wages due to him - A. He never asked me for any wages; about a fortnight before this I asked him if he wanted any money; he said money was acceptable at all times; I meaned to pay him that week he was taken up. I have paid all my servants wages up to Midsummer.</p>

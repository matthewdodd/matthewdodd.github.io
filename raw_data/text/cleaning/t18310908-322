            . I am eleven years old. I went to the Park with my two little brothers; the keeper would not let us in, because we had pinafores on, and I was not old enough to mind them; the prisoner came up, and told us to keep inside the Park; I said the keeper would not let us; she spoke to him; she then came and told me to go round to the Horse-guards' gate; she was then within a few yards of Storey's-gate; she gave me a penny, and said, "Go and get a penny worth of apples" - I had some playthings and an apple in my lap; she said, "That apple is not large enough for you, go and fetch a pennyworth;" I went, and when I came back she was gone, and my two brothers too - I was not gone long; I said, "William and Johnny don't go away"- she said, "No, I'll take care of that;" one of them is six and the other four years old.</p>

            . I live in Tothill-street, Westminster. From Wednesday to Friday I was in the greatest distress about my children, and out day and night; I found one in the workhouse in Shoe-lane, and the other in Shoreditch workhouse - the youngest had a pinafore over him, with his little trousers; the other had scarcely any thing on - I took my daughter, Caroline, to the prison; all the female prisoners were turned into the yard; she pointed the prisoner out among twenty, immediately; I have not found their clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not strip the children, or take any thing from them - I was at Red-Lion-square in the evening from half-past four o'clock.</p>

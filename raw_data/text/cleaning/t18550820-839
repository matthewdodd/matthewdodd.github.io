                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at Vauxhall On Saturday night, 25th July, I was going along Albert-street, London-road, a little after 12 o'clock—I saw a woman, she asked me if I wanted to go with her—I said, "No," I had a wife of my own—she made a sort of screech, and the prisoner and a tall man ran across the road—the tall man held his hand over my mouth, and his other hand at the back of my head—the prisoner struck me over the eye, and kicked me—I had a load with me in a basket, sugar and tea and other things, and I fell down—the man still held his hand over my mouth, that I should not halloo—the prisoner kicked me before I fell down—when I was down the other man held his hand on my mouth, and the prisoner kneeled on my knees—I was lying sideways on the ground—the prisoner said, "Let us do for him"—the woman searched</p>

I heard some one calling "Police!" and ran into Albert-street, and found the prisoner; the prose<lb></lb>cutor was in the act of getting hold of him—the prisoner was holding up his hands to prevent it—the prosecutor said the prisoner had knocked him down, and robbed him of 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and that there were two others, a woman and a taller man, and the tall man held his mouth while the others robbed him—the prisoner told him to calm himself, and said he knew nothing about it—the prosecutor appeared sober, but he was very weak, and was bleeding from the eye—he said, he had been kicked in the thigh by the prisoner—he went back after his basket—I did not see the basket till he brought it.</p>

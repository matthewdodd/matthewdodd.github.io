            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 21st of November, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the morning, I came out of my house in Dog-row,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050090"></xptr>and saw the prisoner and another pass, the prisoner had the copper on his head; I thought he had not come honestly by it, and followed them five or six hundred yards, and got in front of them, the other man said, "What do you want." I said I am an officer, and suspect you have not come honestly by this copper - I wish to know where you got it from, and where are you going to take tt;" the other said to the prisoner, "Never mind any b - y officer, you follow me" - he walked off, I seized the prisoner with the copper, and gave him to a person to hold, and followed the other, and when I seized him, he threw a ripping chisel at me, and knocked me down, and ran off, I could not pursue any further; he was secured, and brought back to me; I found the key of the stable in his pocket, with some skeleton keys; I handcuffed them both together, and within one hundred yards of the watch-house, he slipped his hands out, and escaped. I was wounded in the head and temples with the chisel, and could not follow. My house is five minutes walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

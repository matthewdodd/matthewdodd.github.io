            . My father keeps a general sale-shop. On the 31st of October, at half-past two o'clock, I was going up <placeName id="t18291203-26-crimeloc136">Frith-street</placeName>

               <p>THOMAS MAPLE. I am coachman to Mr. Charles Bell. I was turning from Frith-street into Soho-square, with his pheaton; Cutmore told me the coat was taken - I turned, and missed it; I drove on in the direction he said the prisoner had gone - I saw the prisoner in the custody of the beadle, who had this coat, which is my master's.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I saw the carriage as I was crossing Frith-street, about half-past two o'clock; I went to Bateman's-buildings, where I live, and knocked at my door - while I was waiting the prisoner ran by me with this coat; I followed - he ran into a shop which was shut up, but the door was open; he dropped the coat on the floor - I took him and the coat, which was about two yards from him; he was about one hundred yards from the carriage when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to dinner - I saw this coat in the road, and took it up; I saw no carriage.</p>

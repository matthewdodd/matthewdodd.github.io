            . I am the mate of the Gravesend-boat; Mrs. Hopkins and her two pieces came with me from Graveshend to Billingsgate; about half after eleven o'clock in the evening, it being a late hour I thought proper to help the ladies over the craft; I took a small box and bundle out of the lady's hand; I assisted these two young ladies over the vessel; Morgan was standing there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him - A. No, he asked me if he should assist me with them; I thanked him for his kindness; I told him I did not want his assistance; I assisted the two ladies on shore, then I returned back to the old lady, taking her bundle and pattens out of her hand; when I came to the shore again Morgan was there, the second-time; he asked me the second time if he should assist me; I told him no; he took the bundle out of my hand, having the lady in my hand; if I had let her go as she was stepping up, she must have fell back in the boat, which lay upon the vessel's deck; at the same time he took the bundle, he gave it to somebody else; after the lady enquired for the bundle, I asked Morgan what he had done with the bundle; he told me he knew not, he gave it to somebody that stood by; I told him he knew what he had done with it; I insisted upon knowing; he said he did not know, he gave it to somebody that stood by; I left Morgan with some people while I called my master; I then gave Morgan in charge and took him to the watch-house.</p>

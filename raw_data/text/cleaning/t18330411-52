I met the prisoner in a public-house on the morning of the 24th of March, about five o'clock, when I went to have a pint of beer - I had a sovereign and 1s. 6d. in my pocket; the prisoner stood on my left - I did not feel her hand go into my pocket, but I felt it drawing out, and I made a grasp at her hand - she got it from me, and ran out; I followed her out, but was knocked down by three or four persons, who used me very cruelly - she was afterwards taken by the officer; she said "Give the man his money, it is all there but one 6d., which I have spent."</p>

             (Police-constable F 8). On Sunday morning, the 24th of March, I was informed a man had been robbed, by a girl who had crossed the road - I followed the prisoner, and took her in George-street - I saw she was trying to swallow something; I took hold of her throat, and put my other hand to the back of her head; a sovereign and a shilling dropped from her mouth, which were taken up and given to me - she desired me to give it to the man, and said it was all she had taken from him, except 6d., which she had spent.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES MURNANE. Q.Was the 6d. expended in drink, of which you partook? A. No; it was not spent to my knowledge - I had not been in company with her.</p>

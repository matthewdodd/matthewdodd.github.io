                  </hi>. I am a watchman to Mr. Field, at Upper Marsh, and live in the parish of Lambeth—it is a house let out in apartments—I live on the ground—floor. On the 27th of June, I left it at ten o'clock at night, and fastened it all up safe—the windows and all were fast, and the door double locked—I took the key with me and went to Mr. Field's premises to watch—I returned about two o'clock, as I was fetched—I found the panels of the door broken in—my trunk was open, and my clothes all lying in different places—I cannot say whether I had left the trunk locked or not—I lost a promissory note for £31. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I have never got, and a silk handkerchief—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brook's—court, Upper Marsh, and occupy the first-floor of the same house as the prosecutor. About two o'clock on the morning of the Coronation day, I was not in bed, I heard a great noise in the passage—I opened my door and asked if anybody was there—nobody answered—I had my candle in my hand—I went down and found the street-door wide open, and saw the panel broken in by the side of the wainscot of the prosecutor's room—the street-door is locked up at ten o'clock at night—not left on the latch—I put my head into the panel of the wainscot, where they had broken in, and inquired if anybody was there—nobody answered—I went to the steps of the door and called out <hi rend="italic">"Watch</hi>, and "Police," and the prisoner was the first who jumped through the broken panel—I had seen him once or twice before, going up to a person who lived on the second-floor—there were two men in the prosecutor's room—the other escaped—I am sure the prisoner was the first who came</p>

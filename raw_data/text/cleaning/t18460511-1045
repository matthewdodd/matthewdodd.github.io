                  </hi>. I am master of the barque <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire</hi>, On the 14th of Feb. I received ten sovereigns for a cheque—I was afterwards in Grace-church-street—I met with a stranger, who got into conversation with me, and we went into the Bell tavern, to an up-stairs room—while we were there the prisoner came in—he asked me if I had been to New York—I said I had several times—he said he had lived there with an old gentleman for several years, who had died, and left him a consider-able amount of land and some money—he asked if I wanted a little money to speculate with—I said it would be of no use to me—the stranger who was there said I had better take a little—I said it was no use to me, without it was a large amount, that I could lay out in shipping—the stranger said he was in the butter and bacon line, and he would take a hundred or two of him—he got up and said he would go and get a receipt—he was going out, and beckoned to me—the prisoner said to him, "You are not going?"—he said, "Yes, but I will be sure to return," and be <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> his purse into the prisoner's hat—I was going out after the stranger, and the pri-soner said to me, "Will you be sure to return?"—I said, "Yes," and I foolishly did the same with my purse—I threw it into the prisoner's hat—it contained the ten sovereigns and two fourpenny-pieces—the stranger then called me to the bar door, and said, "You had better take a hundred or two of him"—I said I would rather not—after some time I went Back to the room, and the prisoner was gone, and all was gone—I did not see the prisoner again till the 7th of April, when I met him in Threadneedle-street—he was coming towards me, and had an umbrella loosely up before him—he saw me, and dropped the umbrella, and crossed to the opposite side—I crossed after him—he went on for sixty or eighty yards, and then down a turning—I called a policeman, and we followed him—the officer took him in the yard of a public-house—he asked the prisoner what he went up there for—he said he had gone up <hi rend="italic">for</hi> a necessary purpose—the policeman said he had run a long way—he had been running—in coming along he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "If I owe you any money I will pay it"—I said, "You and I will talk about that afterwards."</p>

On the 7th of April, about half-past one or two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner running—I saw the prosecutor soon after—he beckoned to me, and I followed the prisoner to Plough-court, Lombard-street—I found him there, stooping down behind some casks—the prosecutor charged him with swindling him of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a public-house six weeks before—he said he knew nothing about it—as I was taking him to the station he told the prosecutor if he owed him anything he would pay him—I found on the prisoner two purses—one of them had a coun<lb></lb>terfeit guinea in it, and the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I found on him a pocket-book, containing two bills of exchange drawn in America, which appeared to be long over-due—he had an umbrella, which he set down outside the station-house door.</p>

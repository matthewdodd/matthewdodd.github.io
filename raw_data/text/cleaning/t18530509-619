I have not done so" (I had seen Mr. Sillem, and heard what had taken place)—I said, "You have, and you have got the certificate"—he put his hand in his pocket, took out a certificate, and attempted to tear it—I took it from him, and also this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which he took out of the same pocket as the certificate, and attempted to tear—I took him to the station, went back to Partridge-court, and found my brother constable there and the prisoner Müller, writing a letter for a woman—he requested us to go out of the room while he read the letter; when he had done that I told him he was charged with obtaining 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by using a forged letter of Dr. Cappell's—as soon as I told him that, he put his hand into the corner of a drawer beside him, and took out this seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is similar to the impression on the certificate—he attempted to throw it into the fire; I caught hold of his hand and took it—I took him to the station.</p>

             . I was playing in Swan-Yard, between six and seven o'clock, on Friday night, when this was done. I saw the Prisoner come and stand at a post first, then he stepped into the door; I said to a boy, that lodges up two pair of stairs, What does

The woman calls her son from play, the Prisoner went back again, and I saw him meddle with the lock; presently he ran out with his arm as full of cloaths as he could hold; I ran after him; the first thing I picked up was this shift, and presently I took up another. Just as he was going to turn by the corner, I picked up a sleeve all dirty, and a piece of a cap. All these he dropped as he ran. While I was taking up the things, I lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Brograve. About the Beginning of June, I came up to London, and took Lodgings at Mr. Egleston's, Tobacconist in Fleet-Street; I pack'd up my Things in a Portmanteau to go in the Country: After I had been in the Country about three Weeks, I look'd for some of my Pocket Handkerchiefs, and I miss'd them; I miss'd three Shirts and five Handkerchiefs. When I miss'd my Shirts, I wrote to Mr. Egleston.</p>

In the Time she was with me she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174609030011"></xptr> took these three Shirts and five Handkerchiefs. When the Gentleman wrote to me, he said, if I could answer to the Maid's Character he would set down by the Loss. Her Master said she was a washing some Handkerchiefs; so she brought up a Handkerchief mark'd B. B. I told her (my Credit was at Stake as well as her's) and I desired she would be free and open, and let me know the whole; she told me, she had pawn'd the Shirts in Eagle-Street; she begg'd that I would let her have Money, and she would fetch them again; so we sent to the Pawnbroker's, and she had pawn'd them in the Name of Clark; she said her Husband used to pawn Things in the Name of Clark, and he had learn'd her the Way.</p>

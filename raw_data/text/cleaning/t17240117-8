That having apprehended the Prisoner. they went to John Martin's, who keeps a little Brandy Shed, and there found the Linnen put wet into the Bottom of a Basket, and Small coal upon it, and that John Martin did own that he had received the Linnen from the Prisoner, to let him stay in the Shop while the Watch was broken up.

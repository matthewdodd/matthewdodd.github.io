             (through an Interpreter). I am a native of the East Indies, and am a sailor; I lodged in the same room with Hope. On this Tuesday evening I saw the prisoner and Hope come into the room; the prisoner took a 5l. note out of his hand by force - Hope only had his shirt on, and the prisoner tore it; he showed the note to two or three people in the room, and then went away with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a friend of Hope's? A. I knew him - the prisoner showed the note to us all; we slept in the house that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner shew the note to 'you all? A. Yes.</p>

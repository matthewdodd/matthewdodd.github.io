On the 18th of May the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge, for stealing a coat, handkerchief, and bag - he said he knew nothing about it, and in about two hours he said he had sold the coat for 6s., and it was gone far enough away; he said next morning that he had pawned it at the corner of East-street, Manchester-square - I found it there.</p>

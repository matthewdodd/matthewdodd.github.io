                  </hi>. I am a lithographer and engraver, at 245, High Hol-born; the business is partly mine, and partly my father's. On Monday, 2nd Sept., the prisoner came to our house—he spoke to me in English—he showed me one of these notes, and asked me what I would do 3,000 of them for—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one that he produced to me—I replied that they would be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and then observing a water-mark, I asked if he wished to have that done—he said, "Yes"—I said that would be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—they were to be lithographed, and to be an exact copy—when I said it would cost 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, he said he did not care much about that; if we would do them at a reasonable price, he did not want to <hi rend="italic">bate</hi> us down, but he wanted them done as reasonably as possible—there are two impressions on the note, made with dies; the prisoner asked me what we would engrave those two stamps for—I said I would tell him next time he called—I told him I should require a deposit—he said he was not prepared then, but he would call next morning with it—I am not certain whether the first time he came he explained the nature of the notes, but he did either the first or second time—he came next day and gave me a sovereign—he then said it was a ticket by which miners or labourers could get anything they wished in the shape of provisions or clothing, and that they were paid by the proprietors of the land—I do not understand the Italian language—he asked when he could see a proof of them—I said in two or three days—he did not give me any name, he said he lived in Brook-street; that is near our house—he mentioned the house in Brook-street, but I forget it—when he came the second time I told him the dies would be a sovereign each—he seemed to think it rather high, and said he would see himself about it—I told him he would probably find somebody in Clerkenwell that would do it for him—I began the work—during the pro<lb></lb>gress of it the prisoner called almost every day during the week, he saw it in progress, and seemed very well satisfied as far as we had gone; he repeated the injunction which he gave us first, to do them well—I communicated with my father on the subject on 3rd Sept., the morning after the prisoner came—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210073"></xptr>
               <p>after he had called several times and seen the work in progress, he produced to me this other note (<hi rend="italic">looking at one for</hi> 60-<hi rend="italic">lire</hi>)—I believe that was on the Thursday; I am not exactly certain of the day, it was about a week after he first came—I had previously shown him a proof of the 5-lire note, as far as it had gone—when he produced this 60-lire note, he asked what would be the price for 1,000 of them printed back and front—I said they would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with the water-mark—he agreed to give that—he did not give any description of that note to me—I did not require a further deposit on that new order; he gave me another sovereign on the old one—he afterwards called to see a perfect proof of the first note—that was on Tuesday, the 10th; he examined it, and said it would do very nicely—he wished me to get on with the other as fast as possible, as he was going out of town on the Sunday—I understood him to say he was going to Birmingham, but I am not very certain about that; it was promised on the Saturday—I have not got the proof I showed him of the first note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a proof of part of the second note that I showed him—he expressed himself satisfied as far as it had gone, and wished it finished, and he would come on the Sunday to see a proof, as he had to go out of town; this is a finished proof—it is a proof from a lithographic stone which I made in pursuance of his directions—I promised that the 3,000 of the first notes should be done on Thursday—he said be would call, but he did not—he came on the Saturday, about eleven o'clock in the morning—he said he had called for the labels which he had ordered—I do not know whether he used the term "labels" or "tickets," but I rather think it was "labels," as he had called them labels before—I said they were ready, and I would fetch them—I went up stairs and brought down a packet containing the 3,000 of the first notes, and delivered them to the prisoner—he opened the parcel and examined the notes—he said some of them were a little pale—he paid me a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he had paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—he took away the 3,000 notes with him in the packet I had given him—before he left he saw a proof of the 60-lire note; he had seen it before, partly finished—he expressed himself satisfied, and said he would call the next day—at that time I was aware that Forrester, the officer, was in waiting in the neighbourhood—I believe my father had been in communication with Forrester on Tuesday, 3rd Sept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-officer of the City of London. I received a communication from Mr. Lee I think on 4th Sept.—he came to the Mansion-house to me, and made a communication to me, and that communi<lb></lb>cation] I made to Mr. Bush—I employed Goddard—he went with me on the morning of the 14th—I was not aware of his going to Mr. Lee's in the interval—he went with me on the morning of the 14th, and we saw the prisoner a little before ten o'clock—he went into Mr. Lee's house, and stopped there I think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he then came out with this parcel—I followed him down Holborn into Warwick-court, and then took him into custody, and took the parcel from him—I took him to Bow-street station—when I got him there, I undid the parcel before him, and told him that they appeared like the parts of an Austrian note—he said that all he knew was that a gentleman in France had given him an order to get these things done, and he supposed them to be lottery-tickets—that was all that passed between us—I afterwards went to his house—he gave his address at the station—it was 13, Little Brook-street, Holborn, the George public-house—I went there, and in his room I found this passport (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and other papers—there are two or three letters addressed to him by his name—I also found two more of these Austrian notes—(<hi rend="italic">These were stated to be genuine notes of sixteen and thirty lire.</hi>)</p>

               <p>that the first intimation on this subject that came to your knowledge, was at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from the elder Mr. Lee: I think that was on 4th Sept.—I had no knowledge that anything of this sort was in progress before Mr. Lee called on me—the communication I received was from Mr. Lee the elder—it was not a communication made to the Magistrate at the Mansion-house; it was a private communication to me—I knew Mr. Lee before—the first time I knew him was, I think, two years ago—I had never put him in motion, or he me on the subject matter of such a transaction as this, before I saw him on 4th Sept.—I became acquainted with him by some persons who were convicted here, going to his house to buy some stones for printing notes—that was in a Russian ease, and he was a witness in the ease—I think it was about two years ago; it was the case of Friedeburgh, I think—Mr. Lee had not given any information on that occasion; I think the information went to Mr. Peachey—I think Lee was the person that made the communication—I did not take any advice of any of the authorities at the Mansion-house before I proceeded to Mr. Bush—I went to Leadbetter first—he has something to do with the Austrian Government, and the Commissioners were over here—we talked the case over, and we went to Mr. Bush together—part of the gentlemen who are here now, were in this country at that time—I cannot tell how long they had been here—I only knew of their being here a day or two before 2nd Sept.—I had not seen anything of Mr. Bush on the subject before 4th Sept., nor had Leadbetter, that I am aware of—Leadbetter knew nothing of it till I acquainted him of it—I had not seen the Commissioners before 2nd Sept.; I understood they were at Birmingham on a case there—I did not go to the Austrian Consul; it strikes me that somebody else went, I forget now—I went to Mr. Bush because these gentlemen came, and wished to have advice about it, and that was the reason I went to Mr. Bush with them—I did not have any communication with Mr. Bush until I had seen the Commissioners—I went to Mr. Bush the next morning after receiving the communication from Mr. Lee—I think Mr. Bush was the first person I saw after I had seen Mr. Lee—if you will allow me, I think I can now recollect—there was a person of the name of Netherclift who came to Mr. Bush to give some information about some man—I only know that, because when I went there I saw Mr. Netherclift; he is an engraver—I never saw anybody on the subject of this transaction until 1 saw Mr. Lee, and then I directly went to Mr. Bush.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know, as at that time you had seen nobody, and knew nothing of the transaction, why you went to Mr. Bush? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because Mr. Netherclift had been to Mr. Bush the day before—Mr. Bush sent to me to tell me about Netherclift, and then I stated to Mr. Bush that there was another man of the name Lee giving the same information—I had the message from Mr. Bush the day before I saw Mr. Lee.</p>

               <p>would advise with him, and he was recommended to the case—when Leadbetter came to me we thought we would advise with the Commissioners, and recommend Mr. Bush to the case—Mr. Bush has these sort of cases, and understands them, and I thought he was a very proper person to advise with—I had no particular reason for going to Mr. Bush, without communicating with my superiors—what I did was for the best—I and Leadbetter and the Commissioners all went together to Mr. Bush to advise with him—I did not see the Commissioners before I went to Mr. Bush—the first time I saw them was on the 5th; I think about two o'clock—they came to the Mansion-house, and then from there to Mr. Bush's—I expected to see them at the Mansion-house through Leadbetter—I think I saw Mr. Bush before I saw the Commissioners: I have not a doubt about it—it was through Nether-clift the thing was mentioned—I went to Mr. Bush the day after Mr. Lee made the communication to me; I do not know what time of the day I went; I think it was in the morning, about twelve o'clock—I did not employ Mr. Bush at that lime—I went to Mr. Bush because he sent to me, because Netherclift had given him the information; and when he had told me that, and Lee gave me the information, I went and told him of the circumstance—I had no communication with any person whatever on the subject of this transaction until Mr. Lee came to me and made a private communication to me at the Mansion-house—I did not have any communication with any<lb></lb>body else until I saw Mr. Bush—it was on the 4th that I had a communica<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Bush, not on this subject—it was perhaps five o'clock; it might be four; I am not sure—I had seen Mr. Lee about twelve in the morning—when I saw Mr. Bush at four or five it was at his own office—I had not had any communication with him before that about any subject of this kind—I went to Mr. Bush because he sent to me when Netherelift was there.</p>

                  </hi>, asq. I am a member of the firm of Bush and Mullens; we are conducting this prosecution. On Monday, 2nd Sept., I received a com<lb></lb>munication from a person named Netherclift; it had reference to the 5-lire note on the table—I immediately took that note, and communicated with Messrs. Rothschild and Co., who are the bankers of the Austrian Govern<lb></lb>ment—they referred me to the Baron Kohler, the Austrian <hi rend="italic">charge d'affairs,</hi> and I went to him immediately—I received an appointment to see the Baron Kohler next day—in the interval Forrester came to me and showed me a similar note, different from that which I held—I had sent to Forrester on the Monday evening to say that I wished to see him—he came next day, and brought Lee, senior, with him—he brought with him another note for 5-lire, similar to that which Netherclift gave me the day before—I saw the Baron Kohler next day, and received directly from him, my first instructions to com<lb></lb>municate with Mr. Develthensal the Commissioner on this case, from whom I have since received all instructions—Mr. Develthensal is one of the twenty-four principal Commissioners of Police for the Austrian Empire, and he is now in Court—he was here, I believe, on a prosecution at Birmingham.</p>

The present note of 5-lire is taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries, and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom. The Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli"—the 60-lire note is, "Como—Number 113,496—1st April, 1849—D—Lombardo Venetian Kingdom—60—Treasury note—Sixty Austrian Lire. The present note of 60-lire, and the amount of the interest due thereon, at the rate of the indication on the back hereof, are taken in payment as hard cash at the central treasuries, and at all the public treasuries of the Lombardo Venetian Kingdom. At the expiration of one year the interest will be paid in cash at the central treasu<lb></lb>ries against the issue of a fresh note. Imperial Commissary Plenipotentiary Montecuceoli"—at the back there is a calculation—the words are a beading to a sort of table on the amount of 60-lire—"Interest will be paid, reckoning from 1st April, 1849, at the rate of 1 centessimo for every two days—on the following table is specified the complete amount due as stated"—I believe these (<hi rend="italic">the forgeries</hi>) to be to the same effect as the others, except that she 60-lire note has nothing at the back.</p>

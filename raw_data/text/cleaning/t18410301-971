                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. I met the prisoner on the evening of the 3rd of March, and asked if she could show me the way to a private lodging-house—she said she could, and was going to show me—as she went along she asked me to give her a glass of gin—I said I had no money—she said, "Yes, you can <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a glass"—I said I had a few halfpence, and gave her a glass—I afterwards went down to Burford's, the pawnbroker, and pawned my watch for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., having no money—I got a crown-piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence—I was counting it in my hand—she asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some ale—I said, "This is every farthing I have got to pay my lodging and all"—she caught the crown-piece out of my hand, patted me on the back, and said, "Never mind, you shall come and sleep with me to-night"—I called out, "Give it me"—she would not, but walked away—I followed her to a house, and she went up stairs—I went up after her—it was a dark place—I said, "Give me my money"—she struck a light, and said, "Come, you shall sleep with me, <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a drop of ale"—I gave her a quart of ale, and she would not give it me then—then a woman came up to the room, and said, "Oh, here is my husband coming, if he sees you in the room there will be a terrible <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—the pri<lb></lb>soner went down, and I after her—she went to the Running Horse public-house—I said, "Give me my money"—she would not answer me—I gave her another quart of ale there—there wa four of them there—they went to another public-house, and had some gin—I followed them, to see if they spent my crown-piece there, but they did not—they brought me a glass of gin to the door—I again asked her for my crown-piece—she walked back to the Running Horse—she saw a man coming, and said, "Oh, my G—, here is my old man!"—Me came and drove her home, and said he would knock my eye out—I followed them to the house, heard them bolt the door, and then I ran off for a policeman.</p>

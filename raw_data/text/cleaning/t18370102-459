                  </hi>. I am clerk to Aaron Levy, of High-street, Rochester. On Thursday, the 15th of December, I was in Oxford market—I came to town with James Gordon and several others—I saw him receive a £5 note and some sovereigns from Captain Kemp, in Oxford he was in the act of handing a £5 note to me, when the prisoner rushed in between him and me, and snatched the note out of his hand—I followed him to the door of the market-house with the deceased, but one of his asso<lb></lb>ciates collared me, and knocked me down, and struck me—he is now in the House of Correction—Gordon is dead, and I attended his funeral—he was discharged from the service for ill health, and through losing his money it brought on his death.</p>

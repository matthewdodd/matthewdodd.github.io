On the 30th of July some metal was found, and on the Monday I was called to look at it; I knew it to be my employer's - it had been in the warehouse with other property; it has our order ticket on it, which it would not if it had been sold - I can swear it was in the warehouse on Friday; we had perhaps fifty rolls of metal in the warehouse - I knew the prisoner; he once lived with an ironmonger, with whom we did business.</p>

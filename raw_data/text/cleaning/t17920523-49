            , the prisoner at the bar; it was between seven and eight at night; the prisoner was going by Mr. Nutt's door, in Old Bethlem; I was coming down the steps; he accosted me by the name of Jem, apparently very drunk; he had been, he said, to Wapping, among some friends, and they had cut him up, which I very readily agreed to thinking he was drunk; he said he lived in Fore-street; I told him I would see him to Spinning-wheel-alley, and then he might lay hold of the rails, and get home safe; when we had got into Moorfields, I said now, good man, you are safe, I will leave you; he held very fast by me, and said no, d - n his e - s, you shall go and drink with me, which I refused; he held me very fast, rushed up against me, and robbed me; I felt his hand in my pocket; I found the deception; he was not drunk; he had no weapons that I saw; he took from me three half-crowns, four shillings, and a halfpenny; I then said, good God, you have robbed me! there was no other violence, than his rushing very hard against me when he robbed me; I did not perceive it till after he robbed me; when I accused him of robbing me, he laughed at me, and asked me to lend him half-a-crown; I told him no, he had deprived me of my money; he then said, d - n my e - s, I will lend you a guinea, if you want it? I said no, I did not want any of his; he walked on to Fore-street and Red-cross-street; he met a girl with a basket of radishes on her head; he gave the girl a penny, and says, d - n my e - s, Poll, here's a penny to get a glass of gin; and again he said, d - n my e - s, Poll, I have done him; I followed him to Redcross-street, and he turned round and said, if you follow me, and say I have robbed you, I will knock you down; I said you had better not; then he said, d - n my e - s, if you follow me, I will charge you with a constable; he went into Mr. Edwards's shop, and I desired Mr. Edwards to hear me; he then, to my great surprise, charged me with an unnatural crime; some other constables came by, or I should not have been able to manage him, he was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230039"></xptr>obstropolous; they searched him, and found my money.</p>

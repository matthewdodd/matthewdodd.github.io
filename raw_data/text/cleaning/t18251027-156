            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 17th of October, I saw the two prisoners in Lisson-street, about six o'clock - Claxton had the copper on his shoulder, and on seeing me he said to the other, "We must make great haste to get this copper repaired, as they are going to washing." Claxton said to me, "You may depend upon it, it is all right - for there is the brother of the person who own's it," and Blatchley said, "It is your time to go away, you may as well go with us:" I said "Very well." In Portman-square, I said to Blatchley, "You are the brother of the person who own's the copper?" "Not I, indeed," says he. - "Yes," said Claxton, "he is." We then went on to Gee's-court, and they knocked at a door; I then took hold of them and said, "This business must be settled at watch-house." A watchman came up, and I told him take hold of one of them - which he did, and they were taken into custody.</p>

            . On the 17th of October, the under watch-house keeper asked me if I knew any one who had lost a copper. I went out and inquired, and got to the premises at James'-street, Lisson-grove. I found the lock and the staple broken off the door which led into the yard, and from there into little James'-street - they had got the copper over the wall, and had left black marks on the bricks.</p>

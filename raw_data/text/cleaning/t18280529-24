            . I am in the employ of Moore, Agnes and Co., warehousemen. On Saturday, the 10th of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon. I went out with a cart load of goods; I drove down the <placeName id="t18280529-24-crimeloc132">Castle inn, Wood-street</placeName>

            . I am a constable. I was coming down Aldermanbury about half-past six o'clock - somebody called, Stop thief! I ran across into Love-lane - the prisoner came up very fast - a porter stopped him just as I came up; I took him back to the inn, and the box was brought there by Stone; the prisoner said a person offered him 1s. to carry it to the White Horse, Cripplegate, and he thought the man was in the yard then - I gave him time to look round, but there was nobody there.</p>

            . I live in Watling-street; but in July last I lived in Spitalfields. On the 24th of July, about nine at night, I went to the <placeName id="t17690906-73-crimeloc388">Adam and Eve at Hoxton</placeName>

I fell asleep, and while sleeping my pocket was picked. The people awaked me, and told me my pocket was picked. There was another man in company. I cannot tell who did it. There was a piece of leather found upon the prisoner; I believe it may be part of my pocket; I did not compare it.</p>

            . I was sent for to the Adam and Eve at Hoxton, where they told me they had got a cut-pocket. I asked who the man was whose pocket was cut; and Mr. Holt came and said he was the man. I looked and saw his pocket was cut. The prisoner sat on his right side, and it was his right side pocket that was cut. I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found four shillings upon him, as also the bottom of Mr. Holt's pocket. Mr. Holt had said he lost four shillings. (The bottom of the pocket produced.) Mr. Holt turned out his pocket, and the piece matched exactly. We found this clasp knife in his pocket. (Produced in Court.)</p>

               <p>I know nothing how it came in my pocket. I set by Mr. Holt; I fell asleep, and was awaked by a noise that Mr. Holt's pocket was cut. The knife was never mine.</p>

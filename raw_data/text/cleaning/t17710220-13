            . On Saturday the 15th of December last, I locked up the house and took up the key: in the morning the maid came up to me and told me somebody had been in my house; I went down into the shop, there I saw the goods in the back compting-house; the holland and table linen were brought forward and laid at the end of the compter. There is nothing to be seen of a night; the shutters all shut up, and the compter locks, so that nothing is to be seen. There was one bundle of Irish in a wrapper, tied up like an handkerchief, laid close by the street door; the street door was pulled to; the goods that lay on the compter were brought out of the back compting-house, which had been broke open; a pannel was taken out, and the box of the lock was unscrewed and taken off. The holland, the muslin, the damask table linen, and the cambrick, were taken out of the compting-house. In the shop there were two locks off, and the side shutters broke; one on the right side, the other on the left: some printed furniture cottons were taken out of one side, and some callico wrappers on the other side, and two compters were broke open: the compter slaps stood up edge-ways: there were printed lawns, figured and corded dimities, silks, and silk burdets; silk and cotton handkerchiefs, silk handkerchiefs, and I think some checks; there were several sprigged muslins and figured lawns and nankeen cloth: the street door was pulled to, the chain taken off, and the lock unscrewed. Some bundles of Irish lay at the street door, and some muslin neckcloths: the irish was removed out of the compting-house, that was all that was left of about fifty pieces; there were about eight or nine pieces; the neckcloths came out of the compters in the first shop. There was a piece of wax candle burning upon a pile of sheeting in the compting-house; it was in a flat candlestick, and a candle in it alight that had been taken out of the kitchen, up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the candle?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was it?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. Rather bigger than a long six; there was about one part out of three left. I found the matches lay in a window of the bed-room up one pair of stairs in the back room. The window they got in at was nailed up quite round; that window looks into Mitre-Court. A pain of glass was taken out of a closet window, but there were iron bars and they could not get in; there were inside shutters to that window, which were pinned with iron pins over night; they were bursted open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the street door yourself?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. No;

               <p>Greenfield. To the best estimate I can make, my stock was worth, before I was robb'd, 2500 l. I cast up my stock after the robbery, and it only amounted to 1116 l. the first thing I did I sent for some gentlemen in the city; we went to Sir

I was at the coffee-house when Mr. Fielding's man came and told me he had a woman with some of my goods; I opened the bundle, and saw they were my property. There were some flower'd dimity, twelve fine damask napkins: she brought one piece of diaper napkin very fine, one large damask table-cloth, two ditto, three remnants of flower'd dimity, one remnant of quilting, one of corded dimity, and two remnants of irish, that she had in her apron; they had my marks on them: the napkins generally come by setts, a table cloth and twelve napkins together. We put the same marks on them. I think they are marked I | U, but the marks are my own hand writing.

The goods were up stairs in trunks and chests; and the old woman was washing in the back room, when I went in, some damask table cloths of mine cut across, and some callicoe wrappers and muslin neck-cloths: she said a person had brought them in the night, and desired her to wash them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue washing these things after the men were at her house?</p>

               <p>Greenfield. Yes; I understood so. I went up stairs and the men shewed me some of the rest of the goods in trunks, chests, and the like: I found, up one pair of stairs I think, three pieces of book muslin, two hundred and seventy-three yards; seventy yards of muslin for neckcloths, two hundred and five yards irish, thirty yards irish, eight yards worked muslin for aprons, two yards scotch cambrick, one hundred yards printed linen, sixty-one yards silk and cotton cloth, gold printed; fifteen yards of dimity.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they in bed?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, I believe they were all together; Siday had his breeches and stockings on but nothing else: these goods were locked up: Siday gave me the key to open the drawers they were in (the goods produced) fourteen yards of holland, nine yards of irish, a remnant of sprig muslin, two yards; and eight neck-cloths; they were washed but had never been worn.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Mrs. Siday said, it was linen she bought; in opening another drawer, where there were some pistols, &amp;c. we found this ticket (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Greenfield. This was a ticket upon a piece of scotch holland sheeting, takes out of the compting-house.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I found a bullet mould, a brace of balls, and two powder horns; the pistols were found in a drawer of a chest of drawers; the ticket was found in the same place; Siday opened most of them himself, except the bottom drawer, where the pistols were: Burch was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200009"></xptr> not taken till the Saturday se'nnight following; we had information where he lodged, in Plough Court, Gray's-Inn Lane: we went up stairs and enquired of Mrs. Burch for her husband; she said he was gone out of town; in about half an hour, or three quarters of an hour he came in; we found a vast quantity of goods there (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Here are two diaper table cloths marked, three damask cloths with my mark, a fine diaper piece of cloth with my mark, one piece of gulix holland with my mark. It will be almost impossible to find the marks of them all, they are in different places: I have looked them all over, most are marked; here is a whole piece of muslin with the mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You mentioned there was a piece of fine diaper cloth, part of which were found at Dunster's?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any part of them, that are parts of a set found in any other people's custody?</p>
               <p>Greenfield. I don't know that there is; there were but two sets of diaper, the other set was in Siday's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taylor. Where did you find these goods?</p>
               <p>Taylor. All in Burch's room; these two boxes were full, the rest were laying about.</p>

We found these three bags of goods there (producing them). Mr. Greenfield looked at the things; she was washing, and said they were his.</p>

               <p>Taylor. A large quantity, more dry than wet; some were found in the two pair, some in the three pair of stairs; there were some in chests, some tied up in other things. One Jennings and his wife lodged there at that time, but not in the room in which we found these things: we told her they were Mr. Greenfield's things; she said, they were left there by a person.

I ask'd what bundle I was to carry: he said, I was to go to his house, and ask for a bundle of table linen that was marked; which was given to me by a woman outside the door, a middle-aged woman. I was to leave the bundle at my lodgings for old Mr. Siday and young Mr. Siday. As I was going along with it Mr. Noakes stopp'd me; I was frightened: I told them I would tell them where I had the linen from: I took them to Siday's.</p>

Then I went after the first time to Burch's lodgings, next door but one to Siday's: Burch was bundling up a great quantity of muslin; she went for a box, but could not get any: there was a box in the room, which he fill'd full, and his wife wash'd a great quantity of the goods and put them on the lines to dry: he said, they were going away upon Mr. Greenfield's account, for they were afraid of being took.</p>

             came up with a box; he bid me put the boxes under the bed. I told him my husband would be angry at his leaving so many things there. There was a little pocket book he left on one of the boxes: after he was gone. I put it on one of the shelves; I never opened it.</p>

               <p>Farr. Yes; I saw him on Christmas Eve last: When I was cleaning the room he came in with three pieces of cloth. Mr. Siday bought them and gave him two guineas for them, and told him one of the pieces would make some shifting for Mrs. Siday.</p>

               <p>Farr. There is a little room that has a sink in it, and another little room. I was then in the one pair of stairs room Mrs. Siday lived in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with her?</p>
               <p>Farr. Only Mr. Siday reading a book: there were three pieces, two together, and a large piece rolled up.</p>

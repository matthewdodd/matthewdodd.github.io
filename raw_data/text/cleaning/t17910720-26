               <p>On Sunday, the 12th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I was rather in liquor, but I was sober enough to know what I was about. Going along Barbican three girls were standing together, and the middle one,

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200037"></xptr>Did you go into a room with her? - No, I did not, I only went into the court.</p>
               <p>Was any other girl in the court? - Not in my company, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What sort of watch was it? - It was a silver watch, with a steel chain, a metal key; I lost besides a guinea and a half crown; I did not perceive her take these things, I missed the things before I left her; my watch was in my fob, and the guinea and half crown in my pocket. I had a pair of nankeen breeches on.</p>
               <p>Was these breeches down at all? - They were not.</p>
               <p>When did you last see your watch? - I felt it in my pocket a quarter of an hour before I missed it.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered it? - It is in the constable's possession.</p>
               <p>When did you last see your money? - I felt it in my pocket in a quarter of an hour before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Was that all the money you had? - No, it was not, I had a guinea and 2 s. besides, which I lost also, but this guinea and 2 s. when I came to the watch-house, I found was put into my coat pocket, by some means or other.</p>
               <p>When you missed this money and watch, had you left the woman or the court? - Neither, I stopped her at the instant.</p>
               <p>Was any other woman near her? - There was another woman came up the court, that she spoke to, but I did not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Was she within her reach? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar the other woman? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Did you see her give any thing to the other woman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not feel the money go at any time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was the money in a purse? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Now we all know that at this time breeches are made pretty tight, could it be possible so any person to take your watch and money out of your pocket, and you not feel it? - So it was, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you was tolerably drunk? - I was the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Pearson. As you was so drunk, how can you know I was the woman? - I am quite sure of it, I was sober enough for that.</p>

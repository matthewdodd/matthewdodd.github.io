             and the prisoner; I had arranged with Fogg before - I asked the prisoner if he had got any shan to sell; he said No, but he had got some out and out couters, meaning counterfeit sovereigns, to sell,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110128"></xptr>which were to be 5s. a-piece; I agreed to take three, which were to be brought to me on Saturday night, the 12th of July - he came that night, but said they were not ready, but he brought them on Sunday morning, the 13th; he brought three counterfeit sovereigns; I gave him two halfcrowns and 7s., and promised to give him 3s. on the Monday - they had paper round them, and he told me to keep them separate; in five or ten minutes after we had left the house, I saw Fogg - I shewed him what I had got - he marked them and returned them to me; the prisoner came about three o'clock in the afternoon, on Monday, the 13th, and I paid him the 3s - I know Alexander Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a lodging-house is your's? A. A sailor's lodging and navigator's; there are married men and women there. I believe - I do not keep a house for the reception of men and women, but if a sailor and a woman come there I am not to ask if they are married - Horne is an acquaintance of mine; I do not know that he has been in trouble lately - I never was in trouble; I never speculated in shans and couters before the 13th of July - the first information I had of this was from Horne, at Fairlop-fair; I knew what a couter meant, it is a very common word; if a sailor comes to sleep at my house it is usual for me to take care of their money - I have had a great deal of money in my hands, and in the morning I returned it to them; they do not find any couters among it, unless they gave them to me - I never saw a bad sovereign in my life before.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames-police. Watts gave me information on the 12th of July, and on the 13th he shewed me three counterfeit sovereigns, which I marked and returned to him; on the 19th I was with Mitchell and Carter on Tower-hill, but I did not take the prisoner untill the 22d of August, at Kent-street, in the Borough - he was sitting at breakfast; I said, "White, I want you, I suppose you know what for" - he said, "Yes, I have heard something about it;" I told him it was for selling bad sovereigns to George Watts and George Horne - he then said he thought so of Horne when he saw him at his house the day before, and what could he do this for? - he said, "Well, I understand they can only give me two years for it," and asked if there was anything else against him; I said not that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of you went to apprehim? A. Four - we had four brace of pistols, and powder and shot; I was more afraid of his dog than I was of him - he told me if his dog had been at home I should not have had him then; I knew Watts before - he did live over the water, but I never knew of his keeping a house until he kept the one he lives in now; he came to me first on this subject, and asked what they were to do - I said I would mention it to the Mint, and tell him; I do not think Horne was with Watts the first night - if he was, I had no conversation with him; I have known Horne five or six months - I never knew that Watts and him went about to catch people with money; I do not believe Watts keeps a house of reception for sailors and common women; I have been in his house, but I saw no woman but his wife.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Fogg open this business to you first? A. About the 11th; I was not in company with him when he went to Watts - I think I have seen Watts at the office before, but it is some months ago - I do not know on what charge; I do not think it was for felony - he appeared against two men who were transported, and gave eveidence against them.</p>

            . I am inspector of coin at the Mint; these sovereigns are all counterfeit, and from the same die.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE WATTS. Q. Are you married? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE HORNE. Q. Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and I gave evidence which was taken down in writing; I was in company with Watts when Fogg went to him - I believe it was on the 10th, but I do not recollect the day; we were not coutering together - you are talking French to me; it is a matter of indifference to me, whether I was ever at the tread-mill; the "lead story and the goose story" have nothing to do with this subject - I believe you are right that I had been about, to endeavour to precure people to sell counterfeit coin; I know Fogg, but he did not know of my being engaged in other things - he never employed me till I met him with Watts, on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You have known Fogg some time as an officer? A. Yes, but he never employed me to purchase bad money before; I saw him twice, once when I made my own purchase, and once when Watts made his - when we went to Tower-hill and met Fogg, it was for Watts to tell him what had passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him on Tower-hill? A. On the 19th of July.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOGG re-examined. I saw Horne on Tower-hill on the 19th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know nothing of Horne before that? A. No, and never knew he had been in custody till to-day - I told him when he came into Court, not to deny it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of them, and never sold them anything of the kind.</p>

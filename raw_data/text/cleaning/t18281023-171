            . I was looking out for the prisoner for twelve months, and at last I found her; I told her Mrs. Webber charged her with stealing five coats - she said she did not steal them - they were to be sent back to have some buttons altered, and Mrs. Webber sent her to pawn two of them, that she got some liquor, and then heard that Mrs. Webber was looking for her, and that made her abscond.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She sent me with one of them to pawn; I had a dispute with her daughter about a warrant - there are pawnbrokers who would come and say that I have often pawned them.</p>

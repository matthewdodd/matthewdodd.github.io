                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Weldon. On the 24th of July, the prisoner came to his warehouse, and said he came for samples of feathers for Mr. Cooper, of Dartford—I gave him some—he came again on the 26th, but on the 25th, we had received an order for two bags of feathers, to be got ready by two o'clock the following day, and the cart would call for them—the order was delivered at the warehouse—I cannot say whether it came by post or not—when the prisoner came on the 26th, he said he was come for the feathers for Mr. Cooper, of Dartford—it was a very wet day, and they were not quite ready—he had a spring-cart at the door—we told him the goods were not quite ready—he said, "I will put up my horse and cart in Farringdon-street, and return shortly"—he came again in about an hour and a half—we told him it was a very wet evening, he had better allow us to send the goods by the carrier as, in consequence, of the rain, they might get damaged—he said he had a good tarpaulin, and he could keep them dry—we lent him some bags to put over them, and he took the goods away—we afterwards received an order for horsehair by letter, to be sent to the Spotted Dog, Strand—I went there with an officer, saw the prisoner, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The order for the feathers was here read, and purported to be signed by F. Cooper, High-street, Dartford, and gave as a reference the name of Mr. Dale, of Wardour-street, Soho.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner at Mr. Weldon's warehouse on the 24th of July. He stated that he had called for Mr. Cooper, for samples of two descriptions of feathers—he represented himself as the foreman of Mr. Cooper—the feathers were then delivered to him—I afterwards went to Dartford—I made particular search in the High-street there, to find out Mr. Cooper, but could find no such person—I inquired at the Post-office and of the constable—I know Mr. Dale of Wardour-street, Soho.</p>

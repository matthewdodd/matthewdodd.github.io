               <p>Court. Have you any other lodgers in the house? - Yes, in the two pair of stairs; I went up with Mr. Davis, he came in and asked me what lodgers I had; I said all were good but one that I did not know, that my wife took in.</p>
               <p>Is this old lady very active? - No, Sir, she goes double, she is three-quarters of an hour going from the top of the house to the bottom.</p>

               <p>Was he or not asleep? - He pretended to be asleep, but it is a thing impossible for him to be asleep, because there was so much noise in the room.</p>

I was coming from Bethnall-green, along Brick-lane, I went across the way to go into Angel-alley, Whitechapel, I came to the cart wheel, and these two men catched hold of me, and said that I had been up to the cart, and said that they would send me for a soldier directly, it was just before dark.</p>
               <p>My witnesses were here all yesterday, and they were to be here to night, but I did not know that my trial would come on.</p>

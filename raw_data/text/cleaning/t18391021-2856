On the 2nd of October, I was in the King William public-house—I do not know where it is—the prisoner Elliott, who was a stranger, came in and asked if I knew a man of the name of William Hodgson—I said I knew him—Elliott said he was his brother—he sat down near me—I asked him to drink—he said he had been a fortnight here and his money was all gone—I said, "Never mind that"—I was very kind to him and took him to a cook-shop and gave him his dinner—we then went to the Barley Mow and had some beer—I laid my head down there, and went to sleep for perhaps half-an-hour or three quarters—a young man then awoke me, and I missed my watch and notes, and the property stated—when I went to sleep Elliott was with me, and I had all the property</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Farmer-street Shad<lb></lb>well. I was at the Barley Mow public-house on the 2nd of October and saw Elliott with two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in his hand, about half-past one o'clock—he asked me if the notes were good ones—I said they were Bank of England notes—he asked for change for one of them at the bar, and they had not change—the boy took one of them out, and brought back 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had made a mistake in the change—he gave the money to Elliott—Elliott told me he was his brother, and he had not seen him for two years—he asked me to go to the White Hart public-house with him and have something to drink—I told him I would not go, and he gave me a shilling—the two female prisoners were in company with Elliott when he changed the note—they were going in and out of the parlour—they all went out, and the women beckoned me to go, but I did not—they turned towards Gravel-lane—Thomas had a man's hat in her hand—Elliott was the last that went out of the place, and he told me he should be back shortly—I waited a few minutes, and then awoke the prosecutor, and asked him if that man was his brother—he said he had no brother—he then said he had lost his notes and watch—I ran out directly to the White Hart public-house—I did not find the prisoners there—I then went to the Ship public-house, where I found Elliott and Watson—I told Elliott the man had awoke, and said he was not his brother—Elliott came with me directly—I asked him if he had got the man's money in his pocket—he said he had, and he pulled out a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a half-sovereign, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him where the other money was—he said he had lost it, or been robbed of it—he said, "I will give him all I have got left in my pocket"—Neat gave him into custody—I thought he had been the prosecutor's brother, or he should not have gone out of the house.</p>

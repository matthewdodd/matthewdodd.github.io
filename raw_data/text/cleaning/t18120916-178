            . I am an officer. On Friday evening last, between seven and eight o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner in the house of Mr. Shaw, in East Smithfield. I took him to the office, and searched him. In his pocket I found a bundle of keys. He said, they were the keys of his chests. I asked him how many chests he had. He said, he had four; they were in the house that I had taken him from. I returned to that house, and found these keys opened all the trunks. Captain 
               <persName id="t18120916-178-person1456">Peck</persName>
             was with me. In one trunk I found a black silk waistcoat. Captain Peck said it was his. In another trunk I found a coat; in the third trunk I found a purse, containing nine guineas, a Spanish piece of gold, and fourteen Spanish dollars, the bill of exchange was in the trunk, where the money was, and two one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take up this man - A.From information that I had received of the ten-pound note being traced to him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The coat, waistcoat, and bill of exchange are mine.</p>

On the 24th of March, about a quarter-past eight o'clock, I was in Cheapside, going home; I had six sovereigns and eleven shillings in my purse, in my breeches pocket - I met the prisoner, and asked her where she was going, supposing her to be a woman of the town; I had never seen her before; I went with her to <placeName id="t18310407-110-crimeloc616">No. 3.

I did not see the prisoner and prosecutor come in - about nine o'clock my fellow staid there were two gentlemen and a lady in the parlour - I did not go in then; but when I went in I found two gentlemen and the prisoner; the prosecutor said he had lost his purse; his companion was then with him - he charged the prisoner with having taken it; she said she had not got it - he said if she delivered it up he would pay her a good compliment: I advised her to return it, but she denied having it - I found it concealed about her person; I do not wish to state where; McKenzie claimed it - I gave it to the officer, without looking at it.</p>

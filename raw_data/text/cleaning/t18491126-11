                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a baker, and live at 2, Tabernacle-square. On Saturday evening, 28th Oct., I saw the prisoner on Holborn-hill—she took me by the hand, and put the other hand in my pocket—she spoke to me, but I did not understand her—I held her, and called out for the police—I had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—the prisoner took out three half-crowns, seven shillings, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and left 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—I know I had my money in my pocket at the time—I had bought two handkerchiefs in a shop on Holborn-hill only a few minutes before, and my money was safe then.</p>

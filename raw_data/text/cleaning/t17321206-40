Why, says he, I am one; and with that he pull'd out a Constable's Staff. You a Constable! says I, how came they to make a Foot Soldier a Constable? so went in to drink at Mrs. Jones's, and had a Quartern of Liquor; and he was so far from losing 15 s. that he had not enough to pay the Reckoning; for when Mrs. Jones asked him for the Money, he said he could not pay till his Wife came, and she afterwards paid for it. He took me into a Tipstaff's House, and he and his Wife-tore my Gown off my Back, and tumbled me in the Dirt ; and he did not charge me with the Robbery till 5 Days after I was committed.</p>
               <p>Then the Copy of the Warrant for her Commitment was read. It was for an Assault, without any mention of a Felony, and dated November 6.</p>

            . I was at the Castle Alehouse in Sheer Lane, when Freeman brought in Gale, and several more of these Women came with them. There was a great Disturbance and Confusion. I understood he had first carried her to Mr. Davis's, who would not take Charge of her, because she was not brought by a proper Officer. Freeman said he had a Judge's Warrant against her for an Assault, but I heard him make no mention of a Robbery. And he having no Authority to detain her, she made her Escape by the help of the Woman who came with her.

               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Pearse. No, but only he charged me with it, and I was discharged by Alderman Billers.</p>
               <p>- Thorp. Freeman and his Wife came to my House (the Ship Alehouse in the Old Bailey) and desired me to go with them to look for Gale. We went to Wind-mill-hill, and from thence to Gale's Sister's in Shoe Lane, where we drank to the Tune of half a Crown, and then we and two others went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060022"></xptr> to the Hay-market, and mist of her there to. But coming back by the End of Sheer-Lane, his Wife called to him, and said, Freeman, here the Bitch is. He came up, and damn you, you Bitch, says he, I have catch'd you now. He had but 15 d. when he went out, and he spent 4 d. at the White-Lion in the Old-Bailey; and when we came to Gale's Sister's, his Wife paid 2s. of the Reckoning, because he had not enough to pay the Whole. And as he was going home, I ask'd his Wife if he had lost 15 s. Damn him, a Son of a Bitch, says she, who would trust him with 15 s. to get drunk with?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wattle. I keep a Coffee-house in Ship-yard by Temple Bar. I was above Stairs when Gale came running up, and shut me in, and cry'd, for God-sake hide me. I was frighted. The Constable, and Freeman and his Wife followed. I ask'd 'em what was the Matter, and if she had robb'd 'em? and Mrs. Freeman said no.</p>
               <p>Several other Witnesses swore that Freeman kept a vile House in White-Fryars ; that he said he knew nothing of the Robbery till next Day; and that he offered to make it up for 10 Guineas.</p>
               <p>Freeman swore it was all false, and that they offered him 10 Guineas to make it up. The Jury found the Prisoners <rs id="t17321206-40-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

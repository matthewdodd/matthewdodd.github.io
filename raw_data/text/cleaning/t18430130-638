I saw Barnard running in the King's-road, about 200 yards from Shepherd's shop—he had a green bag—there were several persons running—there was a cry of "Stop thief"—Jones was close behind him—they were both running—when I spoke to Jones, Barnard was running, and crying, "Stop him, stop him"—I stopped Barnard—he threw the bag towards Jones, and said, "Here, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, take it"—he said it was not him, it was some one who had passed on—I picked the bag up—Jones continued running—I took Barnard back to the prosecutor's—he resisted very much—it was as much as two per<lb></lb>sons could do to hold him—I found the beef in the bag.</p>

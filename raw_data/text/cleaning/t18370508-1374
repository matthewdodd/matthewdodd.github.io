I keep the house—the prisoner was my servant for about fifteen months, and was so on the 16th of April—there was nobody but her and myself living in the house—on that day I ordered tea, and when the brought up the kettle, I said "I hope Ann you have well rinsed the kettle:—she said she had and the water boiled—I said "Very well"—I then put some water into the tea-pot and rinsed it out—I looked to see that there were no old tea leaves in—I then made my tea, and after pouring out the first cup and drinking part of it, I thought there was something very disagreeable in it—I put a little more milk to it, and then eat two bits of toast—I then drank the remainder of the cup of tea—I end not drink any more—I was taken with a fluttering and throbbing</p>

               <p>accompanied with a burning sensation in my stomach—I poured out ano<lb></lb>ther cup, but put it back and rang for the servant—she came up, and, I ordered her to take the tea away—I did not suspect any thing was the matter with the tea, but I thought I was taken suddenly ill—I went up stairs, and stopped some time before I went to bed—it was more than an hour or perhaps two, before I saw the prisoner again—I began to find myself ex<lb></lb>ceedingly ill—I rang the bell, and said "Ann, I am taken very ill, I think I am taken for death," and I wished her to assist me to bed—I found my head grow very heavy, I could not hold it up, I could not support it—I found I could hardly articulate a word when I went to speak, and when I at<lb></lb>tempted to get up off my chair I staggered very much, but I did not fall—I held by the table and went into the passage—I asked her if the back door was bolted—she said it was, top and bottom, and she ran and examined it—I then told her to see that the bolt of the front door was done, and desired her to lock it as well—I went and examined it and found it Was locked—I asked her to look at the clock, and she said it was nearly nine o'clock, about nine—I then told her, as I was so ill, she might as well retire early too, and put out the kitchen and parlour fires—I asked her to bring me up a few coals in the warming pan—we were then at the foot of the stairs, and I said might I depend on her to see that all was safe and then come to bed—she said I might—I then put my foot on the first stair, and nearly fell backwards—I screamed out, and said "Oh! 1 shall fall down and break my back"—she said "Oh no, you sha'nt, I will pot my hand to your back"—I then went up stairs, and as soon at she brought up the coals I shut my bed-room door, bolted it, and wound up my watch, and hung it in its place over the mantel shelf—I then got into bed with all speed, and after a few uneasy sensations I got into a profound sleep or swoon, and did not awake all night—I am gene-rally very wakeful—I awoke before six o'clock in the morning—1 was hardly sensible at first—my eyes were swollen, but in a few minutes I came to myself, and then found a small, green painted trunk, which usually stood under the bed, was standing by the bed side, partly from under the bed—it was not in that position when I went to bed—it had been under the bed—I got out of bed, and found the swing-glass on the floor, and my dressing-table removed from its place—I went round my bed, and found all the drawers, one above another, forced open—the bed-room door had been forced open—my dressing-table was standing outside the door on the landing—the drawer of it had been forced open and was out—it had been locked overnight—I lost two £5 notes, six sovereigns and a half, two half crowns, and two or three shillings, from that drawer—I then called to my servant as loud as I could, "Thieves, thieves! Ann, my house is broken open!"—I got no answer—I then called again, and said, "You can hear fast enough at another time, if you won't answer now"—I then went round-to the side of my bed, and partly dressed myself—I came back, and called to her again—she was then coming down the stairs, and had got very little on but her under things—I told her to go back and put her clothes on—we then proceeded down stairs together—I told her to run and see if all the doors were safe, and 1 went with her—she said they were all safe, and said, "I will be on my oath I fastened them"—I said, "I saw you fasten them"—they were still fastened—we went to the back door, and found both the top and bottom bolts as I had seen them the night before—we went to the front door, and found it locked and bolted—I came along the passage, and pushed open the parlour door—I found all safe there—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the morning of Monday, the 17th of April last, I went to the prosecutrix's house, between seven and eight o'clock—I examined the back parlour window, and found the shutters partly opened, about six or eight inches slid back—the center pane of the top sash was broken—it was a very small hole, about an inch wide—a hand could not be got in, and scarcely a finger—it was not large enough for a person to get part of their hand in and undo the fastening—I found some pieces of glass outside, but none within—I examined the window sill, and there was some dust on the outside, and on the water-butt also—there were no marks whatever, either of foot or hand prints—I took particular notice of that—none of the outer fastenings of the premises appeared to have been broken—they were all perfect—I examined the whole of them—I went down the garden with the prisoner, and she pointed to the back garden gate—which opens into a passage which leads into the fields, some distance from the house—she said, "This is the way they must have come, for the locks are forced off"—I saw a padlock lying on the ground—she pointed it out to me—I examined it, and found it perfect—there was no breaking as I could perceive then—the hasp was open, but it did not appear to me to be at all forced—there Was a door lock oh the same door—that was unlocked, but not injured—there was no force on the wards—I afterwards got the keys, and tried both the locks, add found them perfect—here is the padlock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are not these common locks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—many keys that housebreakers use would very easily open them—the hole in the glass presented a rough appearance—it was starred—it was merely a hole punched through, either from within or without, I will not be po<lb></lb>sitive which—one finger might be put through the hole, but I should say, if they put two through, they must have been cut—I should say there was not room for two—a person might put their finger through and get hold of the catch, but not without great difficulty—the hole Was directly opposite the hasp, in the centre of the pane—they could move the catch, and then lift up the window—there would then be nothing to prevent the shutters being opened—they might get out the same way—I saw no injury to the fastening at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Walter Williams, and live in Southampton-buildings, Holborn. On the 2nd of March, I was going up Snow-hill with a friend, about a quarter past ten o'clock, and felt a person's hand in my pocket—I turned round, and saw the prisoner close behind me—there were three persons behind him—he was the nearest to me—I felt immediately, and my pocket-book was gone—it contained a £10 bill of exchange—the prisoner ran away some distance down Sea<lb></lb>coal-lane—I did not lose sight of him until he was stopped.</p>

I was in Fleet-lane be<lb></lb>tween a quarter and half-past ten o'clock, and heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, and went and secured him, as a crowd of people were following him—the prosecutrix came up, and said he was the man—I took him to the watch-house—I found a silver watch and guard, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on him, but nothing relating to the charge.</p>

I was walking behind Mrs. Williams—I saw the prisoner, with three others, and another man like a porter behind them, with a sack over his shoulder, and a cap on—I saw the prisoner hustle the prosecutrix twice—I then saw him put his hand into the pocket-hole of her gown—I did not see the pocket-book—he ran down Seacoal-lane into Fleet-lane—I followed him, and am certain he is the man—I do not know what became of the other three—I kept my eye on the prisoner.</p>

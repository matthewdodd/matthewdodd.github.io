               <p>I am a waterman. I met this lad with the box in Queen-street, and he asked me the way to Bishopsgate-street? I told him to go up to the top of the street, and then to ask; he then parted with me, and a young man, in a blue coat went up to him and got into conversation along with the boy; and the man there, the prisoner, was close behind the boy, walking up the street all the time, walking near the opposite side of the way. The man that was talking to the boy tilted up the box and looked at the directions; he then left the boy and the boy went on, the prisoner turned down Pancras-lane and came up Bucklersbury again, and met that person that looked at the directions; he then left the boy, and the boy went on; the prisoner turned down Pancras-lane and came up Bucklersbury again, and met that person that looked at the directions; the boy then went down the Old Jewry, they all three followed him, there were three of them in all. I saw no more of it till they came to the bottom of Princes-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040019"></xptr>street, and when I came to the botton of Princes-street the prisoner had got the box on his head, and the boy was going away from him. I called to the boy and asked him if he knew the man to whom he delivered the box? he said no, I told the boy he had robbed him of it; I then called out, you, with the box, where are you going? He did not turn at that, I called him again, and he turned about then, I asked him then where he was going with the box? he said, to Bishopsgate-street; I said, you rascal you have robbed the boy of it, he said, here you may have it, and he took it off from his head and gave it to me, I gave it to the boy; a gentleman coming by, said, we ought to charge a constable with him; he said, we need not charge him with a constable, he would go with us; I told him he should. Just as we got to the corner of Wormwood-street, he then fat off to run, and I ran after him, and catched him by the collar. I took him to Mr. Wilson's house, where the box was directed.</p>

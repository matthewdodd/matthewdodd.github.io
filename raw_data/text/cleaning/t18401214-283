In consequence of information, I went on Wednesday evening, the 25th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past seven o'clock, to the New-road, opposite Baker's-row—I put myself in a dark part of the road, and saw the prisoner Dunord drawing a truck with a firkin of butter in it—there were two others with him—they were walking on the foot-path close to the truck, which was in the road—I did not get a full view of their faces—it was dark—I know both the prisoners well—I seized Dunord, and the other two ran away—I could not speak positively to either of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Fuller-street, Air-street, Bethnal-green. On the 25th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes before seven o'clock, I taw Higgins coming out of Baker's-row, Whitechapel, with a truck—I saw nothing in it then—two or three minutes afterwards I saw the same truck in the officer's possession at the corner of the New-road—it then had a firkin in it—I had often hired the truck myself, and was acquainted with it—I think if the firkin had been in it when I first saw Higgins with it, I should have noticed it—it was empty then—he was dragging it out of Baker's-row, across Whitechapel-road, into the New-road opposite—I saw no one else with him—I knew Higgins before, and am not mistaken in his person—I have been in trouble myself for a broom, and was sent for three months to the House of Correction from the police-office—I was also charged on suspicion of horse-stealing, but nothing came of that.</p>

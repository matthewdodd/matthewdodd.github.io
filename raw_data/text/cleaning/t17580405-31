I ordered the foreman to examine his bag of chips, that he carried away when he went from work; thinking he might waste his time in spliting up slabs, I found his chips consisted chiefly in slabs, and such sort, for which I reprov'd him. The foreman in searching to the bottom of his bag said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050027"></xptr> here is something more in it and turn'd it out, and it prov'd to be iron-bolts and nails, and such like useful iron.</p>

               <p>Batson. This was about the 16th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that iron?</p>
               <p>Batson. It is valued in the indictment at 7 s. they were worth to us above 24 s. (produced in court, and deposed to) He confess'd they were our property before we went before the justice, and before the justice; and that he took it out of our iron warehouse.</p>

This iron produced here, we took out of the prisoner's bag amongst his chips as he was going to go home; he was not got out of the yard with them when they were found; he own'd he took them, and said it was a foolish thing of him to do so, and that it was my master's property; and own'd he had taken about twenty pounds weight away before.</p>

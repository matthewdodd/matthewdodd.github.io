                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employment of Charles James Saunders, and another, of Collingwood-street, Blackfriars. It was my duty to take money to the bank every morning—my time of doing so varied from half-past nine o'clock to between ten and eleven—I had been in the habit of taking money to the bank every morning prior to 15th Aug.—the bank was the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank, in Wellington-street, London-bridge—I am generally in the habit of going one way—I go through a passage near St. Saviour's Dock, by St. Saviour's Church, close by the Borough-market—on the morning of 15th Aug. I started from Collingwood-street, I think about half-past nine—I had with me 357<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of Bank of England notes, gold, and silver—there was one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note I know, which I had taken myself the day before, seven "fives," I think, and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, in half-crowns, shillings, &amp;c.—there was upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—I think I had the money in my hand—I sometimes carried it over my shoulder when I had a heavier amount—it was in a bag—I very often have a heavy weight, upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—nothing happened to me on my way until I got to the passage near St. Saviour's-dock—I then saw a man standing against the door at the end of Church-passage—it is a very small passage, which goes under a house, with a door at one end, near the Church—that door is fastened back to the wall in the daytime, with a hook—I saw the man unhook the door, and fasten it to a staple, which would close the door—I could not swear to that man—it was neither of the prisoners—I put out my hand to try to pass when I had got quite close to him, and he gave me a blow, which was evidently intended to hit me on the head—it did not hit my head, but it struck my hat—immedi<lb></lb>ately upon that my hat was knocked over my eyes, and they tripped me up from behind—I turned round, and saw two men standing—I was then on the ground—those two men used every effort to get the money—I clung to it as long as I could—they kicked me, and one fell upon my chest—I called, "Murder!" as loud as I could call—they got the money from me; and as soon as they got it, they ran—I could plainly see the bag in the prisoner Archer's possession—I swear positively that Archer is one of the men—I could not swear to the other—there were two men behind me, and Archer is the man who took the bag—I have a belief as to Davis being the other man—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160098"></xptr>
               <p>I saw him among a number of prisoners at the Southwark police-court, and picked him out as the man who I believed, from his general appearance, was the man who was in company with Archer that morning—I will not under<lb></lb>take to swear positively to him—I got up, and followed Archer, crying, "Stop thief!"—I did not notice where the other men went; I kept my attention on the bag of money—Archer ran in a direction towards Bankside, and came to a flour-mill there, where a lot of men were stationed outside—I called, "Stop thief," and begged them to stop him—they put out their arms to stop him, and he ran in a direction as though he was coming to the passage again—I stood at the end of the passage—he appeared to be coming right at me, but he took a different direction, and ran down a street at the back of the passage—I still followed him into a court where there is no thoroughfare, and he then ran into a house—some gentleman, who is not here, ran in, and seized him—I saw him seize him—I got up before him—Archer was standing, looking round, as if he was about to make for the stairs; but there was some one I believe on the stairs, and he stood there—I ran up to him, and said, "Now, you wretch, give me that bag," and he handed it over to me—it contained the money—he was then given into custody—I think it was on the Thursday after, that I saw Davis—I had never seen either of the pri<lb></lb>soners before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit-salesman, in the Borough-market. On the morning of 15th Aug., a little before ten o'clock, I was passing St. Mary Overy dock, in the direction from Southwark towards Blackfriars-bridge, and when I got about the middle of the passage, underneath the archway, I saw three men coming towards me, Archer, Davis, and another man—the passage is very narrow, and I stood on one side to allow them to pass, thinking they, were coming through, but they did not—they came up to the end of the pas<lb></lb>sage—Archer stationed himself nearest to me on the footpath—Davis placed himself underneath the loophole of the warehouse, exactly facing Archer—the third person placed his back towards the river, but each with their faces directed towards Blackfriars-bridge, the way they came from—I looked very hard at them, and as I passed, Archer said to Davis, "Here he comes!" and looked up towards Bankside—I particularly noticed the faces of these two—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160099"></xptr>
               <p>Davis had his eyes on the ground, and when Archer spoke to him he looked up and looked that way—this could not have occupied more than a minute—I passed them, and went on fifteen or twenty feet further—I then heard a cry of "Stop thief! murder!"—I had gone into a water-closet, which is there for the use of the clerks of the wharf—I kept on the alert more than I should have done, having noticed these three men there—when I heard the cry I came out, and the moment I came out Archer had got a blue bag in his hand, and was making away as fast as he could—the prosecutor was crying out "Murder! stop thief! he has got my money," or something of that sort—exactly facing me, and behind him, was Davis and the other man together—I said, "You scoundrels, you are both of you engaged in this robbery, as well as he"—they all three ran—I followed Archer, and never lost sight of him till he gave the bag into Mr. Greenland's hands—I saw Davis about a week after at the police-station—there was no other person there but the policemen—I have no hesitation in swearing, that Davis is the man I addressed, when I said, "You two scoundrels are connected in this robbery."</p>

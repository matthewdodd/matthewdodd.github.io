            . On the 4th of February I was with Thompson, in Goswell-street, rather before seven o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170054"></xptr>in the evening, and saw the prisoner; he appeared to be walking with another man; the prisoner was carrying the box on his shoulder. As soon as they saw Thompson they parted, the prisoner crossed the road, and the other man ran down a street, I went up to the prisoner, and asked him where he got the box? he said he was going to take it to Mrs. Lane. I asked him where she lived? he said if I went with him he would shew me. As we went along he said a man met him in Holborn, and gave him 6 d. to carry it to the Three Cups, in Aldersgate-street, where it was to be booked to go into the country, and that the man who gave it to him ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where Mrs. Lane lived - A. No, my Lord, nor did he know who it was to be booked to. I opened the box, and found two letters in it, by which I found out the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The prisoner did not increase his pace - A. He walked pretty fast.</p>

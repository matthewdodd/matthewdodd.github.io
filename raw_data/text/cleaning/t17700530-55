            . I saw the prisoner come past Wapping Old-stairs, between four and five that morning, the 25th of May. He had something on his shoulder; two men came with him; one had something on his head, between twelve and one. I said, This is the man that went past here in the morning between four and five, with something on his shoulder. I said he has been taking iron rails from somebody's door: he said what business was that of mine; I said I insisted on seeing what he had got: there was these screws. I stopped him, and the prosecutor came and owned them.</p>

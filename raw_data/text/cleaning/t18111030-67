               <p>Q. Do you remember the arrival of these goods at Paddington - A. I do, they arrived on the 18th of last month by the canal, they were put into the warehouse. I am the clerk of the warehouse at Paddington. In about two hours afterwards they were delivered to Cowdall our carman; the truss was directed to Mr. Daniel, the truss was numbered, and the weight mark upon it, half a hundred and twelve pounds; I say it put in the cart and delivered to Cowdall; I afterwards saw it at the magistrates office on the same day; that was the same truss.</p>

            . Q. You are carman to Messrs. Pickford's - A. I am. On the 18th of October I received a truss out of their warehouse directed to Mr. Daniel, No. 572; it was put in my cart on the top of of the goods, on the off-side of the cart. When I was in Berner-street delivering goods I was obliged to leave the cart. Downe met me as I was coming out of a door, from his information I looked in the cart and saw Mr. Daniel's package was gone; I and Downe pursued Wilks and Ragan, we came up to them in Hollis-street, Wilks had the truss on his shoulder, I laid hold of him, asked him what he did with the truss and told him it was taken out of my cart; he said a man gave him a shilling to carry it for him; I told Downe to take Ragan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ragan a man at that time - A. I did not perceive it. Ragan said he did not know Wilks, he had never seen him before. I put the truss in a public-house, I knew it to be the same truss that I had in my cart. The prisoners were taken to Marlborough-street-office.</p>

            . I am a porter. On the 18th of October, in the afternoon, I was in Wardour-street, I saw the prisoner Ragan, he had a truss in his arms; I gave information to Cowdall; we pursued him into Holly-street, we there saw both the prisoners, Ragan was about five or six yards from Wilks, Wilks then had the truss on his shoulder; Cowdall took Wilks and the truss, Ragan ran away, he did not appear lame at that time, he ran near as fast as I did. They were both apprehended and taken to Marlborough-street office.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN BLACKGROVE. I am carman of the Ealing-cart. On the 18th of October I was going along Oxford-street, I saw the cart from whence this truss was taken, it was standing at the corner of Berner-street; I saw the prisoner go across the street with the truss in his arms as fast as he could go; he was about six yards from the cart when I saw him first, in the direction towards Wardour-street; I saw him put the truss down on the pavement; he then spoke to Wilks, and when he spoke to Wilks he took it up again, and went as fast as he could down Wardour-street. I gave the alarm to Cowdall when he came out of the house.</p>

               <p>Wilks' Defence. Being out of work I was walking up Oxford-street, the bale was then at the corner of a street, the man said, will you give me a lift up with this on my shoulder; I did; he said I wish I could get a man to carry it to Fleet-Market; I said; I am out of work, I will carry it, I had it on my shoulder and that man took it off.

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman cooper. On the 14th of feb<lb></lb>ruary I was living in Petticoat-lane—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—on the 14th of February I received, from Ipswich, a£5 note, of the Ipswich bank—I should know it from its general appearance—when I received it, the prisoner and two young men went with me to the Blue Boar-tap—I believe this is the note, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) from its ge<lb></lb>neral appearance—I said it was an old looking note, and had a broken back—I have no doubt this is the note I received—the prisoner went with me to the tap on Wednesday evening—on Wednesday night the prisoner went to bed first, and not having had a good opportunity of reading the letter, I took the note out and read the letter—I put the note into the letter again, and put them into my box, which stood between the beds—the prisoner had an opportunity of seeing that—no one else was in the room, and no one else sleeps there—there is no lock to the box—I went to work the next morning between seven and eight o'clock—on the Saturday night I found the letter and bank-note were both gone—the prisoner continued to sleep there from Wednesday to Saturday—about half-past one o'clock on Sunday morning I heard a violent ringing at the door—I looked out, and saw the prisoner and two disorderly females—the prisoner was in liquor, and I gave him in charge.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a native of Switzerland. At the latter end of last month, I was coming from Ghent to Ostend. I met with the prisoner on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290051"></xptr>board the barge coming from Ghent. He told us he was a partner in the house of Cothey, Roberts, and Co. in Cannon-street; he shewed us some papers that had a relation to that firm, which induced us to believe that he was in it. We gave him some money to pay for his passage. We first gave him seven Louis d'or; and then he said, those had been stolen from him, and we gave him thirteen more. He came over from Ostend in the same packet to Ramsgate with us, and we came by the same coach to London; we came together to <placeName id="t18160529-89-crimeloc480">Blackheath</placeName>

He said, he would be there in the morning. At Ramsgate he gave us a private direction, Mr. Christian, 116, Red Lion-street, London. He invited us to come and see him. We did not give him the keys of our trunks. When we got to Cannon-street the next morning, we found no such house as Cothay and Co; we heard that those gentlemen had removed to somewhere in Little Tower-street. We afterwards went to Red Lion-street, Holborn, but could find no No. 116 there. He explained to me that it was Red Lion-street, Red Lion-square; and therefore we did not go to any other Red Lion-street.</p>

            . I was directed to make search after the prisoner at the bar. The prosecutor gave me a description of his person, and of the sort of articles he had with him. After a long search, on the 25th of May, I found him at No. 11, Tottenham-court. I took him there at about seven o'clock in the morning. I went up stairs; the woman of the house went up stairs to the bed-room door. She asked to speak to him, and he said he would come directly; I rather suspected that he was preparing to meet me, and I forced the door open, and he snapped a pistol at me. I afterwards found it was loaded. I catched the pistol with one hand and knocked him down with the other. I found two trunks in that room; the locks were forced off; the straps were cut, and the chains broken. They were empty; I searched some drawers there, and found all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

                  </hi> I am a labourer, and live in Duke-street. On the 16th of Aug. I was in the Blackfriars-road, and saw Mrs. Taylor—the two Law<lb></lb>sons were there—James Lawson had a butcher's frock on—I saw Benja<lb></lb>min Lawson attempt to Mrs. Taylor's pocket close by Charlotte-street—she was walking away from Blackfriars-bridge towards the Obelisk—I saw Johnson and Murphy about a quarter of an hour afterwards in conversation together, near the Duke of Clarence, at the corner of the London-road-Mrs. Taylor came up, followed by the two Lawsons—Johnson and Murphy joined the two Lawsons, and they had a conversation together close by Mr. Alder's, the cook's shop—they then went on, and I saw Benjamin Law<lb></lb>son take the purse from Mrs. Taylor's pocket, and they all ran away—Mrs. Taylor had made a stop, and the purse was then taken—the prisoner ran down Gaywood-street—I went another way, round West-square—I found them in St. George's-road—I afterwards took the two Lawsons.</p>

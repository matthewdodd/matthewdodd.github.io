               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You knew the prisoner very well? A. Yes - I treated him because he said he had no money, and he asked me to treat him; I did not know where he lived; I had been at my brother's, where I had a glass of rum and peppermint - that was about four o'clock; I had not drank any porter - I had been at Westminster that morning, but I do not believe I met any female there; I never told a man named Jones that I had been robbed of 1l. 5s. by two women at Westminster, on at any other place - I do not know a man of the name of Smith; I never said that two girls had attempted to take my money, and I thought they had robbed me of 1l. 5s.</p>

            . I was on duty, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I ran after the prisoner, caught him, and held him till the prosecutor came up, who said he had picked his pocket of a sovereign and some silver - the prisoner denied it; I asked the prosecutor if he was sure of it - he said Yes; I asked the prisoner what he had in his pocket - he said some halfpence; I searched him, and found a sovereign, 2s., and some halfpence - he ran the length of a street, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What street was it in? A. Marylebone-street, a great thorougfare - it was half-past seven o'clock in the evening; it was getting dark - I was about twenty yards from the first person I saw running the prisoner is the man I took back to the prosecutor, and he said he was the man who robbed him; the prosecutor certainly was not sober, but he could give his evidence very well before the Magistrate, and we went before him in about a quarter of an hour - he did not at first say he had lost 1l. 5s.; he said a sovereign - I said, "Search your pockets, and see if you have it," and he did; he was satis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150076"></xptr>fied of it himself, but I made him feel for fear he should be wrong.</p>

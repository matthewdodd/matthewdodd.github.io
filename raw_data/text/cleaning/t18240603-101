Soon after I entered the crowd, I was surrounded and pressed by a throng of person. My watch was safe just before - it cost 7 l. with the chain and seals; I felt it drawn from me, and saw the prisoner near me, on my left - his arm went across, and immediately the throng left me, and rushed down Long-alley; I pursued and took him; he declared his innocence, and said he had not a watch about him, and would go with me any where. I sent for an officer, who searched him, but did not find it. He said next morning at the office, that if I would drop the prosecution he would send and see for the watch; he sent a person, who did not return.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he when he said this - A. In the parlour at the office; he came to me and said so. He was standing in a crowd of persons at the time of the robbery; there were not less than fifty people; he was near me - in front; there was no person between me and him. I saw no watch in his hand; I saw his hand near me, and pass with great rapidity towards my right. I did not see the property pass from him to anybody.</p>

            . I live in Long-alley, near the spot in question, and am a stone mason. I was sent for to Crown-street, being an officer, and took the prisoner in charge. I did not hear what was said at the office, but in taking him to the watch-house, at the corner of Crown-street, he struck me a violent blow on the head, and attempted to get away. I had used no violence to provoke him. He did not deny the charge, but said he would go with me.</p>

            . I am a fruit-seller in Finsbury New-market. I saw this man at the end of Crown-street strike Robretson, and I told him if he did so again I would knock him down. I assisted in taking him to a place of safety. I heard him say to the prosecutor that if he would forgive him, and not take him before Magistrate, he would return the watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man said,</p>
               <p>"If you will give the prosecutor his watch or the value of it, he will let you go." I was returning from Smithfield, and passed through this crowd; when I got out of the crowd, I had walked about a hundred yards, and the gentleman came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Me, Sir" - he said</p>

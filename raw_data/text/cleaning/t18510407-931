                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, in Harp-lane, Tower-street. In Feb. last, I had a part of my house to let in offices—the prisoner came to look at them—he gave the name of R. H. or R. M. Holmes—he did not put any name up—I did not enter into any agree<lb></lb>ment with him—he had a paper put up in my office, "All letters addressed to R. M. Holmes and Co., to be left with Mr. Edwards"—we had fre<lb></lb>quent conversation in the course of his coming to and fro, as regards busi<lb></lb>ness, and he said that he was about to open a sherry house; that he had a great deal of property coming to his wife, and that his uncle was con<lb></lb>nected with Spain, that he should only ship sherries, and he wished me to supply his customers with other articles—that was the agreement we were about to enter into, and he was to receive a commission upon them—on 22nd Feb. he said to me, "I was at Woolwich yesterday, calling on my different customers, and among others Mr. Richards, of the Castle Inn, Woolwich, do you know Mr. Richards?—I said, "Yes"—he said, Richards was a purchaser, and asked me to let him have samples to show to Mr. Richards—I let him have the samples—next day he said that he had sold Mr. Richards a pipe of the port, and a hogshead of the sherry, and wished me to take out the warrants—I did so; these are the warrants (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I endorsed them to Mr. Richards—I at the same time gave him this invoice—(<hi rend="italic">read—This was made out—Mr. W. J. Richards, to J. T, Edwards, dated Feb.</hi> 22)—the wine was standing at the Docks in my name, and would not be delivered without these warrants—they are the same as bank-notes—the prisoner told me that Mr. Richards usually paid cash, but he was a little uncertain whether he would, but if not he would give a bill at three months—I told him I had no objection to that, as it was a matter of doubt whether Mr. Richards would pay cash or give a bill, he requested me to give him a blank stamp—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp—I saw him again the next day, or the day after, and on my asking him if he had seen Mr. Richards, he said he had been to Woolwich, that Mr. Richards was not at home, and he had left the warrants, making an appointment to call the following day to receive the money or take a bill—I saw him again on the 27th or 28th—he then gave me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I looked at it, and said, "Holmes, this is not Richards' acceptance"—he said, "No; I will explain to you how that is"—he said that Mr. Hallows, upon whom the bill purports to be drawn, kept the Britannia, another house at Woolwich, that Hallows was related to Mr. Richards by marriage, and the reason why it was Hallows' acceptance was</p>

               <p>to keep the two accounts distinct, but that Richards bought the wine, it was all one affair—he represented that Mr. Richards was the owner both of the Castle and Britannia, and that Hallows conducted the Britannia for him—he said the wine was for the Britannia—he left the bill with me—I did not take it in payment—I said I must have Mr. Richards' accept<lb></lb>ance in lieu of this, and, moreover, I could not take a bill drawn by him upon the parties, that the bill must be drawn direct by me—he said he would get Richards' acceptance—he asked me if he should endorse the bill, and he endorsed it in my presence—I sent the bill to the County Bank—I went down to Woolwich a few days afterwards, inquired about a Mr. Hallows, and found no such person—I saw the prisoner the following day and gave him into custody—I never knew him by the name of Mowbray—be promised to give me another bill instead of this.</p>

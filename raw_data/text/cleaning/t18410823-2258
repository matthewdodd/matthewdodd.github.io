I am a wine-merchant, and keep the New Hummums, hotel, Covent-garden; the prisoner was three or four months in my ser<lb></lb>vice, and boarded in the house. On Friday, the 27th of August, I went to the police-station at Bow-street, in consequence of information I re<lb></lb>ceived, and there saw a case and some bottles of wine, in consequence of which I gave the prisoner into custody—I can speak to the wine, it being sealed with my name, and the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oyster-dealer, and live in Bedford-court, Covent-garden. On the 29th of August the prisoner left a box at my door, and I took it in charge—he told me he would bring a horse and cart and take it away, but he did not, and I gave it up to the police—this is the case, I can swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went to Mr. Rockley's on the 27th, and heard a conversation between the prisoner and Mr. Rockley—the prisoner said "Have mercy on me, master; do not give me into custody"—Mr. Rockley gave him in charge, and on the road to the sta<lb></lb>tion, he said he took the wine to send to his wife, for her to make a little money, as she was very badly off and ill in the country—I found two direc<lb></lb>tions on him—they are directions to his wife—I told him what he said I should give in evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The wine I had from a person who used to live at Liverpool with a Mr. Hanson, he is now agent for somebody—he owed me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would give me the wine for it—it was never on Mr. Rockley's pre<lb></lb>mises,</p>

               <p>but the case I took from Mr. Rockley intending to return it—I sealed the cork with Mr. Rockley's seal for my wife to know where I lived.</p>

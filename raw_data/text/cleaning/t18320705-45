            . I am an officer. About half-past twelve o'clock that night the prosecutor called me, and said he had lost his watch - I took the prisoner, and found on her this handkerchief, which she said he lent her to wipe her month after drinking gin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor sitting on the step of a door; he was very tipsy, and his clothes were loose - he said, "I have been having a sleep;" he got up and took me to a public-house to have some gin - he felt his pockets, and said he had no money; the landlord took the gin up again - he then felt in his pockets, found 6d., and paid that - we then came out; it rained very heavy, and he put the handkerchief round me; he asked if he could go home with me - I said, No, as a female slept with me; he said he could not get into his lodging - I said I could not help that; he then said he had lost his watch, and gave me in charge of the officer; I stood by him till he came, and then I was taken; the next day he said he had lost a sovereign, and his landlady said he had only half a sovereign.</p>

            . I am a widow, and lodge at Mr. Pullman's - there was a copper fixed in the back kitchen of that house. On the 23d of January between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming down and found something on the stairs which I thought was like the copper; I called to a woman to bring a light, and we got a brewer's servant, who went down in the back kitchen and found the prisoner; the copper had been taken from the brick-work, and put on the stairs - I had seen it safe about seven o'clock the same morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not meet you in the passage with the candle in your hand? A. No; I never saw you till you came up from the kitchen with Wilkins. Three families lodge in the same house - the door was open.</p>

            . I was sent for, and went to the house; I found the prisoner on the kitchen stairs; I asked what he was doing; he made me an answer which I did not understand; and his hands were all black, as if he had been taking a copper down - the copper was then at the bottom of the stairs, I believe.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been taking up some old floors at the west end of the town; I was returning home, and was taken ill; I had no half-pence to go to a public-house, and seeing the door of this house open, I went into the yard - this woman accosted me when I came back, and asked what I wanted there; I told her, and she said she thought I had pulled down a copper; I said I had not, and she went to see - I did not attempt to go away; if I had pulled it down I must have had some tool about me.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PULLMAN. Q. Could the copper have been removed without any tools? A. Yes; it could have been pulled up by the hands.</p>

Between nine and ten o'clock, on Sunday night, the ninth of this month, as I was coming on my duty,I met the prisoner, and he kept the middle of the street, and I had suspicion of him, and I went to him and asked him where he lived? he said in Whitechapel, and I fetched him down, and he offered me a bribe, and I laid faster hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What bribe did he offer? - He pulled out some money. I told him I should not have it. When the constable of the night examined him in the watch-house, he gave several excuses.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he carry these things? - He carried them quite loose, they were only huddled up, he had them in his arm, the constable of the night took them from him, and the constable of the night gave them back to me, and I have kept them ever since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That young woman, as I passed by the place, she asked me in, and kept me from half past six, till half past nine; and she asked me to take them things with me; she gave them me herself, and I left my basket there; the girl made me leave the basket, she would not let me take it away; I was to come on the morrow and meet her, and give her what the things fetched.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you give him any of these things? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Pendergrass. Did he or did he not, at the watch-house, say any thing about the house, from whence these things came from? - My Lord, he said first that he brought them from the corner of Monmouth-street; their house is three or four doors from Middle-row; in the street; he said they were his own property, he told us that he brought them from the corner of Monmouth-street, and it being Sunday night, the constable of the night convinced him of that; then he said he brought them from the corner house. I am certain he said the corner house.</p>

               <p>Q. What business did he say he had there? - He did not tell what business he had there, he said he left his basket where he brought the things from; the constable of the night examined him again, and desired him to tell where he fetched them from, and he would not detain him any longer; then when he was backward I asked him to tell me the number of the house, and I would go there and get him acquitted, with that he told the number of the house, a shoemaker's house, No. 40, St. Giles's; then I went up and rapped at the door, and asked the man if he had lost any bed-clothes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He told you the right number of the house? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the basket there? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - As soon I cried ten o'clock, it was a few minutes after ten when I alarmed the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190117"></xptr>Q.When you got back to that house(No. 40,) what time was it? - It was about ten minutes after ten, between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the girl say at the time that she had let you in? - She said that she let her mistress in to the apartment where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mistress was up? - She got up on my alarm.</p>
               <p>Court to Reynolds. When you came home did you hear of this basket? - My little girl told me that the jew had been there, and gave the girl an orange, and her brother an apple; she spoke of it after the child told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first saw the basket? - I did not see the basket at all till the day after, which was on Monday. The basket is there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servant maid at any time say any thing to you about the basket, afterwards? - When she came up to wait at surper, I asked her if the jew and she had been fellow servants? she said no, she never knew him in her life. A little after ten the watchman came and made an alarm, and the lodger let him in, and they came up to my door, and we got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the servant maid first tell you about this basket, or did you speak to her first about it? - To the best of my recollection she told me, that the jew had been there, and he had left his basket, and that she refused to take it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did your servant lay on this same bed where the clothes were taken off? - Not on the same bed, but in the same room.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had this servant been with you? - About two months, but I don't recollect that ever she saw him before.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mitchell. What time did the little boy go to bed? - About a quarter to nine, and the quilt was on the bed then.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. These are my things.</p>

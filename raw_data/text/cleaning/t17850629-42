               <p>On the 31st of May, in the morning, between two and three, I was alarmed by a dog that Mr. Blakey keeps in the back part of his house, which adjoins to mine; in <placeName id="t17850629-42-crimeloc200">Golden-lane</placeName>

I got up and looked through my window, I saw nobody at first, but the third time I looked the prisoner was dragging a piece of lead out of the gutter into my yard, I saw him standing on a bench, then I saw him stamp upon it to bend it together; I did not see him separate the lead, I got up twice, but could not see him, there was 56 lb. of lead, it came undoubtedly from the gutter, the prisoner seeing me stooped down, I said to him, are you a plumber at work here? and he ran away; I pursued him, I never lost sight of him; I am sure he is the man, some more lead had been taken out of the gutter, it had not been repaired ; I sent the lead to Mr. Blakey, the lead answered to the gutter exactly, I measured it.</p>

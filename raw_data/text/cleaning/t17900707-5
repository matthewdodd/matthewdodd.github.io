               <p>On Friday evening last, between nine and ten o'clock, I was going home out of the city.

               <p>Court. Did Highland follow you? - No; he was standing at the corner of Dyot-street; he struck me directly; I gave him no provocation; there was no conversation between the prisoners; they were not in company together; when Highland struck me, he swore very much; the other made the attempt at my pocket, just at the time; I was not knocked down; I received several blows on my arm; I made a retreat into a coal-shed; and he hallooed, blast him, turn him out; I was secure from him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the other say any thing at the time he struck you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Was not you at the Westminster election? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know them before? - Yes, I have seen them many times before; and they knew me; I have seen them pick pockets.</p>
               <p>They did not pick your pocket? - Buckle attempted it.</p>
               <p>This was about the time there was a riot at the election? - Yes, it was.</p>

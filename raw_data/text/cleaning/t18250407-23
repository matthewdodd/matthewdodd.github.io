Mrs. Johnson said she had not ordered it - I shewed her the letter, and she said she knew nothing of it. I then came back to town and went to Mr. Pedley's shop, No. 268, Holborn, where the parcel was directed to be left, and after waiting there till between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came there, and said she had no idea the parcel was so large,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070014"></xptr>had she would get a coach - she then went away, and I saw no more of her till she was apprehended - I gave directions to follow her.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Drew. On the 7th of February I received this letter:</p>
               <p>(The Letter was here read.)</p>
               <p>Woodford, Feb. 7.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Edward Johnson will thank Messrs. Manas to send her, to her late residence in Gerrard-street, the under-mentioned mourning for her three nieces, who are just returned from France. She will be glad if they will not said sending the parcel, carefully packed up, as she is sending by ten o'clock to-morrow, and the servant will call and bring it down to Woodford. Let the articles be good. I send this by the post-boy, with orders to post it immediately, consequently there will be plenty of time to send them."</p>
               <p>(Here followed a list of articles, see Indictment.)</p>
               <p>JESSE HALL. I know Mrs. Johnson - she is a customer of ours - her late husband lived in Gerrard-street; when I received the letter I packed up the goods, directed it for Mrs. Johnson, and delivered it in Gerrard-street, to Thomas Byford; I asked who I was to leave the parcel with, and they directed me to leave it with him. Mr. Johnson had been a comptroller of the Twopenny post-office there; I was not at home when the second letter arrived - I had not seen the prisoner in the transaction, or given her any credit at all - the second parcel was made up according to this letter, and taken the next morning, by Mr. Drew, with a bill of parcels. The second letter is as follows.</p>
               <p>(reads):</p>
               <p>"Feb. 11, 1825.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson received the parcel quite safe, and likes the scarfs very much; she will be glad if Mr. Mann will send her down as much gros de Naples and lining as will make two more pelisses, as the quantity sent is only sufficient for one; also ten yards of Welch flannel, and twenty-five yards of calico, at about 1 s. 3 d.; and a piece of diaper, small pattern, Be so good as to send them to-morrow to Mr. Pedley's, No. 268, High Holborn, two doors from the George and Blue Boar, directed to me, A friend of mine is coming down to spend a few days with me, and sets off from the above Inn, therefore I have requested her to call at Pedley's, and bring the parcel in the coach with her - pack it secure."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit ever since I lost my father at eleven years of age, of having my bill paid yearly at Mr. Mann's. After my marriage with Mr. Webster, I still continued to deal with them - we afterwards went to Ireland - when I returned I had some more goods of Mr. Mann, in consequence of the death of Mr. Johnson, as I wished to look as respectable as the rest of the family, by whom I had been forgotten. I had hoped that Mrs. Johnson would have enabled me pay the bill before it became due - I went to the house and ordered the print myself - I then went to Gerrard-street, and saw the porter; I enquired if the parcel was come, and he gave it me - I did not do it with intent to defraud Messrs. Mann.</p>

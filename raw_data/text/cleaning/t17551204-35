On the 3d of November I was informed by her mistress she was gone, and had taken her boxes away, and left the door open. Having missed things before, I went up to my room, examined my portmanteau, and missed 7 guineas which I had left tied up in a silk purse the day before. About 3 or 4 hours after that, her mistress was informed by the porter, who carried her boxes, where she was in Westminster. I went to justice Fielding and took out a warrant; then went with her master, and found her in a publick house. She cried very much, put her hand in her pocket, and gave me her purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your purse?</p>
               <p>Waters. No, it was not, for that was left empty. She told me, there was my money. I turn'd it out, and found 6 guineas in gold, and 12 s. 6 d. with a pair of knee buckles of her mistress's, which she acknowledged. She was taken before justice Fielding, and there confessed she had taken my money.</p>

On Monday the 3d of November I got up at 7 o'clock, and rang the bell for the maid to rise. A little after that I heard her get up, and go into the parlour and open the windows. I went to sleep again, and then people came and knock'd at the door. I got up, and found the street door open. I went into the kitchen, and found the prisoner's boxes gone. I then went to the person who recommended her to me, to tell him. When I return'd, my wife told me the prosecutor had been rob'd; then I applied to find the porter who carried her boxes, who told me where he had left her; we then got a warrant, and took her up. [ The re the prosecutor had deposed before.]</p>

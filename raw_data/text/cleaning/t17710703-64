               <p>- Garrard. I am a gangsman: I belong to Smart's and Dyce's key; I saw the prisoner at the bar on the twenty-first of May, when I was landing a lighter of sugar; I saw this man about ten o'clock in the morning, loitering about; I took him with his hands in the hogshead, taking the sugar out, and he had a bag under his apron which he put it into: I went and seized him, and saw the bag with the sugar in. (The sugar produced.) This sugar belonged to Messrs. Christian and Smith.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going by to look for work where they were landing sugar; they cried out, Who works? I said, I will; I went, and some of the sugar came out of one of the casks; I took it up; some of the ticket porters gave me handfuls; it was as black as it could be; I was taking it off the ground.</p>

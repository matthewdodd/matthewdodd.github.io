               <p>Had you any conversation when you went with Myers? - Nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>But in general did you say any thing as to your opinion about it? - I can not say what I said.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you was satisfied he was innocent, but you must take him to the Compter? - No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Had you had any particular directions that night? - No.</p>

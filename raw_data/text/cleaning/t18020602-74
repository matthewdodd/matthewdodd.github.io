Wrights, in Henrietta-street; there were one of fifty pounds, two of twenty pounds, and ten pounds; I had them in my pocket on the 1st of May, and as I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020034"></xptr>going down by Charing-cross, towards Westminster-bridge, a man overtook me, and fell into discourse; we went into a public-house, which he fixed upon, called the Mitre, in Union-street, Westminster, where I was to write him my address; in half a minute, the prisoner, who I am sure is the man, came in, and called for a glass of ale, and down he set about two yards from me, and began talking very fast; says he, gentlemen, can you direct me to London-bridge, where the shipping lays; I said, no, I cannot; I know nothing about it, for I am a countryman; he said, he wanted to find his girl, for she was gone to see some man, and he knew where the ship lay, as he had slept with her four nights; then he said he came from the city of Coventry to take twelve hundred pounds, which his aunt had left him, and had got by keeping the poor; that he had spent two hundred pounds in gambling the night before at chalking, and I don't know what, and wanted to get it again; the other man agreed to play, and they wanted me to join them, but I refused as I knew nothing about it, and began to be frightened; there was a shilling or two on the table, and some papers, which appeared to be bank-notes; they did not go on long, when the little man, who first accosted me, asked me for a piece of paper to take my direction; I gave him a bit out of my pocketbook, and held the notes in my hand, upon which he catched them out of my hand, put them among the rest that were on the table, and the prisoner took them up, saying, they were his; that he had won, or something of that sort; then the little man took me by the arm, for I was so frightened I did not know what I did, and led me out of the room round the corner of the street, and desired I would go along with him to his banker's, where he was going to receive four hundred pounds, and he would see me righted, and that I should not be a loser; then presently, says he, no, do you go back, and see after the other man, keep him till I come, and I will see you righted; I went back, but the prisoner was gone, and the notes too; I gave notice to the Bank about the notes, and I was sent for up to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are one of the bailiffs of Horsham? - A. Yes, and have been so since last October.</p>
               <p>Q. When all these notes were on the table, your mouth watered for some, did it not? - A. No money ever tempted me.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them gambling together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the stranger and you went halves in the bets? - A. No, I suppose we might be there five minutes only; I drank a drop of rum and water with the stranger.</p>

               <p>Q. You told the landlord, I suppose? - A. I made no complaint at the house; I did not ask to see the landlord or landlady, nor did I see them; I cannot tell where I went to at first, but I found my way over to Lambeth, to my friend, Mr. Wilson's, who I mentioned it to that very afternoon.</p>

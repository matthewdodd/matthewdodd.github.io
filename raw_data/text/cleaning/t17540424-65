I had got about an hundred yards, I saw my door open; I came back again and found the prisoner behind the door; I asked her what she did there? she said, she came in there to warm herself; says I, there is no fire here, how came you to come here? I asked her what she had in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240054"></xptr> pocket, she said, it was a plate she had borrowed at the two fighting-cocks, in Fleet-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that plate your's?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I believe it belonged to the publick house down Fleet-lane. I said, What have you got in your apron? She shivered and said she had got nothing, and that she folded up her apron only to keep her warm. I said, Let me see; she then said she had got only two or three plates, but when I look'd there were five, to three of which I can swear. I asked her what was the reason she took them, and she said she was almost starved, and did not know how to get a livelihood unless by these means. There was a man coming by, whom I desired to take care of her, and went myself for a constable.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say, nor any witnesses to call.</p>

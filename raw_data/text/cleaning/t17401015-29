She could not find her Husband; so I took her Home with me to make my Bed, and then we went to Bed together. About three o'clock in the Morning I awaked, and missed Madam ; I immediately went to my Drawers, and found my Wife's clothes gone. I lost a Gown, a long camlet Cloak, a pair of Sheets, a Shift, three Razors, and a Guinea and an half.</p>

             . On Sunday Morning about 6 weeks ago, the Prisoner was swearing in St Ann's-Lane , that she had got good Gold and Silver, and good cloaths, since she came out of Newgate : I went into King-street, and met with the Prosecutor, who told me he had been robb'd; I followed the Woman immediately, and took her with the Goods upon her.</p>

            . On Sunday Morning the 6th of September, the Prisoner knocked at my Door, and told me, she was come to pay me the 6 d. she borrowed of me; she gave me a Shilling, I could not give her change, so would have given it her again, but she would not take it. She opened her Hand, and I saw a Guinea in it, I asked her how she came by it? and she said, her Brother had sent her more Money besides that; but she had spent it, and she gave it me to keep for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . I was coming along King-street, and this Man overtook me; he asked me to go along with him, for he had a House full of Lodgers, and no Wife, nor any body to clean his House: I went home with him, and he gave me a gown and coat, and I was to work it out. I never was in his House before, how then could I find the way out of it in the dark?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I gave her nothing but some Small-Beer, and a Pipe of Tobacco.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses. There is my Mistress, she knows I never wrong'd her of a Pin.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of October my father and mother were not at home; I was looking out at the window - I saw two men crossing the street; I said, "Is that you, father?" one of them said, "It is not your father, it is me, little boy, come down, I want to speak to you;" I went down, and they said, "Where is your mother and father gone? is your father gone to the watch-house?" I said I did not know - they said, "Is your father gone to the public-house?" I said I did not know - one of them said, "Come to the top of the street, I will take you to see your mother and father;" they took me to the top of the street, and then they said, "Halloo, you have not got your cap, go back and find your cap;" before I could get up stairs, the two men rushed up stairs, and the prisoner, who was one of them, went behind my father's shelf, took some shute, put it into his pocket, and ran down - I called out Murder! and Thieves! the prisoner kicked me in the mouth with his knee, as he was passing me to go down stairs - I am sure he is one of them; I cried out, "Don't take my father's shute, I shall get murdered" - the other man was taken, but this one got away then.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the office, that you did not know what I said to the boy? A.

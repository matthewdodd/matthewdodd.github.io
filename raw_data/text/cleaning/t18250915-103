On the 31st of August, he counted out forty-eight pairs of shoes, and put them into a market-basket, with a blue handkerchief over it, which he gave me to carry to Mr. Homan's, in Shoreditch. When I got as far as Shoreditch-church, I saw the prisoner, who said he would give me 1 d. to go with him down Bateman's-row. I went there, and put down my basket at the end of <placeName id="t18250915-103-crimeloc559">Princes-street, Bateman's-row</placeName>

I went home and told my master. I saw him again on Saturday, the 3d of September, when my master and I were in Old Street-road. I called Stop thief! - he ran away, and my master overtook him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HOMAN. I was with my boy on the 3d of September - he cried Stop thief! and I took the prisoner, who said, what did I collar him for. I said "For stealing some shoes;" he said he knew nothing about them. I asked what he ran away for, and he said my boy hit him a punch in the mouth, and he ran away from him.</p>

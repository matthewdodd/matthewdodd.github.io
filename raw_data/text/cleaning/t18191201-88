On the 29th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to the back of the workshop and found the padlocks were taken off the door which led to Castle-street. I looked among the carriages and found the door of one open, and both the glasses gone - the strings were left hanging to the door; they were safe at eight o'clock the night before. Next morning I heard two glasses had been stopped at Covent-garden watch-house. I went there, took the strings with me, and found they matched the part left on the carriage, they were my masters' property. The prisoner was in custody. The padlocks were wrenched off.

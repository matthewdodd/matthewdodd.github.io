               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I beg leave to inform you I left off work at a quarter-past eight o'clock, to go home: and as I came through Union-court, Holborn, on my way home, my prosecutor accosted me, and took me into custody, charging me with picking his pocket of his pocket-handkerchief; I was taken into Mr. Wilson's until he fetched a watchman who took me to the watch-house, where I was immediately searched, and nothing found on me; on the following morning I was taken to Guildhall, before the sitting Alderman, where my prosecutor stated his case; there being several people passing and repassing at the same time my prosecutor has acknowledged he did not observe me in particular from any other person following of him. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I most humbly submit my case to your humane consideration, and throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

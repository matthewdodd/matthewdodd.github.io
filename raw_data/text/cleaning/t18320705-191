I lost two hens and eight chickens on the 15th of June, from my yard at the back of my house; they were safe the evening before - I missed them about half-past five o'clock that morning; my hen-house was not locked, but was surrounded by a wall and a fence; on the Monday following the prisoner came and asked me if I did not want some person to work for me - I said No, and asked what he had done with the fowls that he and another had taken from me; he said he had not seen them - I asked if the Policeman had not stopped him, and if he had not told him his name was Field; he said No - I asked him if he had any objection to go to the station; he said No, and I sent for a Policeman, who took him to Shepherd's-bush station, where he had been stopped, and they knew him - one of my hens was a little game hen, and was lame, having had one of her legs broken - two of the chickens had small top-knots on their necks; the prisoner lived at Paddington.</p>

             (Police-constable T 108). I met the prisoner at half-past three o'clock in the morning, at Shepherd's-bush; he had a small pheasant hen in an apron, and eight speckled chickens in a bag - another lad had a small game hen; the prisoner owned that he had taken the fowls, and sold them at Paddington for 6s. 9d.</p>

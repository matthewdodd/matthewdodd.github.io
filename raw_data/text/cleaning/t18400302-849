                  </hi>. I live at Cranford, and am the wife of James Leather. The prisoner and his mother came to our house, on the 17th of February, and had a pint of ale—they were there about an hour—while they were there I had occasion to give change for sixpence—I pulled out my purse, and put the sixpence in it—I returned the purse into my pocket—I had a half-crown in my purse, and some shillings and sixpences, upwards of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—the prisoner had first sat on my left-hand, and then he removed to my right-hand side, which brought him next to my pocket—I had a child in my lap, and noticed the prisoner several times to lay his head against my pocket—he and his mother afterwards went away, and when they had been gone half-an-hour I missed my purse—I went to the prisoner's house, and asked if he had seen my purse and money—he said he had not—his father made him get out of bed and bring his clothes down, and they were searched—he declared he had never seen the purse—my son, who was with me, heard some money rattle as the prisoner was getting out of bed, his father then desired that the policeman might be sent for, and he found the purse and money between the mattress and the bed, on which the prisoner had lain—this is my purse—(<hi rend="italic">examining it.</hi>)</p>

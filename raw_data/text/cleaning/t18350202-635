                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Minerva-terrace, New-cross. I had some fowls—I saw them safe on the 25th of January, about mid-day, and on the 26th my fowl-house was broken open, and I missed two Po<lb></lb>land fowls—these are similar to them.</p>

I met the prisoner on the road, between four and five o'clock that day—I saw he was rather bulky, and asked what he had under his jacket—he said, "Nothing but an<lb></lb>other shirt"—I put my hand to his side, and said there was some<lb></lb>thing more than that—he said, "Yes, a fowl—my sister, who lives at Greenwich, gave it me"—I asked where his sister lived—he said he did not know—he then said, "Where the fair is kept, and her name is An<lb></lb>derson"—I said, "Let me look at the fowl"—he did, and then I found the other on him—this was half a mile from the prosecutor's—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and then to the cage—I found the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and I went to the prisoner, after he had been remanded—I asked him how he came to find such a curious place as where the fowls were—he then said that Captain Wilson's son told him where they were, and he wished to be <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi> for seven years, for he should be better out of the country than in it.</p>

            . The prisoner Russel gave me a watch to give to her husband, which is the man in the bar with her, she called him her husband then. I took it and carried it up stairs; he said it was the last cull's watch his wife had had, and he cut two seals off it. Overy said it was Mr. Harrison's watch, and that he was a brewer; after which I heard him say, he sold it for thirty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. What sort of a watch was your's?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It was a small watch with two seals, one with four thanks to it.</p>
               <p>Phillips. The seals I saw were the same, and the watch a small one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harrison. What colour was the string?</p>
               <p>Harrison. It was an old pink colour very dirty.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I met the prisoner in Cavendish-square, at half-past six o'clock last Sunday morning, with a load on his shoulder, covered with green baize - I went up to him, and said "What have you here?" he said "Lead, which I got from my masters;" I said, "Who is your master?" he said, "I suppose I must tell you, it is Messrs.

            ; we live in Duke-street. On the 6th of September the officer came to me - I have no doubt the solder and lead is ours; the prisoner was our apprentice for four years - I missed a great deal of solder, which is like this, cast in sand - solder is generally cast in moulds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very faint for want of victuals: a man I worked with asked me if I should be at home the night before; I said Yes; he came and brought this solder, and told me to lock it up in my box - he told me on the Sunday morning to help him carry it, and as I was going along I was stopped; he said if any one stopped me to say it was lead from my master's, and they would let me go.</p>

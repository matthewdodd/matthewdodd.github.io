                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BROWNSWORTH COX MORRISON</hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Faulkner—he has no partner—the prisoner Hedges was his carman—my master has a wharf, called Danver's Wharf, at Chelsea. On the morning of the 23rd of August he sent out a load of stones to Montpelier-square—Hedges was the driver—he went out about seven o'clock, and he took two nose-bags of food for the horses—I saw them full—I considered it my duty to watch him—Rance's house is in Pond-place—that was not exactly in the road from Danver's-wharf to Montpelier-square—it is about one hundred yards out of the road—Hedges went by Pond-place, and when he got to Rance's he stopped the cart, and took from the side of the cart a nose-bag full of chaff and corn mixed, and went with it into Rance's house—he keep a coal and potatoe-shop—Hedges remained in the house a minute or two, and then came out with Rance—I have not the slightest doubt that Raw is the man who came out with him—Rance had an empty nose-bag in his hand which he put on the front of the cart, and Hedges went on with his load—I went back and gave information to Mr. Faulkner, whom I met on the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of this wharf. In consequence of suspicion, I directed Morrison to go and watch Hedges on the morning of the 23rd of August—I received information from him—I procured the assistance of two officers, and went to Rance's house, in Pond-place Chelsea—his wife called him to me—I asked him where the corn was that my man had left there that morning—he said, "I don't know any thing about it"—he said, "I have but just got up"—I asked his wife whether she knew any thing about it—she said, "No, I have been out all the morning</p>

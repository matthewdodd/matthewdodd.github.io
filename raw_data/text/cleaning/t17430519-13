               <p>Eliz Conran. Last Monday Morning, between 7 and 8 o'Clock, the Prisoner came to our Shop; says she, I was recommended to you to buy some Cambrick: I asked her what Price she would have it; she said, about 7 s. 6 d. a Yard; (she had a Basket with Butter and Eggs, I believe she <rs id="t17430519-13-deflabel71" type="occupation">sells Butter and Eggs</rs>

She desired I would show her some Lawn; I showed her some Long Lawn, and she said she would have a Handkerchief of it, and I apprehend, at the Time I turned my Rack to get the Lawn, (for I had left several Pieces of Cambrick on the Counter) that she took an Opportunity to take the Cambrick; I had a trembling came over me, suspecting she had taken something, I looked in the Woman's Face, and immediately she shifted her Elbow very much; I heard, as I thought, a piece of Cambrick rustle, said I, Mistress, I must ask your Pardon, but I believe you have got something of mine. She denied it, and gave me very unhandsome Language; I call'd, Adam , and got some Assistance; she had a red Cloak on, I turned it on one side, and saw the Cambrick under her Arm; I snatch'd at it twice, and at the second Pull I got it from her. (The Cambrick was produc'd, which was sworn to by Mr and Mrs Conran.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took this Piece of Cambrick, and put it under my Arm, because I liked it better than any other, and never thought of stealing it; for the Minute she asked me whether I had a Piece of Cambrick of her's, I said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs Conran. I had forgot one thing, if she had not put me in Mind of it; when she bid me measure the Lawn, she said she would not have it now, but would call again for it, and went to take her Basket up, and go out of the Shop.</p>

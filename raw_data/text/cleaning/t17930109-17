Did you ever find any thing by his directions? - No, I did not, one of the runners took the other man Bailey, and the property; the Monday after the runners had taken Bailey, he sware a large oath, and said, I wish you had been at the taking of me, I would have stuck a knife into your bloody entrails, this he said when he was at the lock up room backwards at Hatton-garden.</p>

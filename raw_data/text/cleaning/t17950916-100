               <p>Q. Then after you had been at the police office, you swear that you did not get out of this house and brought back by Bradley, a watchman? - No, I did not get out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see him? -Sometime in April last; he was brought from Chelsea, enlisted by one Brown. I was in the room when he was brought in; I cannot say justly what day it was.</p>
               <p>Q. To what house was he brought? - The Star and Garter, Old Palace-yard, that was our rendezvous.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he kept? - The same as the rest; he went up and down stairs when he pleased; we were never confined only at night when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all permitted to go into the tap room as you pleased? - We were permitted now and then to go down to drink or so with a friend, but we did not run up and down there, because we paid only for the dining room.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not deny but what the watchman brought him in, but only excused for it, that he did not mean to desert? -He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you at present in this regiment of loyal louth volunteers? - Yes, I have been in the recruiting service; I came now from Watford.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been from this recruiting house? - I went away the Wednesday after he went away from the house; I come up again on this trial.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen Cooke? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you conversed on this trial? - He has not conversed with me on this trial; I was sent for last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told what to say? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were not a witness on Cooke's trial? - I was not, because I was sent off to my regiment that I then belonged to, in Dublin barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. But not being at the last trial, did not you understand what you were to prove to day? - Yes, to prove that I knew the man when he was at the Star and Garter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? - I have heard different people talk of it, not one in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not Mr. Cooke tell you so, that you were to come to prove that you remembered this man at the Star and Garter? - Certainly he did, he told me that I was subpoenaed to be an evidence for him, that I was there at the time, and so I was; I am speaking no more than what is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you came here on Friday last, that is a week ago exactly; where have you been living since you have been in town? - I have attended here almost every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Cooke been attending with you? - He has not been attending with me, he has been attending in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been at dinner together? - No, I went home to dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. You went home to this recruiting shop? - Yes, I went home, that is where I lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. You went home to the rest of your regiment? - Yes, but Cooke was not with me, never particularly, no more than any body else; I have had no conversation with him at all, the other men and me have talked together, but not sergeant Cooke.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still in the regiment? - Yes, I am.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that when you was subpoenaed, it was asked what you could prove, and what you knew of this business? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Another thing, you had no other place to live at but this recruiting house? - No, that is my place, I have no right to be any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have talked about this matter among your friends? - Yes, I have</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a very common thing for one of your comrades to be indicted for felony? - No, I should be very sorry if it was.</p>

             morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever go out of your house during that time? - Yes, he went out once to be attested, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out any other time? - Yes, on Monday evening, he was brought in by a watchman, Thomas Bradley; I see him brought in at the door; Bradley asked sergeant Cooke whether that man belonged to him, and he answered that he did, and then they went into the parlour, and I saw no more of them for a little while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in the tap room? - I carried tea to him myself in the tap room, he sat behind the door; he was in more than once to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you see him twice? - I only speak as to belief that I see him twice, but I am certain once, because I carried tea to him, and two slices of bread and butter, either on Sunday or Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he at liberty, or was he locked up? - Neither him nor no man was ever locked up in my house, nor would I suffer any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you solemnly swear that he never was locked up in any room in your house? - He was not; I set two rooms to them, one room to sleep in and another to sit in, and I would wish them to be there as much as I can, but they are all over my house. That is the man, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name did he go at your house? - By the name of

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are the landlord of this house, of course every thing is conducted in this house as it ought to be? - It might be so.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a good many other recruits in the house? - A good many.</p>
               <p>Q. You give them free liberty to run all over the house? They are not confined to one room? - They have four rooms, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had full liberty to go about every part of your house? - Yes, every part except the wine cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that as to once that you are sure that you gave him tea in the tap room, but as to any more, being on your oath, you do not choose to swear, either one way or the other? - No more! will not swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your's been a recruiting house? - Since the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many recruits in your house at different times? - A great many more than sleep there, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many recruits have you had in your house since that time, twenty or thirty? - More than that often in a week.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see him? - On the 27th of April, to the best of my knowledge on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a walter at the Star and Garter? - Yes. When I first see him he was brought in by one Brown from Chelsea, and was taken into the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour? - I cannot say, I am not particular, he came as a recruit; he was taken into a little parlour on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In what other parts did you see him? - On Sunday, and on Monday I see him in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you see him both these days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing in the tap room? - I really cannot tell, what he was doing. he might be drinking with the rest of the recruits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the recruits in general the liberty of coming into the tap room when they pleased? - Yes, at times, they drink in all parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of that man, did he appear to be much restrained, or more confined than the rest of the recruits? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him complain when he was in the house, of being robbed or I treated? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time the watchman gave any account of any man? - Yes, and that was the same man; that was on Monday, about twenty minutes after ten in the evening; Bradley brought him in and asked for Mr. Cooke the sergeant, and asked if he did not belong to him, he supposed he was going to desert.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cooke claim him? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say at that time? - I did not hear him make any defence at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not go to the justice? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you are a waiter at this rendezvous? - Yes, almost a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you continued in the employ at present by the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that he was in the tap room two days? - He was in different times on both days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always said so? - Yes, I said so before to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. That was very recent after the transaction took place that you was examined before, when sergeant Cooke was tied? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was more likely to say your recollection of the thing what had happened, then you are now? - I can recollect as well now as then.</p>
               <p>Q. So you are sure that you said at the last trial, that he was on Sunday and Monday at different times in the tap room. I will put the question that was put to you the last time, "Did you ever see him in the tap room at all" your answer was,"On Monday he was, in the forenoon, to the best of my knowledge."</p>
               <p>"Q. What was he doing there?</p>
               <p>"A. He might be drinking or sitting with the rest of the men.</p>
               <p>"Q. What part of the house on Sunday?</p>
               <p>"A. He was in different parts." On Sunday now you are sure he was in the room, how came you not to say so to the other jury? Stand down.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you state to the court the custom of the office when a recruit comes to be attested? - The attestation is brought, I get the recruit to sign his name, I witness it; then immediately after I have filled it up, and said, sworn before me, in Queen square, Westminster, I ask him if he has had the articles of war read to him? If he has been enlitted four and twenty hours? He is than taken before the magistrate, the magistrate asks him several questions, such as, if he was sober when he enlitted? if he had received his beanty? The magistrate then orders me to administer the oaths to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, are these forms invariably ovserved of the attestation of recruits at your office? - I believe there is not a recruit attested in our office but what these observation are made.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there before this time any trials that induced you to be more cautious? -</p>
               <p>Court. You were particularly cautious and more so in the month of May last - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You, on these occasions, administer an oath to the recruit? - Yes, two oaths; one to be true to his Majesty, and the other in the attestation.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that those oaths were administered to the person that appeared by the name of

               <p>Q. And when you say that William Harris was brought by Sergeant Cooke you say so because it is wrote down so in your book? - From my book and the attestation</p>

               <p>Q. The person that signs that, do you ask him his name, or any body else? - I calls the name that is entered, and he comes to me. There were but two recruits that day; the one is William Harris, by Sergeant Cooke; the other is brought by Sergeant Lovell, his name was

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Where did he bring him from? - Out of a passage close djaning to the house. That is the man that he brought, he was dressed in the same clothes as he was brought to me on Saturday, his own clothes. He went up stairs and changed them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Of course every thing that the present prisoner swore on the former trial must be false? - The greatest part of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You make your agreement with the recruit, and the recruit has the money before the magistrate, before he is attested?(The attestation read.)</p>

               <p>THOMAS RUSSELL. On the 28th of April I was going down <placeName id="t18290611-251-crimeloc1320">St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

               <p>STEWART MACDONALD. I was coming down St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner lift up the tail of Mr. Russell's coat; Mr. Russell stopped, and then he let the coat go, and went on the lamp post; the prosecutor then went as far as the watch-house, and then the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket - I am sure he is the boy.</p>

               <p>JOHN GROOM. On the 5th of May I received this handkerchief from Body, in Round-court-passage, Chandos-street; I took the prisoner; when he saw the witness and me together he ran away - but McDonald said he took the handkerchief and he was taken.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. RUSSELL. I do not know what he put into his cap, but he went between the church and the new buildings.</p>

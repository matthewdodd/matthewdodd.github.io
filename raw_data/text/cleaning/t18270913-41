I found Sanderson there when I first went, and understood from him that he had been there nearly fifteen years. Soon after I went there, Sanderson told me, that if I was short of cash, I was to sell coffee or tea, and apply the money to my own use, for what I was deficient. I said nothing to that. I told Mr.

             of it about a week afterwards, or it might be more. Soon after, the prosecutors kept a more diligent watch over their property, and in about four months had pedlocks put on all their cannisters.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the 24th of July, do you remember some paper coming in? A. Yes; one ream of thin blue and one ream of thin white; we use it to pack tea and coffee for the retail trade only - it would last a long time, as we have very little retail business; it was placed on a back shelf, near the bottom of the counter - Sanderson had access to it. On the 24th I made this memorandum of the paper in hand - there were sixteen quires of blue, fifteen of white, and eight of brown, which we call bag-cap; on the 27th I looked again, there were fourteen of blue, twelve of white, and seven of bag-cap; we had not cut up any of that paper for bags or any thing, nor had we used any of it; what became of the rest I cannot say, but none of it had been used in the business whatever - it could not have been taken for the business without my knowledge, nor could any such quartity have been consumed in business in so few days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you enter the prosecutors' service? A. On the 27th of October, 1825. Sanderson made the communication to me within a month or six weeks; I told Mr. Green about a week afterwards - Sanderson remained in their service till July last; there are four servants in all, including myself; there is a female and a boy beside me and Sanderson - the female had no access to the shop. Mr. Henry Green was always in the business, and Mr. John, occasionally - it is Sanderson's duty to make the bags; I sleep in the house; the paper was kept on an open shelf - the shop is locked up at eight o'clock at night, and I kept the key; the servants have access to the paper in the day time, but I can tell what would be used; the boy or Sanderson could take it when they wanted it - I swear it had not been used in the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could such a quantity be used without your knowledge? A. It could not; it would take a long time to make it into bags, and we never use it for bags - I had a particular reason for taking down the quantity there. I travel sometimes - but was not out during this time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 24th of July, was there a stock of bags so as not to require more to be made? A. Yes; the bags are made of cartridge paper - not of this sort.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Clement's-lane, and am the eldest son of Mr. Green. I supply the paper for the business - in July last I sent them a ream of double crown blue, and one of double wove yellow, and some other papers; in consequence of what was said to me I advised Jordan what to do about the paper - I have since seen some paper produced; it is impossible to swear to paper - but, to the hest of my judgment, it corresponds in every particular, and I believe it to be part of the reams which I delivered them; it is of the same quality, size, fabric, and from the same maker - I compared it with what was left; there was no wrapper on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you supplied them with paper? A. About seven years; I have sold them a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130047"></xptr>great quantity in that time. I called there about ten minutes after it was delivered - I saw it on the floor of their warehouse; I do not deal with several manufacturers - the same maker supplies other people, no doubt - I will not swear that the paper had ever been in my possession; the blue was charged 27s. a ream, and the white about 25s.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do the prosecutors have as much paper as a retail dealer would take? A. Much less; I suppose two or three reams of each sort of this paper would be more than their supply for the year.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are they machine or hand papers? A. I believe these are not machine paper; the edge of machine paper is cut, and hand paper is not.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my son Henry. Sanderson had been about fifteen years in our employ, and was confidentialy employed, till I had reason to suspect him - I am seldom in town. In July last, in consequence of what came to my knowledge, I called him into the counting-house, about three o'clock in the afternoon - it was on a Tuesday, towards the end of the month. I desired Mr. Jordan to repeat, in his presence, what he had said to me; he said he had lost several quires of paper. I had made him no promise of forgiveness, or said any thing at all to him; Jordan said he had missed five quires of paper - that he had taken an account every morning of what there was for several days, and every day had missed some; the prisoner was silent, or said he knew nothing about it, I forget which; I then said there was a rogue in the house, and that he was the man. I observed that he shook a little; he said he knew nothing about it; I persisted that it was him; and at last he acknowledged that he had taken it, and if I would look over it, he would do so no more, and would pay me for what he had taken. I told him that would not be done - that it was not that alone, but I had to accuse him of a great many other things, as he must be aware of - he denied any thing else. I saw him again before I went out, and asked what he had done with the paper - he said he had sold it; and, after some hesitation, he said he sold it to a man in Lime-street, without naming him, and got 6d. a quire for it; after some further conversation, I sent for Wiltshire, the officer. I then said, "Will you tell this officer where you have sold the paper?" he named the man soon after; two officers left the place with him. I went out of town, and next morning I saw the paper at the Mansion-house - it appeared in every respect part of the paper missing. Jordan produced two quires of the paper, and it appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you take an active part in the business? A. Not now, nor did I in 1825.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my father; soon after Jordan came into our employ he made a communication to me, respecting Sanderson; and after that I had frequently missed property in small quantities, which could hardly be missed at the time. I had a padlock put on the large tea cannisters; I afterwards missed other things; there was paper missing in July last; the circumstance was mentioned to me on the 27th; I ordered the paper to be counted daily - but I believe that was done before, when I was out of town - I was not present at the conversation with Sanderson, so as to give a particular account of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had something been said to you about a half-crown piece? Yes; I never heard my father say he should be forgiven if he made a communication. Jordan gave me information within a month of the time when he came. I missed property the next day, and almost daily afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was your reason for keeping Sanderson? A. I wished positively to discover who the thief was, and not to accuse any body improperly; the deprodations were always trifling; but the whole, together, was considerable.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of July, I went from Messrs. Greens' with Sanderson - he took me to the house of Bewick, No. 30, Lime-street; "Dealer in marine-stores" is written over the door; the stock chiefly consisted of old iron, rags, and such things - when we came to the door the prisoner Bewick was in the back part of the passage; Sanderson said,"That is the man I sold the paper to;" I went up to Bewick, and said, "Where is the paper you purchased of this man?" Bewick answered, I never bought any of him;' he then opened the door, and we went into the shop, which is a dark place backwards. I again said,"Now, where is the paper you bought of this person?" he said, "I never bought any of him." Sanderson said, "Yes, you bought some of me yesterday;" Bewick then took up some loose sheets of paper, which laid on the top of a quire of brown, and a quire of white which I produce; Sanderson then took hold of the two quires, and said, "This is the paper;" I then took Bewick and the paper into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two quiros concealed from view? A. No; it might he seen under the loose cloth. I have had it ever since - Mr. Green saw it at the Mansion-house, he compared, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From first to last he denied buying it of Sanderson? A. He did; his shop is on the ground floor - he opened an inner door to admit us - but when I first saw him in the passage he slammed that door too - there might be more paper in the place, but I did not search for more - this was all Sanderson pointed out - he did not say, in Bewick's presence, what he sold it him for.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many thousand quires you may have sold in a year, you cannot say? A. I supply nobody but my father with that sort of paper - the manufacturer may sell a large quantity.</p>

            . I am a wholesale stationer, and carry on business at Bull Wharf-lane, Thames-street. I have dealt with Bewick, and sold him paper of different sorts at different times, bag-cap and small-hand; I do not know that I ever sold him any like that produced; small hand is about half the size of this; I may probably have sold him paper like that produced, but not lately - not within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130048"></xptr>the last three years; I should think this bag-cap is heavier than what I have sold him - it is impossible to identify bagcap - the maker could not do it, not to distinguish one sheet from another.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you sell him any paper at all? A. About three months ago; I sold him bag-cap, small-hand, and lumber-hand - it is perhaps, five years since I have sold him any of the sort produced; I believe I have sold it within seven years, but not within five; I sold him some paper about one month before I sold the bag-cap - I generally sold him a ream or a bundle at a time - I do not believe any of this paper to have been sold by me.</p>

I have sold Bewick some paper; I am what is termed a jobber; my cousin, in Gracechurch-street, is a wholesale dealer; I have sold the prisoner some bag-cap; I have sold him some white paper like this, of this fineness and quality - it was machine cut, and so is this; I have sold him some quires of it, some reams, or bundles I should say - I will not swear that this is the paper I sold him, but it was similar; I defy any manufacturer to swear to a single quire of paper. I have sold him some bag-cap like this, but after it goes out of my hand I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you sell him any bagcap? A. I think about the middle of July - I have not brought my books here - I was not desired - I generally sell for ready money - I do not deliver invoices - I take it my self, and receive the money; I think I sold him three bundles, one of bag-cap, and two of this sort, which is double crown - I believe this is machine cut; I bought my paper of my cousin in July last - I bought about 25l. worth altogether, but not more of this sort than I sold to Bewick - this paper is similar to that; I will swear it is the same quality - it is as near the size as can be - I cannot swear to half an inch - it was about the 10th of July.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you have sometimes sent him invoices? A. I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you appear at the Mansion-house when Bewick was under examination? A. No; I was not desired to attend.</p>
               <p>W. WILTSHIRE re-examined. Bewick was remanded from the Wednesday till the Friday, to bring forward invoices of the party whom he said he bought the paper of.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 29th of March, I saw the prisoner in Drury-lane, standing by a cookshop—I said, "You seem very cold"—she said, "I am cold and hungry too"—I said, "Well, step with me, I have got an old gown I will give you to wear"—she went to my house—I looked out an old gown and shift, and while she was putting those things on, I went to the cupboard, and cut her a slice of bread—I told her to sit by the fire, and warm herself; and while she was eating the bread, I said, "You can go and get yourself something to drink,"—I gave her a shilling to</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Two Brewers in Little St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials. On Thursday morning, the 30th of March, the prisoner came to my house, and came to the bar with her bosom quite open, and seemed tipsy—I said, "What do you do with your bosom open, why don't you pin it up?"—I reached across the bar, and took this watch from her bosom, and said, "How came you by this?"—she said, "My grandmother gave it to me, and she lives in Marylebone-lane"—I did not believe her, and gave her into custody.</p>

I met the prosecutor in Drury-lane, about twelve o'clock—he asked me to go home with him—I said, I did not know how far he had to go—he said, "Not far"—he took me to his house, and gave me gin and water, and cut me a slice of ham and bread—while in conversa<lb></lb>tion, I certainly happened to say I had been very much distressed latterly, it being a severe winter; and from that, it appears, he has taken my words from me, and made it out charity—but before I went home with him, nothing passed about being distressed—when I told him that, he gave me a gown, but nothing else—he said he thought "it would look better than the one I had on, and I had it on at Bow-street—he said he was a working man, and had a little money, but he should want that—that he had to go out next morning, and would trust the watch with me, and I was to bring it to him at ten o'clock the following morning—accordingly I did not part with it—after being in his company nearly an hour, he gave me a shilling to fetch gin—I could not get it, and returned—he said he was shutting the back parlour—I said, "I did not know whether I was right or not"—I sat down full a quarter of an hour, and as he did not come out, I thought he had somebody particular there, so I got up, and went home.</p>

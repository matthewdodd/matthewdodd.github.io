            . I am a servant to Mr. Penton; the prisoner came to work between six and seven o'clock in the morning, he came to about three yards off me, where there was a quantity of metal in a cask; he made a stoop over the cask, I was rather confident that he took something out of it. I communicated the circumstance to Dowton, and while we were talking the prisoner went into the street, we both went after him. Dowton laid hold of him by the collar and asked him where he was going, he said he was going to get a glass of gin. Dowton put his hand in his pocket and felt the metal there. I saw him take it out, it weighs eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>- DOWTON. I took it out of the prisoner's pocket. I can swear it is Mr. Penton's property.</p>

Before I came to East Smithfield I saw somebody stand at a door; I asked if that was the right-road to Tower-Hill; the prisoners walked by me; they said that is the way; I followed them; instead of leading me into East Smithfield, they took me up another street out of the way; I believe they call it <placeName id="t17721209-17-crimeloc93">Red-cross-street, towards Ratcliffe-highway</placeName>

I catched at it; she threw it upon the floor, and said to the other, make off, make off you bitch! She catched me by my breast and strove to hold me while Jones made her escape; I pulled her up by main-strength and gave her a turn down. they made to the door before me. I catched Clarke before she was out of the door; the other got off.

               <p>Ramsay. The clock had not struck six.

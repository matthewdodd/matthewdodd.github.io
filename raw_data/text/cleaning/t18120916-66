He is sick a-bed. On my going out I saw the prisoner, Buzar, I asked him, what o'clock it was; he said, twenty minutes after five. It was quite light then. I returned home about nine the same morning. I lost two sheets, two shirts, an handkerchief, an apron, and a gown; some were in a basket and some were in a box. I had seen them all before I went out in the morning. The property is here but the gown. I know they are my property.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing with him - A. Not that time. Afterwards he came down, and asked me to lend him three halfpence. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards he came in with a bag, and had the three halfpence. He went out of my house with a bag. He returned very shortly, and went up stairs. I said, is that you, John. He replied, yes, softly. I went out to the bottom of the court to get a dram for me and my wife. I met him at the bottom of the court. He said, I have been into your room to borrow a halfpenny. He said, make it up sixpence. I lent him the fourpence halfpenny. He did not return until between four and five in the afternoon. He said, take the key of my door. There was an alarm that Mrs. Kenney had been robbed. I went in his room, and found two handkerchiefs and an apron. Mrs. Kenney owned the handkerchiefs and apron directly. The prisoner told me to go to

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there no other persons behind you? A. Yes, but you were the nearest - you did ask me if I knew you, and I said No; I meant I was not acquainted with you - I cannot swear you took the handkerchief, or passed it; I saw the others with you, and talking to you - I did not follow the other men; I followed you, and did not lose sight of you - your friends have been with me: I said I would not swear positively you had the handkerchief or passed it to the other persons - they went to Marlborough-street, learned my residence, and begged and prayed of me not to swear to you - I believe the prisoner is respectably connected; he is an apprentice to Mr. Maberly.</p>

I went with a number of other police-constables, on the 19th of April, about one o'clock in the afternoon, to No. 3, Peartree-street, Westminster—the outer door of the house was open—I went up stairs to the second-floor front room—the door of that room was securely fastened with an iron bolt and a chair behind it, and the bedstead against it—I broke the door open, and then found it had been barricaded in this manner—when I got in I saw the male prisoner standing on a chair be<lb></lb>hind the door—his coat and waistcoat were off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up—he resisted very much—I pushed him into the arms of Neville, and at that time I saw his wife raise up the window with her left hand, and put her right hand out—that was after I had given her husband into custody—I gave Hawkins instructions to take the woman into custody—I looked at the fire<lb></lb>place—there was a clear coke and coal fire burning—it was rather a fierce fire—close to the fire-place there was a table, on which was a number of counterfeit sixpences, some in a tea-cup and some on the table—I laid hold of them—they were warm—eight of them were filled at the edges, and three</p>

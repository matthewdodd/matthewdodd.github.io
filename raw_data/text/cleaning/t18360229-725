                  </hi>. I live just by the Swan on Finchley-common, about half a mile from Whetstone. I know Friern Barnet—it is in Mid<lb></lb>dlesex, about a mile from Hartfordshire, I believe—I am sure it is in Middlesex—I was at the Bricklayers' Arms, at Friern Barnet, on the 25th of January—I went there to have a pint of beer—I sold a shovel there to Frederick Hattersley, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was sitting in the corner when I went in, and he asked me to give him some beer—I gave him some—he asked me several times to lend him sixpence, or pay for a pot of beer for him—I said I had no money to lend—he said he would be d—if he did not see, and he threw me backwards across his knees—hr forced his hand into my right-hand jacket pocket, and then into my watch-fob, and took a shilling—I am sure I had a shilling in my fob—I had seen it there a quarter of an hour before—nothing had occurred by which I could have lost it—I saw it between his thumb and finger when he drew it out—he gave me a farthing and a piece of pencil back, which he had taken from my right-hand jacket pocket—I asked him to give me the shilling—he said the farthing and pencil was all he had got—I said I should fetch an officer if he did not return the shilling—I did so—the prisoner was in company with two or three more at the public-house—he had re<lb></lb>moved from the Bricklayers' Arms, when I went with the officer, with his companions, and he was taken at a beer-shop, about two hundred yards from the Bricklayers' Arms—the same party were still with him—there were four of them—when I gave him into custody, one of them came round to me, and asked if I meant to give him in charge—I told him I had done so—that was in the prisoner's hearing—the man then struck me violently—the prisoner was taken away in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the afternoon of the 25th of January, Ing came to me and complained of being robbed—I went with him to the Bricklayers' Arms—the prisoner was not there—I found him at the Hand and Flower beer-shop—the prosecutor was sober—I see no difference in him now to what he was then—he ran to my house for me, and walked back with me to the house, as sober as he is at this moment—two persons, named Peet and Banks, were at the beer-shop also—I told the prisoner he was my prisoner—he was charged with feloniously robbing Alexander Ing of one shilling—Peet and Banks wanted to return the shilling back to the prosecutor—they asked him if he would take the shil<lb></lb>ling back which he said he had robbed him of, and they proposed to pay me for my trouble—that was in the prisoner's hearing—I was taking him out of the house at the time the request was made to me and the prosecutor—I told them I could not do business in that way, I must take the case before a Magistrate, and he must decide on it—I did not find any shilling on the prisoner—both Peet and Banks spoke, but Peet was the man who requested the shilling to be paid back—he said, "Will you take the shil<lb></lb>ling back, and say no more about it?" and offered to pay me for my trouble—no money was produced—I said I would not suffer it—I found nothing relating to this charge on the prisoner—the beer-shop is about two hundred yards from the Bricklayers' Arms—they were drinking a pot of beer when I entered the room, and called for two pots of beer after I went in, which was paid for, but I don't know whether the shilling was paid or not.</p>

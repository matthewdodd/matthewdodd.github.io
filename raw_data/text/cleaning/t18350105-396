                  </hi>. I have come from the Compter. I was admitted a wit<lb></lb>ness by the Alderman, as an accomplice. On the 13th of December, I was in Fleet-street, in company with Swindle—we were not out for the purpose of thieving—I had no knowledge of thieving—I did not know what he was going about—I did not see Swindle draw the pocket-book out, till after Tipper picked it up—I did not know Tipper before, but there was a pocket-book on the pavement, and Tipper picked it up—I did not know how it came on the pavement—I was with Swindle—I hardly know whether it was near us, or at a distance—we all three stooped together, quite close to one another—the book was on the pavement when Tipper picked it up—he tapped us on the shoulder—Swindle turned round, and said, "Tipper, it is me"—Tipper said, "I did not know you, but it is all right"—the book was then on the ground—Tipper stooped and picked it up, facing Carlile's window—he then went down the street by the side of Carlile's—he looked at the book, opened it, and said there wes nothing in it—he was sorry for it, and it was a bad job—he asked us if we were going to stand treat—we said no, we had no money—Tipper said he would not say any thing about the book, for he would sooner—(<hi rend="italic">drawing his hand across his throat</hi>)—he wished us a good afternoon, and we went away—it was then four o'clock on Saturday evening—on the Tuesday evening following, I was in company with Swindle, and saw Tipper again at the corner of Farringdon-street—we were standing there—Tipper came up to us, and asked us why we did not go to work, for there were plenty of hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050052"></xptr>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Go back for a moment to the day when this pocket-book was taken off the pavement; did you see any policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw one who was No. 91, not above a minute before, in Fleet-street—I did not notice any one afterwards—I did not see Swindle again till the Tuesday—I was taken as, a thief before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I dare say you were greatly astonished at being taken up as a thief; you that told my friend you had no intention of steal<lb></lb>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was astonished, at the moment, that Tipper should take me for the book—I was astonished that a charge of theft should be made against a man like me—I did not know what the <hi rend="italic">"swell mob"</hi> meant—I have read in newspapers, it is a better sort of thieves—I do not particularly know what it meant—I have come here to speak the truth, and I have spoken it—I was in earnest when I said I had no intention of stealing, and I did not know that Swindle had, or I would have quitted his com<lb></lb>pany—if I had known he had done any thing dishonest, I would have gone and told some policeman—I thought Tipper was acting dishonestly, when he said it was a bad job that there was nothing in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why did not you tell of Tipper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer—I have never been placed in this place before—I have come here to-day for the sake of justice, not to save myself—I knew nothing about it—I did not know the book was stolen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the whole progress of this transaction do you mean to tell the Jury you did not know it was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the end I did, when Tip<lb></lb>per picked it up, and I thought Swindle stole it—I did not seize him nor call to any policeman—I dare say there was no policeman there at the time—I cannot say why I did not inform against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were never taken up before, I am sure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> O yes, Sir, I have—Tipper took me up once, before this pocket-book—I did not bear him any good-will for that—I have not been taken up by any body but him for the last three years—I was taken by an officer—I do not know who—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050053"></xptr>
               <p>Tipper took me up for walking along the street, and I would not <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> any thing to drink—the other officer took me for carrying some chairs on my head, which had been given me to carry—I was taken to the Compter and to Guildhall—I was committed by the Alderman for a month to Bridewell—I did not produce the person who gave me the chairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you draw your hand across your throat, as you have done here, at Guildhall or the Justice-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir, I did not forget it, but I have been to a place where no one could have told me any thing—what I have stated is the truth—I stated that I saw the <hi rend="italic">swell mob</hi>, and Tipper walked off with three of them—what I said, was read over to me after I stated it, and I put a mark to it—I cannot write.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it read over to you that Tipper went away with three of the <hi rend="italic">swell mob? A</hi>. Why, Sir, it is a long while—I forget—it is three weeks ago next Friday—I did not mention about the countryman and the brown purse full of money—I did not think of it at the time—I don't know whe<lb></lb>ther I said any thing about Dixon's repository—I did not go out with any intention of stealing—I would not steal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am patrol of St. Bride's. I have known Tipper four or five years, but was not particularly acquainted with him—when I first knew him, he was in the Metropolitan Police, but I was not in it above nine months myself—I merely know that he was in the force—on the 16th of December I was in Fleet-street, coming off my beat, and was called by Hall—there are three regular patrols, and two extra men on duty—they come on at six o'clock—in the daytime there are policemen there—any body might call them at a minute's warning, I should think—when I was called, I found Tipper at the corner—I knew his face—he said, "O, is it you?"—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "I have a little job in hand, but I have been so ill-used by some of your City men, that I don't like to give it to every body—I should like to find a person I could de<lb></lb>pend upon—they will be here directly, let us go over to the other corner"—the boys then came up, and I took them in charge—before they came, Tip<lb></lb>per said they had drawn a gentleman of his pocket-book in Fleet-street, opposite Carlile's, that he had the book about him; and I was to mind how I handled them, for they were <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> customers—he had had to deal with them before—he said they drew the pocket-book, and ran down Bouverie-street—that he went after them, and picked it up—he said, "Swindle turned round and said, 'Tipper, you won't <hi rend="italic">come it</hi> upon us'—and he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050054"></xptr>
               <p>"No, of course not"—we took the boys to the station-house—nothing passed in going along; but, when we got inside, he said to the boys, "I can<lb></lb>not help it"—it was about half-past seven o'clock—I said to the Ward beadle, "He gives charge of these two boys for stealing a pocket-book on Saturday afternoon"—Tipper gave the charge himself—he said, he had witnessed these boys taking a pocket-book from a gentleman, and he had the book now in his possession—in going down Farringdon-street to the Compter, Swindle said something to me—I afterwards told Tipper of it at a public-house—I said, "Do you know what Swindle said of you?"—he said "God perish me blind if he did not take the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> from me when we <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> it—I suppose he meant a pocket-book—I have heard them called <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>—I told Tipper this in a public-house opposite St. Sepulchre's church—in going up Fleet-street, Tipper said, "Let us go and have some beer"—I said, "No, let us first go and deposit the prisoners in the Compter," which we did—we then went to the public-house—I then told him what Swindle had said, and he said, "Well, I don't deny it, I did take it from them—in fact, I have so completely mixed myself up with the thieves, since I left the County, that I can do any thing I please with them; in fact, I do as I please"—on going to pay for the beer, he pulled out some silver and gold from his pocket, and said, "I am not without the b—y <hi rend="italic">yellow men</hi>, you see—I get them easy"—I said, "Well, as you are so careless about them, you had better give us one"—he said, "No, I may want them in the way of business"—he said, "I will pay for this pot, and you pay for the next"—I said, "No, I want no more," and we left the house—in going down Fleet-lane, I said, "Have you known Swindle and Hammond long?"—he said, "Yes; and, in fact, I know almost all the thieves in London—I think they had better have kept me <hi rend="italic">trapping</hi>, but I think I shall leave off <hi rend="italic">trapping</hi> altogether, and stick to thieving—I think it is best"—I have been a patrol four years and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>house that was open—I did not take him home, because he would not tell me where it was, till I got to the coffee-shop—I did not take any thing there but some coffee—I paid for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a patrol of St. Bride's. I was sent for from the watch-house to accompany Ruberry and Grigg, to take Swindle and Hammond to the Compter—I then went to the public-house with Tipper, Grigg, and Ruberry, where we had a pot of beer—as we were going along, Swindle said, "Tipper took the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> from us, and now he is coming against us"—when we were in the public-house, Tipper said he was so linked up with these thieves that he did not know how to got rid of them—he then pulled some money out of his waistcoat pocket—he took out a sovereign from among the other money, held it between his fingers, and said, "You see I am not without the b—y <hi rend="italic">yellow men</hi> yet"—Roberry immediately says, "Perhaps you can spare us one of them, as you have got so careless with them?" he said, "No, I may want them in the way of business"—as we were going down Fleet-lane, I turned to Tipper and Ruberry, who were walking behind, and asked Tipper if he was aware that Swindle had been tried last Session—he said, "O yes, and we had some<lb></lb>thing to drink on the strength of it"—it is part of my duty to be in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know whether Swindle and Hammond might have been found from the Saturday till the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw them walking together in Fleet-street—I did not see Tipper these—I had seen Hammond about with other pickpockets—I did not know him in the House of Correction—Tipper and Ruberry were together when I spoke to Tipper—they were pretty near—Tipper answered me—I spoke in a moderate talking tone—I dare say Ruberry might hear me—I am not aware that he is deaf—he could not be <hi rend="italic">off</hi> of hearing it, I am certain—I was in the public-house—I heard Ruberry say to Tipper, "Give us one of them"—I had known Swindle about twelve months, and Hammond not so long—Tipper said he wanted to get rid of the thieves—I did not hear him ask Ruberry to treat him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>this freedom without my asking him any questions—I had never seen him before—I had seen Swindle and Hammond together after the Saturday—I could have taken them a dozen times over.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable No</hi>. 91.) I was on day duty in Fleet-street on Saturday, the 13th of December—I went off about a quarter before seven o'clock—if any alarm had been given of a robbery, I should think 1 could have taken the party—according to the best calcula<lb></lb>tions I can make, I must have been within twelve yards of the place—I saw Tipper that evening about six o'clock—he was on the other side of the way—he did not tell me of any felony being committed near Carlile's—he knew me well, and that I have been on that beat two years and a half—I know Swindle and Hammond very well by sight—if he had given me any charge respecting them, I could have taken them before Tuesday, if he had given me a description, and I had met persons answer<lb></lb>ing that description—I did not know their names, but I could have taken them twice—I saw Tipper on Tuesday, between two and three o'clock, in Fleet-street—he came to me and said, "I wish I had seen you on Satur<lb></lb>day afternoon, I would have given two boys into your custody, about four o'clock"—I said, "You need not have gone far to find me; what had they been doing?"—he said, "I saw them <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> a gentleman of a pocket-book, and they ran down Bouverie-stret—a little before they got half-way down, they dropped the pocket-book—I stooped down to pick it up, and they made their escape—if you hear of any one that has lost it, I can take the boys at any time I like"—he told me this on the Tuesday afternoon—he did not say one word to me about it on Saturday evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> On Saturday, the 13th, I had been into Fleet-street to make purchase of a hand of pickled pork—on returning, I saw Swindle and Hammond go behind two gentlemen—Swindle drew the pocket-book and passed it to Hammond, who dropped it—I instantly said, "Pick that up; you have picked that gentleman's pocket." They said, "For God's sake say nothing about it." I made use of several words, but seeing no officer handy, I suffered them to depart, but it was my in<lb></lb>tention to find the prosecutor, if possible—I had no chance of taking them then, I had a basket in my hand, and I knew I could take them when I found the prosecutor.</p>

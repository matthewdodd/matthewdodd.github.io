I had been to No. 9 there, to get two doors, which I brought to No. 6; I saw the tool basket on the prisoner's head, facing the house - I asked him where he got it; he said he had found it. I brought him into the house, and said to my men, who were at work, "Here is my basket of tools," and while I went to get a pair of shoes on he got away into the Harrow-road; he took up two stones, and swore he would kill any man who came near him; at last we got him into the fields - three farmer's men came up, and we got him on his back and secured him; a man came up who had been an officer, and handcuffed him, and as we were bringing him along he begged for a pint of beer: when he got that he ran away like a shot; I pursued him, and took him in about three quarters of an hour; he had the County dress of the prison on him.</p>

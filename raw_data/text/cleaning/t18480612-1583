                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs. On 11th June I wason a vessel near the West India Dock entrance—a coal-barge was lying atthe next buoy above, a boat, with a white streak, like a ship's punt, came toit from the ship above, about three o'clock in the morning—there were twomen in it—I could not see their faces; I described their dresses—the pri<lb></lb>sonersare very much like them—one was a pood deal taller than the other—the short one got out; the other one handed him a basket out of the boat—he put some coals in it, and handed it to the one in the boat, who put it intothe water, shook it, and then capsized it into the boat—they did that severaltimes—then the short one got into the boat, and they went towards Com<lb></lb>mercial Docks—I saw a police-boat, gave information, and in about half anhour they came back with the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector</hi>.) I was on the river about half-pastthree o'clock, on 11th June, I received information, and overtook a boat, sharp at each end, answering the description I had received, and the prisonersin it, going to warns Greenwich—I got into it, and found about 13 1/4 cwt. ofcoals, and a dredge, which they get coals up out of the river with; it is a neton a stick; it is not like a basket—it had mud on it—I asked the prisoners howthey accounted for the coals—Varnham said, "Some we picked up on theshore, and some we dredged up on the river"—I went to tlte barge <hi rend="italic">Timothy</hi>, which Scanlan pointed out—there was a hole in the coals, where a largequantity had been taken out—they were the same sort.</p>

               <p>I did not turn them over—I could not ascertain whether those on the surfacehad been dredged up;—the not appeared to have been used—they were notusing it when 1 saw them—Varnham wore a white frock; I think whiter than—the one he has now, and Daken was dressed the same as now—one's frockwas much darker than the other's—one of them was a very lame—there was abasket in the boat; it was quite clean; it had not been used for coals, unlessit had been washed since.</p>

            . On the 1st of this instant, my wife and daughter were gone out: and these things were lost out of a fore-room up stairs (there is a door to the entry, on one side of the shop) and when my wife and daughter came home, they missed them. I advertised them several times, and on the 13th of this month, Mr. Sherrar, a pawnbroker, came to me, and said, he believed by an advertisement he had seen, he had got some of my things in his custody; that he knew the woman who brought them, for she had been several times at his shop, and may be she might come again; and if she came again, he would stop her: and he stopped her with a gown and a pair of stays.

            . The Prisoner at different times brought to me, one gown, three shifts, one apron, an under petticoat, and a pair of jumps. On the 13th of May, I saw these things advertised, and they are very remarkable; so I went to Mr. Morton's, and acquainted him with it. The Prisoner came next day, and I stopped her: she used to bring wearing apparel of her husband's, almost every week, and I never suspected her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her husband?</p>
               <p>Sherrar. He is a journeyman carver, his name is Boswell, he is a man of a pretty good reputation, he works with a carver in Long Acre. She said, she lived in Dirty Lane in Holborn; (there are two places called Dirty Lane,) one in Holborn, and the other in Long Acre; and I found she lodged in Parker's Lane in Drury Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at my chairwoman's house on the 1st of May, from two o'clock in the afternoon, till eleven at night; and Mr. Morton said, they were taken away at two o'clock on the first of this instant. I met an acquaintance of mine, one Mrs. Jones, who lived in Essex, one day as I was going to Clare Market, and she told me, her aunt was dead, and had left her her clothes, and desired to know, if I could recommend her to an honest pawnbroker: I told her I knew a very honest man; then she desired me to pawn them for her; I said, I was not willing to do it, she had better pawn them herself; but as she desired me to do it, I pawned them to Mr. Sherrar, where I used to go, and I would have taken her up to have cleared my self, if I could have found her. She said, she would pull the black gown and petticoat to pieces, to make herself mourning for her aunt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blower. Your landlady said, you had picked that black gown to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Sherrar I was very sorry they were stolen, and that the woman I had them from was at the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Sherrar. She did say the woman she had them of [Mrs. Jones] was waiting at the end of the street; I sent to see, and there was no such person there.</p>

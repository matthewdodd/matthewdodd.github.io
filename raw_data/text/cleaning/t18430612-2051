                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. I have been living lately at the Bell Tavern, Wellington-street, strand, as cook—my husband was liv<lb></lb>ing during that time at Wimbledon-common—on Thursday the 25th of May, I received this letter from him—it is his handwriting—"Mary Ann Clarke, at the Bell Tavern, Wellington-street, North Strand, May 23, 1843, 9 o'clock. My dear Wife, I just received your letter, but you are so fond of that <hi rend="italic">feller</hi> as you were a living with, as I wonder your sending to me, as you do not intend to come home to live with me; but I assure you that I have known no woman since you have been away from me; for I have the confidence still to think you will return home and make me happy once more. I have one thing to tell you, that is, you have heard me speak of my uncle, and at his death I should receive 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have had a letter from the lawyer to say he is dead, and died on the 25th of August last, and we all brothers and sisters are to meet on the 25th of August next to receive our dividends, but he has not said how much: but my brother wrote to me on Saturday to tell me that the lawyer told him that it was above 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and be it right I will bid fare<lb></lb>well to sawing. So now, my dear wife, if you have got the love for me, as I always thought you had, return home to me and make me happy once more as before you left me. I thought there was no man so happy as myself; and since then, I have been so unhappy, I hope you will consider yourself and come home, and be comfortable, and make me the same. Several people have tried to persuade me to take a warrant out against you; but how can I hurt</p>

               <p>the woman I love better than my own self? it is impossible for me to do it, as the love I have for you, no person knows besides myself. My housekeeper is a going to leave me, for she has a cook's place in London, and she is going to it in a fortnight. So, now, my dear wife, let me know your mind by the return of post. So no more at present, from your ever dutiful and loving husband,</p>

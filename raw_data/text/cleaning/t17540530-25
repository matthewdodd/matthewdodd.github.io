               <p>William Eagen. I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, and as I came down out of my own room, Mrs. Poor's maid desired I would look into the room to see what the prisoner was about: I looked in, and saw the trunk open, and saw some linnen in it; I ran up stairs, and asked the maid how her mistress came to leave the trunk open; and when we came down there was the flap over the lock buckled too?</p>

               <p>William Eagen. It was shut, and buckled down with that strap, and there was either a picklock or key broke in the lock. When Mrs. Poor came home I saw it opened, and there were not all the things taken out.</p>

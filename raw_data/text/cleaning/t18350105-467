                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and carry on business at No. 37, Crosby-row, Walworth-road, in the parish of Newington. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, and always treated him like a brother—he has been at my house for two months at a time—on the 16th of August he had been staying at my house for some days—we went together to Brentford on the 15th, and returned home together—he slept that night in my first floor room—it was on Friday—on Saturday morning, the 16th, my breakfast was brought into my bed-room by the prisoner—he said, "Are you going to get up?"—I said, "No; I shall not get up yet"—he said nothing about leaving at all—not at any time—I did not see him again till the 9th of December, when he was in custody—I found about half-past twelve o'clock that morning that my cash-box and its contents were gone—I went to his brother-in-law after him, and gave notice, offering a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>—on Monday, the 18th, I received a paper parcel by the Woolwich carrier—this is the parcel, it is in the same condition as when I received it—when I last saw my cash-box, the lease of my house was in it, also this policy, and these letters, which are in the parcel, delivered to me by the carrier—there was an address on the parcel, as also on a second white cover, which it has—I have often seen the pri<lb></lb>soner write, and have a great deal of his writing—I have seen him write frequently—I believe the address on the white paper to be the prisoner's writing—it has the appearance of it—the writing on the brown paper is similar to the writing on the white—I believe that is in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—when we were at Brentford that day, the prisoner mentioned that he was in great difficulties, and was indebted to the landlady 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he must go and pledge, to "raise the wind."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's mother, and was living with him. The prisoner had been staying with him some time—on the 15th of August I took the cash-box out of the cupboard, up to bed: I counted the money—there was 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, one £5 note, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I placed the box under my pillow—I found it there when I awoke in the morning, took it down, placed it in the cupboard, and shut the door—I afterwards opened it to change a sovereign—I am positive the money was the same in amount as it was before—I breakfasted at half-past eight o'clock, or between that and nine—there is a glass door between the par<lb></lb>lour and the shop—the breakfast things had been removed—I saw the prisoner come down about half-past nine o'clock—I left hit breakfast for him—I was in the shop—the shop door was open as usual, and things at the door—I did not observe whether the glass door was closed—I did not go to the cupboard where the cash-box was, after giving the change of the sovereign, till about twelve o'clock—I knew the prisoner was gone then, for I missed him about eleven o'clock—if he had gone out of the front door,</p>

               <p>he must have gone through the shop—there is a side door, and when I went into the parlour about twelve o'clock, I found it half-open—I had left the key in the cupboard, but the door was closed—I had the key of the cash-box in my pocket—the cash-box was then gone.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been examined on this charge at the police-office, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and my testimony was taken down in writing—the prisoner lodged at my house in Wardrobe-place, Doctors'-commons, for ten weeks—I remember the 16th of August—I knew before that that he was going to leave town, but he did not tell me where he was going—on that day he came a little before one o'clock, and said he was going that day—he asked me to make out his bill, and my daughter made it out—he remained in my house till half-past four o'clock, or thereabouts—he then Went, and took all his luggage with him—I did not see Mr. Pryse till he came to my house to search, after the prisoner was in custody—I do not recollect his saying that he had lost two £10 notes—my daughter was present, and the police-officer—Mr. Pryse said to me, "Pittock owed you a large bill"—I said, "Mr. Pittock paid me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in a £5 note and a sovereign," which he did before he left town—I examined the note—it was a clean one—there was no writing on the back of it—I paid it to my baker, but I did not keep the number of it—there was no writing at all on it—it appeared a new note direct from the Bank—the prisoner left me in August, and returned on the 3rd of December—he then went on in the usual way—there was no concealment—he paid me regulurly while he lodged with me—that 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was all that he owed me at that time—I had money, and a great deal of property in his room, which could easily have been carried off—he knew that my writing-desk was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he was in arrears till that 16th of August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say a word before the Justice about his having told you he was going out of town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this signature is my handwriting—it was not read, over to me before I signed my name—I will swear it was not, after they had done writing—the whole of it was not read to me before I subscribed my name—I cannot tell how much was read, but I saw the clerk write something afterwards—he read part of it to me before he finished it, then finished it, and did not read the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, do you mean to state that any thing was added to this deposi<lb></lb>tion after you signed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say so upon my oath, but to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any part of that deposition which the clerk did not read? or did he read the whole of it to you before you signed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect whether he did or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen the prisoner's attorney here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him here, but I did not speak to him—he was in my house the Saturday after Christmas-day—that was the first time I had seen him—I came here to-day with Mr. Penrice—he was at my house last night—I do not know that he is any relation of the prisoner—I had seen him be<lb></lb>fore at Union-hall, and at his warehouse, in Old Change, about twelve months ago, before I knew the prisoner—he came to my house on the 24th of December for a brush for the prisoner—that was all he came for—I asked him how Mr. Pittock was, but that was all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that that was all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion—I would not swear positively—I do not recollect that I spoke to him on the subject of this trial—I cannot say whether I did or no—I will not say whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you speak to him about this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him how Mr. Pittock was—to the best of my recollection I did not talk about this case—I had no particular conversation with Mr. Penrice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the clerk read over to you the statement you had made, did you complain of it, and state that it did not contain all you had said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I did not complain that he had not put down that the prisoner had told me before that he was going to leave—I was not aware it was of any consequence—he told me a week before that he was going—he did not say he was going to Woolwich—he left for good at that time, but I was not surprised when he came back on the 3rd of De<lb></lb>cember—my husband was a merchant—I keep a boarding and lodging house—the prisoner sometimes had his breakfast there—he had his bed-room, and if he chose to walk into the parlour, he might—I cannot say how many lodgers I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the prisoner to pay you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no engagement made—he was to pay me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for his bed-room—he lodged with me ten weeks—I did not know that he pawned any things while he was there, till the prosecutor found the duplicates—I take lodgers at any time, and keep them as long as they will stay—I may take them for lets time than a week—I do not take them by the day or night—I never had one stop so short a time as three days, nor as a day and night—I will not swear that I have not had them so short as three days—my circumstances have nothing to do with the prisoner's case—my lodgers generally pay when they leave the house—I do not take in strangers—I take none, but what are recommended—they pay when they please—I never asked the prisoner for any rent at all, that I will swear, nor any of my lodgers—I have kept the house fifteen months—I have lost money by the house—the prisoner paid me a clean £5 note about one o'clock—he came home about one o'clock, packed up his things, washed and dressed, and was a long time in his room—he went away about half-past four o'clock—I do not know how far my house is from the prosecutor's—I do not know Walworth—I do not know whether there would be any difficulty in a per<lb></lb>son getting a £5 note changed, between ten and twelve o'clock—I was present when the duplicates were found in his portmanteau—Mr. Penrice called for me, and I came with him—I am quite sure there was no one else with him—I did not tell the magistrate it was a clean note—he asked no questions about it—I was not asked any thing about it before I came here, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not communicate that fact to the gentleman behind me, and was it not put into his brief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I do not know how the gentleman could ask me whether it was dirty or clean—I do not recollect whether I told that to Mr. Warner or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How lately before the 16th of August had the prisoner slept in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he did not on the 16th, nor 14th—I could not say when—he was absent two or three nights—there is a sitting-room common to the lodgers at my house—that is not the room in Which my desk was—that was put in the prisoner's bed-room, to be more handy for me, as I did not choose to leave it in the parlour—no one but the prisoner occupied that bed-room—I did not go to my desk when he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050128"></xptr>
               <p>there—he had no means of knowing that I had money there—I saw the prisoner's attorney on the 17th of December, but nothing more than to speak to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at Woolwich. On Saturday, the 16th of August, a person left a parcel with me, about half-past two o'clock—he had a hat on—I do not think I have seen the prisoner with his hat on—the prisoner is similar to the man; but I cannot identify the person—I believe he is the man, but I cannot swear to him—the parcel was directed, "Mr. John Pryse, corner of East-lane, Walworth"—this is the wrapper and the direction, I believe—he asked me if I could forward the parcel—I said not that day, for my carts were all gone; but it could go on Monday—he said very well, that would do—I do not think he paid the booking.</p>

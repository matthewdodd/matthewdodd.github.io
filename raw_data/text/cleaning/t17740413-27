I am the prosecutor's wife; the prisoner had been a lodger at my house; on the 18th of Feb. she came to see me; I never left the kitchen while she was there, only to open the door to let my child in from school; I suppose she took the watch then; it hung over the mantle piece; I did not miss it till my husband came home at six o'clock, when she had been gone a quarter of an hour; I saw the watch at half after four.</p>

            . I keep a shop in South Norton-street: about six weeks ago the prisoner came to me, and said she was going to a place in the city; she said she was bare of money, that she had a watch of her husband's in pawn at one Mr. Howell's, and should be glad to sell it for something more than it was pawned for; I went with her, and paid 12 s. for taking it out; I had it valued, and was informed it was worth but 15 s. I gave her the other 3 s. when she was taken; the prosecutor came to me and said it was stole, and I went with him to the Rotation-office.</p>

Romford note, which I changed for him; he then said he had another 10l. note, and he did not much like them - he asked me to change that, which I did, and said, "If you do not like them, how came you to have them?" he said he had been to Romford to get change for a 20l. cheque for his masters, Messrs. Farebrother, and that his own name was West.</p>

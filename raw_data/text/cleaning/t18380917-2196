                  </hi>. I am an architectural modeller. On Friday night, or Saturday morning, the 15th of September, about one o'clock, I was coming from Smithfield towards Saffron-hill—I was sober—I met the prisoner Mar<lb></lb>shall, in the corner of Smithfield, who asked me to go home with her, and to treat her—I said, no, I had no money—she asked me which way I was going—I said, "Down here"—she said, "I am going down here too," and when we got about two streets she dragged me down a place—I said, "It is no use, I have no money"—she said, "You have a watch"—I said, "Yes, and you would like to have it, I dare say"—she made a violent tug at me—I said, "You have got the watch"—she ran off, and I after her—she Tan into a house and shut the door—I got it open, and got into a room in the house—she turned sharp round and shut the door on me—I heard her running down stairs in, and could not open the door directly, but I got on the stairs about the time she got to the bottom—she ran up stairs to me, came into the room, and said, "You b——b——, now have I got your watch?"—I said, "No, I suppose you have <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> it"—she said, "If you stop all night with me I will make it all right with your watch"—I said, "If you do not give it to me I will <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to you"—she said, "I know nothing about your b—watch"—I went out, and met two policemen at the bottom of the court—I took them in and gave her in charge, but could not find the watch—we came out, and in the house of the prisoner Ledshaw, two doors off, the policeman said, "This woman (Ledshaw) has got the watch, she hat buried it in the dust-hole"—my watch was found in the dust-hole of that house under the stairs—it was taken from me in quite a narrow dark passage—there was nobody by me but Marshall at the time, and nobody but her was in the room—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the guard was broken by being dragged off my neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor came and described this to me about a quarter past two o'clock—he was perfectly sober—I went to the house directly, into the room he pointed out—I searched the room, and on the stairs, but could not find the watch—I was bringing Marshall up the court to the station-house—I observed a light in the passage of No. 4—I pushed open the door, and under the stairs in the</p>

I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and in the morn<lb></lb>ing, a woman, who lodges next door, came to me for a light—I gave it to her—my cat ran out at the door—I went to the passage to look for it, and the policeman came in, and pulled out the watch—I had not seen it' that—I had not seen Marshall since Friday afternoon.</p>

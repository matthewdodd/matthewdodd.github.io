               <p>West Ham. On the afternoon of the 14th of October, on going into the parlour, I noticed the shadow of a figure on the side-board—I was alone in the house—I looked through the door, and saw the prisoner standing against the dining-room table, in the middle of the room, with the plate-basket in his hand—on seeing me, he turned round, looked at me, and jumped out of the window, taking the plate-basket with him—I followed, and seized hold of him as he was getting over the gate leading into the back garden—I got possession of the plate-basket—I do not recollect whether he relinquished his hold, or whether I took it from his hand, but all in a moment I found the basket in my possession—I laid hold of his coat after I got the basket, and called out "Murder" and "Police"—I felt him, as I thought, shifting to get his coat off—I then let go my hold of the skirts of his coat, took up the plate-basket, went into the back garden, and gave an alarm—he was brought back in about three-quarters of an hour or an hour—I am sure he is the same man—he left his hat behind him, and in it were several religious and other tracts, and a sheet almanack—a coat was also brought to me, which was such a one as he had when I caught hold of him—the plate-basket had been on the side-board before I saw the prisoner with it—the window was at that time shut down—I found it open when I saw him standing in the parlour—the door of the house was shut—there was no other way of getting in except through the window—I do not know how he would get to the parlour window without getting over the wall and the iron palisades—the plate-basket contained the articles stated, which are worth upwards of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my master's property—I gave information to a man named Miller, who went in pursuit—he is too unwell to be here.</p>

On the afternoon of the 14th of October, I was crossing the fields towards Upton, and saw the prisoner jump over the fence of Mr. Gurney's park, which is, I should say, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutors premises—a great number of people were pursuing him—a conductor of the Parcel's Delivery Company stopped him in the park—I took hold of him, and asked why he ran—he said, because other people ran—he was the first man—a person named Miller came up when I got him to the station—in consequence of what he said, I took him to the prosecutor's house, and Reynolds said he was the man that took the plate-basket out of the parlour—he said, "Women must say something; I suppose I must hear it"—this hat was found in the garden, containing tracts and other things, such as people hawk about, and the coat was found in the next house—the prisoner denied that either were his—he put them on at Lambeth-street—he had no hat or coat on when I stopped him.</p>

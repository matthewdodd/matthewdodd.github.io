            . I am a constable. On the 11th of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was by Pentonville-chapel, about three hundred yards from Mr. Rawes's, and saw the prisoners together. Berry had a basket with willow-shavings at the top. and Halsey had a bundle of wood in his hand. They passed me, and went down Southampton-street. As they passed me Halsey put the wood in his hat. I got Colton to assist me, we found them at the back of White Conduit-house together. Halsey then had a bundle under his arm, and Berry had the basket. Halsey stopped while Berry went to several gentlemen's houses. We searched them, and found a latchkey on Berry, and a bridle on Halsey. He said he picked it up in the field. The basket contained nothing but shavings in it, when I first saw him the basket was bulky, but when I apprehended him there were only a few shavings. Halsey told the Magistrate he was to have 1 s. to carry the basket to Old-street.</p>

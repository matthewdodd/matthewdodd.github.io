On the 3rd of June I lost a pair of shoes; I do not know where they were taken from, but I was in my back parlour - a boy came in, and said a man had stolen a pair of shoes; I went to the door, looked down a passage, and saw the prisoner and another man - the boy pointed out the prisoner - I ran, and secured them both; I took them into an oil-shop, and accused them of stealing my shoes - they made no reply; I pulled open the prisoner's coat, and in his side pocket were these shoes - they are mine; I knew nothing of him before.</p>

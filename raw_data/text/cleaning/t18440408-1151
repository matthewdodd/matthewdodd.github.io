I am ship's carpenter, belonging to the brig <hi rend="italic">Dart.</hi> At half-past three o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of April, I was crossing Tower-street—the prisoner met me—I had never seen him before—he asked me to go into the King's Head to have a glass of ale with him—I said I wanted to make the best of my way home, and did not want any—he came on the other side of me, and forced roe to go in—he would not sit down stairs, but took roe into a room up stairs—he said he was an entire stranger, and I said-so was I—another</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother John—we live at No. 135, Aldersgate-street, and are ink-manufacturers. Both the prisoners have been in our employ—Harding was so till he was apprehended—Cooke had left us about five years—at the beginning of this year we missed a great deal of property, and, in consequence of some com<lb></lb>munication from Deane, I applied for a warrant to search Cooke's premises—they were searched about the 12th or 14th of June, or it might be the 16th—it was on a Tuesday—there was marking-ink and other property of ours found there—I returned with the officer from Cooke's to our own pre<lb></lb>mises, and I sent for Harding down from the warehouse to the counting-House—I said to him, "I am sorry, John, to see you in such a situation; we have a very serious charge against you; it is not an affair of yesterday; I believe you have been robbing us some years, and, in order that I may be correct in the charge laid against you, I will read from a paper now before me"—this is the paper—I said, "On the 11th of March you took from our warehouse half a pint of marking-ink, and deposited that at Cooke's"—I</p>

               <p>read the whole of the paper—he heard the whole of it—I had read the detail to him—I said, "Is this true?"—he said, "I wish I could undo what I have done; I have been made the dupe of a designing man"—I said "You know a certain person (naming him) very well; you ought to have avoided his company"—"But," I said again, "is it true? you must know if it is true or not"—he hesitated a minute, looked at the paper, and said, "Well, then, sir, it is nearly all true, it may not be quite"—I said then, "How could all this happen?"—he said, "I was led into it by a person; and when he had got me into it, he then told me, if I did not bring him what he wanted, he would tell my masters of me"—I said, "How did you contrive to take away so much marking-ink?"—he said, "I put it into bottles, and took it away at different times"—he said he hoped I would be merciful to him—I have seen the marking-ink found at Cooke's—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I have examined the quality of this in this quart bottle, and com<lb></lb>pared it with what we make—it corresponds in all respects with the ink we make, which is entirely made from a secret of our own—nobody but my brother and myself make this ink—we do not trust an individual with the secret—I can say that this is a part of that manufactured on our premises—it is never sent out in larger bottles than these small ones—we once sent out half a pint to a person—that must be seven or eight years ago—with that exception, it is invariably sent out in these small bottles—Cooke must have known that—he was with us four years.</p>

               <p>half a pint of marking-ink, on the 11th of March—he gave it to Cooke in the counting-house, and Cooke put it down on the desk—I afterwards looked, and it was marking-ink—it was not in this bottle, but in a smaller bottle, about a half-pint—it was not a regular marking-ink bottle—I should say it was a bottle used for other purposes—Cooke sold marking-ink at that time, but I never knew him make any—I afterwards saw the bottle containing the marking-ink, up stairs, and a bottle similar to this one, was under it, and it was draining into it—I had frequently seen Harding at Cooke's before the 11th of March—I had seen him bring ink-powder, and red ink before that, and oxide of iron, I believe it is called—he came sometimes two or three times a week, and sometimes he did not come for a week—he had a latch-key, and generally let himself in—there is a gate<lb></lb>way near Cooke's, to which Cooke used to send me—he told me to wait till I saw the young man, Harding, and then I was to say to him that Mr. Cooke wanted him—I heard Harding say to Cooke on one occasion, "Don't send them close to our premises, for if our old man were to see them, or to know it, he would have some suspicion," or, "it might excite, out old man's suspicion," or words to that effect—I am sure I heard him say that—I do not recollect that Cooke made any answer—I am not certain whether that was before or after the marking-ink was brought—while 1 was at Cooke's I never knew any marking-ink to be made or to be bought by him.</p>

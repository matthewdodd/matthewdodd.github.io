On the 8th of May, about a quarter past one o'clock, I heard a noise in the shop while I was in the room adjoining; I looked and saw the prisoner with the till in his hand - he was not then behind the counter - he set the till on the counter and ran away; I saw him again that afternoon, and am quite sure of his person, as I took such particular notice of him; I had not seen him before.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWCOMB. My daughter alarmed me: I came down and saw the prisoner just going out of the door - he ran as fast as he could; I followed and took him - I lost sight of him as he turned the corners of two or three streets - I am quite sure he is the person - there were no others running; I had been at my till half an hour before; I cannot say what was gone from it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you lose sight of him for a minute? A. No; not for half a minute; I noticed he had a hairy cap on when he went out, and no one in the street had one on but him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor came up to me in a croud - a woman said that is not the boy; I had come out of a public-house, and seeing a crowd went up to it, and was taken.</p>

            . I live in Coleman-street-buildings. On the 29th of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18300916-20-crimeloc117">Bartholomew-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300916-20-crimeloc117" type="placeName" value="Bartholomew-lane"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What became of his hand, did you lose sight of that? A. I cannot say I saw his hand all the time - he was alone after I saw him; the box was small - there was a crowd about the Auctionmart door, where it occurred; if I had seized him at the moment perhaps I should have been floored, for that happened once before - he threw nothing away; I have no doubt the other man received the box - whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when I saw it come from my pocket I cannot say: I did not follow him above twenty yards - he did not say if I went with him it should be explained, but that it should be settled; he said that three or four times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly declare my innocence - instead of positive proof you have only the prosecutor's statement, and that consisting only of suspicion that he lost his property, but nothing whatever occurred to implicate me; I was passing through the City, and on arriving at Angel-court, was most roughly laid hold of by the prosecutor and charged with stealing a snuff-box - I offered him every satisfaction in my power, but when I was roughly treated I certainly offered resistance as any body would; he swore he saw me at the Auction-mart, and saw me take away his property, but quietly pursued me for the purpose of giving me into custody - I presume had any of you been robbed you would have seized the thief in the act; but what does his conduct argue but that he was uncertain where and when he lost his property; he has varied in his description of the box, and if mistaken in one thing he may be in another - a gentleman inquired what was the matter; he exclaimed that he had lost a gold snuff-box - at the Mansion-house he said it was silver, and worth 8l. or 10l., at the last examination he said 5l.; I have ascertained that just previous to the robbery he had a serious fit of illness, which may have impaired his mind.</p>

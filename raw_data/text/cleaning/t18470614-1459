                  </hi>. I keep Long's Hotel, New Bond-street—it is my dwel<lb></lb>ing-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On the 20th of May the prisoner came and occupied apartments at my hotel—he gave the name of Shakepace—he remained there in that name till the 30th of may, and then left without paying his bill, and did not come back—the plate was counted that night—I did not count it—the person who counted it is not here—I missed twelve silver table-spoons—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the Police-station—these spoons produced are mine—they are worth mines than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the marks have been filed out, but enough remains for me to know them by—I have no partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Woods, of the Castle hotel, Aldersgate-street. On Tuesday afternoon I was in Furnival's-inn—my hus-band also keeps an hotel—the prisoner came there in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about four o'clock, and asked for a bed—I am quite sure he is the person—we told him we were full, but we would give him a bed in a private house—he gave the name of Curtis—I thought I had seen him before—he brought this bag produced—he asked if he could go up to wash—he was gone up stairs I think about ten minutes—when he came down, I said, "I think I know you?"—he said, "I don't know you"—I said, "I am quite sure I know you"—he said, "Where do you know me?"—I said, "At the Castle"—he said, what did I know of him—I said he went away without paying his bill—he said I was mistaken, he would bring two gentlemen who would prove to the contrary—he went away—I said I knew he would not come back, and he did not—he left his bag, umbrella, and a stick—about eight the same evening I opened the bag, and found these twelve pieces of silver spoons and an empty box tied up in paper.</p>

On the 9th of November I lost six fowls, which I had seen safe the day before; I heard the dogs barking between nine and ten o'clock at night, and suppose they were taken then; I had nobody but a boy in the house, and did not go to see. I went to bed before ten o'clock, and heard some horses pacing down the lane by my house; I got out of bed, and went to the window with a gun. I saw the fowls at eleven o'clock next morning, at Jarvis', at Hayes - they were then dead; they were alive the day before - Jarvis had fifteen or sixteen; I knew five hens, and one cock to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is any body here who saw them alive the day they were taken? A. No; I have lived there about a year and a quarter. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060076"></xptr>know the prisoner, and know nothing of his being an orphan.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street. On the 9th of November, at a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner walking behind a waggon of hay - he had a sack on his shoulder; I stopped, and asked what it contained; he said water-cresses; I laid my hand on it, and found something warm; I dismounted, and found fifteen fowls in it, some of them quite warm; he gave no account of them, and I took him to Jarvis, the constable of Hayes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a warrant against any other men? A. Yes, but they have not been taken; the prisoner told the Magistrate that Pearson and Allen were in company with him, and that he did not take them.</p>

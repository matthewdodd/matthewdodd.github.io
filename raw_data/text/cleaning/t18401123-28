At a quarter-past six o'clock on the evening of the 15th of November, I was walking with my brother-in-law in Barbican—my brother-in-law jogged me—I did not take notice—he jogged me again—I looked round, and saw the prisoner behind roe drawing my hand<lb></lb>kerchief from my pocket—I asked him what he meant by doing that—he said, "What!" and began to abuse me—he had got my handkerchief in his hand—I told him to go on, or else I would give him in charge of the police—he told me to go on myself.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to suspect her?</p>
               <p>F. Agit. She took one of my candlesticks to a tenant that lodged in the next room, and wanted her to go and pawn it for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>F. Agit. No, but that tenant came down and told me so, and bid me take care of her; then I went up-stairs to look for my things, and found the goods mention'd in the indictment were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before?</p>
               <p>F. Agit. I am sure they were all there the over-night. We took her up, and in the watch-house she own'd she had taken and pawn'd them to one Gibbs, a pawnbroker in Shoe-Lane, where we went and found them. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gibbs. The prisoner is the person that pawn'd these goods with me.</p>

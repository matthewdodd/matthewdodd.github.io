                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Collins, of Leather-lane, a butcher. On the morning of the 21st of September I was putting out a board in front of the shop—there was some meat inside—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner just inside the shop while I was taking the board out—when I came into the shop again, I saw him take a shoulder of mutton, put it into a cloth, and then put it into a cart which he had at the door—he was a slaughter<lb></lb>man to Mr. Collins, and had brought home a caroass of beef that morning—I</p>

               <p>think he had been there about ten minutes—a man was with him, who was in the shop on the left-hand side, when he took it—I then went to my master—he looked out of window, and then came down stairs, and as<lb></lb>sisted in taking one hind-quarter of beef out of the cart—he had some conversation with the prisoner—my master afterwards took the shoulder of mutton out of the cart, and said, "It is not the first time by a good many that I have missed meat out of my shop"—he held it up to the pri<lb></lb>soner, and asked me whether it was his property—I said, "Yes, mas<lb></lb>ter"—the prisoner came to the door, and said to me, "It is half a neck and a shoulder of mutton, tell him it weighs 9 1/2 lbs."</p>

                  </hi>. On the 21st of September I gave some directions to my apprentice, as I had missed something the preceding morning—on that morning, in consequence of something the apprentice told me, I looked into the cart, and found a cloth with a shoulder of mutton in it—I had not authorised the prisoner to take it—I held it up, and said, "This is my shoulder of mutton; this is not the first joint you have taken by a great many; there was half a leg taken yesterday morning"—he said, "Well, don't prosecute me, I will pay you for that, and I will pay you for this; I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you won't prosecute"—he had no authority to go and help himself to mutton.</p>

Q.</hi> He acknowledged to having taken the piece the morning before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—to the best of my knowledge I did not owe him for any tongues—I bought three tongues of him about three months before—to the best of my recollection they were paid for—I saw him about an hour after in Smithfield—I took him because he had robbed me—I had a struggle between duty and interest—he offered me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or half-a-dozen oxen, which I pleased, if I would not prosecute—I had business at Smith<lb></lb>field, and then I went and took him at his house—I found him there after being denied three times—I got an officer, and had him taken for the shoulder of mutton and the half-leg—they were worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would defy me to prove he meant to steal them—I never went to try to get him out of custody—there was a strong temptation—a gentleman offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to ask whether it would not be my duty to have the other man taken.</p>

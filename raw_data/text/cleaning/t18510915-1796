                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the General Post-office. In consequence of what had reached me in my official capacity, on 6th Aug. I made up a letter, and addressed it to Mr. James Hyam: Letherington, Wisbeach, Cambridgeshire—I enclosed in it a sovereign a shilling, and three 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. postage stamps—I marked them before enclosing them in the letter, in the presence of Mr. Cole, the inspector—I sealed the letter, and delivered it to Peak, the constable, about 12 o'clock in the day—if that letter was then posted at Highgate, it ought to have reached the General Post-office about half-past 2—the letters come from Highgate in a bag—I was at the General Post-office when the bag arrived, and opened it; the letter was not in it—the letter-bill accompanied the letters in the bag—I have it here—it describes the letters as 49 unpaid and stamped letters, and is paid, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found the contents of the bag corresponded with the bill—on this discovery I proceeded to Highgate, with Peak, the officer, and Mr. Cole—I made some inquiry at the post-office at Highgate, in consequence which I directed Peak to go in search of the prisoner—he was at that time an auxiliary deliverer of letters there—Peak returned to the Post-office,</p>

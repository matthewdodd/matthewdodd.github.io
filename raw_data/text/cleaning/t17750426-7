            , I am servant to Mr. Leighton, a pawnbroker in Wardour Street. The prisoner offered a pair of shoes to pawn on the 1st of March: knowing he worked with the prosecutor, I suspected the shoes belonged to him; I went and informed him of it. The prisoner had pawned a pair at our house before.</p>
               <p>- Priestman. The prisoner pawned four pair of shoes at my master's.</p>
               <p>- Wilson. I am a pawnbroker. I took in four pair of shoes of the prisoner in January and February. The shoes were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I kept a shop in Little Poultney Street. I rather failed, and then I removed to Wardour Street, where I worked sometime for my own customers. These shoes were my own property; I pawned them because I wanted a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who had known him a great many years, and gave him a good character.</p>

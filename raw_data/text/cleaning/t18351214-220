                  </hi>. I am a dealer in clothes, and live in High-street, Shadwell. On the 28th of November I shut my shop up about twelve o'clock at night, when the prisoner knocked at the door, and said he had something to sell—he had a piece of canvass, and an old pair of trowsers—I offered him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which he agreed to take—I had a gas-light burning—I had no change, and knocked at the partition of my landlord's house, to bring me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—In the mean time I missed my key—I looked round, and happened to go to six waistcoats which I had put in the shelves, thinking I had put the key there—I replaced them, and then the landlord came to the door to give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave to the prisoner, who went away; and when I came into the shop again, I missed two waistcoats from the shelf—I went out, and found him about four doors off at the corner of Angel-gardens—I charged him with stealing the two waist<lb></lb>coats—he said he had not—I said, "I will give you in charge"—he said, "I must go and ease myself"—he ran into a court by the side of a wall, and I lost sight of him for about three minutes—when he came out of the court I gave him in charge of the policeman—the court is no thoroughfare—I found the waistcoats concealed on the top of the palings, up the court, about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 91.) I saw the prisoner come out of the court, and Moss gave him in charge—he made a violent resistance—It required six of us to take him to the station-house—he is a very powerful man—after putting him into the station-house, I found two waistcoats on the palings, in the court, which the prosecutor claimed—I found on the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he may have lost some money in the struggle, as he was very violent—he struggled with us, endeavouring to got away—he was not struck at all.</p>

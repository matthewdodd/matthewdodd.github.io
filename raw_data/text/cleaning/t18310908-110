               <p>SIR, - I am extremely sorry it was not in my power to honour my bill for 13l., due on Saturday; I fully expected to have met it, but being disappointed in getting money, and two fellows having run away deeply in my debt, have put it out of my power - my wife being so unwell, I cannot possibly come to town at present, but if you will give me a week or ten days, I shall be able to pay you, together with all charges; I have received a letter from my son, stating that you had called, and seemed surprised I was not there - I have to inform you, you have no occasion to be afraid of your money or property, it is my intention to pay you and every body else; I cannot at present return the fly or gig, for the fly is now on a job, and will not be home for a month, and the gig a traveller has - it will be home in a week, and I will return them to you; I did very little with them at first, and business has been very had of late - I send this letter by my son, who will put it into the post for you, and will thank you to send him an answer back; I have no doubt I shall be in town in ten days - my son's address is, No. 2, Mill-street, Pentonville.</p>
               <p>MR. SNOW. I did not see the fly again till last June; I went to Mr. Bruin's, in Camberwell-road, in consequence of information, and found it there; I have not been allowed to take it away - I have never had it, nor been paid a farthing for the hire of it; I never authorised the prisoner to sell it.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Claremontmews, Claremont-square, Clerkenwell. I was in the prisoner's service in November last, and remember his bringing a landau-fly and harness from Mr. Snow; he said he could buy and sell Mr. Snow for a pint of beer, and he would mace him out of it; this was the day he brought it home - he represented himself as a livery-stable keeper; I left him very shortly after the carriage came, and did not see him again till he was in custody, in August.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, but I do not know whether my husband is living. I lived with the prisoner, as his wife, for about two years, and passed by the name of Matthews—on 13th Nov., between 11 and 12 o'clock, I told the prisoner I should leave him, and get a lodging elsewhere—I said I would not pledge my clothes any more for him—I do not know what answer he gave me—he left home directly afterwards with Appleton—on the evening of that day I went to a public-house, with three young women and two young men—I drank there, and was very much the worse for liquor—we also had some pies; and whilst eating and drinking, the prisoner and Appleton came in—the prisoner asked me if I would go home with him—I said I would not come home, and I was very aggravating to him—I kept saying to him, "You go by yourself; I won't go home," I knew there was nothing that aggravated him more than that—I went outside with him, and he asked if I would come home—I told him I would not, he might go by himself; and he asked me for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pint of beer with—Appleton said, "Let her go in again, because she should not be laughed at"—I was not so drunk then as I was afterwards—I went into the tap-room again; and the three young women and the two young men, and me, got quarreling, and I took off my bonnet and shawl—the prisoner was then standing at the fire<lb></lb>place, at my side—I received a wound, and found blood flowing from my neck—I cannot say who gave me the wound—we were all quarreling toge<lb></lb>ther—I knew no more till I found myself at the hospital.</p>

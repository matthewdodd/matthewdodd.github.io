               <p>WILLIAM LANDON. I was in the employ of Messrs. East, and on the 18th of August I went, by desire of Messrs. East, to the house of the prisoner Newland, No. 12, Bury-street - Goddard went in first; I followed, with four or five more, and found, laying on the table, three coats in an unfinished state, one silk waistcoat made up, and one surtout, not made, and six white quilting waistcoats cut out, but not made: Newland said the coats he had cut out to make up for Robinson's wear, and the silk waistcoats also, but the quilting waistcoats were for customers of his own - two lengths of drill were also produced with other articles, by Newland; he said he had them from Robinson - Goddard asked if that was all the property he had got which he had received from Robinson; he said it was all he had got; Clements said, "Then if that is all you have got, we will look round the room;" he did so, and on taking a candle, on a sideboard or shelf on the left-hand side of the room, he found this parcel, tied up in brown paper - here is the paper; there is written on it, in Robinson's hand-writing, "Mr. J. Robinson;" I have seen him write many times; the parcel contained a yard and a quarter of fancy velvet, a yard and a half of figured silk, a yard and three-quarters of superfine brown cloth, and two pairs of trousers made up: I do not think they have been worn - one pair has not been worn certainly: Newland said he was not aware of it having been left there - that it must have been left three or four days before; he was asked if he had an account with Robinson, and said he had been in the habit of making up a good many clothes for him - that he was never paid in money, but in goods, which answered his purpose equally well; he produced no account in my presence - he was asked if he was aware Robinson was in the employ of Messrs. East, and he said he was perfectly aware of that - he was asked what he owed Robinson, and at first said, Nothing; being again asked, he said there was an account between them, and he believed he owed him between 30l. and 40l., which was to be paid at Christmas - several of these articles I can positively swear to; I have the piece this velvet was cut from in Court - it matches exactly, where the figures is cut through, and tallies exactly, and this silk I thoroughly believe to be Messrs. Easts', as we have the exact pattern; here are two pattern-cards which we found in Newland's room - they are Messrs. Easts', and his name ought to be on them; that part of the cover which had" C. and H. East" on it is cut out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Had this conversation passed before you found the coats? A.They were produced to Goddard, I believe, before I went up -I never heard him say any thing about his believing Robinson to be an agent, selling on commission, or any thing to that effect; he lives at a baker's shop, and is a tailor - it is a small room, about fourteen feet square; I did not see the parcel till Clements took hold of it - Newland's attention had not been directed to it; I do not think it had been opened at all - it was not directed to Newland.</p>
               <p>Q.When the officer asked if he had more articles which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080072"></xptr>he had bought of Robinson, did he call his apprentice to look and see if there was more? A. I did not hear him, and think I can swear he did not; I never knew an instance of a clerk acting as a commission agent in our trade; I have been with Mr. East twelve years - Robinson was two years and a half or three years in Mr. East's employ, and acted as a servant.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the sideboard, on which the parcel was, in the dining-room? A. Yes; there was nothing to prevent the family seeing it - I never knew a clerk allowed to get goods made up, and pay the tailor in cloth.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with another officer and Landon to the prisoner's house; I went up stairs first, saw Newland, and asked if her knew a young man named Robinson, in the employ of Mr. East - he said he did: I asked how long it was since he had any cloth from him - he said, "Last week;" I said his employers had been robbed to a very considerable extent, and that I had a search-warrant, and it was for him to produce the property he had of Robinson: I then asked how much he owed Robinson - he said he did not owe him any, for he always took it out in cloth: he then went into a back room, and brought three unfinished coats, and the articles Landon has spoken of - the drill was in the front room; he said he was making the coats up for Robinson; Clements and Landon then came up stairs - the conversation was in the middle room; I asked if he had got any more property which Robinson had brought there - we were then in the front room, in which the sideboard was; he said No: Clements then proceeded to search further, and on the sideboard found a small parcel, directed to 
               <persName id="t18310908-140-person1154">J. </persName>
            Robinson - Newland said it must have been left there three or four days ago, for he did not know it was there; he was again asked if he owed Robinson any thing, and said he owed him nothing - we pot him into St. James' watch-house, and on our way to the office next day, he said he supposed he owed Robinson 20l. or 30l., but if he had finished the clothes he supposed he would have owed him 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go there? A.About a quarter-past seven o'clock in the evening, or it might be half-past; it was certainly getting towards dark - he at once said he knew Robinson, and had bought goods of him; the things were brought to us by himself and his apprentice - he went into the back room, where they make up clothes; the front is a set of dining and a cutting-room, and the middle a bed-room - I asked him to produce the whole of the property which he had from Robinson; we were then in the front room, and he was asked if he had got any thing else; Clements took the candle off the front room table, and brought the parcel - the parcel was tied up, as if it had not been undone; the drill laid openly on the cutting-board - the other things were brought out of the back room, except the quilted waistcoats, which were in the front room; his apprentices assisted to produce the things - I particularly asked if it was all the property he had of Robinson.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the pattern-cards? A. Yes, they were found, to the best of my knowledge, under the paper parcel on the sideboard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with the officers, and found the paper parcel on the sideboard, with these two pattern-cards under it, and another by the side of it; Landon took them up, and said, "Why, these are ours;" I was bringing Newland to the office on the 19th; he said he owed Robinson about 20l., or it might be rather more, that he had been making a suit of clothes for a young man at No. 120, Sloane-street, named Wilson Scott, with cloth brought by Robinson, which he took home last Saturday, and that would reduce it to about 12l.; I went there, and got the clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go into the room were you found the parcel with a candle? A. I took a candle off the table in that room.</p>
               <p>HENRY VIGURS EAST. I am in partnership with my brother. Robinson was our servant; we paid him wages as a servant - he was called into the counting-house on the 17th of August, and asked where he lived; he gave three false addresses - these pattern-cards contain patterns of the goods we had for sale in August, and our present stock corresponds with 19-20lbs of them; the cards are ours, and all the property produced is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you deal in the wholesale way? A. Yes; we serve tailors as well as others - we give pattern-cards, not sell them; August is not the season for giving them; we gave several dozens away in April or May - the goods found at Newland's are worth 9l. or 10l., besides that in the parcel.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you give any cards do you erase your name from them, or is it that the persons may know your stock? A.Certainly it is - our name is outside, and we generally write inside the name of the person we give them to; there is no name inside these.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. If a person sells on commission for you, in what way does he sell? A. It is a very different description of trade altogether; we have a country traveller, but never sell on commission - I do not think it is the practice in our trade to sell on commission at all.</p>

            . I was porter to the prosecutors five months ago; Robinson directed me to take two parcels out for him; I left one or two for him at a coffeeshop kept by Arliss, in Upper St. Martin's-lane, tied in brown paper - I think they were directed in the name of James Robinson; I also took a parcel to a baker's-shop, in Bury-street, St. James', and think it is the house Newland lodged at - I think I took two parcels there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to leave Messrs. East? A. On account of getting up late in the morning; I understood so at the time - I have since heard I was not confident enough; I left on the 20th of March - it was about July last year that I went to Bury-street, and about February to the coffee-shop - I did not know what the parcels contained.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop, in Upper St. Martin's-lane, and have known Robinson about eight months. He left a parcel himself with me, about eight o'clock in the morning, directed to Mr. Newland, and one for Mr. Green - I cannot positively say whether Newland himself came for the parcel; I was examined at the office - a person called about eleven o'clock the same morning, and asked for a parcel left for Mr. Newland by Robinson; it was the prisoner Newland for all I know - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How long age<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080073"></xptr>was it that Robinson left the parcel for Newland? A. I cannot say; I think it was after Christmas, five or six months ago - I do not know who fetched it away.</p>
               <p>Newland's Defence (written). If I had dealt with the prisoner Robinson as a mere acquaintance of yesterday, more caution might have been required at my hands, but I have known him intimately for several years, and known him employed in various situations of great respectability and trust, in which no misconduct was ever imputed to him - I knew him to be a sober and an attentive industrious man. I was acquainted with some of his relatives and friends, who were highly respectable, and in a condition, as I believed, to afford him the means which he stated they had done; I have long worked for him, as a tailor, before he entered the service of the prosecutors, and was always told by himself, when he solicited orders from me, that he was transacting business occassionally on his own account - a circumstance not at all uncommon with persons in his situation. In confirmation of all this, his prices were as high as those charged by the wholesale traders; and I humbly hope you will be satisfied that, in crediting these assertions and representations, I was doing no more than almost any other man would have done; he came openly to my shop, and transacted business in the presence of my two apprentices, to whom our accounts were always open for inspection - nor was there any thing in the extent of our dealings to awaken suspicion on my part. When his conduct was discovered, and the prosecutors, with the officers, came to my house, I was ready and anxious to give every explanation - I directed every article to be brought forward, and gave up the accounts without hesitation, for I had nothing either to conceal or to deny; and if I have been in any instance too easily induced to believe in the representations of so very old an acquaintance, who, as far as I knew, had deserved the good character he had enjoyed, I trust the character the Court will hear of me to-day, from respectable individuals, will induce your Lordship and the Jury to believe that I have not done so with any culpable intention of defrauding others, but that I have been myself most cruelly deceived.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Newland. I have seen Robinson at his house - master has bought articles of him in the usual way of business: they were entered in the books - I have seen them entered at the time they were bought; Robinson used to enter them, and I have seen master enter them - master made up clothes for him; I never knew master pay him except by making clothes for him; I have heard master complain to him of being over - charged for goods - Robinson has answered that he did not get 2d. a yard by them; I have heard Robinson tell master at the time that he had bought the goods in the City - I was present when the officers came; master and I gathered up the things I was making, and took them into the front room - master told me to look for all the things he had had from Robinson: I produced all that came from him to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How many dealings had your master with Robinson? A. I am not aware - I have heard him there a dozen times; we never made him more than one coat at a time, except the last - there was a great coat and three dress coats; they were for Robinson himself, and a black coat was made for a gentleman in Sloane-street - I never saw any money pass between Robinson and master; I never heard him say where in the City the goods came from - it was the first dealing I was present at that he said he bought them in the City; master and mistress used to sit in the front room - I did not go there unless I was wanted; I did not know he was in Mr. East's employ till be was taken - master's books were given to Mr. East on the first examination.</p>

            . I have been apprentice to Newland these two years - he was in the habit of buying goods of Robinson; I have several times heard him complain of their high price, and Robinson said he did not get 2d. a yard by it - I have heard him say he got the goods in the City, but never heard where; the purchases were regularly entered into the book at the time - I believe that book is in Mr. East's possession.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long has Robinson dealt with your master? A. Ever since I have been there, I think, but I did not know much of master's affairs when I first went; he would appear very young two years ago - the first dealing I was present at was about a year and a half since; when he has called master has said he wanted goods - I have heard him say, "It is a pity I did not know it an hour ago, as I have just come from the City;" I have heard that several times - I never heard master ask where he got them; I knew he was in Mr. East's employ, and have heard master say so - Robinson frequently brought cloth to master's, he might have brought cloth a dozen or three dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear your master has not bought one hundred and fifty yards of cloth of him at different times? A. I cannot; I have seen pattern-cards about, but do not know whether these were them - they had not the name scratched out; I never noticed what the names were - I seldom went into the front room; I believe Robinson went into master's front room whenever he chose - I never saw the parcel on the sideboard; I had not been into the room for three days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Look at these trousers? A. This pair was made at our house, and I believe the others; they do not appear to have been worn.</p>
               <p>Q.Then in the bundle was a pair of trousers made by your master? A. I think they are his make - I do not remember when they were made.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Bedward, a man's-mercer, in Vigo-lane - I have managed his business for the last seven years, and receive all his cash. I know Newland perfectly well; I have dealt with him as an agent, at least he has had goods of me on my own account; I bought them of Mr. Bedward, who is my uncle - I am allowed that privilege; they are booked to me, and I dispose of them among my friends - I have sold the prisoner goods, and have been paid by his making clothes for myself, my brother, my cousin, and Dr. Jewell, whom I recommended to him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your uncle was acquainted with this, and you did nothing secretly? A.Certainly - he knew where I lived; I told him I had my uncle's permission.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How were the goods delivered? A.Sometimes he came to our shop for them, and at other times I sent our young man with them.</p>

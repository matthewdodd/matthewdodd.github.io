On the 26th of December, I was at Little Gadsden and sent six packages to London by the carrier, I delivered them to Francis London. The carrier was directed to my house, No.2, Penford-street, Red Lion-square, Holborn. Five of them were delivered safe, the other contained the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>ROBERT APPLETON. I am a watchman of Red Lion-square. On the 27th of December, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner by the near side of the waggon, and another man with him, the waggoner took a load out of it and went to Mr. Oldham's house; while he was in the house, the prisoner and the other man crossed over to the waggon, they each took hold of the handles of the package and walked down Penford-street, Red Lion-square, I went across to them, and said, what have you got there, it does not belong to you. They dropped the trunk, and ran away. I sprung my rattle and called stop thief! they ran down the street; Dewxell and Welch stopped them. I went up and said, the prisoner was the man, the other got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The waggon stopped two doors from Red Lion-square. It was not quite dark. I am sure he is the man.</p>

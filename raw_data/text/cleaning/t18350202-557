                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Long, who is a weaver, living in Wellington-row, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On Wednesday afternoon, the 28th of January, I was up stairs, at my work—I left work about a quarter before five o'clock, and came down stairs to get tea ready—I heard footsteps in the passage, and a noise in the bed-room—I heard two persons go out of the house—I called to know who was going out, but got no answer—I found my bed-room window open—that is the front room, on the ground floor, about two feet from the pave<lb></lb>ment—I opened the street door, and about ten yards from the door, on the right hand, I saw two lads, walking slowly, side by side—on my left hand a stranger was passing—I made inquiry of the stranger—I saw Jordan's face, and observed that they each looked round at me, and turned their heads, but I did not observe the face of the other prisoner—I observed Jor<lb></lb>dan so as to know him again—the other person had a round brown cap on—when Smith was apprehended, he had such a cap at Worship-street office in his hand—I spoke loud enough to the stranger who was passing for the lads to hear me—I asked whether those lads came out of my house—I can<lb></lb>not not say they heard the answer—I immediately said, "We are robbed;" and when I uttered those words the two lads both began to run—the man I ques<lb></lb>tioned ran the same way, and my husband followed—Jordan was brought back to my door—I immediately recognised him to be one of the boys who had turned round and looked me in the face—I searched my bed-room, found the drawers open, and my husband's clothes taken out—the glass of the window was cut, and the screw which fastened both sashes together was gone—the window was fast, to my certain knowledge, at half-past twelve o'clock—it was screwed—nobody could open it without breaking the glass, and that would admit a hand to undo the screw—the window-sash had been raised up—I received from my apprentice a great-coat, a pair of trowsers, and a waistcoat—I had observed that some clothes were gone out of the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Wellington-row. On the afternoon of the 28th of January, I was in my garden—I heard a cry of "Stop thief" proceeding from my left hand, about thirty yards in the direc<lb></lb>tion of the prosecutor's—I saw two lads running towards me from the prosecutor's—I had a full view of them—the prisoners are the two lads, I am certain—I stopped Jordan—Smith got away—I am not quite certain of Smith, as he turned his head very quickly—I had a full view of him for a short time—I will not undertake to swear to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of Elizabeth Esther Long, and live in Wellington-row. When my wife had been down stairs about two minute, she gave an alarm—I ran down stairs—I asked which way they had run—I ran after them, but did not see them; and about one hundred yards from my own house, I picked up my great-coat, trowsers, and waistcoat, lying all in a heap together—they are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed two other coats—I found the articles in the direction the boys ran—the pane of glass had been broken at the corner, and mended before—I found the corner had been dug out, and the window screw gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bonnet-shape maker, and live in Wel<lb></lb>lington-row. I went in pursuit of the thieves, hearing the alarm—I saw Long pick up the trowsers, coat, and waistcoat, from a ditch—as Jordan was taken back to the house, I was behind him, and saw him take his hand from his left hand pocket, and drop an instrument, which will be pro<lb></lb>duced—a lad took it up, by my direction—I afterwards saw the policeman try the instrument to the marks made in the putty of the window—they were exactly the marks such an instrument would make, and were made by it, in my opinion—the corners of the chisel are both broken off, and there were marks of that on the putty.</p>

I received Jordan into cus<lb></lb>tody, from Long, and took him to Long's house—on the road I heard something <hi rend="italic">chink</hi> on the stones, and this chisel was delivered to me by the apprentice boy I believe—I said to Jordan, "These are the instruments you make use of, are they?"—he said, "I picked that up in Bethnal-green-road"—I applied it to the marks in the window-frame—the centre square of the top sash—it is a very remarkable chisel, and it fitted the marks exactly—I merely laid it into the old mark—there was only one mark in the window—I have no doubt that instrument made that mark.</p>

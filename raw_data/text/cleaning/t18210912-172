            . I live in Ivy-street, St. Giles's, near George-street, I live in the cellar. Lyon's called me to give her a light in the passage, I came up, there was a barrow in the passage, and a blue box between the handles of it; whether Maroney or Lyons took it into Lyons's room, I cannot say. The box was opened, and Maroney took the things out, tied them up, and took them away; he said, he got them from the Hare and Hounds, public-house. I told Lyons they were stolen, and it was a shame, and told the neighbours. She took the box to Elcom's after it was emptied - they took all the things out, and took them away. Finnerty was in the passage, but not in the room; next morning, the articles stated in the indictment were found in the passage where the barrow stood.</p>

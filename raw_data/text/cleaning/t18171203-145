               <p>WILLIAM HARTLAND. I am a private watchman. On the 23rd of November I was in St. James's-market, about half-past six in the morning; I saw the prisoner come out of No. 19, which was uninhabited, with some lead on his shoulder-it was not Sneezum's house; I could not follow him. In about five minutes he returned, and went into the same house; he staid there two or three minutes, and then came out with another load of lead on his shoulder; I seized him, and made him put it down in the passage of No. 19. As I took him to the watch-house he tried to get my stick from me, but could not; he pulled something out of his pocket, and cut me on the head, which bled a great deal; he got from me, I never lost sight of him; Hawskby took him again. I went to the house where the lead was put, and was present when it was compared with the roof of No. 17-it fitted it.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITHERS. I am a watchman of St. James's parish. I was coming off my beat, a little before seven o'clock on the morning of November 30th, saw the prisoner at the top of Eagle-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief; Hartland was pursuing him-Hawksby laid hold of him-they came to the ground together - He knocked Hawksby down; I went up, and took him; Hartland was about twelve yards from him-his temples bled very much; the blood ran down his cheeks.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SUTHE. I am a patrol. I heard the rattle sprung; the prisoner was taken - I found a knife on him; Hartland was very much cut; I found another piece of lead on the roof of No. 17, from which the lead was cut.</p>
               <p>JOHN JENNINGS. I am clerk of the works. I compared the lead-it was taken from the roof of No. 17, and was worth 1l. 15s.; it weighed 202lbs.</p>

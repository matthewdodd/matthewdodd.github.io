            What did you consent to? - He asked me to let him leave the cask till the morning; I consented to his leaving the cask, saying that he might come in the morning and carry it away; after the man was gone I had some suspicion that the man had not come honestly by the cask, I went and examined the cask and saw How on the cask; I went down to Mr. How's house, and informed Mr. How's servant, I told Mr. Meadows, and Meadows came the next morning, and when he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150167"></xptr>I shewed him the same cask that the prisoner delivered the over night.</p>
               <p>Q.

            Then the prisoner was taken into custody by these officers? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. You are sure that was the same cask that he brought the over night, and you are sure it had How upon it? - I am sure, the cask is here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This cask is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had been discharged from your service the beginning of May last? - He had, and he has never been in my service since.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave him no directions to go to Mr. Low to get a cask of him or any customer whatever? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I only asked Mr. Wheatley to let me leave the cask till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Wheatley. It was so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to Mr. Low's door and asked the young woman if they wanted any beer? she said there is an empty cask in the cellar you may take it away; so with that I took the cask away and carried it to this public house and asked Mr. Wheatley to let me leave the cask there till the morning? he said yes, I told him I would call for it as the morning following, in the morning when I came there there was the officers to stop me from taking it away; when I went to Mr. Low's I never asked for the cask.</p>

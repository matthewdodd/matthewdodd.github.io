            . I am porter to Messrs. Wilks and Co., and live in Hungerford-market. On the 26th of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I met the prisoner at the corner of <placeName id="t18220220-90-crimeloc484">Skelton-court</placeName>

I stood talking to her two or three minutes, and as I left her I missed them - turned round, and directly laid hold of her, and said she had robbed me of two sovereigns; she said she had no such thing, and laughed at me - I said I was certain she had, and called the watchman; he came up, and I laid fast hold of her hand, till she got to the watchouse, and then found one sovereign in her hand, which was clenched; she declared she had no more - the watchman found the other in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200050"></xptr>mouth. I had given her 6 d. which was not found on her. I was coming from my club.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and heard the cry of Watch! the prosecutor came out of Shelton-court, holding the prisoner; he said she had robbed him of two sovereigns, she denied it, and said she had none; he held her hand, till we got her to the watch-house, and then found one in her hand - she said she had no more. I found another in her mouth with 1 s., she said the shilling was her's.</p>

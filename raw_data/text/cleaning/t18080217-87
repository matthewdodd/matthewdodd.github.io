            . I live at Mr. Chapman's, boot-maker, Moorfields. On Tuesday the 26th of January, about ten minutes past five in the afternoon, the foreman of Mr. Chapman went to tea; he came back after he had been to Short street, he said there were three men standing there, they either intended to do the linen draper or us; I went and shut the door of the ladies' shop; we have two shops, one for ladies and the other for gentlemen; I stood at the other door, I saw the prisoner walking on the pavement, up and down; he crossed the road into Moorfield's quarters; I saw the prisoner behind a tree looking at Mr. Macklew's shop, I observed one of them as he went round the coach stand by the end of Moorgate, I saw him again in the quarters making motions to another; at that time Mr. Macklew's young man was taking the things in; he looked up at the next house at that time. I saw no person passing just at that time; I saw the prisoner about three yards from the door with a piece of printed cotton in his hand; I saw one that was with him meet him about half way in the road; I saw the prisoner give it the other, he put it under his coat and ran off across Moorfields; I immediately run and caught the prisoner by the collar, and brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this is the man. - A. Yes, I am certain that is the man.</p>
               <p>- CARTWRIGHT. I took the prisoner in custody, I searched him, I found nothing upon him.</p>

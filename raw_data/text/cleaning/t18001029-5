               <p>Q. You cannot say where you put it when you went to bed? - A. No; I missed my pocket-book out of my jacket.</p>

               <p>Q. When can you speak to having had it before that? - A. I am sure I had it at six o'clock at the Black-dog; I lost a twenty pound, and a five pound note, and six half joes; in about half an hour after I awoke, the prisoner, Blake, came to bed to me; I mentioned nothing to her about it till day-light; when it was day-light, I got up and began to put my cloths on, she was in bed at that time; I asked her to get up, which she did immediately; I then asked her if she had seen any thing of my pocket-book; she said, she had not, but told me, that I put my cloths under the bed, when I went to bed; I happened to cast my eye under the bed, and saw the pocket-book lying open, about three feet from where the cloaths lay; I took the book up, and I looked into it, I missed a twenty pound and a five pound note; there were three five pound notes, and a one half joe left; I did not say any thing at that time, I was rather ashamed of myself; then we both went out, and had some purl and gin; I then went in search of my fellow-lodger; I found him in bed with another girl, I told him to get up, and we went home to our lodgings.</p>


               <p>Q. You had not then mentioned any thing to her about it? - A. I had told her I missed my money, but did not say how much, and when she saw that half joe, she said, lord, here is your money, you cannot have lost any; after we had been in our lodging sometime, I got some intelligence from Maria Hill, and I saw five half joes found, that were hid in the garden of Berry's house; Treadway was with me, and Mumford, and about five o'clock we took

I was in a Back Parlour even with the Shop, and there came a Woman into the Shop; there were some Ladies with me; one of them said, Mrs. Cumbridge , there is a Woman in your Shop: I went into the Shop and shew'd her something, but saw she had a Bundle in her Lap; she wanted some printed Linnen; I ask'd her what she had in her Lap; she said, what is that to you, 'tis none of your's : I said it was Cloth, and I was determin'd to look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no body in the Shop?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . No, my Lord, I took the Piece of Cloth out of her Apron, whic h Cloth was twenty-two Yards; I look'd at it immediately , and knew it to be mine, because that very Morning I mark'd twenty of them with my own Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she so easily by it?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge. There lay a Quantity of them upon the Counter , which I had mark'd that very Morning .</p>
               <p>Q. Was all of them bundled up in that Manner?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to it?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . I shew'd her the rest with the same Mark .</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say.</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . She prmended the Child she had, about five Years old, pick'd it off the Ground.</p>

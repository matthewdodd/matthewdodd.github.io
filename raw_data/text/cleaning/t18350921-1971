                  </hi>. I am a mariner, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Pentworth</hi> schooner, which laid in the London Docks. The prisoner applied to me about a week before the robbery to take him into my employ—I took him out of charity, and on the 15th, in the evening, when I went to bed, I took four sovereigns, three half-crowns, and six pence from my trowsers pocket, and put them in my waistcoat pocket—I had three-halfpence and a key in another pocket—I hung my colthes up at the state-room door—I missed my money the next morning—the prisoner was then missing—I found him in the Deptford-road—the officer said, "What ship do you belong to?"—he said, "None at all"—the officer found on him four sovereigns, three half-crowns, and two shillings—I said, "Where did you get that jacket?"—he said, "I bought it out of part of the money, for three shillings, and will show you where I bought it"—he said he was sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would let him go.</p>

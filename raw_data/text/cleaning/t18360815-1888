On the 4th of August, just after twelve o'clock at night, I was in Gray's-inn-lane—a man ran against me—I thought it was the effect of an accident, but almost immediately found I had lost my watch and its appendages—the next morning I went to the different pawn<lb></lb>brokers, and at one I heard the seal had been offered to know if it was gold—I gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the seal and ring from the pawnbroker—I then detained Hubbard till he produced the man that he said he had it of—he brought the prisoner—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found the duplicate of the watch in his watch-pocket, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the duplicate of the watch, which was pledged in Holborn—the ribbon, which the prosecutor swears to, was in the prisoner's coat pocket—when I came to his watch-pocket, he said, "Now, old man, you have got it; I had the watch".</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Friday morning, between the hours of four and five, I was passing along the fields leading from Calthorpe-street to Bag<lb></lb>wells road, by the wall of the House of Correction; and in a corner where there is a water-course, I saw the watch. I picked it up, and at the time thought I was committing no crime in so doing. I afterwards went to the Cobham's Head, to clean some knives and forks for the pot-boy. I informed him that I had found a seal, he then asked me if I wished to sell it, and what I wanted for it; I said I would leave the price with him: and I solemnly declare at that time, I thought it was only metal—he offered me a shilling for it, saying it was as much as he could afford—I let him have it. At the time I found the watch, I was in the deepest distress, having been out of work for twelve months, and having a wife and seven children entirely dependent on me. I did, I must confess, pledge the watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

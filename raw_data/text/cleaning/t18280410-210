            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 28th of February I was in company with Bassett and Lloyd, near the house of Linton, at Islington-green; he is a retailer of table-beer, what is called a pinman; I saw the two prisoners about six o'clock in the evening, come there, and Culley had a firkin on his shoulder; they were walking in company together; I should think they were a mile and a half, or two miles from Mr. Harris'; he lives in the Hampstead-road; they went up the gateway to Linton's brewery, and set the cask down at Linton's door - they then went to a workshop in the same yard, next door to Linton's, made some inquiry, and then returned up the yard; I went to them, and asked what they had left the cask there for - they appeared confused, and I said, "What business had you to leave that cask there?" they said they had found it in Smithfield, and were going to take it home- I think it was Fagan who said he picked it up, and Culley said he was assisting him to carry it; it was a small cask, and did not require two men to carry it; I took them in charge, and fetched the cask from Linton's door.</p>

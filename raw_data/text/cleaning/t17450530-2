            . I am a founder in Shoe Lane. On the 11th of May I bought a dial of the Prisoner, the cock [the gnomon] was off, and the arms were erased out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sanders. Had it a gnomon upon it when it was in your master's garden?</p>
               <p>Sanders. It had a gnomon to it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gregory. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I bought it as old brass, I gave him nine shillings and a peny; it weighed thirteen pounds two ounces; and he brought two brass candlesticks feet, and part of a knocker.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Gregory. I believed he dealt in old pewter and old brass, and such things. He told me he was a country dealer, and used to buy up these things in the country. I have had a great deal of trouble in this case in taking the Prisoner, and if I had not taken him, I might probably have stood in his shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sell Tunbridge ware, and have dealt that way a great many years.</p>

             (mathematical instrument maker to his Majesty.)

It was a very neat one; Mr. Hedges gave me five guineas and a half for it.</p>

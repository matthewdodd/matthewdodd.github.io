                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Everett-street, Brunswick-square. The prisoner had been once in my service—on the 9th of Sept, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was called by the police-man, and found the prisoner concealed under the sofa in the back parlour—he was taken to the station—there were marks that he had got in by the fanlight over the shop-door—that had not been shut at night—we leave it open in warm nights for ventilation—there is always a man at work on the premises—we never leave it open when a man is not there—these six keys and this ring were found on the prisoner—they are mine.</p>

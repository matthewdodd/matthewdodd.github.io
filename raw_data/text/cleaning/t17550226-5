            . Cowley was a lodger in my house; one evening he brought a piece of shalloon home, and desired me to look on it, he said he had it of one Haines; he desired I would tell him what it was worth per yard, I said, I could not justly tell, but said it was very slight, and might be worth about a shilling per yard. I have seen Haines twice at my house; I asked him how Haines came by such goods? he said, Haines told him it was given him in exchange for some old cloaths. Some time after that I found Cowley had some bays, which was about a fortnight before he was taken up; I understood that the bays was to be sold for a shilling or fourteen-pence per yard, which he had from Haines, then I told him I would inquire into the thing, fearing it was a bad affair, then he said he should be glad if I would go down to Haines's master; I went to Mr. Sky at the Green-man in Bucklersbury, and acquainted him with it, and desired he would endeavour to find it out, he said Haines lived with a bays-factor. In about an hour after Mr. Royds and Mr. Sky came to my house, there they found Cowley. I remember Cowley told me one day he was going to sell a piece of bays, and the people were going to stop him, and he told Haines of it, and Haines said to him, he could have brought his master and brother to have released him.</p>

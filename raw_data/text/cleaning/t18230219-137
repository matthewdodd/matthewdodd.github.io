I had entered the number of the notes in my memorandum book, the 100 l. was No. 19,834, dated the 11th of October, 1822; I stopped them at the Bank, and in about a month, I was sent for and found the 100 l. note.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Whitechapel, and know the prisoner. On the 20th of November, about nine o'clock at night, he and a girl who I never saw before, came to my house; he pulled an 100 l. note out of his waistcoat pocket, presented it to me upside down, and asked me what amount it was; I turned it round, and told him it was an 100 l. Bank note - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! is it;" I turned it round on the blank side; there was an endorsement on the back of it, hardly legible - I could not make out what it was. He put it into his pocket, and then pulled out a 20 l. note, and asked what it was; I told him; that was quite new, and had no endorsement; he then pulled out a new 5 l. note - I told him what that was - he said he would lay out the 5 l. note if I would change the others for him; I refused, and he left the shop. (My house is half or three quarters of a mile from Chapel-street,) I had known him for about four week before, and when he left the shop, suspecting all was not right, I followed him and the girl seven or eight hundred yards off into Rosemary-lane, and lost sight of them all at once. I then went to Whitechapel watch-house, and stated what had happened. Plankett Parteridge, and I went round together after them for three or four hours without success.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is your's an open shop - A. Yes. There are clothes hanging outside the same as at other shops. I had seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood frequently, and had seen him seven or eight times; he was dressed in a short fustian jacket; I do not know where he lived. I never saw the woman before; she looked like a girl of the town; she had a red whittle on. I had no power to stop him if I had chosen - he could have overcome me. I was tried here some years ago, for fetching three spoons out of pawn, and was acquitted. I have been in the House of Correction, and in Clerkenwell, about a stolen 10 l. note, which I took in my business - I was detained for a fortnight, and then discharged. I was also in prison about a quantity of palms, which I had sold to a slopseller, and when the business of the 10 l. note happened, a person came forward and owned four of the palms, and I was held to bail, tried at Hick's Hall, and was acquitted. I never said that it was another man who brought me the 100 l. note, or that I offered 50 l. for the notes.</p>

On the 20th of November, Lewis came to me and Parteridge, at the Horse and Groom, public-house, which is opposite the watch-house, about a quarter past nine o'clock, and said, a man and a girl had been to his house with a 100 l., a 20 l., and a 5 l. note; he described their persons, and said, the man wanted to lay out the 5 l. note, if he would change the others, we went with him in search of them for above an hour, and from the description he gave me, I said who I thought they were, I saw the prosecutor next day, and he shewed me the house where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know who inhabits the house - A. No. Lewis said he followed them to Rosemary-lane.

Lewis said the woman had a red whittle on.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Preston, in Lancashire. I was residing for two or three days at the Golden Cross. On the 18th of January I lost the property stated from my own private bed-room, No. 16, some was on a chair, and some hung up behind the door—I saw it safe about a quarter, before six o'clock that evening—I went out, returned about eleven o'clock, and the landlord told me something—I saw my property at the office the next morning—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am chamber-maid at the Golden Cross. Mr. Kemp was lodging at No. 16—I saw these clothes there—I knew nothing of the prisoner till I saw him run up stairs on the evening of the 18th, about a quarter to seven o'clock—I asked him if he would accept of a candle—he made me no reply—I could not recognize him as stopping at the house; but as he was going up, I thought he was going to sleep there—he was up stairs a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I called the waiter to take my seat, and I then went up and searched two or three rooms, but could not find him—I was then coming down, and met him coining from the second story, where No. 16 is—I said, "Where have you come from?"—he made no answer, but looked at me—I said, "You have not got the clothes on that you had when you went up"—he made no reply, but looked at me again—he had a cigar in his mouth—I called the waiter, and we asked the prisoner where he came from—he said, "From No. 27."—I said I knew that was not right—he then said No. 37—we knew there was a lady and gentleman there—the waiter then said, "Show me where</p>

               <p>you came from," and he took us to No. 16—he then took off his Mack<lb></lb>intosh and this coat, and said, "Let me go"—the waiter said, "No, I will call my master"—all this property was found on him—he had not left any of his own clothes there, but put these things on over them.</p>

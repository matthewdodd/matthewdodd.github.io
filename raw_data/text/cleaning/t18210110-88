               <p>"Is this Fountain?" Darch said Fountain was gone to Barnet, and he was come to sweep the chimney. I shewed him down stairs, drew them some beer, and went into my own room while they swept the chimney. Two silver tea-spoons were with the tea things, but before they had done I returned into the kitchen. Darch asked for the money. I told him to call again for it, and let them out, and about eight o'clock the servant missed the spoons - in about a quarter of an hour Darch came for the money. I told him to deliver up the tea-spoons - he denied knowing any thing of it. I told him to wait a moment. I turned round - he opened the door and ran out, and I after him. I secured him in a court which had no thoroughfare - the constable asked where the spoons were - be denied it, and then said he had given them to another sweep named Darby, and wrote on a paper</p>
               <p>"No. 7, Lilly-street, Saffron-hill." We went and found Darby at a shoemaker's shop, and asked if he knew a sweep named Darch - he took us to Jacob's-court, up two pair of stairs, the constable asked for the property Darch gave him - he then took us to Turnmill-street, and said</p>
               <p>"You are pretty near the spoons now," and in White-horse-court, he took and pushed some dirt away from the wall and pointed them out,</p>

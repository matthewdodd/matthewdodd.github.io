                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Beswick, who keeps the Green Dragon, at Stepney. The prisoner was two months in my service, as cook—she went out about Christmas, with my leave—she staid out all night—I dismissed her the next day—I soon afterwards missed the pro<lb></lb>perty stated, and went to seek for her—I could not find her where she said she lived; but I found a young man that visited her—he begged me very hard to wait till the next day; and said he should see her—I gave him till the next day, and then he had got some things to my son's; but he would not give up where the prisoner was—I gave him in charge—he then gave her up—I found her at Hampstead—here is a sheet, a shirt, a bed-gown, &amp;c.—the young man proves to be her husband—I did not know it before he brought these things to my son-in-law's.</p>

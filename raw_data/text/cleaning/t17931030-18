               <p>Q. Then it was not dark at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I have only to ask you whether you are positive? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was going through St. Martin's-court, I heard this gentleman cry out stop thief! and with that he comes up to me and says, you have got my watch; I said I have not got the watch; I see a man run before me. He up with his hand and with his cane gave me a knock on the head; I said don't ill use me; and there was a parcel of people surrounding me, and I was taken to Bow-street; I have no witness to call. When they took me up to Bow-street, I says to the gentleman, I beg you will look to see if you have not got the watch, he said if I have got the watch, you must have played a slight of hand trick, accordingly he felt and he found he had got it in his pocket.</p>

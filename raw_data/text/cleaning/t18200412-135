I suspected her, marked the note, and said I had not got change, but I would try to get it in the neighbourhood. I went out, returned, and asked her her name and address, and of whom she took the note. She said she was an unfortunate woman, and the note was given to her by a gentleman in Shepherd-street - she gave her name as

            , City-road. I said I must search her, which she objected to. I repeated the request, and stated that I was a constable, but she still objected to it. I said I must take her to a place where we should force her to be searched -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120058"></xptr>she was searched in our back room by a woman, and taken to the watch-house; she then said she had no place of residence. I said she must have some place to keep her clothes in; she said she had nothing but what she had got on. I said it was strange she should buy a pocketbook for 4 s. 6 d. when she could get one for 8 d. or 9 d. that would answer her purpose - she made no answer. I returned home, and on going to the shop, in the place where she stood, I found a new umbrella - next morning Mr. Simms claimed it - (looks at one) - this is it.</p>

            . I live in Marylebone-street. On the 24th of February, about a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought an umbrella for 7 s. 6 d., and said if it turned out good she would recommend me a customer. She tendered me a 1 l. note, but I begged of her to give me silver; she produced 2 s. and a 1 l. note from under her glove, said that was all she had, and she was determined to have an umbrella. I held the note up to the light, and saw the water-mark, then went out to borrow a few shillings, and gave her change - the umbrella produced is the one she bought. I gave the note she gave to me to Abbott; who got it changed for me.</p>

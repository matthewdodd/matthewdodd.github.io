                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Crawley, of Bainbridge-street, Saint Gilles's. On the 20th of August I put a sovereign, a half sovereign, nine shillings and sixpence in silver, a pocket-book, and a bunch of keys into a pocket, which I put under my pillow, or on a box along side my bed—I had two rings—I could swear to my wedding-ring—I took the prisoner on suspicion, between eight and nine o'clock the next morning, and he owned to it—I think it was on the 20th of last month—my husband took the pri<lb></lb>soner—he did not live in the same house—he got in in the morning when my husband went out to work—It was about four days after when my hus<lb></lb>band found him—I saw him a quarter of a mile from where I live—I said, "What have you done with my money?"—he said, "I have not taken it"—I said "I know you have bought a new suit of clothes—where did you get the money?"—he said, he was very sorry; he id not know it was my money, or he would not have taken it, and that he gave some to another boy—I asked where he had put my pocket—he said, "Come along, and I will show you"—he took me to a water-closet, about twenty doors from where I lodged, in the same street—he put his hand down before my husband and said, "I have placed the pocket there"—I got a stick, and my husband found the pocket, and put his hand into it, and found one ring—I asked him what had become of the other ring—he said, "Come along, and I will show you I <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> it on the stairs"—he took us up to the landing, but we could not found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's husband. I took the prisoner in Carnaby market—I said I had been hunting for him three or four days—he said, "Not me"—I said, "Yes, I want you"—he stooped down, and said, "I don't know you"—"I know you, then"—said I, "What did you do with my money?"—he said, "Mr. Crawley, if I had known it was your money I should not have taken it"—"What have you done with it?" says I—"I bought a suid, of clothes in Monmouth-street, "said he, "and gave the money to another boy"—I asked his name, he said, "One Leary"—he said he put the pocket in Mr. Langley's privy—he took me to show it me—he said, "We had given the handkerchief to a boy, and was looking in the water-closet for the pocket, and could not find it there"—Mrs. Langley came in—I took up some boards, and found the pocket, and the gold ring in it—he then went with me to the stairs—I was looking for the other ring—he came and said, "It is not there now"—I went with him to the pawnbroker's—he said the handkerchief had been pawned, and he had sold the duplicate for three-halfpence—the handkerchief was gone—he said he gave the handkerchief and two-pence to another boy to pawn it.</p>

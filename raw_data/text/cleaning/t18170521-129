               <p>EDWARD LOWE. On the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner passed my door with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210040"></xptr>a sack on his back, with somthing in it, which I took to be bread, I was going to stop him, when a Jew came up, and said he saw him fill the sack with loaves, from a barrow in Howland-mews. I followed him, and stopped him in Foley-street, and insisted on his taking the sack back to where he got it from; when he got to the place a great mob assembled, and endeavoured to rescue him. I detained him, and kept him there for sometime, thinking the man would come back, and then took him to the watchhouse, with great difficulty. At twelve o'clock I found the property belonged to Dix.</p>
               <p>HENRY HOWARD. I took the prisoner into custody; he said a man told him he might take as many as he liked.</p>

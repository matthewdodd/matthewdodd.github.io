            . I was to have had twenty-eight sacks of potatoes brought by the prisoner's cart from Tooley-street, on the 6th of March - I did not see them in the cart so as to notice the number; when the prisoner came to my door there were but twenty-seven sacks in the cart- I said, "You have been making away with one sack;" he said he knew nothing about it, but he supposed if he had lost one, he should have to make it good; I ordered my man to get my horse - I went over the water, and brought the salesman and his clerk; when I returned there were twenty-eight sacks in the cart, but I had taken away the empty sack before I went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the cart loaded? A. No; I saw it when it was loaded, but did not count the sacks - he brought a book with the potatoes; I cannot tell who loaded it - I was in the ship at the time it was loaded; I saw the prisoner starting with the cart full - twenty-four is the usual number for a cart to carry; it was overloaded - I think the sacks were not fastened with any ropes; I should think one could not have fallen off, for they can load thirty-two sacks in a cart: I suppose the distance is a mile and a half over the stones.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see them loaded? A. No, but I counted them when he went out of the wharf; I did not get into the cart, but I could tell if I were blindfolded pretty near - some of them did partly conceal others, but not entirely.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Adams, a butcher. I saw the prisoner with a cart, near my master's shop, in <placeName id="t18290409-190-crimeloc1079">Shoreditch</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was this from Mr. Parker's? A. Not more than half a dozen doors - it was before he got to Mr. Parker's; the cart did not go on, but he went in - whether it fell off or not I cannot tell; the cart seemed to he pretty full.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was the sack tied? A. I did not notice that.</p>

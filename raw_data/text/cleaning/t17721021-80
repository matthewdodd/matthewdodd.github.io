I called in assistance from over the way; he said he understood the law very well, that I should take care I did not insult him in his house; I told him I did not care for his house, nor anybody, I would secure him: he and I walked together up and down from two till about half after six o'clock; if he went to the door I held his coat; I never left him; I sent a porter to my wife to tell her my situation, and she sent two men; he said there was a gentleman at the Angel Inn to convey the plate into the country; about six o'clock there came

I would run you through the body if you served me so; he said he would serve me to-morrow with a King's Beach writ; well said I, but have you my plate, or will you pay for it? he said, no; I then took the prisoner before Justice Welch; there he said he had sent the plate into Dorsetshire, to one Capt. Robinson. The Justice said to Holloway; I know you, give the candlesticks back; and the Justice desired we would go to the door, and see if we could settle matters; at the door he said, what must we do? I said I must have my money of my candlesticks: says Holloway, I never will propose a thing but I will stick to, and upon my honour you shall have the plate on Saturday; I said I will not take your word for two pence, so Holloway asked Leo to produce the note; Holloway looked at it and said it was not worth two-pence, and the prisoner was committed; the next morning Nicolls came to my house, about half an hour after seven, and said it is a sad affair, I can tell you where Ward lodges, and he pawned the candlesticks; we went to Ward's lodgings, and his wife said her husband had pawned some candlesticks for Mr. Leo, at Mr. Trip's, in St. Martin's-lane. we went there, and Trip said they were pawned there the day before.

I was in the house when Touling brought the candlesticks, on the 28th of September, about eleven or twelve o'clock; I shewed him into the parlour to Leo, and shut the door, and went to writing again in the room adjoining; he staid about a quarter of an hour, and then came out again another way into the parlour where I was writing, and was let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210042"></xptr> out by a footman of Mr. Holloway's; he had a green back under his arm when he came in, which seemed to have goods in it; he returned with it under his arm, but it appeared to be empty. In about five or six minutes Leo called me into the parlour, and told me he had bought a pair of candlesticks of a silversmith, for which he had credit two or three months; but mentioned no bill; he asked me if I could borrow fourteen guineas upon them; he said they were to go into the country, for a friend of Mr. Holloway's, and therefore could not lie long at the pawnbroker's; if I could not get fourteen guineas, he bid me get as much as I could; he bid me carry them to Mr. Tripp's, the pawnbroker's, and he gave me a tavern bill which amounted to 2 l. 14 s. to pay as I came back; I went to Mr. Trip's and asked him to lend me fourteen guineas upon them; he said what are they a compliment to Mr. Holloway; I said they might come by that channel; he lent me ten guineas upon them; I asked for a duplicate; he said he would not give me one as they were above 10 l. but I must sign a note of my leaving them there; I did in my own name, and as I came back, called at the Adelphi tavern, and paid the bill, and I ordered a dinner for that day as Leo had directed me. The waiter went to change a guinea; I met him; he said I must go back as fast I could; that my master wanted me; when I came, Leo came into the entry, and said I must fetch the candlesticks again instantly; I told him that was impossible, for that I had paid away part of the money at the Adelphi tavern; said he you must go instantly, and urged me to go. I went out of the house, and went to one Mr. Herring, a friend, in the Strand, to advise what was to be done; he said if I went to the pawnbroker's again, he would not let me have the plate without making up the money. I did not know what to do; he said I had better go to Mr. Holloway, I went to see for him, and found him at a coffee house; he had heard the story, and said give me the 14 guineas.</p>

               <p>"a servant to Leo, and Holloway jointly, that</p>

               <p>Ward. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you pledge them at Mr. Trip's?</p>
               <p>Ward. Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to Trip. When did he pledge them with you?</p>
               <p>Trip. Between two and three I had just dined.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner to Ward. As you acknowledge yourself my servant, do you not know the duty of a servant, if you was my servant, why did not you obey my orders directly?</p>
               <p>Ward. I was detained at the pawnbroker's, and at the Tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pawn them in my name?</p>
               <p>Ward. Because I looked upon it you had a joint property: after that Holloway demanded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177210210043"></xptr> the fourteen guineas, which was the very sum Leo ordered me to get.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your not coming back to me, but running away with the money, and hiding yourself in the country?</p>
               <p>Ward. I came back to you directly, and you bid me go and get them instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go into the country?</p>
               <p>Ward. There was an attachment of privilege against a person, and Jacobs desired me to go and see the person arrested directly, so on that account I went to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Touling has said several things that are false: first place when I ordered the things, Touling delivered them on the table; I said, are they the same I looked out. When he had delivered them to me, he pulled out his pocket book, and delivered the bill to me; I tendered that draught to him; he asked if it was a good draught; I said it was, and would be paid when it became due. When we were before the justice, the accepter said he would pay it when it was become due, and he went away very satisfied. Ward came into the room, and said they looked pretty; I said they were to go into the country; I went up stairs, and when I came down, he was gone with the goods; when he was gone Touling came in and demanded the goods; he questioned me about it: I said if he would go, I would see if I could find Ward, but he would not go, nor let me go, so I could not find Ward nor the goods.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Nicholas. After he was taken up the last witness came for a tea chest he had of his, and said Leo formerly used to be an honest man, but since he got connected with Holloway, he has been as great a rogue as he.</p>
               <p>Trueby. I said in this gentleman's house, if they had done such roguish things, they were great rogues.</p>

               <p>Dr. Wilson. Trueby said he knew him from a child; that he used to be an honest man, but since he had been with Holloway, he was as great a rogue as he. He said he left a tea-chest in his custody to dispose of for him, and it would be hard if he could not get it again.</p>

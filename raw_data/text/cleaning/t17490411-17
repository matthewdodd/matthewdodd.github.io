I have known her for some years , and she knew she had never a friend in the world like my self. On the 22d of April, having by that time some little suspicion of her, I took a gentleman with me and went over the water to the farther end of Tooly-street; she came home with me to my own house; she first said she sold it for a guinea ; then she said she had pawn'd it for a guinea ; we went all three to the pawnbroker's, and charg'd him with it, and there was no such thing , she never brought it; then she fell down on her knees and wrung her hands , and said it was gone, and I should never see it more, saying she sold it on the Custom-house key, to a man in a white cap; she ask'd him three guineas for it, and he offer'd her two; he call'd to a man in a jacket and trowsers bring a light to look on it; after which he gave her three guineas .</p>

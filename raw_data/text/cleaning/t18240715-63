The prisoner came into our service on the 3d of May; we do not keep an open shop. On taking stock on the 23d of June we missed three seals among a great deal of other property; they were gold seals, and had been kept in a drawer in the warehouse. We found them in pawn. We can ascertain their description and value by our books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did Mr. Allanson come into partnership with you - A. On the 1st of April; - it was the prisoner's duty to take out goods, which were given him to dispose of, but none but what were given to him - they were always given to him - he was to shew them round the trade; he had particular directions every morning - and I or my partner always examined the stock he took out - he was only to take such goods as we gave him, and was not authorised to open a fresh account without our knowledge, unless he sold for cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not express a desire that the stock should be taken - A. Never, till I told him there were many goods missing, and must have stock taken; he might have replied that he was anxious for it, I cannot tell. He absented himself one day, but returned the next - he continued in our employ till stock was taken, and up to the Saturday following. I told him we should not want his services - I produce his daily sale book - the first entry is dated on the 8th of April, and the last on the 23d of June. I have made a few entries in it myself, having sold some goods. We were two days taking stock - he was absent one of those days - I had told him we should not want him after that week.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you take stock in the regular course of business, or under suspicion that you were robbed - A. Suspecting that we had been robbed, I mentioned these seals to him as having been missed among other things - he gave no account of them. We finished taking stock on Thursday - he came on Friday. I asked him then, and repeatedly to explain about the seals - he gave no explanation. I paid him his wages, and discharged him on Saturday - we were not then sensible of the extent of our loss. He should enter in this book what he had done with the property he took out, I never ordered him to take these seals.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Here are many entries of seals in this book - A. Yes, but not of those in question. On the day he left he said there was some money he could receive from a person I did not know - I said</p>
               <p>"Go and receive it." He returned and said he had not received it, but had lent the man the money to pay me (looking at three seals) these are them - two are worth 46 s. and the other 38 s.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>MR. SPENCER. I had seen these seals a few days before we took stock - I know them by the workmanship.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLANSON. I never authorized the prisoner to take out these seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prisoner come into your employ - A. On the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the partnership - A. Not till a few days before he left us - it was on the night of the 21st of June. I had said nothing to him, but he told me he knew I had borrowed money of my sister to open an account at a banker's, and he insinuated things against my partner - he said if I would look in the books I should find false entries made, and proposed my drawing part of the stock from the concern; and said I might command him in what way I pleased. I did not propose it to him - he said he would take the stock out as usual next day, and sell it as usual, and I would meet him at the Colonial Coffee-house at five o'clock in the evening; and I might enquire in the mean time into what he had said. I never myself desired him to take part of the stock out. I know Saunders - I went with him one day to search a house near the Cobourg Theatre, after the prisoner was in custody. I never told him I had engaged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150025"></xptr>with the prisoner to take away the most valuable part of the stock, to compel Spencer to dissolve the partnership, or any thing of the kind. I might have said I had agreed to meet him at the coffee-house, as it was publicly known then. I told him the prisoner was to wait me at the coffee-house with the stock which he had taken out to sell - he had advised me to secure the stock - I said I would consider of what he had said, and would meet him there. My partner had sent him out with the stock as well as myself. I related the circumstances to Saunders in the way I have stated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him you had agreed to the proposition - A. I do not think that I did - I will not swear it. I called at the Colonial Coffee-house, and he was not there. I left word for him to stop, intending to call in half an hour, but did not. My father was going that way; I desired him to call and send him home. My father saw him safe into the house, and then left. I never expressed a dissatisfaction about the partnership, except from what he insinuated. I had no conversation with him at any other time about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you draw any money out of the banker's on a particular account - A. Only to pay the partnership accounts. He was absent one day while we were taking stock. Mr. Spencer told him to come at nine o'clock, but he did not; he came next day, in consequence of my going to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How did you meet with Saunders - A. He came to me, at our house in Red Lion-street, in consequence of my calling at his mother's; he had been in our service in May; we sent for him, thinking he might give some information about the property. I never entertained the least doubt of my partner's fidelity till the 21st of June, when the prisoner suggested this to me; he suggested every thing to me. I appeared to acquiesce, but formed no opinion about it, wishing to inquire further; I only told him to take the stock out as usual. I told Mr. Spencer what had passed on the Thursday; after the stock came home. My sister demanded the money she had 1 nt, and I withdrew it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What stock did he bring home on Thursday - A. I do not know, my Lord, it was more than usual.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th, in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. I found seven or eight sovereigns on him. He said he knew there was a quantity of property missing, and he could explain it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK to MR. SPENCER. Q. Is there any thing in these seals to enable you to distinguish them from others of the same pattern - A. They are of a particular pattern; they were in a private drawer in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I first entered their service, I supposed I was to do the out-door business alone; I was to have thirty shillings a week at first, which was to be increased as I sold more goods. When I went on Monday, to my surprise a youth named Saunders was there to be employed in the same way at half my salary. I found from my first day's business that there was not enough employment for me, and saw this youth was there to supplant me, when I had formed a connection. It may he said I have made false entries in my book. I have done so, but I have paid the money for the goods, which my book will prove, and their cash book also, which is the case with these three seals. Saunders sold a good many seals; I entered these and paid for them. Not wishing him to get the connexion. I saw these three seals in the warehouse, and told Mr. Spencer I wanted them to shew with others. There was never an account taken of what I took out after the first fortnight; I was authorized to take any articles which I could sell, I was very unsuccessful on that day, and entered these seals - two to Mr. Rossery, and one to Campbell; fearing Saunders would do more than me, I entered Campbell's as paid, and paid for it myself, and entered Rossery payable on a certain day, and paid it myself on that day.</p>
               <p>MR. SPENCER. Here is on cash-book. The prisoner has entered in his book</p>
               <p>"One seal 17th, 42 s., and one 34 s.," making 3 l. 16 d., discount 3 s. 3 d., paid - Campbell one seal, 34 s., discount 2 s., 1 l. 12 s., paid." We received the cash for these entries, but these are not the seals in question, and the seals he states he had from the warehouse was on the 18th; this entry is on the 17th. I am quite certain that it relates to quite different seals.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How can you tell they are not the same seals - A. The price is very different, and these are three which were given to him, and accounted for, and of a different pattern. The price tells the pattern. Here is an entry in the cash-book of 1 l. 12 s. received from Campbell, on the 17th, and 3 l. 12 s. from Rossery, on the 22 d.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have the seals ever been delivered out of your stock to be offered for sale - A. Never; they are of quite a different price.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are your seals ticketed with the prices when you deliver them to him for sale - A. Yes, unless it is a common pattern, which he would have a sufficient knowledge of. I recollect his asking for the seals, which he has entered perfectly well - he did not usually take out seals, but he said he had a customer, and I gave him three, which he returned, as sold to Rossery and Campbell.</p>
               <p>- ROSSERY. Q. Did the prisoner sell any seals to you on the 17th of June - A. No.</p>

            . I entered the prosecutor's service on the same day as the prisoner. The goods were selected for him at first, but he afterwards took what he thought proper - he entered them on a slate, and in the evening accounted for them. I left on the 24th of May. I checked his accounts every night. On the 1st of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning I had some conversation with Mr. Allanson, on Blackfriars-bridge; he said he had agreed with the prisoner to take out the best part of the goods by stratagem, and he was to meet him at the Colonial coffee-house at five o'clock that evening, and the goods were to be detained, to make Mr. Spencer settle accounts; he said he had taken legal advice on the subject. He said he went to the coffee-house, but did not meet Fidler.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you lived with any one since you left the prosecutors - A. No. I know the conversation was on the 1st of July, by a memorandum I have, of having been there on that day to cast up their books.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the prosecutors - A. Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150026"></xptr>Spencer told me on Saturday evening that he had no further occasion for my services.</p>

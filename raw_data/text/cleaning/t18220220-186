I passed between the men and the women, and felt a finger at my waistcoat pocket. I immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I'll not be robbed, keep your hands off;" a young man rushed before me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you say I robbed you?" I said, I'll have nothing to say to you." I was going on, and at the corner of Black Eagle-street, somebody behind pushed against me, and shoved me up the street, and one of them violently thrust his hands into my waistcoat pocket, and took out my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200077"></xptr>watch. I cried Stop thief! he was followed to the end of the street, and somebody said,</p>
               <p>"We have got your watch." I found the prisoner in custody, and gave him in charge at the watch-house. I cannot say whether he was one of the men, my sight is very bad.</p>

            . I was coming along Brick-lane, between five and six o'clock, and opposite the end of Black Eagle-street, I saw the prosecutor surrounded by three fellows, and from the position they were in, I thought they were robbing him - I was running to the spot, and had got as far as the middle of the road, when all three ran off - the prisoner up the lane, another in the opposite direction, and the third down Black Eagle-street, where he fell down, and I overtook him. He got up and was running off again, I struck him on the head with my umbrella, he then turned from the middle of the street, towards the pavement, when several persons seized him. I saw his hand in a position, as if he had thrown something in the kennel, I picked the watch out, and with several others, took him to the watch-house - it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard the cry and joined in the pursuit for twenty yards, and saw a lad drop something - they collared me and said I was the person who dropped it.</p>

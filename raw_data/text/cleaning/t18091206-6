On the 5th of November, I went to the houses, to give them some air. When I got to the top story, I perceived the wet come through the ceiling: I went upon the roof, and found the lead was missing from the gutters of all the three houses, except a small piece that hung over to blind my sight: by seeing that, I should have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180912060007"></xptr>concluded the lead was all safe; the piece that was left was about three feet long at the end. I went into one of the kitchens of the unfinished houses, and saw some lead standing up by the kitchen wall, concealed; some boards were placed round it. I went to Mr. Armstrong and the other officers to come and watch with me. About half seven I saw a man come on the terrace: he jumped from there into the house where I saw the lead. In two or three minutes he returned with something under his arm like a bundle: he went off with the bundle. Mr. Armstrong went into the houses, and said one of the pieces of lead were gone. In about a quarter of an hour, the same man returned again: I am certain it was the same man by his walk and by his coat: I saw him jump down the same place again; the officers had placed themselves in the kitchen during the time he was gone; I took a lanthorn, and went into the empty house, and saw the prisoner in the custody of the officers: he had moved the lead three feet from where I had seen it on the same day; I am sure he is the man that was taken. I am quite clear of it. I was looking out of the one pair of stairs window when he first came; the lamp gave a light to the terrace.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went in the kitchen, the prisoner had none of the lead about him then. - A. No, the prisoner was secured, and taken before a magistrate: on comparing the lead in the kitchen with that upon the house, they were the same in breadth and thickness; it made a complete join: I make no doubt but that it was the lead that came off my houses.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of November, Mr. Emmins applied to me: I went with Bishop and my son to some new houses of his in Hackkney Road. I had a candle and lanthorn, and saw the lead behind the boards in the kitchen: there were two pieces; one a very large roll, and the other a small one: the timber was put over them as before; then I and Bishop went to the adjoining house: after I had been there some time, I had occasion to go through that very house where the lead was, I found one piece gone from the kitchen: then Bishop placed himself in the front kitchen, and I placed myself to command a view of the kitchen where the lead was left: in about twenty minutes I heard something; I looked and let it come into the second kitchen, where the lead was. I saw the figure of a man; I seized him, and never let him go, which was the prisoner at the bar. Bishop instantly came to me and the prosecutor; I sent him for a candle and lanthorn; I never quitted the prisoner till he got a candle and landthorn, and then the prosecutor measured the wall where the lead lodged against, from where it laid flat on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that. - A. Two or three feet: he took particular notice; I requested him, he being a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. When you last left it, and put the timber before it, it stood against the wall - A. Yes, and when I took the prisoner, it laid flat on the ground. I found this basket and a bit of a blanket at the side of the foredoor, which was not there when we went in the first time. This large piece of lead I locked up in the cupboard on the Monday; it was compared with the piece that the prosecutor produced; it matched.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the piece I took off the house.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I was present with Armstrong; I was placed in the front kitchen, and Armstrong in the back. The prisoner passed me about three yards: when I came up to him, Armstrong had hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the different situation of the lead when you left it to where it was when you apprehended the prisoner. - A. Yes; Armstrong has given a right account of it; I saw the two pieces of lead fitted; they corresponded.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He had a very quick walk, and the same coat he has now: the lamps upon the terrace gave a light; I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live at No.2, Princes-street, Portman-market. I know Mr. Lawrence's shop—he is a linen draper in New Church-street—on Thursday evening, the 14th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was passing his shop, and I saw the prisoner Miles looking in at the window—Shepherd and Snelling were standing together at the corner of Carlisle-street, about a dozen yards off, talking together—I then went into a baker's shop two doors off, and when I came out of that shop I saw Miles taking some prints from inside the shop door, which was open—he ran to Shepherd and Snelling, who stood at the corner, and gave the things to Shepherd—Miles and Shepherd then ran down Carlisle-street—Snelling passed Mr. Lawrence's shop, looked in at the door, and passed along—I ran in and gave information to Mr. Law<lb></lb>rence—Sudell ran out after them, but did not overtake them—I am quite sure of the other two prisoners.</p>

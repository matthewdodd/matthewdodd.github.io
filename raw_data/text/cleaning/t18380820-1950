I live in Aldersgate-street, and am a carrier to Mr. Parry—on the 2nd of August I had my cart in the New-road, near Munster-street—the prisoner Dunn came and asked me if I would take a bag for him—I saw Mr. Graham's wagon at the corner of Munster-street, and Arthur was standing by it—they had a woollen cloth over the wagon-Arthur got upon the wheel and helped Dunn to undo the cloth—then Dunn got into the wagon, got out a bag, and brought it to my cart—it was full, and seemed to contain about one cwt.-as soon as Dunn brought it to me, I saw the contents, and told him I would have nothing to do with it—I did not see the cask undone—the name of John Graham was on the wagon.</p>

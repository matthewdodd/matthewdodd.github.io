               <p>Last Sunday se'nnight in the evening, between ten and eleven, we were at the fire, to prevent robberies; about a quarter before eleven, there was a great noise in Rood-lane; I ran down, and saw this Black and Newman having hold of Jarvis, and a very great mob were pulling him oue way and the other; I took hold of Jarvis with my left hand, and looked at him; says I, is it you Jarvis? In a minute or two somebody hit me behind over the head, not the prisoner; Filcock came and assisted me to take him to the counter; I searched him, and found nothing upon him; we went to the City Arms in Lombard-street, and a witness came in named Clarke, who took the Black's account of the watch and locket, and delivered to him a watch and a locket, which the Black said were his, and which Clarke said he found, and a locket.</p>

               <p>Harrison. I went to the prosecutor's Mistresses, and I went down into the kitchin, and there were three tea chests on the dresser; I tried the key that was on the watch, and it fitted none but the one which he said was his own.</p>

               <p>Where do you live? - In Hammersmith, Brook-green.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a weaver by trade.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with the prisoner on the night he was taken at the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Relate what you know of this transaction? - I was at one Mr. Gill's, in Whitechapel; we had a pot of beer, the prisoner and me; I was going home to Hammersmith; I said you may as well take a walk along with me, it was between the hours of eight and nine; there was a fire.</p>
               <p>Where does the prisoner live? - In Priest-alley, Tower-Dock, No. 11.</p>
               <p>Was the alehouse from whence you went in the way to his home, as well as to yours? - No, it certainly was not: coming to the fire, I stopped there about five minutes; that might be between eight and nine; the prisoner had his left hand on my right shoulder, and a stick in his right hand; he was complaining to me of a pain he had in his leg, from a fall from a horse, about five weeks back; there was a bustle among the people, and a shoving, and the prosecutor took hold of a stout lusty man, in a light-coloured drab coat, he got away from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Then you swear that the prosecutor first took hold of a stout man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100069"></xptr>with a light coloured drab coat on, who got away from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he take hold of him? - By the collar; I might be two or three yards from him, I cannot tell exactly the distance, by the crouding of the people; I could not hear any thing he said to him; the man broke away from him; the prisoner had hold of me at that time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner nearer to the black man than you was, or was you nearer to the black man? - I never saw the black man, till he seized hold of the stout lusty man; I saw him then; to the best of my knowledge I was nearer to him, he had his left hand on my right shoulder; he had a stick in his right hand; the stout lusty man got away from the prosecutor, and he seized hold of the prisoner, and said, you have got my watch. I have got no watch, says the prisoner, search me; and the scourge of people took away the prisoner and carried him to the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a butcher, I believe? - I believe he is a butcher, and kept a shop in Russel-street, Covent-Garden, about two years back; his father before him was a butcher; I have known the prisoner from a baby.</p>
               <p>He had the misfortune to fail? - He had, he is now a journeyman; I never knew any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Newman, or Fillcock, or Harrison there? - No, there was a struggling among the multitude, and the prisoner was taken away; I do not know by who; I could not follow then, but an hour after I knew he was carried to the counter; I could not get time to tell them he was innocent when they took him, the people crowded so.</p>

               <p>Was the fire in your road home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was the prisoner going with you? - As far as St. Paul's, to the Goose and Gridiron; then I should have gone to Piccadilly, and taken the stage.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of the fire when you was drinking at the alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Then coming along you stopt out of curiosity? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did nothing good or bad? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did you desert your friend, when they charged him with taking the watch? - The hustle of the people was so great, that I did not know which way he went, when they carried him away, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you appear before the justice the next morning? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Was you examined? - I was called in, and sent out again; before I went in again, they said I had no business there; Mr. Harrison says to me, you have been making it up with this man, concerning the watch; No, says I, I have not; I went to him, and spoke to him directly, and asked him; No says he, I never saw you before; there was a little man, a barber, with a loose coat on Mr. Harrison, said I, wanted to make it up with him.</p>
               <p>Court to Harrison. Was the witness at the justices the next day? - He was; I know him very well; he came to give an account, if they would let him; I told him afterwards, that I suspected he was going to make it up.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fisher. What way are you in now? - I have not followed business these two years; I have above fifty pounds a year, and I had one hundred fifty pounds, when it was left me; I have nobody but my wife and myself; and we live upon it, at Brook-Green, under Mr. Ward.</p>

               <p>Has nobody spoke to you? - Nobody, not till now, that the prisoner spoke to me; the black man said, that he only wanted his property again, as he could not swear to any body there were the words.</p>
               <p>That was said before the sister of this prisoner and you, and several other people? - I do not know, to my knowledge, they there was any body heard it besides the prisoner's sister; and myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Darby. Did you say to this woman, or the prisoner's sister, or to any body, that you could not swear to any one? - I did not say any such thing, they came after me to make it up, and I told them I would not.</p>
               <p>Did this woman come to help to make it up? - Yes, with another woman, wanted to ask me questions, I told them I could not; they wanted me to go with them, and wanted to ask me questions; my business was at home, I would not.</p>
               <p>Did this woman, or did the other woman in her presence, and when she was there, offer to make it up with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was that offer made? - The value of the watch to make it up, and not make any words.</p>
               <p>Who offered the value of the watch? - His sister.</p>
               <p>Was this woman present? - She was there, she heard it.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Leak. What did you go to him for? - I went with his sister, I cannot say what she went to him for.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing said about making it up, upon your oath? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Not a syllable? - Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Nor about giving him the value of the watch to drop the prosecution? - Not in my presence; I did not ask him any questions; I went with her; I cannot positively say I did not hear her asked the man any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Then he voluntarily without being asked any questions, said, what he wanted was his property again? - She went and spoke to him, I do not know what questions she asked him; I heard him say, what he wanted was his property again, that he could not swear to any one; I did not hear the question, I only heard the answer.</p>

             sworn. - On the 3d of October, a man came and asked for a lodging at the house where I lived; he was accommodated by the landlord in the next room adjoining to me that night; in the morning early the man went out, and left the woman behind; on the 4th of October the watch was lost; I met the woman in the passage, she said she was very dry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did a woman come with this man? - A. Yes, this woman came with the man who took the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 4th you met her in the passage, she said she was dry? - A. Yes; I said I would give her some cold tea; I gave her some, she drank it, and while I went down stairs, she slipped the lock of the door, and went in and took the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was not in the room where the watch was, when you gave her the tea? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the house belong to? - A. To Thomas Etherington.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the watch again? - A. Before we took her in Whitecross-street, I went and looked for it, I found her in the pawnbroker's shop with the watch in her hand. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that watch? - A. Two guineas, my husband gave five guineas for it twenty years ago, I seized the watch, and sent for Spicer the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That woman owed me thirty shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had come there but the night before? - A. I came to her several times for the money, and could get no money, she gave me 5 s. 6 d. the first week of Bartholomew fair; on the morning she told you, she gave me the watch for the thirty shillings, she told me to go and pawn it, and bring in a pound of soap, and two ounces of blue, and to pay myself, then I went to the pawnbroker's; as soon as I turned my back from the house, she followed me, and in the pawnbroker's shop she told me I had robbed her, and as there is a good God, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never saw her before with my eyes.</p>

            (To prisoner.) Have you any witness to prove that she owed you thirty shillings? - A. No, but the Almighty God, I am quite a stranger in the town.</p>

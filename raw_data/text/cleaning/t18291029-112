            . I live in Charlton-street. I saw the prisoner take something from his apron, and throw it into Tofts' shop; I heard Mrs. Tofts cry Stop thief! and say the prisoner had stolen the ham - he ran away, and I sent my husband after him; I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me out of the house with the ham? A. Yes, with something that you threw back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She said I was inside the shop all the time; I went to get a halfpenny worth of cheese, and knocked on the counter - no one came: I saw a carriage stop, and was going out to see if they wanted the horse held; a person came and said the woman wanted me - I went back to the shop, and the woman said I had taken up the ham, and put it down again, but it was upside down.</p>

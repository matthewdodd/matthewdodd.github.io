I was sent with some gin and other liquors in a cart to the Custom-house; I left them in the cart while I went to receive some other orders; when I came back I observed the prisoner about the cart; I found the tail of the cart cut and the cask of Geneva upon the ground; the vessel was staved and about three gallons was run out; I saw it twice in his hands; he catched at it again, then I struck him with my whip.</p>
               <p>William Hill. I was shutting up a shop near where the cart stood; I saw the prisoner with the cask in his hand, endeavouring to get it upon his shoulder; he dropped it, which staved the cask and then Morris came up.</p>

               <p>I saw the cask upon the ground; I thought it had sell out of the cart; I attempted to put it upon its head for fear the liquor should run out. Morris came up and struck me, and very much abused me.</p>

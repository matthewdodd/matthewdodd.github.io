               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not, but I am positive it is the same, he was in the shop for the space of twenty minutes; I shewed him the watch; he did not approve of that watch; he desired to look at another that was marked three guineas, which I shewed him also; he did not approve of that; I shewed him another which was marked three guineas; then he asked to look at a metal watch; the three first were silver watches, I shewed him a metal watch; he did not approve of it; then after some hesitation he agreed for the first I shewed him, for which he was to give three guineas; he desired then to look at a chain; I shewed him two chains, a steel one and a metal one, and he did not approve of either of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260043"></xptr>the two chains, he said there was a particular chain in the corner of the window which he should like to look at; at this time I had put up two of the watches out of the five which I shewed him first, and there remained three on the counter; when I turned myself about he said there was a chain which he would wish to look at, and he said he would go to the outside and point to it, he went outside to point to it as I thought, and I turned myself about and missed the watch, and the prisoner, and not seeing the prisoner I jumped over the counter to go into the street, and I could see nothing of the prisoner. Hearing of a robbery of the same nature I attended at Bow-street, at the examination, and I knew the prisoner, on Monday evening last; he had on the very same dress as he had on at the time he came into our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the watch? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty. Did you see him take the watch off the counter? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any body else in the shop? - Yes, but not at that part of the shop where the watches were shewn, there were customers pledging, and two or three more people of our own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty. How long was he in the shop? - A quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I was principally engaged with him, I took particular notice of him when I took two of the watches to hang them up; I have no doubt as to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took down five and put up two? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other people in the shop? - They were, but not in that part of the shop, there is a projection in the shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any counter between where the people were pledging and the prisoner? - There was not, there was a partition about the distance of two yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any of the other people run away? - No.</p>

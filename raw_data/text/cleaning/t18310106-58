            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill, in company with his brother Thomas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no defence to make, nor would I have made the plea I have, fearing to irritate or wound the feelings of my prosecutors, who always behaved to me with the most unbounded kindness and liberality; but merely to put myself in a situation to call on them to state their sentiments regarding me up to the time I left them, and also if they think proper to recommend me to mercy - a representation has gone abroad, as false and calumnious as it is prejudicial to the unfortunate individual before you, the statement is, that my uncle and friends, the former of whom stands as high in reputation as any merchant in the City, were privy and concerned in what has happened - I can only say, it is quite untrue, and the author ought to be ashamed at adding additional trouble on them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. The prosecutors never heard a syllable of this before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. BULMER. Q. A week previous to my leaving you, had I not notice to quit your employ? A. No; he absconded from our employ - I never hinted that he was to leave; he received considerable sums the week before he left - he was receiving money on our account up to the very day he absconded.</p>

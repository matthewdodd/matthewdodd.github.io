On 31st March, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go up Compter-street, in the Borough—I knew him before, went after him, and saw him put his band into a gentleman's pocket, take a handkerchief, and put it into his breast—I went across the road, he taw me coming, ran away, pulled out the handkerchief and threw it into the road—a man jumped out of one of Pickford's vans and picked it up—I took the prisoner; he said, "Oh dear, let me go."</p>

             (police-constable S 64). I took the prisoner, on the 27th of December - in the way to the station-house, I said, "Have you any duplicates about you?" - he said, "No; I have sent my wife eighty miles into the country to keep her out of trouble."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mrs. Townsene asked my wife for money on Christmas-eve, my wife told me to step out, and she would tell me how we were circumstanced - when we got out she would have gone down on her knees to me, and told me of it - she said, "Mrs. Townsene does not know of the greater part of these things being pawned; you had better not go home; and on Saturday we shall have money, and we will get them" - I said I would keep up if I could; but being ill, I could not go far - I then took off my shirt, and got 1s. for it to get a lodging - my wife promised to see me the next day, but she has deserted me, though I would have laid down my life for her - I then went to the workhouse, where I was taken by the officer.</p>

I am a taylor; my master was to pay me there that night; when he went to Mr. Baxter for change, Mr. Baxter said he could not do it; then he suspected he had a thief in the house; the prisoner call'd for the paper, and was reading it I believe an hour and an half; when the people went from the table he was at, he turned round and laid the paper over the tankard, and looking afterwards, I found the tankard was gone; I went to Mr. Baxter at the door, and said, the man has stole your tankard; he said he knew that; the prisoner came past me into the yard; I collared him and said, You have got a tankard of Mr. Baxter's; he said, I have not, how can you charge a gentleman so; search me; then Mr. Baxter took him by the collar, and I felt and found the tankard hanging behind him; there was a handkerchief put through the handle; I laid hold of that and pulled it from him; (produced and deposed to.)</p>

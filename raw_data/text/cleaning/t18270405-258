On Saturday, the 10th of February, I sent him with four 5l. Huntingdon notes, to go to Esdaile's to change them, and go to the Bank and get silver for them - he went about ten o'clock, and I directed him to be back by twelve o'clock - he said he should have plenty of time to return, but he never did return. My husband brought him back on the Saturday fortnight, and he was taken to the Compter - he never returned any thing that he got for these four notes.</p>
               <p>JOHN WINSKILL. I was not at home when my wife delivered these notes to the prisoner; but I endeavoured to find out where he came from, and I found, by a letter, that his father lived at Harlstonham - I went there, and found him at Yarmouth - he said he was very sorry for what he had done; I found on him three sovereigns, and 14s. in the bag which his mistress gave him for the money - he had purchased a great coat for 3l. 10s., a hat, and a cloak, and taken a cloak out of pawn, and paid his expenses on the road; he said the money I found on him was all he had left - I had a character with him from Mr. Williams, of Aldersgate-street.</p>

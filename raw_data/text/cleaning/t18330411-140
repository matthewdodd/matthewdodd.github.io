On the 30th of November, a woman came and took a furnished room of me, in the name of Sarah Rose - she afterwards came with the prisoner - he lodged there with her; they paid me only 3s. 6d. for rent, and went away on the night of the 13th of December; on the following day I received the key of the room in a letter, and some duplicates; I then went into the room, and missed the blanket, candlesticks, and some other articles; I also missed three gowns from an adjoining room - I have seen some of the property since - two of the gowns have been given up by the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not nearly the whole of your rooms left open, so that I might have gone in and taken property. Witness. Being a <rs id="t18330411-140-viclabel782" type="occupation">laundress</rs>

               <p>WILLIAM SUMSHON HAYES. I am a pawnbroker. I have a candlestick and a gown which were pawned by the prisoner, on the 6th of December and the 12th of December; the duplicates are both in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How long was it after that you received information? A. I think about three weeks or a month; I positively swear I took them both in of you; my young men may write duplicates for me, but I do not for them.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARRIS. These are my property - I lost above 6l. worth of articles. See the Fourth Day.</p>

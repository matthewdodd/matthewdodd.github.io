                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Hackman Brown, draper, of No. 23, High-street, Aldgate. On Thursday afternoon, the 25th of Feb., the prisoners came into our shop together—I am sure it was these two—Campbell asked to look at some bonnet ribbon—I showed her some—I put the ribbon on the counter—it was in rolls, in boxes—Neighbour was by Campbell's side—they purchased two yards of ribbon, at 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, which they paid for—before I finished serving them, I left them for about two minutes to go to another part of the shop, to take change from another young man—I saw the prisoners leave the shop, and as soon as they were gone I received information from another person—I went after the prisoners and overtook them in Petticoat-lane—I asked them if them would step back with me to the shop—I touched them both, and felt two pieces of ribbon in Campbell's bosom—they turned and went back part of the way with me—as they went, I observed Campbell take the pieces of ribbon from her bosom, and hand them to the other—I know the pieces of ribbon produced—they are the property of my employer, and they were in the boxes—Neighbour took this piece of ribbon and threw it into a poulterer's shop—I still kept walking close by the side of the prisoners—I then saw Neighbour <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> this other piece of ribbon into a cellar—I then caught hold of her, and she dropped this other piece of ribbon—I picked it up—I let the prisoners go while I went and got the three pieces of ribbon—I✗ afterwards gave the ribbon to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Gun-street, Spitalfields. At half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 25th of Feb., I was in Petticoat-lane—I saw the witness Betchley and the two prisoners—he had hold of Neighbour's arm—I saw this piece of ribbon drop from Neighbour's person—Betchley stooped to pick it up—Campbell laid hold of Neighbour's arm, and the two of them struggled, and got away from Betchley—they took the first turning down a court, which had no thoroughfare—they returned, crossed Petticoat-lane, and through the new market—I saw them for about ten minutes, when I me a police-constable, and gave them into custody.</p>

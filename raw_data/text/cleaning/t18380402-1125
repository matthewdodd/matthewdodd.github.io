                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, East-street, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 1st of April I went out between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, after locking up my house—on returning between ten and eleven o'clock I found my house in possession of the police—I found a pane of glass broken, the catch of the window moved aside, and the window open—I found next morning at the station-house the articles stated in the indictment, which belong to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On Sunday night last, about half-past eight o'clock, I was going down East-lane—a young man came and pointed out the prosecutor's house, and said there were thieves in it—I saw a light at the window—he said a policeman was gone round to the back door—I pulled the shutter open, put up the sash, and went into the parlour—neither the shutter nor window were fastened—when I got in I went into the passage, and at the bottom of the stairs sat Fitzgerald, and then the other—they had got a candle—I brought them into the parlour, and before the policeman came to my assistance Fitzgerald dropped the four handkerchiefs, the sugar tongs, and cap, from his person—the policeman came and searched him, and found two medals in his pocket—on Steves he found some skeleton keys—they gave no account of themselves—I Pro<lb></lb>duced the property next day at the police office to Mr. Shrubshall, and he identified it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was going up East-lane, about half-past eight o'clock on Sunday night, and received information—I went round to the back of the house, and saw it all safe there—I then got in at the front window, and found the prisoners in Rangecroft's custody—there was nobody else in the house—on Stevens, I found a skeleton Key, and a latch key, a lucifer box and matches—I searched Fitzgerald, and in his pocket found two medals, both having the prosecutor's name on them. I found six keys, up stairs, on the bed—after leaving the house the prosecu<lb></lb>tor gave me a chisel which he had found—he saw the property next day—I examined the house—they had broken a pane of glass in the front win<lb></lb>dow, and opened the sash.</p>

                  </hi> I am superintending president of the Inland-office of the Post-office. I remember the arrival of the Indian mail on the 23rd of June—when the letters are taken out of the bags they are divided into fifteen divisions, numbered from one to fifteen—the person who so divide are on one side of what is called the sorters' table; and on the other side are the sorters, who have the letters given to them to sub-sort them into walks——there is a sub-sorter to each division—they have lines on a board in front indicating the particular walks composing the division; and as they sort the letters they place them end-ways against the walk in which they run—it is the duty of the sub-sorter, when they have accumulated sufficiently, to place a blank docket in front of the parcel, and to hand the letters so placed, to the teller, who is at a table close by—the teller ascertains the amount of postage charged on the letters, and enters on the docket the total amount—each of those parcels is called a charge—they are taken from the teller with the docket, which contains the total amount of the postage of each charge, into the adjoining office, called the letter-carriers' office—the docket is then handed to the check-clerk, and at the same time the letters are put into boxes or com<lb></lb>partments—on the docket being handed to the check-clerk, the letter-carrier, who belongs to the walk, looks at the letters so brought, and tells to the check-clerk the amount of the postage on them without having any previous knowledge of the docket—the letter-carrier is then called to receive the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050117"></xptr>
               <p>charge if it is St. Mary Axe charge for instance, they would call out, "St. Mary Axe," and the letter-carrier would go and receive the latter—the letter-carrier has no means whatever of knowing the amount on the docket—he tells up the amount of the postage, and calls it over to the check-clerk imme<lb></lb>diately; and if it corresponds with the amount mentioned in the docket, then the letters are put in the letter-carrier's box for delivery—if the amount which the letter-carrier makes, corresponds with the entry on the docket, the docket is handed to the letter-carrier by the check-clerk, and the carrier places his initial upon it and restores it; he then takes the letters away to his own place—the check is then complete, and the revenue has nothing further to do with it—all he has then to do, is to bring back the money for the letter; he then has to go to the charge-taker—letters sometimes get mis-sorted in the course of this process; but that is arranged before the latter-carrier leaves; and those having been mis-sorted to his walk, and not belonging to him, are taken off the amount of money charged against him by the charge-taker—if any belonging to him are brought from another walk, the amount of that postage is added to his by the charge-taker—the balance so struck is the sum he is to bring back to the Post-office—if any letters remain in his possession mis-sorted, he has to deliver them after com<lb></lb>pleting his own delivery, and would be punished if he did not—the amount of postage of these letters would be included in the charge—the prisoner was a letter-carrier of the ninth division, in which the St. Mary Axe walk is, No. 96—Gallin is the sorter of the ninth division, which would be the next to No. 10, the division at which Thacker, who was tried yesterday, was placed—I did not see the prisoner at his duty on the day in question—as he was going out with his letters he was stopped by my direction, from a communi<lb></lb>cation that had been made to me, and was taken into Mr. Kelly's office—I afterwards saw him in my private room—the letters that he had to deliver were produced—I do not know whether the postage was told up in his presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you speaking of the morning or the mid-day duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The mid-day duty, the letter-carriers are then in a different office—I should say there are three times more person engaged in the morning than at mid-day—the mid-day duty occurs every day—the In<lb></lb>dian mail does not arrive every day—when the Indian mail is connected with the mid-day duty more exertion is required; but I should say there is not more bustle—letters are taken about from one to the other in the same way in the morning—there may be bustle on both occasions; but I think not more at mid-day than in the morning—if one person had nothing particular to do he would be employed in some way other—I have heard since that an inspector sometimes tells a letter-currier to put over a charge to the teller—there are seats or desks at which the letter-carriers some<lb></lb>times leave their letters while they go to some other part of the place—they are sometimes left for a long time—if letters not properly belonging to that seat are put on it, that could only be corrected by the letter-carrier sorting his letters—the seat is only a small desk for the letter-carrier to arrange his letters on—he cannot get his letters for his walk until they have been pre<lb></lb>viously charged by the teller—when he gets them he frequently lays them down on his seat or desk, and goes away—if any other letters were put there in his absence he could only ascertain that by sorting the letters were put there finding, when he went to deliver them, that he had more.</p>

               <p>place or letters occasionally to fetch his second or third charge—if his letters are completely made up. it would be barely possible that he might leave them even then, being called by the president, or go for a registered letter, or for some purpose or other—he sets the letters himself—he commences sorting his letters as soon as he receives his first charge—he cannot finish it till he has got them all—he then should go out for delivery—a certain time is allowed, and then a bell rings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the bell rings, he must go at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, whether he has times to sort his letters or not—after going out he would not be able to set right any mistake till next day—at the time the prisoner was called into Mr. Kelly's room, two clerks reported to me that they had told his letters up—I heard that Mr. Cook, the inspector, had also told them up, and Mr. Brodie afterwards—Mr. Brodie and Mr. Cook made a difference in the amount of their telling, but I do not know what—when I found they dif<lb></lb>fered, I requested Mr. Brodie to be very particular, and also told another clerk to take it—the telling is a mental operation—it is a very rapid busi<lb></lb>ness—when they amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they are put up together, and the odd pence are carried on to the next—it is written down to help the recollection—it is all matter of recollection until they come to the end—Mr. Cook is not here, that I am aware of—Mr. Brodie will be able to state how much the dif<lb></lb>ference was between him and Mr. Cook—he told me the difference, but what it was I do not know—there is a paper called the president's docket, on which allowances are made and charges added—if there were more or fewer letters than there ought to be in a man's possession, he would come next day and explain it, and it would be set right in the president's paper of next day; but I never heard of such a transaction—if you are charged 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. too much, you take it back to the letter-carrier, and he will take it to the president, and he will allow you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the dockt—if any mistake does occur, it must be corrected next day on the president's paper; but I never heard of one—if a man carried out more letters than he ought, and came back and said, "I have carried out more," that would be correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If some person, with a wicked motive, put some letters on a man's desk, inducing him to believe they were there before, and he went away with them, it must be set right by the president's paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—the man would come to the president, and say, "I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than my charge yesterday; I had some letters put by some person, with an evil design, on my desk, and here are the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," that would be the way in which it would be set right—they must have been letters not charged, or else the other person who put them there would have it, or else the revenue would get 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than it ought—I never heard of such a circumstance in my experi<lb></lb>ence, and I sometimes have to attend to these president's papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The Indian mail letters would require a smaller number to make up an amount, than common letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly—the lowest charge is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were some twopenny letters—they were inland letters which he had to deliver as well—I have seen Indian letters charged 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which a man could carry out with ease, or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it need not be very large—the French post charge by the quarter of an ounce weight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi> Then the effect would be, that the letter-carrier would only be charged with the sum that the inspector found was the proper sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if the carrier had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of letters more than was counted in his charge, there must have been a mistake in the first place made in the amount by the teller and letter-carrier, or some person must have put the letters there to make him a present of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he would get by the postage.</p>

                  </hi> On the 23rd of June I was charge-taker of the ninth division—this is my book, the amount of charge to the carrier to the St. Mary Axe walk on that day, No.96, is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know what it consists of—I only take the sum total in the book—I take it from docu<lb></lb>ments he produces to me—if there has been any mis-sorting, it would be set to rights in this book—there was on that day 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. mis-sorted to the St. Mary Axe walk—that was taken off his amount—there were letters for other walks that were mis-sorted there—they amounted to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sub<lb></lb>tracted 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and allowed him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is done with the letter-carrier just before he leaves of the purpose of delivering his letters—he has generally got his letters set for delivery before he comes to me, as many as he can get set at the time.</p>

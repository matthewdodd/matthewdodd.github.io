               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can every higler swear to his own fowls? - The countries differ, and this man sets his fowls fuller than most.</p>

             took the prisoner, the 4th of December, in Holborn, with six fowls; he said, he had some things of his own, and I might go home with him if I liked; he would not let me see them, nor have them at first; after that, he says, d - n your eyes! take them; the fowls lay in the mud a few minutes, they were in a handkerchief not tied; going along I asked him where he got them, and he said, he knew better than to tell me, I gave information at every public-house, and the prosecutor heard of it.</p>

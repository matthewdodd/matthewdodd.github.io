                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Thompson, of Oxford-street. On Saturday last I was going home in the evening, about ten o'clock, and met an acquaintance in Oxford-street, named John Wright—we went to have some ale—the prisoner and another female came into the public house—I do not know what house it was—I was not sober—we talked with the females a little there, and then left—the females came after us and wanted something to drink, and we went into a house in Quebec-street, where we had half a pint of rum with them—I sat down some time, and after we parted the prisoner took me into the fields across the Edgeware-road, and I sat down with her on the grass—it was then Sunday morning—I gave her no money—I made no bargain with her—I found myself fast asleep the next morning on the grass—I awoke some time in the morning—when I sat down I had a £100 note and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and a purse wrapped in two pieces of paper—it was safe when I met the prisoner in Oxford-street—I missed it when I awoke—I went home and went to bed—I got up an hour or two after and went out—I am not a single man—I did not tell my wife, what had happened—I went to the police and told them what had occurred, and the policeman found the prisoner—I had recovered my senses then—that was about ten o'clock—I found the prisoner in bed in Edward's-place, up stairs—the policeman and Wright went in before me—I charged her with robbing me of a purse containing a £100 note and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—she denied all of it—the policeman told her to get out of bed—she made some fumbling about, but he insisted she should, and he found some papers which dropped from her, and after some searching he found the purse with the £ 100</p>

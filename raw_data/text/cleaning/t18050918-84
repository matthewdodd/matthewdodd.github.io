               <p>Q. Was Mr. Paas a customer of your's? - A. He has been a customer of ours for these five or six months, he lives at the end of Surry-square, Walworth.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that fell upon the prisoner, did you make any application to Mr. Paas? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of having made application to Mr. Paas, do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming home on the 27th of August? - A. Perfectly well; when he came home I booked his load with the name of the customers whom he had served in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear that Mr. Paas was one of the customers on that day? - A. No, it was not among them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered any beer to him to deliver to Mr. Paas on that day? - A. We do not deliver them beer for particular customers without there is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180069"></xptr>a specific order brought home; they call upon their customers when they go by to see who wants.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came at night, what did you say to him? - A. I merely took his account, I have the book here; he gave me no account of any beer delivered to Mr. Paas, there is no entry by me on that day; we did not charge him with it at that time; on the following day, or the day after, we consulted with the partners, and he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing before the Magistrate? - A. He said he had booked the load right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Paas for the purpose of making enquiry whether he had delivered any beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When the prisoner came home to you at night, he gave you the account, and you booked it - how many barrels were booked on that day? - A. Twenty-two of beer and two of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. He reported all these names from memory? - A. From his own book, he carries a memorandum-book with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him whether he had delivered any beer to Mr. Paas on that day? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afraid to remind him, perhaps - did you or did you not abstain from asking him about Mr. Paas for the present? - A. I did abstain, we were satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you purposely omit to remind him? - A I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said you refrained? - A. It was not usual to ask them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it for granted that you take an account, when the dray goes out, of what quantity of beer it carries - did you compare that quantity that went out with the account he gave you at night - was there any deficiency? - A. No deficiency whatever in the load; we found out afterwards who he booked it to.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the prisoner intrusted to receive money? - A. Always.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask him to be on his guard, to give a correct account, or whether he accounted for all the money he had received? - A. He did not account for any money whatever from any person; we took his receipts, every one back, as he went out with; he said nobody had paid him.</p>
               <p>- PAAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp Q. You live at Walworth, and you bought beer of Messrs. Eldridge and Co.? - A. Yes, for five or six months I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you purchase any beer of the prisoner on the 27th? - A. One small cask; I paid him 4 s. 9 d. for it on account of his master, thinking he paid it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take any receipt of him for it? - A. I asked him before I had that cask if he had got a printed receipt; he said it was of no consequence' as I paid on delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was not his duty to give receipts for every sum of money he received, whether ready money customers or not? A. Always.</p>

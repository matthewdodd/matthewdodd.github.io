I cry'd out Murder, Stop Thief; and the Dog ran after him, and, I said, Hold him, Tough . The Dog caught hold of his Wig, and tore it to pieces, and I caught hold of his Arm, and this Shoe was in his Hand; he had artfully convey'd the other away. He told us there was another Boy stood at the Window, and receiv'd them of him, as he stole them; and he says, that he took them one by one.</p>

On the 28th of April I saw the prisoner in the stable about twelve o'clock at night; I had been out to my benefit club. I had bought a bit of bacon the over night, and I put it in the stable when I did my horses up, and when I came home from my benefit club I went into the stable to take the bacon out; I saw a man in the stable up against the lost window, and the dunghill window was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that left shut. - A. Yes, I left it shut between six and seven o'clock; there were three pair of trace chains for cart horses, they were put in a sack, it stood against the dung hole window; the mouth of the sack was tied, and three ropes he had put loose on the dunghill, with his hat full of horse hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these things been. - A. We always hang the harness up in the stable; he had cut the back band straps and took the chains out of them, and he had got the dung fork in his hand to try to wrench the bin open; when I went up to the dung hole window I found him in the stable. I called my follow servant back; then he got up into the loft.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man been about the parish. - A. Yes; he at a time had worked for Mr. Boram; he got out of the loft into the barn; we took him in the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself. - A. He said he did it in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this stable or loft part of the house. - A. No, the stable is one side and the house is of the other; they all join. He got in at the loft.</p>

I left him in the stable till three o'clock; at four I went over to the public house; as soon as it was open, I gave him some beer and a glass of gin; I took a dog's collar from him, he asked me to give it him, I would not; he threatened me if ever he should be at liberty, he would make me remember the dog's collar. I would not give it him; the collar I thought might lead to some discovery.</p>

               <p>Was there among the things you lost a linen sheet, bolster, and a footman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were these things ever found again? - Yes, they were found in a woman's apartment; I was there. They were found the Tuesday after my house was broke open, on the Monday evening, the 29th of last month. They were found up one pair of stairs; the footman was found by the fire, and the bolster about half way under the bed. I do not know where the sheet was found.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday, the 30th, I went, in company with the other officers, to the prisoner's apartment, in a one pair of stairs. We found a man's hat, and a number of other things; among which, Mrs. Hilton owned a sheet. We then hearing of other things, took her to the room: she pointed out the footman and the bolster; but the man's hat and sheet were taken in the morning; Shakeshaft has had them, and has them now. While we were there, there was a knocking at the door; Harper and Lucy went down, and took Happy, and in his pocket I found her cloak, and likewise a waistcoat, which was part of her goods; particularly, I saw a bundle brought in by the other officer, which contained a number of things that had been taken from the prosecutrix's house the night before. They were the same two men that were convicted here; they were taken up in the presence of the prisoner. She was particularly asked who lived there; she said nobody but herself; she said the apartments were her own. And whenever we wanted any thing; we took her out of prison, and let her lock her own door. They desired to have some gin; and the two prisoners and she drank together.</p>
               <p>They appeared to know each other? - Very much so. She would give no answer how the things came there.</p>

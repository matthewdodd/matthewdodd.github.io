A carriage and four was hired to go down to the races, by a Mr. De Fontaine; the price was ten guineas. After the races, I made up the bill, and told the prisoner to go to Mr. De Fontaine; the bill was my hand writing. (A receipt produced.) That receipt is the prisoner's hand writing. On his return, he said, he had not received all the money for the bills he had taken out, but he should receive the whole on Monday morning; and then he would account with me. After that, he absconded. On enquiry, I got that receipt from Mr. De Fontaine, who said, he had paid the prisoner. I found by further enquiry, that he had received upwards of one hundred pounds, for which he had given receipts. I never received a halfpenny from him.</p>

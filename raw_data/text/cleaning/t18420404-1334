                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Monmouth-street. I have a room in a lodging-house—I went out on this night three weeks, at eight o'clock, and locked my door with a padlock—I returned about half-past ten, found the padlock off the door, my room in confusion, and missed a cap, a bonnet, an apron, a black silk handkerchief, and a half handkerchief, two pieces of blanket, a bed-quilt, two shifts, and a petticoat—they were quite safe before I went out—I found some lucifer matches on the table, some burnt, and some not burnt—they were not there when I went out—I saw my bonnet the day after, banging up for sale a few doors from where I live—I told the person the bonnet was mine—this is my bonnet, blanket, and quilt produced.</p>

Between eight and nine o' clock on this night three weeks, the prisoner came to my shop with two pieces of blanket, which I gave her 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—she went, and returned again within half-an-hour, and offered me this bonnet, and a mourning-cap with it for sale—she asked a shilling for them—I did not purchase them—a few days afterwards she sold me a piece of patchwork for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she told me she had exchanged flower-pots for the things—I took these pieces of blanket to Marlborough-street as soon as I beard of the robbery.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 17th of January, about four o'clock, the prisoners came into Mrs. Winch's shop, and asked for five yards of black ribbon for a bonnet; it was cut off for them, and I missed a piece of sash ribbon; I asked Mrs. Winch if it was in the drawer when she gave it me over; she said it was; Mrs. Winch came round to the side of the counter where I was, and missed a piece of white ribbon, she then sent for a constable; when the constable came, Jones got up, and I found a piece of green ribbon under the chair; they were both together.</p>

               <p>Was any green ribbon missing? - Not that I know of; the drawer was in the middle of the counter.</p>
               <p>Did either of them put their hands in the drawer, or did you give them the ribbon out? - No, Brown took them out herself.</p>

               <p>You did not see them examined in the parlour? - No.</p>
               <p>Should you know the maroon ribbon again? - Yes, it is marked 7 1/2 d. and a cross.</p>

            . I sent my infant son Thomas out with my little daughter, (who is nine years of age,) on the 31st of October, about the middle of the day, to take a walk - the baby had a pair of shoes and a blue shawl on; she returned, and the child had lost the shawl and one shoe; I have a sick husband, and cannot often send my daughter to church; I do when I can - the prisoner says she sold the things at a rag-shop.</p>

On the 31st of October, about one o'clock, she brought home a lightish blue shawl and a child's shoe - she said she found them; I did not make any inquiries - I tore the shoe up and mended my husband's stockings with it, and burnt the sole - I do not know what became of the shawl; she said her mistress lent it her - she wore it that afternoon, went out with it the next morning, then came home without it, and said her mistress had given it to a young woman who had got farther to go than she had.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 2d of November, about nine o'clock at night; I told her it was for stealing a shawl off a child's neck - I took her to the watch-house, and she told the watch-housekeeper she sold it in a court in the Strand for 3d.; she said she took it off a child's neck - the prosecutrix was there and said if she produced the shawl she would not give charge of her - the watch house-keeper might say she would not be prosecuted.</p>

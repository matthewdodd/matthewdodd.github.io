            . I know the prisoners very well, they are the two persons that came into my mistress's shop; I have seen them several times before; they came into the shop between twelve and one, and asked to see a cardinal; I shewed them several; some were too dear, and others did not suit their fancies; they bought none; they staid twenty minutes trafficking about these cardinals; there was one particular cardinal lined with blue I shewed them, which I asked twenty shillings for; Hawkins said she could not afford to buy it; West said she would give fourteen shillings for it: they bought nothing: Hawkins attempted to tie up her pocket, when tying it up I observed a black ribband hanging out of it; I said nothing about it, though I had a suspicion that it was some of my mistress's goods, stolen by that woman; but when they were going out of the shop, I touched Hawkins, and said, I want to speak to you; she said, What is the matter? I said, Why I believe you have something of my mistresses under your petticoat; I said, If you don't come and let me examine you, I must take hold of you. Well, says Hawkins, if you do you must have a run for it; upon which I said, I will have a run for it: Hawkins run as fast as she could; I followed her; I happened to fall down; I called out stop her; Mr. Bishop, a neighbour, run after her; I got up and run after her as fast as I could: I saw Hawkins come out of Mr. Hurley's yard, she had not then the cardinal about her; I took hold of her.</p>

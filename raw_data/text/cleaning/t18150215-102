               <p>Q. Whose cask is this - A. Messrs. Venus's, the cask was to be returned to them after the goods were turned out. On the 13th of February, I had to call at the <placeName id="t18150215-102-crimeloc611">Crown and Anchor</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the cask again - A. Yes, the cask leaked with the man throwing it down; we were obliged to get another cask to put the liquor in. when I came out, my cart was there, and the prisoner was there. I saw the cask about two yards off the cart, the prisoner was taken into custody, I saw him next at the office.</p>

            . I was just gone into the public house; I was looking out of the window, I saw the prisoner with the cag upon his knees, he had his foot upon the wheel, then the prisoner was close to the wheel of the cart, I looked round in the tap room and said, there is a man wants help, I went out, and directly the carman claimed the cag as his property the prisoner instantly knocked him down, and before he could get up, he knocked him down again, and with an oath, he said he would knock his brains out, I pulled the prisoner off, the prisoner went from one to another, after that I took him before the magistrate. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

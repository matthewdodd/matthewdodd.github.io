I felt something at my pocket, and immediately heard a whistling. The prisoner was close by me, I saw him with my handkerchief in his hand behind him. The mob was very great, so I did not call out, thinking he might drop it, and get away; so I followed him to near Bell-savage-inn; there I said hold of him, and he immediately dropped the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to you when you missed the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Walker. He was within a yard of me when I turned about.</p>

               <p>I was going up Ludgate-hill, on the 13th of July, I trode on something, I did not know what it was, I looked down, and saw it was a handkerchief, I picked it up, and went with it in my hand, and held it up, and said I had found something by coming to see the sight. I went across the way with it in my hand openly; and when I heard a noise of a pickpocket, and the gentleman coming, I threw it down, knowing it was not my property. I never offered to stir an inch. Then the gentleman said I picked his pocket of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Are you certain you had it in your pocket when you was standing there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain I had, and am confident it was taken out of my pocket; I had not put it in my pocket a minute; the prisoner was not above three yards from me on my seeing it in his hand, to the time of my taking hold of him.</p>

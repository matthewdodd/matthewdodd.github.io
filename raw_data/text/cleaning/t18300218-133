            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live at No. 9, Monmouth-street. On the 29th of January, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner and another man came to my shop, to sell this coat - they asked 2l. for it, and both spoke about it; the prisoner spoke broken English: I could understand him - he had got the coat on, wearing it; when he came into the shop he pulled it off, and asked 2l. for it; I asked if it was their own, as it appeared too good- I kept them in conversation, and sent privately for an officer, but the man was gone so long, they went away, leaving the coat in the shop; I went to Marlborough-street, and in the evening a neighbour, who had seen them, saw the prisoner, and gave him into custody. I am certain of his person.</p>

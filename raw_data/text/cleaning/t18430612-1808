                  </hi>. I live in Preston-terrace, Green-street, Bethnal-green, and am a sergeant in the 2nd regiment of Tower Hamlets Militia. On the 19th of April, I was on duty as ordinary at the house of Captain Henry Frederick Hawker, at No. 4, East-side, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—between eleven and twelve o'clock that day, I placed two coats and a cloak, or wrapper, after I had brushed them, in the orderly-room on the ground floor—the window of that room looks out on to Bethnal-green, at the back of the new church—the window was a little open—there was a wire blind to that window, and a brass bolt at each end of it—no one could get in without removing the blind, as it comes nearly to the top of the top pane of the bot<lb></lb>tom sash—I left the house by the street door, which I closed after me, and the iron gate of the fore court also—the clothes were Captain Hawker's—some keys were given me, and I took them to the station, and gave them to Mr. Young.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a laundress—I work next door to Captain Haw<lb></lb>ker—on the 19th of April I was looking out of the laundry window, about twenty minutes after one o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing, with two other men, about the length of this Court from Captain Hawker's house, in front of it—I saw Price, who was one of them, go into the garden in front of the house—the prisoner and the other one walked by the garden gate—I cannot tell where Price went when he went in the garden; but he had no bundle when he went into the garden, and he had a bundle under his arm when he came out—Price came out twice, and gave something out of his pocket each time, and the third time he came out with the bundle on his arm, and gave it to the other one, who was then standing with the prisoner—the outside of the bundle was red—they then parted; Price went to the right, and the pri<lb></lb>soner and the other went to the left together—I ran out, and called "Stop thief"—Price then joined in the cry, and ran after his companions—he then joined the prisoner and the other, and they all ran together—when they got to the lunatic asylum on the green, the bundle was thrown oter the palings into the garden of the asylum—I followed the prisoner and hit companion, but lost sight of them—I received these keys from Howard.</p>

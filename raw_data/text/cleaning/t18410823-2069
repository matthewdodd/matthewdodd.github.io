                  </hi>. I am a cotton-spinner, and live at Manchester. On the 2nd of July I was in Fleet-street—the prisoner overtook me, and asked where Fleet-street was—I said I believed he was in it—he said he was a stranger in London, and had come from Warrington, that he kept a farm there, and had come to London, to take a shop to deal in flour, as he would sell it to advantage, and he had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to speculate with—he said he was a native of Warrington, that his parents were dead, and had left him and another brother to carry on the farm—I said, "You have come from not far from where I came from; I came from Manchester"—he said he was glad we had met, and asked me to go and have a glass of ale, as he was tired of walking about, and he was a stranger—I refused—he pressed it, but I still refused—we walked on to the end of Chancery-lane—I said I had not been in any public-house but one, which was the Mitre (pointing to it)—he said, "We will go in there"—we went, and he called for a pint of ale, which he paid for—another man then came in, and knocked the table, and spilt some of the ale—he begged pardon—the prisoner said, "No offence," and asked him if he would have a glass of ale—he said, No, he could pay for it if he wanted any—he did take a glass, and then he took out a pocket-book, and showed his notes—and the prisoner, to convince him that he did not wish to <hi rend="italic">sponge</hi> upon him, calling me his friend, pulled out his notes likewise—the prisoner then said to me, "Just to convince the gentleman, let him see that you could pay your <hi rend="italic">road</hi> too"—I said, No, it was a thing I did not do—he said, "Just to show the man that you can pay your <hi rend="italic">road</hi> as well as me"—I did then show two or three sovereigns—he said, just show him a few more than that, which I did—they then commenced talking about <hi rend="italic">sharpers,</hi> and we went into another parlour, further in—the prisoner went in, and I followed him—the other man followed—the prisoner said, we must all take care of our money, for there were many <hi rend="italic">sharpers</hi> about—he said, "Is your money loose? be sure whether it is correct or not"—I said, "I am sure it is"—he said, "Look; I should not like you to lose any thing in our company"—I did look, and counted fifteen sovereigns in my pocket, which was all I had—he said, "Here is a piece of paper, <hi rend="italic">lap</hi> it up"—I did <hi rend="italic">lap</hi> it up—he said, "Now, to convince the other gentleman your money is correct I will put it by"—I said, "No, I can put it by myself"—he said, "Just to convince the gentleman, I will put it in"—I was just putting it into my pocket, when he caught hold of it, and put it into my fob, as I thought— we sat a short time—we then went out, and they sent me into a shop to get three cigars, and when I came out they were gone—I found I had six copper halfpence in my fob, instead of the sovereigns.</p>

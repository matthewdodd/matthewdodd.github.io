On Sunday, the 17th of August, I went to the farm from London; I had some bits in that stable, which I had used about a month before - the stable had been fastened by the man who usually does it; the next morning I heard that the window of the stable had been taken out - I went there between seven and eight o'clock and missed the bits, which I had seen two or three days before; I saw them again on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, at the watch-house, at Kentish-town - my stable window-frame and all were taken out.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch at Kentish-town. On the morning of the 18th of August, at seven o'clock, I was standing about, after leaving duty, I saw the three prisoners pass me, near Grafton-place, coming towards London, by the road from Finchley - I stopped Matthews first, with this green bag; I found these two bits in it - I asked where he got them, he said he had been in the country for them; a gentleman had sent him for them - I left him in custody at a public-house and went after the other two; I took them and found this chisel concealed down Watson's overalls - they had both some apples about them: the other two had got about one hundred yards on before I took them; they were walking - the same bits were shewn to Mr. Stotton on the Tuesday, I think it was - I went to Finchley and fitted this chisel to the window; it corresponded with the marks exactly, and I have no doubt it had been used to break it open - there was some pitch on the window and there is some of it on the chisel - these are the bits.</p>

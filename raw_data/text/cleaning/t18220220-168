I desired the patrol to look out for him, and on the 2d of February, they took him with this wheat on his back; I compared it with that in my barn, it corresponded. I have a sample of each.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 3d of February, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I took the prisoner in the road, about a mile and a half from the prosecutor's, with a bag on his shoulder; I asked what he had got there, he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing," I said he had some corn, he said Yes, he had got wheat, which he bought of Mr. Poyser - we said we should take him back, and if he had bought it it was all right - he said,</p>
               <p>"For G - d's sake don't take me before a Magistrate, for I stole it," and he would give us his coat, and any money we liked, to be quiet about it; we refused.</p>

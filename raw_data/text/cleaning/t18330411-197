Williams, Deacon and Co. About the end of October the prisoner introduced himself to me by a letter of introduction; he came to my counting-house one day, about the end of November, and asked me if I could negociate bills on his father's house for 150l.; he said his father carried on business at Rotterdam - while he was there stamps were sent out for, to draw the bills on, and they were drawn in my presence - these are the bills which he drew; after they were drawn he asked me if I would be kind enough to negociate them, and give him the money for them - I said, I did not know his father's house; - I made inquiry, and could hear nothing of that house, and refused to advance him money on them - he came again on the 13th (the next day), and asked me to let him have 20l. on the bills, and I gave him a cheque on my bankers for that amount; this is the cheque - he said he wanted the 20l. to go down to Brighton, with a friend; I drew the cheque in his presence, and he wrote his name on the back - I went with him and showed him the banking-house, and left him there; on the 15th he called again, between twelve and one o'clock, and asked me to allow him a sheet of paper to write a letter - I gave him one, and he wrote a letter at the same table as I sat at; he sat opposite to me - my cheque-book laid on the table, at my side; after he had written the letter I had occasion to leave the room, leaving my cheque-book in the place I have stated - I went up stairs, leaving the cheque-book within his reach; this is the cheque-book - my clerk sat with his back to him; I returned in a few minutes - I found him there, and the cheque-book where I had left it; I then showed the prisoner the Bank and Lloyd's, and other places, and, on parting with him, I promised to get him a ticket for the Lord Mayor's ball, which was that night or the next night; there was not the slightest intimation from him that he was going to leave the country - I received information the same day from Messrs. Williams, and, in consequence of a description given me by the clerk, I gave directions that the prisoner should be given into custody; inquires were made after him without  effect - the ticket for the ball was to be sent to him at the Royal-hotel, St. James'; application was made for him there, but we could hear nothing of him - this cheque -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110108"></xptr>(looking at it) is not in my hand-writing; I believe the body of it to be the hand-writing of the prisoner - I believe the whole to be his hand-writing; it says 55 pound, leaving out the s; the word pound is spelt in the bills also without the s - the forged cheque is in the same hand as the letter he wrote, which was addressed to Mr. Reading.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what time on the 15th did we separate in the Poultry? A. I should think about two o'clock - I should think it impossible that the cheque could have been abstracted from my book before that day - I usually left it on my table.</p>
               <p>Mr. BODKIN. Q. Can you account for all the two hundred cheques in your book, except this one? A. I can; I had used the book on the 14th.</p>

Robinson and Co.; there is only one partner besides Mr. Robinson - the prisoner was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards, I remember his coming on the 15th of November - Mr. Robinson was not at home when he first came; I asked him to sit down, and gave him the newspaper - I sit with my back to Mr. Robinson's table, and cannot see any thing that takes place at the table; Mr. Robinson came in, in about half an hour - I do not recollect the prisoner writing a letter; he was sitting at the table with Mr. Robinson - Mr. Robinson left the office for a few minutes, leaving nobody but me and the prisoner there; he was sitting at the table at the time - I could not see any thing he might do at the table; the cheque-book generally lays on the table - Mr. Atkins does business in our office; nobody else has an opportunity of touching the cheque-book - it is locked in Mr. Robinson's drawer after business hours; I do not interfere with the cheque-book at any time - the prisoner and Mr. Robinson afterwards went out together, about one o'clock; I understood he lodged at St. James' hotel - I lost sight of the prisoner after that entirely; I think I met him once in Coleman-street, but I was not certain it was him, and did not stop him - in February I saw him in Regent-street, I went up to him, and said, "How do you do, Mr. Peppers?" he said, "Very well" - I asked if he had heard from his friends; he said No - I then asked if he was walking about Regent-street; he said No, he was waiting for a friend - I kept him in conversation, and saw an officer in a few minutes; I then ran and met the officer, and brought him to the prisoner - I ran forward and laid hold of him by the arm; he said, "For God Almighty's sake, do not take me!" - he saw the officer, in his uniform, with me; I had told him before, that Mr. Robinson wanted to see him, and asked him to call on him - he said he would next day; I think he was going down Warwick-street when I took him - I did not intimate that I was going for an officer.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Meesrs. Williams and Co.; they have an account with Robinson and Co., Old Jewry - the cheques we use have one number through the whole book; each customer has a distinct number - this cheque-book is No. 403; that number was on all the cheques in that book - it contained exactly two hundred cheques; this 20l. cheque was paid in course, on the 15th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon - this 55l. cheque was brought to our house; it was presented by a man whose general appearance was like the prisoner, but he was in a very different dress - he had a dark frock-coat, buttoned close up; it was in rather a dark part of the office - the person's height and general appearance was like the prisoner; on the cheque being presented I had some doubt of the signature, and went to the back part of the office to compare the signature, and when I returned to the counter the person who presented it was gone - it is an imitation of Robinson and Co.'s signature; the s was omitted in the word pounds - I wrote on it."Differs from the usual signature," and returned it to Mr. Robinson.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and prepare the cheque-books for Messrs. Williams and Co. I made this cheque-book - I have not the least doubt but the cheque in question formed part of that book; I can point out the part of the book from which a cheque has been taken; there were two hundred cheques in it when it was made, and all bore the No. 403; here is the rough edge left from which the cheque has been torn - the margin has since been cut off the cheque, but I can tell from the appearance of the cheque in length and breadth; that it has been in that book, and I speak more positively because only one book was numbered 403; I am certain that cheque has been in that book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Has the cheque been torn or cut out? A. Torn; the others are cut off at the margin.</p>
               <p>The bills referred to being produced had the letter s omitted in the word pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a foreigner, but a consciousness of my innocence has induced me to come to this bar unprotected by counsel or professional advice; I cannot but avail myself of the opportunity of pointing out the very loose evidence to fix the crime on me - it amounts to nothing but that the cheque is drawn in the name of a gentleman to whom I happened to write a letter - and will you consign me to slavery for life for this? can such a coincidence warrant such an act? - conceive the impossibility of my tearing the cheque out, in the presence of the clerk, and that I should be such a madman as to draw it in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110109"></xptr>name of a gentleman, and leave the letter in the prosecutor's possession.</p>

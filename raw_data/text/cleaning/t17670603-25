            . I keep a turner's shop. On Wednesday the 6th of May, in the evening, the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I would buy a dozen of brushes; he asked half a crown for them; I thought that was much   under the value; I decoyed him within doors, by telling him I would send for a neighbour, to know whether they were worth the money. I asked him how he came by them; he said, he had them of one Mr. Moor, in Mark-lane, in exchange for thrums. I was going to send for Mr. Moor, but the prisoner desired me not to send for him; soon after, he said he found them by London-bridge, and after that, he said by Westminster-bridge; he seemed to be poor, and out of compassion I did not take him up; I sent my boy to watch where he lived; then by enquiring, I found the brushes belonged to Mrs. Grant.</p>

            . I am constable. The prosecutor came to me and said he had been robbed, and suspected the prisoner. I went with him and took him into custody; he owned he stole the stockings, and that they were in the room where he lay at Mrs. Mayfield's in Poplar. We went there, and found eight pair. [Produced in court and deposed to.] He begged his master would forgive him.</p>

I have known Bennett three years and a half—when I first knew him he was check<lb></lb>taker at the Adelphi Theatre—I had lost sight of him for five or six months, when he accidentally rode outside my omnibus—I had seen him and Sullivan five or six months or more before I went to Mr. Wyatt's, but had had no further communication with them than drinking with them—about fourteen months ago I went to Mr. Wyatt's shop with Sullivan—I asked Mr. Wyatt for a cheroot—Sullivan said, "I will have one also," and I paid for one for him—he then asked for an ounce of bird's-eye tobacco; Mr. Wyatt served him—he</p>

               <p>more than once; it might be a week or ten days after the last transaction—Jones said, "Will you let me have any more money, Mr. Wyatt?"—Mr. Wyatt replied, "No"—Jones said, "The fact of it is you must, for taking indecent liberties with Tiddiman—Mr. Wyatt went to the cheffioneer, and brought out half-a-sovereign and some silver—I received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the rest was to be divided with Sullivan—I did not see it shared—I knew Laidler first of all—one evening I was at a ball, 1st or 2nd March, with Bennett—Sullivan and Jones were not there—Bennett said, "Now,<hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> here is a young man," meaning Laidler, who we met there, "and he has no objection to set the part of a solicitor for us, to intimidate the old man and woman out of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Laidler replied that he would do so—Bennett proposed that Jones should act as clerk to the solicitor—two or three days alter, Jones and Laidler went us to Wyatt's; (but a week previous, or perhaps a little more than that, I met Sullivan, and he said it would be a good <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> for any one to go and act as solicitor, as there was a woman in the case)—Jones and Laidler went to Wyatt's; I waited outside with Sullivan, by agreement—Sullivan told Laidler to go in and get some money, and said we would wait till he came out; and said, "Mind you don't come out without it"—Laidler came out and said he had got a sovereign, all he could get—Sullivan called him on one side, and whispered something to him—we went to a public-house, shared the sovereign, and parted—either the same night, or the next; we all met again, by appointment, at a public-house in Long Acre, and it was agreed that we should all go—Sullivan gave Laidler instructions to draw up an "I O U," for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided Mr. Wyatt had not got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ready cash in the house; which, after some hesitation, Laidler agreed to do, not willingly—it was drawn out for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first—I made no reply, I was picking some cigars out of a cigar-case at the back of the bar—I think the publican's name was Purnall—I then went with them to Mr. Wyatt's—I believe Laidler walked on first, before Sullivan, Bennett, Jones, and me—he stopped a few doors before the shop till we arrived—Jones and Laidler went in, and me, Sullivan, and Bennett remained outside—in about ten minutes Laidler came out, and said to Sullivan, "I have told the woman all about it"—Laidler said to me, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Harry,</hi> you must come in"—I said I would not—afterwards, by the persua<lb></lb>sion of Sullivan, I went in with Bennett—Sullivan was outside; he said he would not come in—Laidler went back with us—he and Jones talked to the woman in private—I saw tears in Mrs. Legg's eyes, and heard Laidler say, "It is a case not fit for a woman to be mixed up in, and this is the young man that can prove it," pointing to me—Mr. Wyatt was standing by the parlour, at the corner of the counter—he could hear what passed—he appeared rather nervous—Laidler asked him for some money—I do not know how much—Mr. Wyatt replied, he had not got any—Laidler said, "Then I will draw up an 'I O U' for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—one of them, (I cannot say which,) said, "No, it shall be for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." an "I O U" was drawn up by Jones, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is Samuel Wyatt's signature to it—there were two "I O U's"—one was for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that Bennett asked for a sovereign—Mr. Wyatt said he had not got one, but he would see what silver he had—he gave Bennett 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave Laidler a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I do not think Mrs. Legg was aware that the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was given—we all left the shop, and found Sullivan outside—we all went to a public-house, and then to a coffee-shop, where Jones said to Sullivan, "We have been to the old man, and made him give us an 'I O U' for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Sullivan said, "Then, of course, I <hi rend="italic">stand in</hi>"—Jones and Laidler replied, "Yes"—next day I went to Wyatt's with Laidler, Sullivan, Jones, and Bennett—Laidler and Jones went in by themselves, the others</p>

               <p>remained outside—they came out and said they had got 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was shared amongst us—Laidler and Jones called Sullivan on one side, and spoke to him privately—a few days afterwards I saw Laidler and Jones again, but I do not remember anything being said about the affair—after this we met of a night at Laidler's house—we kept meeting together daily—on the night I was taken, we all five went to Mr. Wyatt's—Laidler and Jones went in; we remained outside—Jones came out, and met me and Bennett half-way up the street, and said in Sullivan's hearing, "Now, then, you must come in; there is the money all ready waiting"—Sullivan came in afterwards—I said, "I would sooner have nothing to do with it, go in by yourselves; I will go my way, you go your's"—Sullivan said, "No, go on, go on," and I accordingly went in—Mrs. Legg said, "Walk into the parlour, gentlemen"—I went in with Bennett—Sullivan stopped in the shop, we walked into the parlour—Mrs. Legg said, "Now, gentlemen, I want an explanation of the case; who is the solicitor in the case?"—Laidler said, "I am"—she said, "What demand have you upon my uncle?"—one, but I cannot say who, said, "24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I am sure it was not me—Mrs. Legg said, "Where are your chambers?"—Laidler said, "I have already told you; 5, Cecil-court, St. Martin's-lane"—at that, two officers came from behind the curtain, and took us into custody—that ended the transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am niece to Mr. Samuel Wyatt, who keeps a tobacconist's shop in Lincoln's-inn-fields. I live with him, and help him to carry on the business—he is sixty-four years of age, and has been in ill health for some time past—about Nov., his manner was a great deal more depressed than usual, and I looked more attentively to him—the first time I remember any one coming, was on New Year's eve—it was Tiddiman—he was between the parlour door and the shop door, which was slightly open—he had his hand in</p>

               <p>Bennett, but he snatched the rest, and said, "We may as well have all"—they went away, and took the money and the "I O U"—this was on Saturday—after that my uncle became much worse, he kept his bed until the day the prisoners were taken—on the Monday afterwards, Jones and Laidler came about the middle of the day—my uncle was in bed—they inquired after his health—I said he was very ill in bed, they might satisfy themselves by seeing him, if they thought proper—they did so; he slept in the parlour—they asked me for some money—I said they could not have it, but if they would come next day we would see what we could do for them—Laidler said he was a solicitor—the "I O U" was pro<lb></lb>duced—I really cannot tell what was said about it, for it was produced so often, and so much was said about it—they said they would compromise the affair for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I think it was that day that Laidler said he had been to the Docks to pay part of the passage-money, and that Tiddiman might start by that vessel—he said it was a most infamous affair, and, if it got into the papers, would cause more sensation than Greenacre's murder—I then said something to Jones about some other case—Jones mentioned some name, and said it was a similar case to the person in question, but he got him through it—next day, Tuesday, Laidler and Jones came—they said they came for money, and they wished it very much to be settled—I said it was impossible, but I would give them part of it—Laidler spoke—I gave them a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and two sovereigns, my uncle's money—the "I O U" was mentioned—Laidler received the money—I will not be certain whether I gave it him, or whether he took it up—when he had taken it, he said, "We consider this as our fees; do not tell Bennett or Tiddiman we have received any"—he said they might think they were compromising the affair; and I think he said something about indicting them for felony, and having Laidler's name struck off the roll of attorneys—I said I would not—next day, Wednesday, Laidler and Jones came again—they came almost every day—they saw Mr. Wyatt in bed—Laidler said, could not my uncle grant me an undertaking to get the remainder of the money—he said he could not—Laidler said, if he would, he would take me to the Bank, either in his private carriage or in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would not, and they went away—next day they came again, and brought an "I O U" for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was thrown away and burnt, as a forgery, it was not my uncle's writing—my uncle's name was to it—Laidler asked me if it was my uncle's writing—I told him, "No," and he then burnt it—he said it had got into Bennett's or Tiddiman's hands, one of the two, I do not know which—he said they picked hit pocket of it, and they could sell it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; as any one would give them that for an "I O U" with Mr. Wyatt's name to it—he said to Jones, "If you will endeavour to get it back from them, I will give you a sovereign"—Jones said, "I don't require that, I dare say I can do it without"—on one occasion, Laidler said if the money was not paid, the Sheriffs officer would come and take the things away; to the amount, I suppose—on the Friday, Laidler and Jones came again, and saw my uncle in bed—I said I wished to settle altogether, for I was very much annoyed, and my business was injured, as I was obliged to shut my shop up as soon as it was dark, to pacify my uncle, who was almost in a state of madness—Laidler said, "You can keep open with safety till nine o'clock at night, as your house is protected till then"—he said he paid a man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day to watch the house, and pointed out Sullivan, who was coming up the gateway opposite—he sent Jones to fetch Sullivan, who came back with Jones—Laidler said he would not be answerable for my shop after nine, as his man went off then—they all three went into my uncle's bedroom—Sullivan only asked him how he did</p>

               <p>—nothing was said there about settling—as they went away they asked me if I could settle it—I said I could not, it was not in our power—they went away somewhere about one or two o'clock—Sullivan said, as he was going away, that my uncle appeared very ill, and it was a pity it could not be settled—then they left—about eleven o'clock, after the shop was shut, I was alarmed by a very great noise, as if the shop-door was beat with sticks—(they used to enter at the private door)—it continued two or three minutes—I did not go—I was in the parlour—I heard a voice call my uncle's name, and ask if he did not mean to open the door—it was not a noise as if people wanted to come in—I did not open the door—it frightened my uncle very much—next morning Jones came—he saw my uncle, and said he was very sorry to see him so ill, and of course he wanted money—I told him they would have had the money if it had not been for the riot the night before—Jones asked me if I would give him a paper to satisfy the others that he had been there, and what was the cause of their not receiving the money—I consented—this is the paper I gave him(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in my writing—he then asked if I could give him some money—I afterwards gave him and Laidler 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on Friday the 8th—he denied having been there the night before—I said it was of no use, for I heard their voices—he said they had nothing to do with it—(<hi rend="italic">paper read</hi>—"Gentlemen,—Through your coming last evening, my uncle is much worse; if you will let the matter stand over till Monday at six, the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shall be forthcoming, M.

                  </hi>. In March last, I carried on the business of a tobacconist, at 13, Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. I am sixty-four years of age—one evening, about seven months ago, Tiddiman came and asked for some tobacco—I gave it him—he squeezed my hand and pressed up against me—I was behind the counter, and came to the front of it to take a glass of gin-and-water which I had made—he left in five or ten minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you sit down at the outside of the counter, and take your gin-and-water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I asked him to take a little of it—that was before he squeezed my hand—I went round and sat by his side, with the gin-and-water on a chair between us—he squeezed my hand when I laid the tobacco on the counter—he had not tasted the gin-and-water before I put down the tobacco; he squeezed my hand, both before and after—I noticed nothing par<lb></lb>ticular in his conduct towards me—I thought it very strange his squeezing my hand, for a stranger—some time afterwards he got up to go; he got two or three Cuba cigars, which he paid for—he did not touch me after squeezing my hand—there was nothing extraordinary in his demeanour but that—I made no complaint to him before he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>I told him to go—I am certain of that—nothing particular struck me in his conduct at that time—I was surprised at his squeezing my hand, and walking into my bedroom—I felt disposed to kick him out of my house—I told him I never suffered any one to come in there—he did not stay five minutes after that—I did not go on with my gin-and-water after that—the shop was open, any one passing could see into it—when the room-door is open, any one can look in by the light of the shop—as far as an open view goes, it is a public place—the door is glazed as well as the window, the shop is nearly half as wide again, and half as long again as the dock of this Court—I was near the parlour with the spirits-and-water—that was not where I served him with the tobacco—I served him behind the counter, and then came forward to take the remainder of the refreshment—I take gin-and-water every night, because I take no malt liquor.</p>

Middleditch, 1 Denison's Crown Cases, p. 92); that the expression used to Mrs. Legg could only be received as evidence to explain the nature of the previous threat to the prosecutor, there being no charge that by any threat to her, money was sought to be obtained from him; and that it had been held that the very term used to her "sodomitical" was of too vague and uncertain a meaning to support an indictment.

PRENDERGAST, JUN</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on behalf of Sullivan, in moving in arrest of judg<lb></lb>ment, urged that the indictment was defective, in as much as it did not allege that the security sought to be obtained, was the property of the Prosecutor, and refered to the case of Reg. v.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOLLETT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for Bennett, and</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for Jones, made a similar notion, and referred to Reg. v. Norton, 8 Car.&amp; Payne,</hi> 196. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">is reply, contended that as this was a charge not of obtaining, but of endeavouring, by means of threats, to obtain, it was not necessary to show whose property the security was. See Reg. v. Clark, 1 Car. &amp; Kir.</hi> 421. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">hav<lb></lb>ing taken until Monday to consider the point) in giving judgment, stated that the question was, whether the indictment, which charged the prisoners with making the threat in question with intent to extort from the Prosecutor a valuable security, and did not state whose property that security was, could be supported or not. The statute on which the indictment was framed was 10 &amp; 11 Vic., c. 66. s. 2, which made it an offence to accuse, or threaten to accuse, any person of the offence specified, with a view or intent to extort or gain from such person any property, money, or security. The words of the statute were exceedingly important, because one of them, viz. "extort," had a certain technical meaning which was defined in 2nd Salkeld's Reports; and when a man was charged with extorsively taking, the very import of the word showed that he was not acquiring possession of his own<lb></lb>tion would be found in 2 Burn's Justice; and the language showed that it was not at all necessary that the thing extorted should be stated to be the property of any person, if it was wrested from the party upon whom the extortion was effected; and if that was the case, the present indictment was sufficient. In a case referred to (Reg. v. Norton) it appeared that the property was described in the manner contended for by the prisoner's counsel; but that was an indictment under another statute, which made it necessary that the party charged under it should actually obtain the thing sought to be obtained; that was not so in the present case, because, whether anything was obtained or not, the crime was com<lb></lb>plete; and whether the property belonged to the person threatened, or not, was quite immaterial; the offence was committed immediately the accusation was made with the evil intent stated in the indictment.</hi>

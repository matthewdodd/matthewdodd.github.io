            . I went home with the prisoner; when I awoke in the morning, she was going down stairs; I then missed four sovereigns, half a crown, and a purse, which had been in my right-hand breeches pocket; I did not know what she went down for - I got up, and went to the watchman - we saw the prisoner going into No. 6, with the last prisoner - the patrol got in at the window - there was one sovereign found within the lining of the prisoner's shoe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you place the money by the watch? A. No, I missed the money after I got out of bed, before I missed the watch; I then looked at the watch, and put it on the shelf again - I am sure I had the money when I went with her - she had a glass of rum at a public-house - we should have gone into a bye place, but there was a watchman - I have gone to a bye place with her, and given her a shilling; I never went home with her till that night - I did not give her any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100117"></xptr>that night but the glass of rum - I am a groom - I changed half a sovereign at the public-house; I had paid about 2l. away before I went home with her; when I got home with her, I took out the purse, and said I hoped I should not be robbed; she said I was perfectly safe - she did not say she had had this money sent her by a friend from the country.</p>

            . I was on duty as patrol; at twenty minutes after three o'clock I met the prosecutor and the watchman - I went to the house where he said he had been robbed, but we could not get in; the landlord was present, but was not willing that we should break the door, and we did not like to do it - we fetched Timbrell, and found the watch; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, searched her, and in her shoe I found the sovereign - that was all.</p>

A young man called at the shop; I told him I believed there was a thief at the door, and set him to watch; I watched her but she did not take the cloth; Wood bought the handkerchief; and they both went away, and crossed over the way backwards and forwards; then another person (Dignam) came in to speak to me, and we went after the prisoners, and found them in Oxford-street facing the shop.</p>

            . On Saturday the 13th I had been to Cavendish-square with a letter; I came into the shop; the young man said I believe there has been two shop lifters here; I want you to look for them: I went to a public house and watched them; they did not take any thing, but came away from the shop; I heard Smith say to Wood it will not do, it is removed; afterwards I went over the way, and laid hold of them, and took this cloth from under Wood's cloak, tied up in her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was going up the road: being a cold day I went to have a pennyworth of gin, at the corner; a man came and delivered this, and said will either of you hold this five minutes, while I go a little way; it was laid down; one would not take it and the other would not take it; it lay on the bench; I waited ten minutes; the man never came back, so I took it up, and by this means it was found upon me. I go out to ironing every day.</p>

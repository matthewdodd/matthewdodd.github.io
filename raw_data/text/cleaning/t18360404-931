                  </hi>. I keep the Hoop and Horse-shoe, in Queen-street, Tower-hill. The prisoner came on a Sunday night, in March, and hired a bed, about half-past eleven o'clock—he was a stranger to me the house was shut up, and he knocked at the door—Mrs. Cansdell called me down to him—I said he could not sleep there—he said he wanted to go into the docks in the morning, and I let him have a bed—he said he wanted to go as soon as the dock opened, which was about seven o'clock; and in the morning, he went out—I opened the street-door—he partly opened it himself, and seemed in a hurry—I sent the servant up stairs, and in consequence of what she said, I pursued him—he went towards Whitechapel—I sent the boy after him, who brought him back he had a bundle under his arm—we opened that—he said that</p>

I am a chandler, in George-street, St. Giles's. on Sunday afternoon, 30th April, I was in my shop, and saw a policemancoming towards my shop—the prisoner, Jerome Coakley, was then standingopposite, about the centre of the street—I then saw them standing near eachother, and Jerome was in a <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> position, opposite the policeman, <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>, as I thought—something attracted my attention in my shop for asecond or two, and the next thing I noticed was seeing them having hold ofeach other, in the act of wrestling—they fell together on the ground—Iturned my eyes to my shop again, and the next thing I saw was both stand<lb></lb>ingup again—they had hold of each other the same as before—I afterwardssaw them both on the ground again the policeman was underneath; butafter some little struggling he got uppermost—I then saw the prisoner Patrick strike the policeman on the right side of the head with a piece ofwood like a policeman's staff; I cannot swear that it was a staff—I did notsee where he got it from—he had been standing four or five yards off whilethey were struggling—the policeman's hat was off at the time.</p>

At a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, on the 5th of May, I was coming home—the prisoner came up, and asked the nearest way to Leather-lane—I told him—he then laid hold of my watch, took it off, and broke the guard—I laid hold of him, and he handed the watch to the others who were with him—a gentleman came up, and I took the prisoner to Scotland-yard.</p>

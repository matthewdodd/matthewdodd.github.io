               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Is not Mr. Watts the superintendent of this work? A. He was formerly - he does not superintend the manufacturing department; he is the head of the whole establishment - the prisoner was employed there before me; in this entry there appears to have been an erasure before the word James - I do not know what that is; it might be there when I entered it - I make the entries in this book one day, and give it to the prisoner to post the next morning, about nine o'clock- he posts it, and returns it; no other person but the prisoner and me were employed in the writing department- the books are locked up at night in the store-room, and I kept the key.</p>

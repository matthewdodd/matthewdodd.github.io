That accordingly Holms led him to a Place call'd Upper-Morefields, near the Booth, or the Wooden-house ; that then the Defendant told Holms, that he need not go any farther, for he then knew where he was, and offer'd Holms a Penny, which he refus'd; that then he offer'd him 2 d. which he likewise refused. That Holms gave a Whistle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060025"></xptr> and out came a Man unknown to him and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast; that Holms rifled his Pocket, and took out 5 s. and 9 d. in Money, and a Silver Buckle out of his Shoe.</p>

               <p>Plimpton. Yes; when the Evidence was gone thro' on Holms's side, the Judge call'd the Defendant up again. And, says the Judge, Harnet, did you ever see that Holms before? Yes, says he, once or twice, my Lord. Where? says my Lord. At the Wrestling. Ring, says he. Then you are sure that's the Man? says my Lord. Yes, I am sure, says he, looking at the Prisoner Holms.</p>

               <p>Plimpton. The Time was mention'd to be about 10 at Night, within a Quarter over or under, there or thereabouts; that's the Evidence he gave.</p>

            , and ask'd him the way to Bishopsgate-street. That Holms offer'd to show him the way, and took him up and down several Streets, which he did not know the Names of, till he brought him to Upper-Morefields. That when they came there, he offer'd Holms a penny for his Trouble, which he refused. He then offer'd him Two-pence, and Holms also refused that, and after some Dispute, a little Man came up, and clapp'd a Pistol to his Breast, and Holms rifled his Pockets, and took 5 s. 0 d. out, and then took one of his Buckles. That he the Defendant said to Holms, they are not Silver, don't take them; but that Holms swore they were Silver, and he would have them, but Company coming up he got but one. The Defendant was ask'd, how he could be sure that Holms was the Person? and he said, he knew him by the Lights in coming along, and that he had reason to know his Guide. Then he brought Persons to swear what he said when he came home.</p>
               <p>C. What did he say as to the time of Night?</p>
               <p>P. Jun. He swore it was about 10 a-Clock, and I think he said it was the 19th of July last.</p>
               <p>C. How came you both to recollect so particularly, did you take any Notes?</p>
               <p>P. Sen. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>P. Jun. I did. For Holms, who is now dead, was my Father's Servant, and being in some Trouble on this Account, he sent for my Father, and we went with him before Justice Garret. He was taken up the Day after the Robbery was said to be done.</p>

When he was ask'd, why Holms did not take the other Buckle? He said, My Lord, we heard a Noise, and he run one way, and I another. He said, he was positive to the Man, by his black bushy Hair. His Lordship ask'd him, How he knew? And he answer'd, By the Lights as they came along together.</p>

And says he, To see for you; Mr. King has got a Shoulder of Mutton, desires you and I, and my Wife and Sister, to come to Supper with him to Night. I did not much care for going, and so I went on towards Holm's-House, which is in Old-Bedlam-Court, and he turned back and went with me. When he came home, he said to his Wife, Sarah ! come prithee get ready, Mr. King's Supper waits. Says she, Won't my Father go? Will, says I, to oblige you I will, and so he and I went before, about 8, and his Wife and Sister came after. We stay'd there with him till 11.</p>

               <p>Towers. I don't know that he was out of the Room. He might go out to make Water, but I am sure he was not out 5 Minutes.</p>

               <p>Towers. That I am. I went home with him when the Company broke up. His Sister took hold of his Arm, and his Wife of mine. I saw him partly undrest, in order to go to Bed before I left him, and then it was half an Hour past a 11. Next Day, being the 20th of July, after I had done work, I went to drink a Pint of Beer at an Alehouse in Houndsditch. A Messenger came there, and told me, that my Son Holms was got into Trouble, and was at the Flying-Horse in Morefields. I wonder'd to hear it, because I knew he was not Quarrelsome; so I went thither, and found him sitting in a Box. What's the Matter? says I. Why, says he, Here's a Villain accuses me of Robbing him last Night. Robbing him? says I. Yes, says Holms, and has put a Buckle into my Pocket. Well, says I, we can prove where you was last Night. I'll go and fetch some of the People that were with us. I went out and met Mr. Plimpton and his Son.</p>

            . So meeting with Mr. Plimpton, I went back with him to the Flying-Horse, and Holms told him the same Story as he had told me; that the Villain had charg'd him with a Robbery, and had put a Buckle in his Pocket. His Master desir'd they might go before a Justice; I think 't was Justice Chamberlain's we went to; but he was not at home, and going from his Door the Constable and Holms cross'd Spittle-Yard in order to go to Justice Garret's, when I observ'd the Defendant, who was behind them, turn'd towards Bishopsgate-street, as if he was going off. I can't swear that that was his Design; but I believe he was sorry for what he had done, and was afraid to proceed. But I went behind him, and then he followed them ; and I desired the Constable to take Care of him. The Defendant finding such a favourable Reception at Justice Garret's, he swore the Robbery, or else I believe he would not have had the Impudence to have done it.</p>

            . I was drinking at Mr. Hoare's (the Constable's) at the Flying-horse in Moorfields. The Defendant came and told Mr. Hoare that he had seen a Man at the wrestling Ring who had robb'd him the Night before. Mr. Hoare call'd me to assist him. We went out together, and the Defendant told us we should find the Goods upon the Man, and desired us to stand off a little, while he went to the Ring and look'd for the Man. We staid about a quarter of an Hour, and Mr. Hoare being tired with waiting, sent me to see for the Defendant. The Defendant seeing me coming towards him, came and met me, and said, stay a little, the Man is there, and I see the Buckle upon him. I went back to Mr. Hoare, and presently the Defendant called us, and going up to Holms, he tapt him on the Shoulder, and said, This is the Man. We went to the King's Head Tavern, and the Defendant bid me search Holms. I search'd his left Coat Pocket, and found nothing; but the Constable searching the other, pull'd out a Buckle: The Defendant presently cry'd, that's my Buckle, and here's the Fellow to it: With that Holms said, then somebody put it in. We went to one Justice, but he was not at home, and so went again to Mr. Hoare's House, and he charg'd another Man to take care of Holms. So that I being no farther concerned, did not know when they went before the Justice again. By the Defendant's saying he saw the Buckle upon him, I thought it had been a Girdle-Buckle, till I saw it was a Shoe-Buckle.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see nothing else taken out of Holms's Pocket? Yates. Nothing, except it was 2 or 3 Goosberries. Dif. Did I ever tell you that I saw the Buckle upon him? Yates. Yes, those were your very Words. Def. I had no Discourse with you alone.</p>

            . I was coming over Moorfields the 19th of July at Night, and about the Middle of the Tenter-ground, I saw the Prisoner standing stock still, and 2 Gentlemen coming by, he ask'd them what was o'Clock; they answer'd him roughly ; and I coming up, told him it had just struck 10. He said he did not want to know, but only asked for his Fancy. Then he and I walking one Way, he told me he had been robb'd; and coming</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060028"></xptr>to a House in Long-Lane [Long-Alley] he stopt, and told me that was his Lodging, and would needs have me go in. I was afraid he intended to charge me with the Robbery: But however I went in with him. He ask'd me my Name, and where I liv'd. I told him, and he set it down. Then he ask'd if I'd drink a Dram. I said yes. We had a Quartern, and he put his Hand in his Fob and took out half a Crown and some Shillings and Half-pence, and paid the Reckoning. I was in a sort of a Wonder how that Money escaped; but he said his Breeches buttoir'd tight, so that the Man who robb'd him could not find it.</p>

               <p>Quarrel. I am not so good a Judge of that as your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Def. Was it proper for me to tell you why I ask'd? You told me that I had been at your House with two Women.</p>
               <p>Quarrel. That was when I came to your Lodging, not when I met you first.</p>
               <p>Def. Did not you say in Moorfields, that a Fellow rushed after you, and whistled, and that you suspected somebody had been robb'd?</p>
               <p>Quarrel. No. Def. You knew me first when we met. Quar. I never knew you, till I came to your Lodging.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he been at your House with two Women?</p>
               <p>Quar. Yes, a few Days before.</p>
               <p>Def. I have met with a great deal of Trouble in a strange Place, and it is not to be expected that I should bring Witnesses from Ireland, from whence I lately came, and where my Friends live; but I have a Certificate here from the Mayor of Cork and other Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court cannot read it; such Certificates may be procured in a very odd manner.</p>
               <p>Def. I had no Money to subpoena Witnesses to prove it. Here are nothing but Circumstances against me; and I declare now, (tho' a Man may be mistaken) that he actually robb'd me, and I would say the same, if it was my dying Day.</p>

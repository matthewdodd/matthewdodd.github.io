            . The prisoner's mother came to me, told me the case, and told me to take him if I could. I found him in Covent-garden and took him; he said "What have you to do with me?" I said, "What did you do with the coat?" he said, "That is nothing to you, it was my mother's coat, and I was not going to starve." I have known him all his life.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 77.) On the 14th of Aug., about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Wimpole-street, and heard a noise as if somebody had jumped—I turned round, and saw a tall man standing on the cellar-flap of Mrs. Davis's house, and saw the prisoner jump off the leads of a jeweller's shop, come to the corner of Wigmore-street, and both of them ran down Wigmore-street—I sprang my rattle—the prisoner stopped, and began to walk—I went up and asked him what he did there—he said, "That man has struck me," pointing to the man who had ran away—I took him to the station, and found four silver tea-spoons in his coat pocket, and two silver thimbles, also some lucifer matches, and in his right-hand pocket two pieces of netting, a thermometer, and other articles—I went back to the place I saw him jump from, got on the leads of the jeweller's shop, and saw the sash of the drawing-room window <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> up—I gave an alarm.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock on Monday night I went into the drawing-room, and put the window down which opens on to the leads of the jeweller's shop—I am sure I put it close down—I did not shut the shutters—I was not the last person up—I do not know whether anybody went into the drawing-room after me—I was alarmed next morning between one and two o'clock by the policeman—I went into the room, and missed my thimble and shawl; also, four spoons of my mistress's, which I had seen safe the morning before.</p>

I was alarmed about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I went into the dining-room, and missed four spoons—those produced are mine—this thermometer belongs to a friend, and was in my care—I had locked it up in a book-case two or three week* before—this net is mine, and was in a drawer in the spare bed-room.</p>

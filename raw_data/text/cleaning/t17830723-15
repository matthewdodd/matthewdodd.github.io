             sworn.</p>
               <p>This is my bracelet, there is no particular mark but the carving, I had the fellow of it, it was a present made to me, it was rolled on a card that was cut in a particular manner that makes me know it, I believe it was the four of diamonds, I have no doubt of it, it was upon this cardon the mantle-piece in my dressing-room, I lost it on Sunday morning, the prisoner dressed my hair that morning the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Aldus. Do you know Roberts at all? - Yes, two or three years.</p>
               <p>What is she? - She is a servant to a girl of the town.</p>
               <p>You do not give her the best of characters? - I never heard any thing against her character.</p>
               <p>You have seen a good deal of this gold chain work? - I never saw one like that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230035"></xptr>What is there particular in the make of this? - It is very small, they are generally larger.</p>
               <p>Have you had the custody of it ever since? - I have; it has never been out of my custody since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Miss. Catley. You know this to be the card you say, why you have not the fellow of it? - I have not the fellow to it now, I had it some time, but I believe in want the same way that is gone, but that is not to the purpose now; I suppose you could not match it in England; I have sworn to it already in two places before I had the honour of coming here, I had five guineas sent from him, not to appear against him.</p>
               <p>Whether you was not going to take the prisoner as a servant in your family a few days before? - I was.</p>
               <p>You have known him for twelve years? - Yes.</p>

               <p>During that time you entertained that opinion of him, that you would have taken him for a servant? - Certainly Sir, I always took him to have been honest; the only fault I never found against him, was his drinking; I never could keep him sober, but for all that, that is my chain.</p>
               <p>You told us this was a present to you? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Has no other person any concern in it? - No, Sir, I am not a married woman.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been married? - Never, nor never intend it, I never shall; but I suppose I am not obliged to swear that Sir, am I; if the court say, I shall answer it.</p>
               <p>Court. I will explain to you how far it is material, the prisoner was indicted for stealing this property as belonging to you as a single woman, therefore, in point of law, if you are married, he must be acquitted? - I am not, nor I never was, nor I never shall.</p>
               <p>Court. We do not understand you as having sworn to the latter part, only as to what has passed, but not as to future.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What was it you pawned with Mr. Aldus? - I do not know what it was, it was on a card, I should not know it again, it was on a Monday, I never carried any thing but once; Mr. La Roche asked me in Chapple-street, to go to a pawnbroker's, I told him yes, he bid me go to the pawnbroker's and bring him a guinea and a ticket, for he must have it out to-morrow; I asked him no questions, and he told me nothing; I should like to see the chain; I have been there too often for my interest; I have carried things several times since then, I believe it is seven weeks ago, I never carried any thing upon a card before to the best of my knowledge; I believe that is the man that desired me to carry it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever carry any thing of this kind, whether gold or not rolled upon a card, to Mr. Aldus's but once? - No, Sir, never but once.</p>
               <p>Then who did you get that thing from? - From a man they called Le Roche.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have known him a great while to have been a hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>That is the man is it not? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I believe it is the man, he has not the same cloaths on; if I could swear to the man, I could not swear to the chain; Mr. Aldus said, it was what they put round gentlemen's waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether that is the man? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt but that is the man? - I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure? - I would not be sure, he had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Then you only know him by his coat, upon your oath is that the man or not, go look at him? - I am sure it is the same.</p>
               <p>Was not the man you shewed to Aldus in the street, the man you got it from? - I did not shew him to Aldus; I asked him for a guinea and a ticket, he said, whose was it, I said, I will not tell you, I said, it is La Roche's, he went out and found him at the publick house, I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>(The chain shewn her.)</p>

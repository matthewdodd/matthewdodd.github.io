I am certain I had it when I went there; I awoke about half past seven, and she was gone, and my watch also, which I had put under the pillow. I did not see James M'Carthy till he was at Queen-square; I saw the watch on Tuesday morning; I made known my loss in the house; I did not know the prisoner's name at the time, but I have no doubt that she is the person; I cannot exactly swear it. I spoke to no other woman in the house but her, the door was locked inside when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What time did you go there - A. About half-past eleven o'clock. I had nothing to eat nor drink there. I went to sleep soon after, and did not awake till half-past seven. I was sober enough - I had not had two pots of beer, nor any other liquor - I had had half a pint of ale; I was to sleep at my master's stable. I gave her 6 s. When I awoke the door was shut, but not locked, and she was gone. I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person I slept with.</p>

            . I live at No. 50, Whitcomb-street. The female prisoner did not live there. I had known her six months, and had seen her at the house several times. I saw her in the prosecutor's company on Sunday night, the 25th July. I am servant in the house. Mrs. Curry keeps the house. I showed them to a bed-room, and left them there. Brown went away about seven o'clock in the morning; I am quite sure she is the person who came with Black; - he went away about half-past seven o'clock, and complained of losing his watch. There was no other person in the house, and no one had been there from the time Brown went till Black complained of his loss. When he came in at night I saw the ribbon of his watch. There was no other person went in or out of the house from the time they came in at night till Brown went away the next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What, are you servant of all work - A. Yes; there had been visitors in the house in the evening, before they came in. I sleep in the three-pair of stairs, and Mrs. Curry in the back parlour. I opened the house just before seven o'clock, and saw Brown go out. We shut up between eleven and twelve. There is no other door to the room. I have seen M'Carthy before, but not on that day. They have been to our house together before.</p>

            . I am a watch and clockmaker, and live in Great Chapel-street, Westminster. About six o'clock on Monday afternoon, the 26th of July, M'Carthy offered me a valuable silver watch for sale; I do not think it had any appendages but a ribbon; he wanted five sovereigns for it; I told him I did not want it, and did not ask how he came by it. I have not the smallest doubt of his person; he was then in his regimental dress, as a drummer. I saw him in custody next morning, and was positive of him. I afterwards saw this watch at the Police-office, and have no doubt of its being the same.</p>

My son asked me to look at it; I asked what he wanted; he said 3 l. I said whose property is it? he said it was his own. I said I knew it could not be his own, it was stolen property. I sent for an officer, and gave charge of him. The watch was produced at Queen-square, and sworn to by Black. It is worth seven guineas and a half, or 8 l.</p>

I asked where she lived; she said she would show me, and took me to several places. I searched her, and found twelve duplicates; one of them was for M'Carthy's Waterloo medal. I showed Brown to M'Carthy, and asked him if he knew her - they both said they did not know each other. She had a gown on, and when M'Carthy was searched at the Hoop and Grapes, public-house a piece of this gown was in his pocket, and in her box another.</p>

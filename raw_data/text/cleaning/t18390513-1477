                  </hi>. I live in Christian-street I slept in Vinegar-lane on the 4th of May, with Mary Ann Reed—about half-past three o'clock in the morning, as I was in bed, I heard a noise at the back door—Reed went and opened the door, and it was Dunbar—she came in and said, "I have come over the palings of No. 4—I robbed a man of his watch, which I put in the kitchen, and a sovereign, which I put under the carpet—will you let me have a pair of slippers, and a bonnet, and shawl?"—Reed would not—Dunbar said, "Don't you think I will pay you for them?"—she said, "I think not"—Dunbar then went away—I told Reed to open the window and call a policeman, but she could not see one—I watched at the window—in about a quarter of an hour I saw two policemen, and gave them information.</p>

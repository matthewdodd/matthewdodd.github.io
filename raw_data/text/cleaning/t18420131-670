About four o'clock on the 7th of January, I fastened my window with the usual simple fastening, a spring catch—I left home at a quarter past six o'clock—I left my wife in the house and two lodgers—I returned about ten minutes before seven, as near as possible—I found some persons had been in the house and taken a Bible, Prayer-book, and hymn-book, and a table-cover off the table in the front-room—these now produced are them.</p>

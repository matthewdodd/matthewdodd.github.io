            . I am one of the City police; on the 19th of February, at a quarter after six o'clock in the evening, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18340220-205-crimeloc1171">Arundel-street, Aldgate</placeName>

               <p>Jacob's Defence. I was going up Gracechurch-street, the policeman tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "I want you, my lad, you must come to the watchhouse with me;" and when I got there he said, "I take you for picking a gentleman's pocket, and giving it to the other prisoner;" whom I had never seen before in my life.</p>

               <p>Should you have known them on the green three or four miles off? - Yes, I swore to them, and carried them home; they have been eat since.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol of Saint George's, Hanover-square, on the 22d of July last, about ten minutes after four in the morning, my partner and I were standing in the corner of Park-lane, and the two prisoners came along by the dead wall from Tyburn Turnpike to the corner of the lane; they came on the foot way; I turned about and spoke to my partner that stands here, and said, them men were suspicious looking men, and they should be searched; Goddard had the bag; it was very light, ten minutes after four; he had the bag tied up, and upon his head; the other prisoner had nothing upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140088"></xptr> him; they were walking together as near as they conveniently could.</p>
               <p>Did you hear them conversing together before you stopped Goddard? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Were they walking side by side, or were they following? - I cannot say, I believe they crossed one another when they came to turn down Green-street round the corner of the wall, as if not to come through it, but to go down Park-lane.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to you as if they meant to avoid you? - Yes, I stopped them at the corner of Green-street, I asked them where they were going; I spoke to Goddard, who had the bag, and the other stopped; they both stopped with one another, and my partner came up to me; I asked him where he was going, and what he had got, he said ducks; I said, where are you going with these ducks, and he said, to Leadenhall-market; I asked him to whom there, and he said Jones; I asked him what Mr. Jones was, and he said a salesman; I asked him where Mr. Jones lived, and he said at East Acton; he said he had been hay-making there; he said I might see the ducks, I said I should see them; the ducks were all dead; I saw by the killing of them they were not properly killed by a market-man; I seized one, and my partner seized the other; the prisoner said he was not concerned; going along Park-street, just by the Barley Mow, Goddard desired to stop, I stood very close to him the same time; I saw him hustle very close to the corner, and he put his right-hand into his left hand waistcoat pocket, and I put my hand in, and found this piece of wire, and this piece of iron; in the examination they were deemed picklocks, and I took them for such; there were some things of no value, and a pewter spoon, but they are owned by nobody; nothing was found on Lovejoy but this little knife; I took the prisoner to our watch-house in Mount-street, and immediately set off for East Acton, where the prosecutor lives; I went to Mr. Bedford's to ask if he had lost the ducks, and described them no further than as seven ducks; I had no discourse with the servant about the ducks; when I shewed them to him the servant knew the ducks, and said they were his master's property; they were of the Muscovy breed; I did not observe that he said any thing about the marks.</p>

On the 13th of November I had been dining at a coffee-house in Cornhill, and on returning from dinner with a friend I suppose it might be about eleven o'clock at night, I was going under the gateway of <placeName id="t18111204-8-crimeloc38">Thavies Inn, Holborn</placeName>

I found myself incumbered by a man running against me, and feeling round my pockets; I clapped my hand down to my fob, missed my watch, and seized the man by the neck, and immediately exclaimed, you rascal you have got my watch; I took my umbrella, which I had in my left hand, and plunged the same into his mouth, and kept repeating it untill I secured him, and at the same time calling out for watch, and for assistance. The people in the houses heard me, and immediately came out with their candles, and a man of the name of Davis, who is a watchman of the place, also came out, and the constable of the parish came from the noise, and the man was taken away from me in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your watch - A. The watch was gone; the people brought out candles and found the outside case which the constable has got. The watch I have lately heard an account that it is pawned in Blackfriars-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other man near you - A. None at all; he was quite by himself. At the moment I found a flutter I seized him, and never gave him up untill I delivered him to the constable. There was no blow struck by the prisoner, all he did was, he came plump against me, and feeling the flutter in my pocket I seized hold of him by the neck, and put my umbrella in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no harm produced - A. No harm at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How could I take the watch from you, and what could I do with it - A. There is no doubt he had an accomplice with him; there was a man seen to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040015"></xptr>run from him to Hatton Garden.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 13th of November an alarm came to the watchhouse that a gentleman was robbed; I immediately went up Thavies Inn, I saw the prisoner collared by the prosecutor, he told me that he had been robbed of his watch. I immediately took charge of the prisoner. In the course of two or three minutes the watch case was brought to me. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, I searched him. I found upon him nothing but a bad dollar, a three shilling piece, and one good shilling.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When this gentleman accused me of the robbery I was going home, he turned round and took hold of me by the collar; he said you scoundrel, you have robbed me of my watch; I said, no, I have not; he struck me; I was all over a gore of blood; he left me and went about to look for the watch; I staid there, knowing myself an innocent man. I am as innocent of stealing the watch as God is true.</p>
               <p>Roberts. This is the outside case.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my outside case.</p>

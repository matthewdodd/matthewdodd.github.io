                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Jones; we live at Uxbridge Moor—my husband rents the house; he is a grocer and baker. On Christmas-day, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I and my husband left the house—it was fastened up, and no one was in it—the windows were fast, and the door—I returned about 9 o'clock—I found our casement window open—it had been fastened with a little bolt—I had lost some tobacco out of a jar, and some coppers out of the till—I thought there was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in coppers—I have seen the tobacco since, this is it—and there was one particular halfpenny among the coppers that I know, this is it—the day before I gave to a little girl 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of halfpence, and she brought this one back, and said it was bad—that called my attention to it—I can swear to this being in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday morning, the 11th of October, I was on duty in Weymouth-street, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner about one-eighth of a mile from the corner of Upper Harley-street, at the corner of Portland-road—as soon as he saw me he turned round in a different direction and went down Charlotte-street—I met him at the bottom of the road—he was carrying something on his left arm, and a bundle in his right-hand—he asked me if there was a coach on the rank—I was in my uniform—he said he wanted to take a coach to London Bridge to take the first steamer to Gravesend—I asked what he was carrying—he said, "It is my own," and walked on—I stopped him, and took two coats off his left arm, and asked if they were his own—he said they were—I shook one of the coats and heard halfpence rattle—I asked if there was any thing in the pockets—he said there was nothing—I found three halfpence and a pair of gloves in one pocket, and a silk handkerchief in the other—I asked what he had in the bundle—he said a clock—I asked if it was his own—he said it was, he had had it four years—I asked if there was any name on the clock—he said his own name was on it—I said, "If you have had it four years, tell me the maker's name which is on the front"—he said, "I know nothing about that"—another constable came up and he was taken into custody—as we went along with him to the station-house he said, "If you will let me alone, and say no more about it, I could drop you a few shil<lb></lb>lings"—I asked his name—he said, White, 30, Melcombe-mews, Dorset-square, and that he had brought the property from there—I inquired there and he was not known—I returned to the station-house, searched him, and found on him five silver spoons, two watch seals, a key, a finger ring, four keys on a ring, a pocket-book, two letters, a razor and case, a box of Lucifer matches, and a snuff box—I went to Mr. Berry's house and saw the win<lb></lb>dow—I found a piece of wood in the area, and marks on it, which I matched to the iron bar of the window where it was wrenched—it corresponded exactly.</p>

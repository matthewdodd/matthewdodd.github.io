               <p>JOHN FEAR. I am a boot-closer; I live at No. 2, Angel-court, in the Strand. On the 6th of November, about two in the afternoon, I was going past the prosecutor's shop, <placeName id="t18121202-59-crimeloc348">between Foster-lane and Newgate-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18121202-59-crimeloc348" type="placeName" value="between Foster-lane and Newgate-street"></interp>

I saw the prisoner standing with her back against the counter. I saw her take the silk up, and put it under her shawl. There were several people at the other counter. I was going past with a parcel; I happened to stop and look in at the window; and when the prisoner came out of the shop I went in and told of it. Mr. Delaney came out of the shop, and went after her. I saw Mr. Delaney take the silk from her in Foster-lane.</p>

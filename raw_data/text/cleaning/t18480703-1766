I am cashier at the Southwark Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—Henry Bosanquet and others are the proprietors—Mr. James Dobson of High-street, Borough, is a customer—on 27th June this check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was brought by the prisoner—I suspected it, and asked him from whom he obtained it—he said Mr. Matthews sent him to obtain the money—I asked him what Mr. Matthews was—he said a builder or a carpenter—I took him into the Manager's room, a policeman was sent for, and he was given in custody—the policeman asked where he got the check—he said a gentleman over the way at Wallis's coffee-house gave it him to obtain the money, and gave him a shilling for his trouble—he said the gentleman had a white waistcoat, and he could give no other description of him—he produced a canvas bag, which he said the gentleman had given him to put the money in.</p>

I am a clothier in the Borough—I keep an account at the Southwark Branch of the London and "Westminster Bank—the prisoner was in my service about six months back; from four to six months—I have frequently sent him to the bankers to take cash—this check is not my writing, nor the slightest imitation of it—on my engaging the prisoner, I asked him to sign his name, which he did, but that was not sufficient for me to form a judgment of his hand-writing—he was requested to write at the Court, and from the signature at the Court, I should say this check is his writing—it is very like it—when this was first handed to me, I said I must refer to my books to see if I could find any corresponding writing—I have since seen his writing, which was similar to this, but it was written very badly—I have not sufficient information to form a belief abont it—this order for a check-book I can only make the same reply about, it is not my writing—I did not desire any person to go for a check-book on that day—the remark I was pressed to make at the Court was unfairly taken from me—I stated I had not sufficient authority to speak to the writing, I must see some corresponding writing.</p>

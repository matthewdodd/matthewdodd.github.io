On Friday, the 24th of August, the prisoner came into the shop for a basin of mock-turtle soup; I took it into the soup-room with a spoon, and in a very few minutes he called me into the room, and gave me half a crown - I gave him 1s. 6d.; he had only eat half the soup; he left in a very short time, and as he went out, I went into the room, and missed the spoon - my father went after him, and he was taken in a pawnbroker's shop; I saw the spoon at the office the same evening, and am quite sure it is my father's - I have cleaned it for many years; there are no initials on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it? A. By the pattern; nobody came in or went out of the room before I missed it - we had no other customer.</p>

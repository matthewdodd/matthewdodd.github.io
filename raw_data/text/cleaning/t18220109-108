On the 7th January, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner accompanied by another man came into the shop, and asked for some calico like that I had shewn him on the Saturday before; he said it was not wide enough; I said I had none wider; he bought one yard, paid 8 d. for it, and then went out; in about a minute I missed two shawls; I went after them down White Lion-street, and across Spital-square, and saw the prisoner in Lamb-street, with the other, and two or three more walking together, they turned down South-street; I came up to them just before they got into the market; and collared the prisoner; he knocked me away; the prisoner then ran across the market, I followed him, but the others hit me several times, and trod on my heels, and kicked my shoes off - I pursued the prisoner calling Stop Thief! he went into Red Lion-street, and I lost sight of him; his coat was picked up in the Fruit Market, and given to me - I am sure he is the man - I think he had come with the other man on the Saturday - he stood by the shawls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where were they found - A. In his pocket; I lost sight of him in the Market; I never said I did not think he was the man - he was not above ten minutes in the shop.</p>

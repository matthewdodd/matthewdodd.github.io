                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 23rd of November, the prisoner came and offered himself as a servant, and I took him into my service to carry out coals when ordered—between twelve and one o'clock on the same day I sent him with a half cwt. of coals to Mrs. Matthews, in Grey Eagle-street—there was a lad waiting for him—I desired him to bring 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back, but I never saw him again till he was brought to me in custody—he had only come to me that morning—he was brought to me by a servant of mine—I asked what he had done with the money for the coals?—he said he had spent it, and had thrown the coal-bag into the railing of the brewery—I gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I have never received the 9 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

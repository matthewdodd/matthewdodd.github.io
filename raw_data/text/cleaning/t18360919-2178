                  </hi>. I am a widow, and have the care of a house at the corner of Albemarle-street; it belongs to Mrs. Jeffreys. The prisoner was employed to whitewash the kitchen—I missed a table-cloth and hand<lb></lb>kerchief, which belong to me, and also a stew-pen, a copper, and jelly<lb></lb>mould—I told him what I had lost.</p>

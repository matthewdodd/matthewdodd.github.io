On Sunday the 27th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw my tin cash-box safe in my bed-room, on one corner of my drawers. I had omitted to put it away in its usual place, as my mother-in-law was then in a dying state. Physwick had at that time lived not quite a week in my service, she left about seven o'clock that evening. I had a character with her, she gave me no notice of her going, nor did she wait for her wages. At the time she left we were at tea, and she was desired to take the tea up stairs to my mother-in-law, she came down, she was sent to feed the bird in the shop and we did not see her after that. In taking the tea up she must pass the room-door, where the cash-box was, she left the street-door on a jar. I apprehended her on the following Saturday the 1st of November, at Chatham. I have found the box with the writings that were in it, but all the money was gone. I have got one of the 5 l. notes from the Bank, and am sure it is one of those which were in my box. At the time it was stolen it contained two 5 l. notes, seven or eight sovereigns, a crooked guinea, one or three half sovereigns, a seven shilling piece, and about 5 l. in silver, with other things. I found the box at Mary-le-bone office. I don't know Stephenson; when I took Phywsick, I told her she had stolen my cash-box and money, she acknowledged taking it, I neither threatened or promised her. I found nothing on her.</p>

I gave her the change, I was to have a pair of black stockings, a flannel, and a black petticoat. I said I did not wish any thing, the stuff bought, would make two flannel, and two black petticoats, she told me to take the things home and make them; this was on a Monday morning. and on Tuesday she came to me and said a young woman had robbed her master, and she was afraid she herself would get into prison, and the young woman too. She went away telling me to make her gown as soon as I could, and to take care of the things. I told this to the constable, when I was before the magistrate, the week after, I saw Physwick on Tuesday morning, she came with Stephenson, but was not by when she mentioned about the note.</p>

I went with Mr. Baker to Chatham, and took Physwick, who confessed to me voluntarily that she had taken the box out of her master's bed-room, and took it to a court in Islington, which she did not know the name of, where she opened the box and took out what she could, and left the box against a wall there; that she afterwards came to Westminster, and went to Stephenson's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040039"></xptr>with the two notes in her hand, but she only saw what amount one of them was, and that was a five. That Stephenson took both notes out of her hand, and said she would get change for them; that she returned in an hour or two, and gave her four sovereigns, telling her she should have the remainder another time. When she was at the office, I shewed her the box, which somebody had taken to Mary-le-bone office, she said it was the same. Stephenson denied all knowledge of the notes.</p>

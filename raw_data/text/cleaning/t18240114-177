            . Last summer, I was a pauper in St. Mary-le-bone Workhouse; the prisoners were also <rs id="t18240114-177-deflabel993" type="occupation">paupers</rs>

Bryan came and asked me to run away; I said I did not know where to go to; she then went to Kelly, who agreed to go, and I said I would go with them. We all went to bed at eight o'clock at night, and at twelve we all got up; we went across the yard, and got in at the little wash-house window into the laundry; Kelly set me to watch while they dressed themselves. We took nothing except what we dressed in, which was three gowns, three pairs of shoes, three shawls, a silk handkerchief, two flannel petticoats, two shifts, five caps, and two bonnets; they put a cap or two into their bosoms, and got out of window again, went to the gate, and found a ladder; got over the gate, dropped down the wall, and went into George-street, St. Giles's. Kelly took us there. She took out a purse of money, and said, there was eight or nine shillings; she afterwards felt for it, and said she had lost it. We staid two nights at Mrs. Pierce's, in George-street - it is a house of ill fame. They sent me to pawn a gown in Tottenham-court-road; I gave Kelly the ticket. We then went and lived at Allen's, in George-street, and slept there every night, all three together, for four months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get your living - A. Kelly and Bryan went on the streets, and I was their servant for four months. I was then starving, and went back to the workhouse, and told the gentlemen the truth. Kelly paid Pierce for the lodging with a silk shawl and handkerchief. The things stolen all belonged to the paupers, except a shift and a pair of shoes.</p>

            . I am laundress at Mary-le-bone work-house; the paupers' clothes are in my care. The prisoners and Thorp went away in the night, about the middle of the summer; they had left the laundry between seven and eight o'clock at night. I locked the door and left all safe, and in the morning found the wash-house window broken open, and the door burst open, to get to the laundry. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; five caps and two handkerchiefs belonged to me. My husband's name is Robert. I have since seen a gown, a cap, and petticoat.</p>

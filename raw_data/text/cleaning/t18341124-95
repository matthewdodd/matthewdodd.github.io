I received these skins from Mr. Harborough, of Carlton-street, Regent-street—I got them myself; and when I brought them home I worked on them, on the 28th of October; and on that evening I hung part of them in the stove the last thing at night, about half-past nine o'clock—I was the last per<lb></lb>son there—I locked up the place, all the windows were safe and the shut<lb></lb>ters up—I locked the door—I went there the next morning at six o'clock; when I got up to let the men in; the shutter of the stove was down, and the sash taken out—I called my father, and we missed these skins—I saw them again at Messrs.

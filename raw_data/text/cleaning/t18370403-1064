                  </hi>. I live in White Lion-street, Goodman's-fields, and am clerk to George Richard Metzler, of Wardour-street, Westminster. On the 8th of March, I saw a bassoon and clarionet in the shop, at ten o'clock in the morning—there was a broken square of glass in the window, large enough to admit a hand, but I had ordered some music cases to be placed against the hole—I did not mist these articles till the evening—I afterwards saw the clarionet in the possession of Wentworth—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the bassoon 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the cost price—a person might get them out without breaking the window, but I had had them moved out of reach—they could not be reached by a hand without some instrument being used—they were both missed at the same time—the lowest value of them is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

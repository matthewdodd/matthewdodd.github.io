            . The prisoner deposed that he was a formast-man, on board the King David, that captain Broad was then first mate, and Scott fourth mate. That he saw captain Broad knock Scott down twice with a blunderbuss, near the windlass; that then he struck the cock in his breast twice; that he then punched him three or four times with the butt end, into his belly; and then turned the mussel of the gun, and struck him in the belly; that Scott died in less than 24 or 28 hours. That he had no assistance, but lay where he fell; and that Wheeler and Osgood were there and saw him. That he really believed the blows were mortal at the time they were given; and that every one that was there thought so too. That he asked captain Broad to let the surgeon bleed him, he said d - n you, you bouger, if you be not quiet I will serve you in the same manner. Upon his cross examination, he said, it was between four and five in the afternoon; that it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100060"></xptr> broad day-light then, being in the month of July. That several blows were given him before he came. He said, that the captain knocked him down twice with the blunderbuss; that he got up and was knocked down again. He said he first struck him on the head; afterwards, he said, the first blow was in the stomach; then he said, he was knocked down both ways, both times; he could not say whether he struck him on the breast or the head with the second blow; but was certain he was knocked down with the blunderbuss in the stomach that was the first way; the punching with the cock was upon his breast, and that he punched him with the muzzle in his belly; he said, the occasion of it was, they had a shower of rain, and Scott had gone off the deck to shelter himself out of the rain; that Broad beat him upon the deck, and used him very ill, because he was off the deck. He was asked, how he could reconcile that, he said, he could not; he had said the man remained twenty-eight hours one time, and twenty-four another; being asked which he would stand to, he said to the forty-eight-hours; he was sure he did not live longer than that; that he said twenty-four in a short way for brevity sake: the truth being forty-eight hours. two whole days and nights; that all the ship's crew that were left saw him lie upon the deck in that condition, but no one could assist him; that Broad d - d him; in regard to Doughty that he never spoke to the captain about Scott, but when he said the captain d - d him he meant about Doughty; that he did not say a word to Broad about Scott, or to the surgeon's mate, or any body; that he called for no assistance, and no body offered him assistance but one Whallen and Drinkwater; what he said about the captain's denying his assistance, was in respect to Doughty; that Scott was speechless all the while; that he never heard him speak from receiving the blow; that he could not be always with him, but did apprehend he was unable to speak, and continued so during all the time; and that Osgood was upon the deck at the time the thing happened; but he did not remember any body else that was. That nobody did interpose, because they durst not speak for themselves. That the last words he ever heard from Scott, was the day before he used; he said, for God's sake, if you live to go home to Bristol, remember me to my wife and family; then he was bid to remember that two minutes before he swore that the man was speechless from the time he was knocked down till he died. His answer was, He told me that; he was then asked, if he had forgot what he said just now, that from the last time of his being struck down, he never spoke any more; his answer was, I never heard him speak after the last words; he died the day after he said this. The blows were the day before that of the conversation; he was asked if he did not say he was speechless from that time. His answer was, Not the time after he spoke to him; he never spoke in his hearing but once. Then he was asked, if he did not swear just now, that from the second time he was struck down he never heard him speak one word, and believed he was speechless. His answer was, I might say so, he was speechless; but the time he saw him and spoke to him, he said he was in a very bad condition, and died with the blows: that he looked at his breast and it was both black and blue, and he was swelled both on the right and left side of his breasts; he looked at him before he died. At the time he spoke to him. he opened his breasts; that he looked at him once in four or five hours which was as often as he could; that he did not look at his blows at any other time till he sewed him up; that he opened his cloaths at first when he spoke to him, but saw no other blow but upon his breast: that Scott told him he thought his death was owing to this blow: the words he used was, I am a dying man, and said, Captain

               <p>Q. The prisoner gave an account on the last trial of Broad's knocking him down with a blunderbuss; do you know any thing of such a blow being given by Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Scott died of?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I imagine a fever; I was upon the deck generally.</p>
               <p>Q. For the last three days before Scott died, was you upon the deck?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his being struck and punched with a blunderbuss by Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No, I may venture to say there was never one made use of in the whole voyage in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. You was second mate?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; I had a peculiar care of the arms and arm chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold any conversation with Scott for two days before he died?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I saw him frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever complain of the ill usage of Broad?</p>
               <p>Osgood. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Commings's coming back to the ship at any time?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; he came back in the King's long boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any relation made then of this murder?</p>

               <p>Osgood. I heard none.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was on board when he came back?</p>
               <p>Osgood. Yes; it was the King's long boat he came back in; neither he nor any other person complained of this murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether or not Scott died a natural death with a fever, or was killed by any blows from Broad or any other person?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I believe he died a natural death; and as for a blunderbuss I am certain it was never made use of in such a manner in the ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on board?</p>

               <p>A. If such a complaint had been made to me I should have put him into custody there, and had him tried by a high court of Admiralty there; he never spoke a word to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You can be very certain that this man never mentioned it to you?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the man; I am certain I never heard it from any man.</p>

I said, Have you deserted the ship? I turned to Captain

            's letter, and found that he was put down in that letter as entered on board a man of war. I said, You are a pretty fellow to leave the ship at such a time, after so great a mortality, and put us to straits to navigate the ship; for we buried, I think, upon the coast of Calabar and to Jamaica seven or nine and twenty white men of the crew. The original crew was about forty, and about two hundred and seventy-seven negroes. Commings said, they left the ship for bad usage; that there was no such thing as living with Capt. Broad, and also from his predecessor Capt. Patty. I said, As to Capt. Patty he might be a little severe; he was remarkably rough in his disposition, but as to Broad, I have known him many years, and looked upon him to be a different sort of a man, however when he comes home he must answer for himself: and as to your wages, it is impossible to settle with you, till I see how you stand on the ship's books. They went away; in two or three days the prisoner and the other man returned again and brought their landlord. They repeated the same demand; I gave them much the same answer, and said it was impossible for me to settle with them till I knew how they upon the ship's books, I was apprehensive they had forfeited their wages, for agreeable to that made, if a sailor does exceed forty-eight hours after a sorting from the other ships before he eaters on board a man of war, he forfeits his wages; they said, they had not forfeited it; they said I would not pay that wages they should. I would accept their power of attorney I said, I would not put them to the and expence; if they would would pay them when the ship returned which they were very thankfull. in particular, said, God bless your honour they took their leaves; I called Commings in, in order to enquire the occasion of our misfortunes by the mortality in the ship; he told me the reason of it was, they had been a long voyage about twelve months upon the coast; that they had contracted disorders, and likewise for want of the doctor, that that brought on distempers. I said, I was very sorry to hear Captain

             behaved in that manner; I looked upon him as a different person. Sir, says the prisoner, if I may speak the truth, I never was ill used by captain Broad in my life, nor never saw any thing by him, but what was humane. I asked him, if he was not a d - d rascal, that the last time he was with me, he gave me for the reason of his quitting the ship. The ill usage of captain Broad, he said, Sir, what I said was false; we must say something to make our story good.</p>

The other evidences that were with me, are at sea, both Howard and Wilson, if they had been examined, it would have proved the charge. I was wade drunk.</p>

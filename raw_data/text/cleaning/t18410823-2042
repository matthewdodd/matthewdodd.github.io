                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. William Joseph Sacre, who lives in Park-road. The stable is at the bottom of the garden—I left it all safe at eleven o'clock on the 17th of July—I returned in about an hour and a half, or three-quarters, and missed from it the articles stated—the parties must have got in at the loft-door, which had been shut—the bolt was slid in about an inch—they must have forced it open—nothing was broken—I went down to the station soon after, and there saw all the articles but two coats and a shirt—this now produced is my master's livery coat—I know nothing of the prisoner except seeing him about Lis<lb></lb>son-grove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty that night, and met the prisoner in Alpha-road, a short distance from Mr. Sacre's stable, carrying this bundle under his arm—I suspected all was not right, and asked what he had got—he said, only a few old clothes which a servant had given him at No. 2, Alpha-road—I took the bundle from him, and found it contained livery and other articles—I tied it up again, took hold of him, and saidjie must go with me—he became very resolute, and tried</p>

I was in liquor at the time."</p>

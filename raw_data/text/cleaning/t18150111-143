            . I keep a linen draper's shop at Somer's town. On the 6th of December these two boys came into my shop; they told me they wanted to look at some handkerchiefs; they were not so well dressed then as they are now. Tilley pointed to a particular sort of handkerchief: I got up in a chair to reach it down; that handkerchief was above my reach, and when I got down off the chair, he ran out of the shop. Jones staid in the shop; I said to Jones, the other boy has got something that he ought not to have. He replied he was not that kind of a boy; I said, what could he run out of the shop in that ridiculous manner for. He said that was the nature of him; and while I was standing looking at the door,

             the officer brought the other boy back, until the officer brought him back I did not know that I had missed any handkerchiefs. The officer searched them, and found two handkerchiefs on each of them.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. On the 6th of December I was at the Seven Dials were a gang of these boys meet and set off from there; I followed Tilley and Jones to Tower-street, Sommer's town; Tilley took off his apron, and Jones put it on him. I knew them, they were going to do what they call work. I saw them both go into Mrs. Pile's shop; and, as Tilley come out, he was tucking something up under his waistcoat. I stopped him; he asked my pardon, he knew me well. I took him into the shop; I searched them, and found two handkerchiefs on each of them; these are the handkerchiefs. They had no money about them, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my handkerchiefs, the are worth a shilling each.</p>

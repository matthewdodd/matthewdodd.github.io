            . I was in Peter-street, and saw the three prisoners and another man with them; Smith went up to the prosecutor - I did not see her take the watch, but I saw it in her possession; the prosecutor laid hold of her - Read then went up and said, "What is the matter?" Read took the watch from Smith and passed it behind her - Newman took it and passed it to the other man, who ran away with it; the case of the watch was picked up, but I do not know by whom; I got rid of my child, who was in my arms, and assisted to keep the two women till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was it before Newman was taken? A. I believe four days; I had seen him before, but had not spoken to him; I am not mistaken in his person - I did not hear the prosecutor swear he was not the man; there was a witness who said so at first, but he afterwards said he was; I could not take hold of him at the time because I had a child in my hand; the man who received the watch from Newman ran away; Newman stopped perhaps ten minutes, and told the woman to cut away into the passage and not stop there - he then went away; I had never spoken to him; I am a labourer at Mr. Cox's, in Shoe-lane - I had been to my tea and stopped rather over my time; I do not recollect two witnesses saying Newman was not the man.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in King's Head-court. I was not in Peter-street when the watch was lost; when I came up I saw Smith and the prosecutor scuffling - in a few minutes Read came up and received the watch from Smith; I did not see it pass into any other person's hands except a young man who ran away, calling out that he was an officer, which prevented the people from taking him; I saw Newman on the spot, but did not see him have any concern with the watch - it was said at the watch-house that he was in the scuffle in the passage, but I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How near were you to the woman when you saw the watch go? A. About four yards; I saw it go - Read took it from Smith when she went to rescue her, and passed it to a young man behind; it appeared to me to be a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You saw it pass to some person who ran away? A. Yes; he put it into his right-hand pocket - that was not Newman; I never told the last witness I had changed my mind and that it was; Newman was on the spot - there was a struggle between the prosecutor and the woman, before the man who ran away received the watch; to the best of my knowledge Newman took no part in it.</p>

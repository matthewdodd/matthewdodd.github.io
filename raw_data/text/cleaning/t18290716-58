            . I was at the hotel, and remember the prisoner coming there; I followed him up stairs when he went to brush his shoes - he went to the place where the shoes are cleaned; I staid with him there - I did not observe whether he went into any other room; he only went into the place, looked round, and found there were no brushes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160023"></xptr>and went out of the place: Bassett came up stairs, and I left him in conversation with her at the top of the stairs - I went down into the kitchen, and left them; she came down stairs, and met me in the kitchen - I expected she had let him out, but I went up stairs, and found him standing at Mr. Beaumont's bed-room door, which I think was open: I could not tell whether he had been in, but he seemed confessed - I did not like his manner; he stood with his hands placed before him, as if there was something in them - I kept an eye on him; Bassett came up stairs - he directed his discourse to her; I told him to look at me, and not to look at her so much - he still kept his back towards me; I touched his arm, gave it a sudden jerk, and the pin dropped out of his hand - I am certain he dropped it from his hand; he let me pick it up very easily, he did not resist in the least; I then said, "You have taken some things from Mr. Beaumont's room;" he said, What? I did not know the pin at the time, but suspected it was so - I said, "You have come into this house to see this girl, for her sake and mine do not take any thing out of the house;" he said he had not got any thing - I saw him place his hand in his coat pocket; Bassett immediately went into Beaumont's room, looked on the table, missed a box, and said, "Don't say you have not taken any thing, you have got a small box with a steel and flint;" he ten took the box out of his left side pocket and placed it in her hand, and begged of us not to tell, for it was the first thing he had ever done; he cried - I promised him I would not if he would give me up every thing; he said he had not got any thing more if he never breathed again - I asked if he knew the consequence of what he was saying; he said he did - that it was not that we lived now, but that we lived hereafter. I had been into Mr. Beaumont's room about three-quarters of an hour before but had not noticed the watch; I went into the room after he was gone, but did not see the watch there - I had been in the habit of seeing it there; I do not know whether there was a chain on it, as I had not particularly noticed it; this is the box he put into Bassett's hand, and this is the pin I picked up.</p>

            . I live at No. 42, Monmouth-street, and am servant to Mr. Emanuel, a clothes salesman. One night, the latter end of May, about ten o'clock, the prisoner brought a gold chain into my master's shop; I cannot say whether it was after the 26th - he produced a gold watch, and had the chain round his neck; I saw him take his hat off, and take the chain off his neck - the watch hung in his bosom fastened to the chain; Emanuel was at home - he is not here; he would not swear to him before the Justice; I know him to be the man - he staid there about a quarter of an hour, and my master gave the watch to him again; he wanted 18l. for it - my master would not buy it, and he went away; I am quite sure he is the man - I cannot recollect the day; my master was closing the shop up when he came, and told him to come next morning; but he did not.</p>

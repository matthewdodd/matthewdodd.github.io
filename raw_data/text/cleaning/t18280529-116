               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell when this was on your premises? A. I have lost 104 metals since February, but I cannot tell when I lost any particular quantity.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SLAUGHTER. Q. Is it your's, or is it not? A. Yes; I know this piece by its being a particular sort, which was made on purpose to cross the roads - they would not let me use any other, because the carts should not be shaken; I had twenty-eight yards of it, and these three yards were found at Christmas's house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there any mark on it? A. No; but we have more like it - it is of a particular shape - no other persons use such as this for a rail-way; I had the mould cast for this at Mr. Fowler's, and he never cast such for anybody else.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Want to Christmas' premises at Hounslow, where I found 10 1/2 cwt. of this sort of metal; he was not at home - but I saw him afterwards, and asked where he got it; he said he had it of a man with one hand, and he believed his name was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290068"></xptr>Slaughter - nothing was said about it when they were both together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know nothing of Slaughter but what you heard from Christmas? A. No; I took him in the country - Christmas was summoned as a witness at Bow-street - he came, and was committed on Monday last; when I went to his house, Mrs. Christmas shewed me the iron; there was a great deal of broken iron about, and some of these pieces were whole; I believe these pieces are sold as old iron when they are broken: Hounslow is about six miles from the prosecutors premises - Christmas said he had given 3s. a cwt. for it.</p>

            . I am a servant at Hillingdon. I saw Slaughter with some iron like this in his cart, crossing a field about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - he was coming towards the road leading to London; I went and took hold of his donkey; he begged and prayed for us to let him go: we told him we would take the iron back to where he got it - he said he had nine pieces from the wharf, and two from Mr. Rodney's gateway; he gave no account of buying it - we took him into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. WANT. Mr. Rodney is a farmer; I put some iron on his premises for safety.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to JOHN WELCH. Q. Then Slaughter never had time to go to Hounslow with this iron? A. No. There were five pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SLAUGHTER. Two persons came up; one caught hold of the donkey's head, and the other loaded the iron into the cart - they said they knew where it came from.</p>
               <p>JOHN WELCH. Yes; we brought back the cart, and put some iron in, which we found in a ditch; I was thirsty, and went to have a draught of water, and there I saw it; and he having some in his cart, I thought it was all of one parcel.</p>

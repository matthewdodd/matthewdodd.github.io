I tax'd her with robbing me, but she deny'd it, and up came her Bullies, and maul'd me, and beat me, and kick'd me down Stairs, and broke my Nose, and then turn'd me out of Doors, and hussel'd me up and down among the dark Alleys, that I might not find the House again, and so they left me in a most lamentable Pickle. I gave notice to several Pawn-brokers to step my Goods, by which Means I afterwards recover'd them.

Now its always my way to take care of my Masters, and see them safe home, when ever I meet any of them as I go my Rounds: and so it fell out between 12 and 1 a Saturday Morning, that I see's my Master Hartrey come out of a Coach very much fuddled, and who should be up upon, but this very Gentlewoman at the Bar, Madam Blewit, or Dickenson, or Bowler, or what you please to call her, for she was Wife to them all Three at the same Time, and the two First of'em are now a hanging in Chains in St. George's-Fields. Whether he wanted a Whore, or she a Rogue, is neither here not there, but they presently laid fast hold of one another, and grew woundy loving. I found my Master was in Danger, and did all that I could to get him away. Hussy, says I, You Saucy Brimstone Toad you, what Business, have ye with my Master, let him go, or I'll call my Brother Watchman, and have ye to the Round-House directly, And, Ah Master! says I, my dear Master, come away from that Hang-in-Chains Bitch. - Yes I did call her Bitch, that I did, my Lord, and I can't deny it. - She'll certainly pick your Pocket, says I, or Serve you a worse Trick. - Come, come don't expose yourself, but all signify'd nothing, he swore she was a Girl for his Fancy, and he would go with her, and so they went together, but it had been better for him if he had taken his poor Watchman's Advice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Dutton, a shoemaker, at Beckford-row, Walworth. Mr. John Williams was remaining at his house, having come from Wales—on the 19th of August a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which was engaged the over night, came to the house between six and seven o'clock in the morning, driven by the prisoner—I assisted in putting the parcels into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—there was, among others, a cane basket, containing articles belonging to Mr. Williams—this is the basket—(<hi rend="italic">looking at</hi>)—I was not aware of the contents—I gave it to the prisoner, and he put it inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> himself—there was a padlock to it—I do not know whether it was fastened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane. On the morning of Wednesday the 19th of August I remember a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming there with a gentleman and lady, and some luggage—the pri<lb></lb>soner is the man who drove it—I know his face well—I helped to unload the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not take any parcel from inside, but from outside—I then asked the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man if he had any more parcels inside, after it appeared to be unloaded, and he said, "No"—there was no basket of this kind taken out—I saw all that was taken out brought into the office.</p>

I went to the George public-house, in Black friars-road, which is a watering house, on the 22nd of August, in company with Mr. Douglas, I there saw a person named Ionn—I made inquiry of him, and he showed me this basket—the hasp had been broken off, and tied with this cord—the plate which is now in it was in it then—he stated where he got it—Douglas claimed it as Mr. Mills' property, and he gave it up.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. This lady's son came to me, and gave me information: I went with him in a coach to Peter-street, Westminster, and then to Peter-street, Soho; and up stairs, in the house of one Lloyd, I apprehended the prisoner; I got there about eight, last Thursday night; I found her there, up one pair of stairs, and upon searching a chest which she claimed, I found these pair of stays, and these things; she gave me the key of the chest; on searching her pockets, she dropped this box on the floor, which contained this gold ring; in her right hand pocket I found another gold ring, which is here; and in the chest, I found this spoon; she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. One is my sister's and the other my husband's, which I had in my box; here is their names in them; these things are all mine, and many more that she has pawned.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Three weeks ago last Friday, Mrs. Fearnsworth brought this little box to me; and she said I had four rings in 
this, and two I gave away, because my son's wife shall never enjoy them; I give you these two rings; so on Sunday night, when we went 
to bed, she said she would give me all the rest of the things, that her son's wife might not wear them after she was dead; the silver spoon is my own; I have had it these many years.</p>

               <p>ELY WOLSTENHOLM.

Prior said he was in a hurry, and if he did not search him, he should go; he went, Isaacs was going to follow him. Smith struck him several times, and tried to trip him up. I pursued, and at the corner of Bunhill-row, I saw Prior throw the handkerchief down; the officer took him, he tried to get away; Smith tried to rescue him; the other man went away.</p>

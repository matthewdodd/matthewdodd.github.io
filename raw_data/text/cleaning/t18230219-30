            . I am a constable. On the 8th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on Holborn-hill, on the opposite side to Mr. Martin, and saw the prisoner in company with two more running after the prosecutor. I watched them and saw, Jordan take the handkerchief out; they all ran up Union-court - I sent a man to stop the gentleman. I followed, and lost sight of them - I knew them before. I went towards Field-lane, and met Wilden, who accompanied me, and in West-street, I took Jordan; he was standing at the corner of a court in company with several more. I had taken the other two before that. I found the handkerchief in his hat with another; he said he bought them of a sailor. Mr. Martin claimed it, and produced the fellow one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. Andrew's-hill. On the 20th of March I was in the Post-office—I had two pins and a chain in my stock—after putting a letter into the Post-office, I missed my pins—these now produced are them, and what I lost—I had them safe immediately before going into the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty about six o'clock that evening—I saw the prisoner with this letter in his hand—it was sealed then, and has been opened since by the Alderman—he was reaching with it over the prosecutor's shoulder—knowing him, I kept my eye on him—he pressed very hard, and returned without putting the letter in—he went to another window—the prosecutor turned and said, "I have lost my pin"—I said, "Keep your eye on me"—the clock struck—the prisoner was then going away—I stopped him and said, "What have you got about you?"—he said "Nothing"—I searched, and in his pocket I found this pocket<lb></lb>book and this pin, loose—I asked where he got it—he said, "It is my own, I bought it at Manchester three months ago, and gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—the pro<lb></lb>secutor saw me pull it out—he said instantly, "It is my pin."</p>

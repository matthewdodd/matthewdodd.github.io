            . I am a cow-keeper, and live at Tottenham. I know both the prisoners. On the 19th of May, a little after nine o'clock in the evening, I saw Mallett go past my house with a truss of hay, in a direction from Dr. Gwynne's, and about a hundred yards from his house; I never heard that Mallett has any land, but I know he keeps a horse and two or three cows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had you known him? A. I think he had lived in the neighbourhood six or seven years.</p>

On the 19th of May Messenbird was in my service; I had missed hay for a long time, and I missed some that day; the prisoners were taken before Mr. Morees; I was present; there was no threat or promise held out to them - what they said was taken down - I saw them sign it; they were charged with this felony; one was examined against the other. (Deposition read.)</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MESSENBIRD being charged with having purloined and robbed his master, Dr. Gwynne, the complainant, of hay and corn, says, "On Saturday last I gave nearly a whole truss of hay to Thomas Mallett, of Tottenham, who keeps a horse and some cows, and about a fortnight before that I gave about half a truss to the said Thomas Mallett; and a little before that I gave him about half a bushel of oats, which I put into a sack for him, and for which I told him tocome in the evening, which he did, and took the same away; I gave him the hay and corn about three weeks ago, as a recompence for the loan of his horse, which Mallett promised to lend me when I left my service, he go to see my friends." W. MEASENBIRD.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MALLETT says, "On Saturday night last I carried a blackbird and cage to Dr. Gwynne's servant; I do not know his name - between nine and ten o'clock, and he gave me part of a truss of hay - I think about 40lbs., which I took home to my house - he also, about a week or ten days ago, gave me half a bushel of oats in a sack, which he told me to come for about nine o'clock - I took the same home - he gave me hay twice - I keep a horse and two cows, but have no land."

            . I am constable of Edmonton. I had no conversation with the prisoners before they were brought before the Magistrates - I read the warrant to them, but did not threaten or promise them any thing; Mallett said"I had a bit of hay - Messenbird went with me to my house."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they both went before the Magistrate, and before any evidence was gone into they made a confession of their crime? A. Yes; they did.</p>

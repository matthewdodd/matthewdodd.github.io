                  </hi>. I am a servant, and lodged at Mrs. Fuller's, in Great Barlow-street, as I was out of place—I had been there a fortnight. The prisoner, who was a stranger, came there about five o'clock in the evening, on the 24th of January—Mrs. Fuller did not know her before—she came with the pretence of taking a lodging—I was out at the time—when I came home she was there—I had a bag there, containing a sovereign and one half-sovereign, three half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence in a purse, also a handkerchief, and shawl—we drank tea together, and talked a great deal about her mistress, and so on—we were in a room on the second floor—she said, would I like to take something to drink—I said, no, I did not want any thing—I was at needlework—at last I consented, and she took a small bottle from the cheffioneer, and went out—I lighted her down, and she said, would I lend her my shawl, to go next door—I lent it her—she went out, and did not return—I looked, and missed my things—she was taken in three days—I found this purse, which is mine, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—that is all I have got back.</p>

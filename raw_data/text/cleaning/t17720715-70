            . I was a witness here the other day on the conviction of Dempsey and Devine. I went with them to Duke's Place; Devine asked 
               <persName id="t17720715-70-person593">
                  Aaron

             to buy a watch; he said he could not; we asked him if he could help us to one that could; we went a little further and met the prisoner; he brought us into a public house; we shewed him the watch; he said he would give no more than five guineas for the gold, and one guinea for the metal one which I had, six guineas in all, he put them in his pocket, and said go home with me, I will pay you the money, and bid the former witness wait till we came back, and he gave him 6 d. we went to Lyons's, in Sweet Apple Court, he then locked at the watches, and said he would give but six guineas; he took out a 20 l. note, as told us, and gave it to his wife to get it changed; Dempsey watched her, and she went into a Jews place, and got it changed, and came back, and then we asked him to drink, and sent out for half a pint of rum.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. What time of day did you come to my house?</p>
               <p>Gore. After seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What money was it you received?</p>
               <p>Gore. Six guineas all but the half pint of rum; there was five guineas and a half in gold, and the change of the half guinea.</p>
               <p>- Heley. After Gore had surrendered himself to me, he told me, he had sold two watches on the 9th of June, to a Jew, in Sweet Apple Court, Bishopsgate Street; I asked him if he knew the name; he said, yes, it was one Lyons; accordingly Mr. Bond, I and Mr. Taylor, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150042"></xptr> next morning, between three and four o'clock, to the house of Lyon; the evidence Gore knocked at the door; I stood about ten yards from the door; the window was opened by Lyon, and he said, I am coming; accordingly the door was opened, and Mr. Bond and I jumped in, and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond gave the evidence the watch in his hand, and rushed in, and cried, take this! take this! it is no watch to be bought. What Gore says is false; It is a matter made up by Sir John Fielding's men; they instructed Gore to tell this story; he never knew any thing of me. I don't live in Sweet Apple Court, but in St. Dunstan's Alley.</p>

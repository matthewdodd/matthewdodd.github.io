On the 8th of August I went out at one o'clock, and I did not return till nine o'clock at night, and when I came home I found my door double-locked, as I left it; but the ceiling was broken before and behind; I did not see it that night, I went to bed and slept until the Hatton-garden officers came and awoke me; they told me to get up and look if there was any thing amiss; I did, and found my chest half open, the box broken, and nothing in it but a parcel of bad halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you left in the chest? - A. There were ten bundles, with two pounds in each bundle, in silver and copper; the officers told me to dress myself and get up, they had got them snug enough. I had seen my chest on the 8th of August, the very instant I had dressed myself, just before I went out, because there were four shillings in the corner of it which I took out and locked the chest again, and all the money was there then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcels in it? - A. Yes, and counted them. They had cut the string of my keys and kept two of them; every week I lost something or other since they lodged with me, which has been a quarter of a year, and

             is the chief man of them all: I lost 30 s. in caps and sheets and linen, but I took care of the money because I looked at that every day: I am a poor desolate widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. I lost a shawl that I had bought in Oxford-road, from the head of my bed, and they took a night-cap with my name on it and stop thief in full length.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found any of your things again? A. Only the money which is here (they have spent the rest), the shawl, and the cap, they were at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned home were any of the prisoners at your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the four persons you have described lodgers at your house at that time? - A. Yes, they were, and they were lodgers off and on for this half-year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come home that night? - A. No, they were taken that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Mrs. Welch, where did you live then? - A. In Philips-yard, Diot-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am an old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living? - A. By letting out a few old beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Who they are, and what they are, you do not make enquiry about that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers had you in the house besides these? - A. No person at all in my apartments but these.</p>
               <p>Q. How many apartments have you? - A. I have a back and a front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no more than two rooms? - A. These were particular to myself; they used to sleep in the front room, all four in two beds.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did Price sleep? - A. He rented a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180017"></xptr>little room of me, and he pretended he had lost the key; his room was within a yard and a half of my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it adjoining the front room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more than these three rooms? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms had you altogether? - A. I have nine or ten both large and small; there is a room here and a room there, in a gallery over stables in a coach-yard, they broke through the ceiling of my chamber to get into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you how many lodgers you had there at that time in the other apartments, besides these five? - A. They were all out; I had locked the rooms up; they walk out by day and come home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hope of getting any reward by indicting as you have done? - A. I am both stupid and ignorant.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to see how far this stupidity and ignorance goes. - Have you not indicted them as you have done that you might get a reward? - A. I do not know whether I would or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not hope you would? - A. I hope in God I would.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you hope you would get? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You can reckon how much seven times forty would amount to: You know seven times forty pounds would amount to a great deal of money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get that? - A. That lies to the gentlemen, but not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get forty pounds a-piece for all the seven? - A. No, no: I would not wish to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You just now said you hoped in God you would? - A. I beg your pardon, I thought it was my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had not you the hope of getting forty pounds a-piece? - A. I would not wish it.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not take it if it was offered you? - A.These are cross questions to pass to an ignorant old woman.</p>

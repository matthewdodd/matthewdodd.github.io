I went to sleep. About twelve o'clock the man came and roused me, and said, what do you do here; I said, you were agreeable last night; he said put your clothes on, and when I was going to put my waistcoat on I found I had lost my watch and notes; he said, look under your pillow you will find your watch, I did; I asked for my money; he said he did not care about my money; I put on my clothes and called the watchman, the watchman called the officer and there was nobody in the house.

            . On the 10th of June the watchman, in company with this sailor, called me, the watchman informed me that the sailor had been robbed, they shewed me the house, I knocked at the door, nobody answered; I got into the house and found nobody there. This was one o'clock in the morning, it was quite day light; we returned again to the house. The prosecutor was fatigued, I told him to lay down on the parlour bed. I sat in the parlour till a quarter before nine in the morning, about that time Parnall came and opened the door with a key: he brought this bundle in his hand; he was in the act of unlocking a chest; I then went to him, I said to him, you have been playing a pretty game; he said, what is it; I said, you remember a sailor coming in last night; he said, there was a sailor with a girl of the town that he turned out; I awaked the prosecutor, he said, that is the man that gave me liberty to sleep here. I searched Parnell, on his person I found one pound eleven shillings and sixpence, and this bundle. There is two pair of new stockings, a pair of women's shoes new, and the stockings the woman then had been wearing, they could not have been off the legs many minutes. I found the stockings were purchased at Mr. Sanders's shop; there was some tea and sugar bought at Whitechapel, there was a pound note changed there. This tippett I can swear to be the woman's, here is also a duplicate of hers I found amongst the halfpence in his pocket, of a bed-winch pledged for four-pence on the 6th of June. I found the woman in Smithfield. After the woman prisoner was indicted she never has been near the house since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that note - A. This is one of mine. I lost eleven one pound notes, and a two pound note.</p>
               <p>Parnell's Defence. He came into my house about ten o'clock at night, he was there with a woman two hours, he sent for liquor at twelve o'clock; I said why do you stop so long here, I want to go to bed; they stopped till a quarter after twelve, he then said he must go and see after the girl that had been there, he had been robbed; I said, why did not you tell me, she should not have gone away. In the morning, when I came into the house, Patridge said, there is a man that was robbed at your house last night, do you know the woman; I said I knew the woman personally, but I did not know her name.</p>

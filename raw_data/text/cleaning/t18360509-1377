                  </hi>. I was a practitioner in medicine, and live in Crown-square, Southwark. On the 1st of April the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I was Dr. Lee—he said he was sent by the captain of the Dundee, naming Captain Wishar; that there was a package on board directed to me, and it must be fetched before ten o'clock the next morning, otherwise it would be landed, and incur expense—I asked him if he had seen the package—he said yes, with my full name on it—I said, I supposed he expected something for it, and offered him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he objected, and said he must have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it was his privilege, as the pilot-boy, to have that—I have not received any such parcel—it was on the faith of his representing there was such a parcel that I gave it him.</p>

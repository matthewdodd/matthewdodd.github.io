I went with Campbell, on the 2nd of May, to Rowland's house—I examined Mr. Bennett's premises last Sunday—the outside frame of the kitchen window had been cut, appa<lb></lb>rently with a knife, so as to admit an instrument to turn the button inside; and that being undone, the opening was large enough for a man to get in—I examined the dairy door, and a portion of the wood was cut where the bolt of the lock shuts, so as to admit an instrument to put the bolt back—I got this candlestick from Mr. Hutchings.</p>

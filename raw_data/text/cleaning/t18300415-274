            . I am a labourer. On the 29th of September I saw the prisoner at the <placeName id="t18300415-274-crimeloc1514">Castle, in the Broadway</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What intercourse with me had you, that you knew the hat was mine? A. Because you wore it on the watch with me, and you had it on that morning - I took particular notice of it; I could swear to it from all the hats I ever saw in my life - it was at nine o'clock when you were first in company with me that morning; afterwards two other men came in, and Johnson and they went to get their breakfasts, I believe.</p>

            . On the 29th of September I was standing on the Broadway pavement, and saw the prisoner going from towards the house where Collins lodged to his own lodging, it was about half-past eleven o'clock; he had a very large bundle with him tied up in a red shawl, which I have seen Collins wear round his neck; I saw about his trousers a parcel, which appeared about the size of a man's arm, and part of a gown tail hung over his boot - he saw it as he knocked at the door, and tucked it in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not that the time you ought to have stopped such a man? Witness. I ought to have done it, and you are the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He is a man who ought not to be allowed to give evidence; he would come home at all hours of the night, and has a wife and child he is bringing up in a bad manner.</p>

            . I had a warrant against the prisoner on the 7th of April on another charge; on his examination at Bow-street I heard of this - I went to the Castle, and found Collins had removed; on Good Friday I went to his lodgings, where he gave me a list of what he had lost, and this letter which the prisoner had sent him - (read.)</p>
               <p>Friend Collins. I met to-day Johnson, and he told me that I have done something wrong in your place, which if I have I am not conscious of so doing; however, he advised me to come to you, as he was going out of town for a few days, but you may depend on it you shall be satisfied, if I have done any mischief, before three o'clock on Monday next, and I have requested of Johnson to call on you when he comes to town, hoping this will satisfy you till then; I am living here in Camberwell with a pensioner of my own regiment, as I expect to receive prizemoney every day, and should I be so fortunate as to get it before Monday you shall hear from me, as I gave Johnson up my prizeticket this morning when I met him in St. Martin's-lane - he desired me to tell you of it, and to write this letter to you; I hope you will make yourself easy till you see him or me, between this and Monday. No more at present.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking with Collins on account of the watch being broken up at the time; three or four more were in company with us; some time in the day he got tipsy, and left the company - I went to my own quarters in Westminster, and next day I went down to Chatham to draw some prize-money; in going I met Johnson, who told me Collins had been robbed, and had a suspicion I had done it; I wrote the letter, and stated as you have heard.</p>

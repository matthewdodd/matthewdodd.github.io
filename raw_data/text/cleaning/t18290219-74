I have a court-yard, which joins my house, in which there is a building. On the night of the 2d of February I fed my fowls at six o'clock; they were then all right - I locked their house up then, and at seven the next morning I found the locks had been forced off, and all the fowls were gone but three - twenty fowls and one guinea-fowl had been taken away: I saw them altogether afterwards, and can swear to them - I had seen the prisoner on the Monday morning, as I was looking at the men; he spoke to one of my men, and said he was going where he was last.</p>

            . I am an officer of Kentish-town. On the morning of the 3d of February I was going from the watch-house, and saw the prisoner carrying three bags; I followed, and stopped him, about two hundred and fifty yards off; I asked what he had got - he said he believed fowls: I said, "Let us look" - he put the bags down, and while I was untying one of them he started; Bauldon, who was with me, followed, and took him - they were struggling, and I went up; the prisoner was resolute, and I drew my pistol - I asked where he got them from;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190035"></xptr>he said from the other side of St. Alban's, but he did not know from whom, and he was going to take them to Battle-bridge - as we were going along I saw his right hand going towards his pocket; I seized his hand, felt his pocket, and this knife was in it; I shewed the same fowls to Mr. Dean, who owned them - this lock was found on the prisoner, and there was a crow-bar at the back of his jacket, which fitted the marks exactly, but I have lost it.</p>

I was in bed and asleep that night, at a neighbour's, on Finchley-common, who I expected here, but he has not come; a man asked me to carry these bags to Battle-bridge - he said he would satisfy me, and I was willing to get a shilling if I could; if they had found a crow-bar, why did they not bring it forward?</p>

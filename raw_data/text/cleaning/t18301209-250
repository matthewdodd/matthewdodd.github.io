I lost these onions from a shed belonging to my house, on Friday last - they had been transferred from where I had left them, into a hay-loft, put into a sack, and partly concealed under hay-bands and other litter; the prisoner was my carter, and was going to town the same evening with me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Richardson. A little before one o'clock on Friday, I saw the prisoner put a prop against the hay-loft door, which I never saw before - I told my master I thought there was something wrong in the loft; I had seen the prisoner loading onions on the cart at five o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I had the prisoner stopped with his cart, when he had got five hundred yards from my house, and I pretended I wanted a sovereign changed- I then found these onions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. These onions had been transferred from one part to another? A. Yes - he was employed to carry onions for sale, but he never took any to sell without my direction; I have generally been on the premises when he has loaded his cart - I have sometimes been in London, and he has brought the cart to me, but I prepare my own goods for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090122"></xptr>market in a particular manner, and when they have been loaded he takes them - the shed was at the back of my premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have no doubt the onions were yours? A. No; I saw them at one o'clock, and saw them on the cart at five, in the same sack - the prisoner had 12s. a week, and 1s. a night when he went to market.</p>

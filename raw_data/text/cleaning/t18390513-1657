                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the family of Mr. Newel, of Cockspur-street. On the 2nd of May I was in the Court of Requests, in Castle-street. I did not notice any person round me but the prisoner, who was close behind me—I felt my gown pulled several times—I looked round, and saw the prisoner several times behind me, but it did not strike me what he was doing, till Mr. Groom asked me if I had not lost something—I then put my hand into my pocket, and found that I had lost a half-crown, 2 sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, and some halfpence, which had been loose in my pocket—I had a handkerchief in the same pocket, but that was left—I am quite certain I had my money safe when I first went into the Court—I saw the whole of my money again the next day—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—here is one sixpence rather bent, which I know to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of St. Martin-in-the-Fields—I was attending the Court of Requests on the 2nd of May, about four o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of the prosecutrix, <hi rend="italic">hitching</hi> her gown up gently—he at last got it up, and I observed him very busy with the pocket—he drew his hand out, and dropped a fourpenny-piece—a witness who is here picked it up—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—I ran up and seized him with some money in his hand—he struggled, and thrust his hand into his pocket—I asked the prosecutrix if she had had her pocket picked—she felt, and said "Lord bless me, yes! every thing I had is taken out"—I immediately tried to get the prisoner's hand out of his pocket, but he dropped the money in the pocket, and in the pocket I found one half-crown, two sixpences, a fourpenny-piece, 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, and five farthings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you there on duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was about three yards from the prisoner while he was picking the pocket—there was no partition between me and him—Alderson was about a yard from him at the time he picked up the fourpenny-piece, and gave it the prisoner—I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, and attempted to get hold of his hand—he thrust his hand into his left trowsers' pocket—I had not spoken to the prosecutrix before that—I did afterwards—there was no noise in the court—I do not suppose there were twenty persons there—they were clearing out—I was in such a situation as to be able to see what took place.</p>

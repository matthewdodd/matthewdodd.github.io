               <p>The Beadle returned with the watch-book, by which it appeared he was on duty both Saturday and Sunday night, and therefore on duty the night the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted on very clear and satisfactory evidence of a theft, though not of a value that affects your life, yet it is attended with circumstances that strongly call for a public example and severe punishment; as it appears clearly from the circumstances of this case, that that theft was committed by you, at a time when you was upon duty as a watchman; intrusted by the parish, and employed for the benefit of the public, to protect the neighbourhood from depredation and violence. There is an end to all safety to society, if those that are employed in the night to guard the persons and property of the King's subjects, become themselves the plunderers; therefore in such a case no punishment that the law authorises can be too severe: had the value been such as to have found you capitally guilty, I certainly should have recommended it to the Jury under the circumstances of your case not to have reduced the value, and there would have been every reason to believe that your Sovereign would have ordered you for speedy execution; it therefore becomes my duty to set as strong an example as can be; I shall not only sentence you for transportation, but the severest transportation that the law permits, the place of which must be Africa; you are therefore ordered by the Court to be <rs id="t17861213-128-punish646" type="punishmentDescription">

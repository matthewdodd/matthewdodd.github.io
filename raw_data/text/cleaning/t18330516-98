             (police-constable H 169). On the 18th of March, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Shorter-street, Wellcose-square - I saw a waggon; I saw the prisoners and Cartwright, who was convicted here last sessions, with the waggon; they all got into it, and opened several bags of sugar - I waited I suppose ten minutes; I then saw the waggoner (Cartwright) get out, but the two prisoners remained in - I waited a short time, and then I saw the two prisoners out of the waggon, and Cartwright in, and he lifted a bag of sugar off the waggon on to Wilkinson's back; the two prisoners were then going off, I pursued them, they threw the sugar down and escaped - I took the sugar and the waggoner; I am sure the prisoners are the persons, they were taken some time afterwards - the sugar was produced the last time, there was sixty-one lbs. of it.</p>

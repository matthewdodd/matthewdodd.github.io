            . I am an officer. On the 19th of May I searched the prisoner's house, No. 14, Barrett's-court, Wigmore-street - she came in while we were there; I asked her if the premises were her's? she said Yes. Before she came home I had searched the first floor, and found twenty-eight pair of sheets with the hospital mark on them, three pair of blankets, a piece of sheeting, a quantity of towelling, and a great many other things - I found in all as much as a small cart would hold. I attended her examination, she said part of the things were given to her by a sister in the hospital, who was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was her declaration made as to part or all the property - A. To that which was marked. She meant a sister of the hospital. I found a great many things with the marks cut out.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Wood, who is solicitor for the prosecution. What the prisoner said before the Magistrate was not taken in writing.</p>
               <p>MR. WILBY. I am steward of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18200628-12-deflabel65" type="occupation">sister of Faith's ward</rs>

               <p>Q. While she was there, had you reason to complain to her of losing property - A. Yes, principally sheeting; she said the patients must have taken them away. The property produced belongs to the hospital; some of it has been marked within the last two years. We never sell old linen, it is used for bandages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. May not linen get out of the hospital by patients not restoring it - A. I never knew it. We never allow it to servants as perquisites.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The sheets were given to me by Mrs. Foot; I refused to take them, but she said they were her perquisites.</p>

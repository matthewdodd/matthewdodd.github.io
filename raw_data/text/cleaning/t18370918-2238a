                  </hi> am the wife of the Rev. Joseph Prendergast, and live at Lewisham, in Kent. On Saturday, the 5th of August, I saw the house secured before I went to bed—there is a door from the private dining-room—that room where the boys dine—there is a door into the play-ground from that room, and a window towards the gar den I know that window and door were secure—next morning(Sunday)about six o'clock, when our man King came, he gave an alarm—I got up and come down the first—I went into the school-dining-room, and found the window-sash taken wholly out and removed—it is a small window—I inquired for the flutes and violins, and things on that sort, and the man produced some bundles form the play-ground—one bundle contained four flutes, tied in a yellow silk handkerchief, and there was a violin in a green bag—this property had been in the school-dinning-room the night before—the violin was generally kept on the sideboard—there were some shoes ready to be taken away—some outside the window, some in the play ground; and some on the table—they belong to the young gentlemen, who had left them below on Saturday night—they had been moved from where they were the night before—I saw a hat which Joseph Martyn found, and delivered to me, and I gave it to the policeman—there were four flutes—it was broad daylight when I was alarmed.</p>

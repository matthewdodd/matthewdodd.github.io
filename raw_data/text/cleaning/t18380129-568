                  </hi>. I am a medicine vender, and live at No. 20, Jermyn-street. On the 15th of January the prisoner came to my house, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening—he presented a parcel, and with it presented a printed ticket, purporting to come from the Belle Sauvage, Ludgate-hill—this is the ticket—(the direction of the parcel being read was, ("<hi rend="italic">To be delivered immediately to Mr. William Lambert, che<lb></lb>mist, &amp;c.,</hi> 20, <hi rend="italic">Jermyn-street, St. James's, London, by Monarch Coach Ticket, Mr. W.

To pay—I looked at the parcel, and saw it was directed to me—I opened it, and read a letter which it contained, purporting to be an order for goods—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"<hi rend="italic">No</hi>. 102, <hi rend="italic">Great Ormond-street, Bath. Sir,—Having been often asked by several customers for the celebrated Dr. Scott's pills, manufactured by you, I enclose an order for three dozens small boxes and two dozen large ones. I will thank you to send the account to Mr. Hart, solicitor, of Furnival's Inn, who will pay the same, &amp;c., &amp;c. Signed John Marks, chemist, &amp;c."</hi>—The prisoner said the parcel should have been delivered some hours previous, but in consequence of the bad state of the roads, the coach could not arrive at the Belle Sauvage in proper time—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he left the shop—I did not know John Marks, nor ever heard of such a person—I went to Furnival's Inn, and there was no such person as Hart there.</p>

This parcel has never passed through our office—this printed bill is not ours—ours is a blue ticket—this is not a genuine ticket—I never saw the prisoner till he was at Bow-street—he was never employed at our office since 1819, while I have been there—Monarch Bath coach comes to our inn, but this parcel, if it had come by it, would have been left at Hatchard's Hotel, in Piccadilly.</p>

On the 11th of February I was there; the prisoner Lloyd was introduced to me that day by a person named Baker—I did not know him before—I knew Baker—Lloyd produced this bill to me to get it discounted—it would be due some days after, on the 19th—I found that it required an endorsement, as it was specially endorsed to Mr. Ruffy, and there was no endorsement by Mr. Ruffy upon it—I said, "The bill is not negotiable in its present state, it must have Mr. Ruffy's endorsement on it before it can be negotiated"—he said he would go and get it done—I told him it was rather late then, and asked how long he would be gone—he said be had to go to the Commercial-road; it would take him nearly an hour—he went any and was gone about an hour—when he came back, Cunningham and Willes came with him—the bill was then endorsed as it is now—I told them I would endeavour to get it discounted, and if they would call not morning, I would give them an answer—they agreed to that; Lloyd at first did not wish to leave the bill with me, but Willes said he had known me some length of time, and he was sure it would be right; if I gave an undertaking to return the bill or the money, it would be perfectly safe in my hands; upon that they agreed to leave it—Lloyd said if he could not come himself, I might give the money, or return the bill to Mr. Cunningham—Cunningham came to me next morning—I told him I had not succeeded in getting the bill discounted—I was to make a further effort that day, and to give an answer on the Monday morning—I did not hear or see anything more of them after that day—on the 19th, the day the bill became due, I went to the house of Mr. Johnson, the acceptor, took the bill with me, and made a communication to him, in consequence of which I was taken into custody.</p>

Gordon, Duff, and Co. Order, Capt. Thompson, in full of my passage money hence to Demerara, Charles Heath. Drawn on Barton, Hasleham, and Higgins, Liverpool. Accepted, 18th January, 1842.

               <p>laws of England to know whether it would have the same effect in this country, nevertheless I considered it an irregularity—I explained that to them, and I believe Cunningham said, "Well, I thought it was all right, Willes knows enough about bills to say they are all right," and I believe he told me at the time that he himself knew little about bills—I saw nothing wrong in the second bill—I saw it was specially endorsed to J. Ruffy Esq., and asked Cunningham whether his name was Ruffy—he said "No"—I asked whether he was the holder of the bill—he said "Yes"—I said "How does it happen then that that name is deficient?"—I made then re<lb></lb>mark to both the parties that the endorsement was special, and the name was deficient—Cunningham said it did not matter, it could be got—there was mention made of there being a third bill in existence—I could not take on myself to recollect who said that—they said the amount of the other bill was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I understood, but I have not seen that bill—they said they had such a bill, but not with them—I desired them to let me see the other bill, because from the irregularities I perceived on this bill, I did not like to make my mind up as to the appearance, or the nature of the suspicious circumstance—they then left me—next day, Cunningham came to me alone, and brought the same two bills, but not the third—he asked me either to lend him, or procure him the loan of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these two bills—I noticed that Mr. Ruffy's signature was still wanting, and made the re<lb></lb>mark to Cunningham—I said, "Where is that third bill you promised me to look at yesterday?"—he said he could not get it, that Willes would not let him have it—I said, "How does it happen that this bill is in the same state as when you brought it to me before?"—he said, "Well, but is not the other bill, (alluding to the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill,) where there is no special endow<lb></lb>ment required, sufficient for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said "No, I will tell you what—I don't like the look of the whole of this case, because the third bill does not make its appearance," and then the young man being by himself I said, "I tell you what, I don't like the look of the whole case; how am I cer<lb></lb>tain those bills may not have been found?"—that was a suggestion of mine—Cunningham replied, "Supposing they have"—I said, "That is the reason I will have nothing at all to do with them, nor advise you to do"—previous to that I said, "If I was fool enough to meddle in this transac<lb></lb>tion, who tells me that these bills may not have been already advertised and stopped"—to which Cunningham answered, "No, I have looked at the paper these nine days"—that opened my eyes sufficiently, and I then addressed him in a manly style, saying, "I am older than to be your father, and I advise you to have nothing at all to do in this case, to meddle with the negociation of this paper—for, in the first instance, you cannot succeed without an attempt at fraud, and in the next without a forgery, and by attempting either, you run the risk of being sent across the water"—he then shook, and said, "Oh, I had better then destroy them"—I said "No, why would you do an innocent owner an injury without doing your<lb></lb>self any benefit or good by it? If you like to be guided by me, the only way in which you can even make an honest something out of it, and with out any danger to yourself, will be this; bring me the third bill yon have got, and I will do like I have done with the other two, make a copy of it and make a public advertisement for you, drawing it in the mildest man<lb></lb>ner, namely, that they had been found, and I will make an advertisement to that effect for you in the public papers"—I told him he would get a better reward that way than by any other means, and without any risk—that advice he seemed highly to approve of, and promised to follow—he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Bacon-street, Bethnal-green; I manufacture fringe and lace in the upholstery line. I occasionally go to the Old Rum Puncheon, which used to be kept by Packer—I remember seeing the prisoner Davis there—the first time I saw him there was about six months ago—I never saw him there on this affair at all—he called on me, as near as I can remember, six weeks ago come Wednesday—I cannot fix the date, as I paid so little attention, it having no<lb></lb>thing to do with my affairs—he had been once before to my house, but I was not in the way—he left word when I came home to stop, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I saw him—he asked me to read a note for him—I asked if be could not read himself—he said, "No"—he had not got the note with him—I asked him for it, and he asked me if I would step with him and read it—I accompanied him to a house just on the spot, I do not know the name of the street, and there found Saint, Clarke, and Davis—Clarke pro<lb></lb>duced some papers—they appeared to be bills drawn—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the bil for</hi> 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I believe this is one of the bills I saw—I read the bills—I do not remember the particulars of any other than this—I read then to them, and laid them down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induces you to say that is one of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It being the same amount—I remember the amount of that one bill—I do not remember the amount of any of the others—I read four bills—I cannot pretend to say the amounts of the other bills, but they were under this—they were partly printed, and partly in ink—one was from Liverpool, and I believe one from Madeira—I read them aloud—they told me to read—I read the words Ma<lb></lb>deira and Liverpool to them—I felt rather surprised at persons like then having these bills, and asked how they came by them—they said they had picked them up—they asked me what they had better do with them—I said to return them to the owner would be the best thing they could do with them, they would be of more use to him than to them—I then left them, and left the bills—they gave me nothing for my trouble, no further than asking me to have something to drink, which I had.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you altogether at the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes—I did not put any mark on the bill, or make any memorandum of it—in the course of that ten minutes I read four bills—I had seen Clarke before at Packer's—I was not in the habit of using Packer's house—I have been there several times—I suppose I might have been there twenty or thirty times in the course of about eighteen months—I was there about once a-week in that time—I do not call that being in the habit of using the house—I knew Packer by his attending there, nothing more.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect this being six weeks to-morrow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been out on business, and I returned from business—it was my own business—I had been round with my goods—I do not keep any shop to</p>

               <p>expose goods—in my line of business they are not exposed—I deal with many people round the City, with any one that will give me a price for my goods—I deal with Pawsons, of St. Paul's Church-yard—the last time I dealt with them was about eight weeks ago—I was out on my business when Davis first came to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose nobody has ever been ill-natured enough to accuse you of any thing dishonest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never been in any thing of the kind, nor was I ever accused of any thing dishonest in any way—I never lived with a floor-cloth manufacturer in Whitechapel—that I swear—I will take my oath I never worked in a floor-cloth manufactory of any description, either in Whitechapel or the neighbourhood—my wife and I never slept in the house of any manufacturer in Whitechapel—I never was accused of rob<lb></lb>bing a person in Whitechapel, in whose house I slept—I never slept there—I was never accused of robbing a person in Whitechapel or the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I have been to Greenwich several times to see my father, who is there—I was never accused of any robbery at Greenwich, and know nothing of any thing of the kind—I have never said I thought there was a reward offered for me and my companions for a robbery at Greenwich—I never said I was in a robbery at Greenwich—I have never been in any prison in my life, nor was I ever taken before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said you had to cross the water after this robbery at Greenwich, and that you were so closely pursued you had to throw a good deal of the property away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never said so—I never said I was closely pursued by the officers, that I stole a considerable sum of money, and in getting away I had to throw part of it away, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you always been working for yourself, were you never em<lb></lb>ployed by any body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Up to the last twelve months I was employed as foreman to Mr. Hory, a manufacturer in Spitalfields—Mr. Hory did not discharge me on a charge of robbery, and say he would not prosecute me because of my wife and family—I left on account of an unmanly attempt which be made to reduce my wages, at the time my wife was lying dead—I resented it, as I consider it the duty of a man to do, and I left him the following week without being discharged—nothing was said about my having robbed him, that I swear positively—he knew my wife was lying dead at the time—I had been with him three years and a half—I was the first with him in establishing his factory, and I left him the last—I never had an angry word with him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Willes's Defence.</hi> On the 10th of February, Cunningham brought there bills of exchange, and I went with him to Mr. Cobet; he said he either wanted to borrow some money on them, or have them discounted. Mr. Cobet and he had some conversation, what it was I do not know, respect<lb></lb>ing them; I had nothing more to do with the bills, and heard nothing more about them for several days, till I was informed by Mr. Packer, the landlord of the public-house where I met them, that they were put into his tap-room fire, and burnt. Some few days after, that 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was brought to me, and I mentioned it to Fletcher; I heard nothing of it for several days till I found it was in Mr. Wood's hands, who had it for the purpose of discounting or returning it; that is the whole of the knowledge I had either of the bills or these parties; I never saw them before to my knowledge in my life, and I should not have seen them had I not been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280164"></xptr>
               <p>applied to to inform them who would lend money on these bills. I have lived for forty years in the city of London, and borne a good character, and my family before me for sixty years, in the neighbourhood of London<lb></lb>wall; this is the first time I was ever in difficulty. I was not aware I was offending against the law, in saying such and such parties discount billls or lend money on them; I was not aware I was guilty of any crime in taking them to those parties—they did not tell me how they came by the bills it is not likely they would inform me—I heard no more of it till Mr. Wood was in custody; I was then given in charge, and taken to the station in Tower-street. Mr. Wood there recollected himself, that he did not receive the bill from me; I reminded him of the parties he did receive it of; and Inspector Waller, when I mentioned that, told me if I found the parties, they only wanted the parties who committed the burglary; that I should be taken care of. I was to meet these men on the Sunday night, between ten and eleven o'clock; this was on Saturday. I met them at twelve, two men named Pratt and Patteson, and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednes<lb></lb>day, and Thursday, I met them, till the parties were all in custody; and I believe Mr. Waller will prove, that as far as I was capable, I gave every information, after finding the bills were come by wrongly; on Thursday night I was taken into custody after having relieved Mr. Waller from all difficulty in finding the parties; as far as my information went, I acted as straightforward as any man could act under the circumstances. I had no bills or part of a Bank-note. I believe Packer went with Cunningham to the Bank to get it changed; he gave it to Lloyd, and Lloyd gave it to Fletcher to take to a Jew to get money or clothes, or what they could get for it. I advised Mr. Wood to have nothing to do with the bill, and so did Baker, so they tell me, and Wood was requested to give the bills back to the parties, that there might be an end of it. I have told you the whole truth, and the whole connexion I had with the parties; it is the first I ever had, and I will take care it shall be the last. I only acted in the capacity of an agent between them. Lloyd had all his things distrained on, and as bed to sleep in, and was greatly in want of money, or I should not have exerted myself in the matter. I leave it entirely to the consideration of the Jury whether I am guilty, in going with these two parties to borrow money on the bills, for I had nothing further to do with it.</p>

My master being out, I went down and told my mistress, and then sent for my master; this was about five o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140023"></xptr>in the afternoon. At eight, when he was leaving work, I stopped him going out, just off the step of the street door, and went and fetched Singleton the constable, and he searched him, and found pewter in every one of his pockets. While I went for the constable, he was in the kitchen with my mistress, and Mr. Bland with her, a next door neighbour.</p>

               <p>I am constable of St. Andrew's; I was sent for to Mr. Swift; I live directly opposite; I went over; I went down to Mr. Swift's kitchen, and searched him, and pulled all this pewter out of his different pockets, his coat, waistcoat, and breeches pockets. (Produced.) They weigh upwards of six pounds weight. The man said, he was very sorry for what he had done. I asked him, if ever he had been guilty of the like before? he said, he had not; he meant to sell it to an old iron shop in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking at all before you went to the Opera? - A. Hardly any thing; my friend and I had drank a bottle of wine after dinner, and no more; that was a long while before the Opera.</p>

             sworn. - I am a foreigner; I came from Flanders; I dined with Mabbely, and we drank a bottle of wine, and went to the Opera-house after we spent the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the beginning of the Opera? - A. Yes; when we came out, we met with the prisoner and another woman in the same dress, and they asked us to go home with them to Mrs. Brown's in Whitcomb-street; we did not mean to stop with them, but only drink a little together, and talk with them; my friend fancied this woman, and they were talking together, and the other woman attempted to rob me; my friend told me he was robbed in French, and then I saw this woman wanted to run away; she went out about half a minute, and I said, stop, come in; she came in, and directly my friend said, you have robbed me of three guineas and a half; she began to swear she had not, and she pulled off her shoes and shook her cloaths, and I saw it in her mouth, and directly as I said so, she tried to swallow up the money, and she became directly very black, and I put my hand to her throat to stop it, and she spit out a guinea, and then she would not own it; then we could not get the other guineas, because they were gone, and then we called the watchman; as we came down stairs, we were in the room below waiting for a watchman, she dropped down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110036"></xptr>a sixpence, and my friend picked it up; I saw it was a French sixpence, with a hole bored in it; and as we were going to the watch-house, she offered to go back to her lodgings, and she would make it up; he said, if she would send for the money he would; next Monday, at Bow-street, she said, she would make it up, and would send a woman to pawn her cloaths to get it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the money; the sixpence came from the pawnbroker's; it fell from my bosom; he told me he would not prosecute me, if I gave him a guinea and a half; I asked him if he knew the consequence of an oath, and to take an innocent person's life away; he said, he had lost a guinea by not going down by the coach, and he was determined to have it; he acknowledged himself on the Sunday to be in liquor, and wished he had not given charge of me, and on the Monday he said, will you give me a guinea and a half of the money; I said; I could not make it out; I am very innocent of it.</p>

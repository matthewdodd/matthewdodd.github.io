             the prisoner at the bar; had he ever slept at your house? - A. Yes, he had lodged three weeks with me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in point of fact whether he ever slept with Gunnell? - A. We came home after twelve o'clock at night; he told me he could not pay his lodging that night, he would pay me the next week; I gave him a light, and he went up stairs into his bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go into his bed room? - A. I slept in the room under him; I heard him go into the bed room; I locked the door and fastened it with two bolts, and went up to bed; my husband was in bed before he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning who was the first up in the house? - 
               <persName id="t18051204-12-person160">A. William Gunnel</persName>
             came down about six o'clock to our room door, and asked if any body had slept with him; I told my husband James had come home; we got up, and we all came down stairs and found the door only on the spring lock, it was not bolted; I am sure that I had bolted it on the over night; I had only put the spring lock too, I had not put the key in.</p>
               <p>Q. James did not pay you of course; how many nights did he owe you for his lodging? - A. One week. I did not hear of him till the 8th of November, and on the 9th of November I saw him at the Worship-street office; he was then in custody. I produce a pair of old shoes and a waistcoat which were left in the room; Gunnell wore the shoes to his brother's house in the morning he missed his shoes, which is a few doors off, and then he returned them to me; I have had them ever since Gunnel found them in his room..</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gunnel.) When you got up in the morning did you find any shoes in the room? - A. I found this pair of shoes, they had some pieces which had been torn off the red waistcoat in them for socks; I put them on to go to my brother's, having lost my own shoes; when I returned I gave them to Mrs. Hart, I found them at the foot of the bed that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hart.) Can you say who them shoes belonged to? - A. They belonged either to Gunnel or the prisoner. There was no other person in the room; they are not my husband's shoes I am sure. The socks that are in the shoes are pieces that were torn off this red waistcoat, which 
               <persName id="t18051204-12-person161">James</persName>
             the prisoner wore when he first lodged with me; I found the waistcoat in James's room.</p>

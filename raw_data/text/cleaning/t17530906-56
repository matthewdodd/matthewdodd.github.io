             As I was at my father's house last Monday between three and four in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the bar on this house, it is opposite to my father's, he was taking the lead from off the middle garret window; I saw part of his body out at the window; then he came down to the one pair of stairs window and put his foot on the lamp-iron, which gave way. so he fell into the street: then he said he had broke his leg, I went and assisted him.</p>

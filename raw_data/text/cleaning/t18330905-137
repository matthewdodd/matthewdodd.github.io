            . I live in Albany-street, Regent's-park, but I did live opposite to the house the prisoner had in Britannia-street; I frequently saw him go in and out, but the house was always shut up close - I saw an old woman frequently go in and out, and always shut the door very carefully; I have seen people knock at the door, but I never saw anybody let in; I never saw any furniture taken in; I saw the materials of the oven carried away; the prisoner entered some time in August last year, and Mr. Attwood got possession in May last.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told Mr. Attwood I wanted the premises as a warehouse, provided he would give me leave to take the oven away; he said, "Very well;" and asked if I would take the lease; I said I would within twelve months; to which he consented, and gave me possession; I had a person living in the house; as the oven was of no use to me, I applied to Mr. Bedell who built it; he said it had been built twenty-two years, he took hold of a brick and some of the bricks fell down; he said he could not allow me anything for it and if he removed it he must be paid for his man and horse and cart; in a few days Goddard told me that Mr. Dymock would buy it as he was going to build a wall, and he would allow me 4l. 10s. for it; I agreed to those terms and it was carried away; but circumstances did not admit of my making the alteration so soon as I intended; but I resided there six months; I was not applied to for rent, till I met the prosecutor in the road, and he asked if I could pay him, I said "Not at present;" he said I had better give him up the key if I could not make the alterations I intended, that he might let the house; I said if he would give me a little time I should be able to fulfil my promise - I never saw any one for five weeks afterwards; when I went home one night and knocked at the door, I found it had been broken open and a notice on it, which I took down and put into my pocket.</p>

On the 26th of May, between two and three o'clock, a young man going by stepped in the shop, I was at the back part of the shop; he asked me whether I had lost any lace from the door, I had lace pinned to some stuff at the door of the shop; upon my looking at the door, I missed the lace; I had seen the lace there ten minutes before; I had cut some off for a customer, and had pinned it up again. I followed Cooper immediately; she was alone when she took it, but she joined Brown in an alley at the back of my house.</p>

            . I live in Mitchell-street; I am an apprentice to Mr. Sherfleet, a cabinet maker. As I was coming down Sun-street, I saw a great many people going into Mr. Styles's shop; when I got to the pavement by Mr. Styles's door, I kicked my foot against something, which afterwards turned out to be lace; I took it into Mr. Styles's shop, and asked them if it was their lace, I gave it into Mr. Cooper's hands, he was in Mr. Styles's shop; he claimed the lace. The women were in Mr. Styles's shop when I went in; I know nothing of their taking it. Mr. Sapwell had the lace.</p>

            . I am a servant, I live near the Halfway house, Cottage-lane, I saw a mob of people. A young man took hold of Brown in Union-street, I followed her; I saw her drop the lace down, Mr. Baldero laid hold of the tall woman, Brown; he took her into Mr. Styles's shop, Brown had her hands in the pocket hole of her gown, I saw it drop from her clothes; this young man, Cox, was coming by, he picked it up just at Mr. Styles's door; I followed the young man into the shop. I saw Cox give that which he picked up to Mr. Cooper.</p>

               <p>Cox. At the time I picked up the lace, it was all in a lump.</p>

               <p>Cooper's Defence. I was going down Sun-street the same day I picked up this bit of lace, in the same manner is the boy said, when this gentleman to his shop I let it drop; I went into the wine vaults, I had a glass of peppermint; ever so many people followed me in. I never saw this woman to my knowledge before that day.</p>

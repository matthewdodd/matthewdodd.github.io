                  </hi>. I am the wife of James M'Kenzie, and live at No. 39, Cable-street, St. George's. On the 2nd of Sept I went and staid out with a friend—she wished me to stop all night—I did not wish to do so, and her servant saw me home—I asked if he would take a glass of some<lb></lb>thing, and we went into a public-house in Cable-street, which leads out of Rosemary-lane—there were two or three men there—I took my purse out to pay for what he had—I kept my purse in my hand; and whilst I was wishing the servant good night, the prisoner knocked me down, and got the purse out of my hand—I am quite sure, without looking at him, that he is the person that knocked me down—I am very sorry to see him in such a place—I had never seen him before—he was in the public-house, and saw my money in my purse—I cannot tell to a shilling what was in it—there were several shillings in it—I had just that moment bid the ser<lb></lb>vant good bye, and I said, "Oh, Sam, this person has got my purse;" and he ran after him directly—he hit me in the chest—I do not say that he hurt me—he merely knocked me down—he seized my purse—I got up, and shouted, "Stop thief"—Sam got hold of him—he flung the purse down—I did not see him do so—I know Sam picked it up—it was my purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fruit salesman, of 17, Broad-court, Bow-street. On Friday afternoon, 9th Aug., I had two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a cheek for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and nearly twenty sovereigns—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note wrapped up in a check, which I did not know of—the check and note have since heen brought to me—I went into the Mercers' Arms between five and six o'clock—I was sober—I called for some bitter ale, and sat down—the prisoner was there—another man, who I believe was with him, asked me if I knew anybody at Manchester—I said I did—after that I treated them and two women who were there to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin—I had none of it—I ordered a bottle of wine, which we had between four or five of us—the bottle passed round, I cannot say whether they all drank—I had had two glasses of bitter ale, and a portion of the wine—I have frequently drank as much without getting drunk—when I took my purse out to pay, toy notes and money were perfectly safe—I bad then been in the house about twenty minutes—the prisoner sat by me—I became insensible, and when I recovered I was at borne, and my money was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Little White Lion-street, Seren Diala. I was in the Mercers' Arms and saw Thwaites, who seemed very drunk, sitting between the prisoner and a young woman, who were both sober—the woman said, "You have lost a bottle of wine, now pay for it"—I went out and informed Mr. Thwaites' man—as I returned I saw the prisoner running down Long-acre, in a direction from the Mercers' Arms, and two young men with him—they got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the corner of James-street—Mr. Thwaites' man came up and stopped the horse—they got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and ran down King-street very fast.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Thwaites' service—my father is in partner<lb></lb>ship with him, and I superintend part of the business—on Friday morning, 9th Aug., I gave Mr. Thwaites two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—he put them into a canvas bag, and placed them in his pocket—about seven o'clock in the evening I received information from Harlow, and went towards the Mercers' Arms—before I reached there, I saw the prisoner and another man near him, and another a short distance behind, running or walking very fast—the prisoner and the one nearest to him passed me—one of them said, "Is the money all safe?" and the other answered, "Yes"—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was standing at the corner of Hart-street, into which they ran—Harlow ran up, and said something—I stopped the horse, and the men got out on the other side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I pur<lb></lb>sued the prisoner down King-street, through Short's-gardens, towards Endell-street—I beckoned to policeman 79, who followed the prisoner—I then went to the Mercers' Arms, and found Mr. Thwaites insensible, with his pockets turned inside out—he had no moneybut a sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Mereers' Arms. On 9th Aug. Mr. Thwaites came and called for a glass of pale ale—he afterwards called for some wine—I served him with it—I cannot say whether the prisoner was there—I have seen him there once or twice—Mr. Thwaites took a canvas bag out of his pocket, to pay for the wine, and I saw him put it back again into his left pocket—he gave me half-a-sovereign—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, which he put into his pocket—he became insensible, and I went and picked him up—his left pocket was a little out, the other appeared all right—I saw him searched—there was no bag, or money—the wine I served him with would certainly not produce the effect I saw.</p>

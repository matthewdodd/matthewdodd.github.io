On Sunday morning, the 4th of July, I was rather intoxicated, but not to say drunk; I spoke to the prisoner in Whitechapel - an acquaintance was very soon struck; we drank a glass of gin together, and then she proposed I should go home to a house in <placeName id="t18300708-192-crimeloc1089">Wentworth-street</placeName>

               <p>"I want a sovereign more;" the landlady said that she saw through the key-hole the prisoner take this money from my pocket, before I had been on the bed five minutes; the Policeman was sent for, and took the other sovereign from the prisoner's glove - she had positively denied having it; the Policeman took her.</p>
               <p>SARAH MCCALLISTER. I keep a lodging-house. I remember this man coming there and the prisoner; she asked me to let her a bed - they had not been there five minutes, before the policeman sent in, and said he thought the man had some money; I went and looked through the key-hole - I saw her picking the man's pocket - I saw both gold and silver taken from him; I went and fastened my door, and by the time I had done that she had got her bonnet and cloak on and was going out - I would not let her go till I had awoke the man to see what money he had; the three sovereigns she took from her bosom, and the 18s. 6d. from her pocket; he said he had four sovereigns; and she would not give it up till I went and got the Policeman - she denied having any more.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I was on duty early in the morning of last Sunday week: I saw the prosecutor, who appeared to me to be intoxicated, and the prisoner was with him - I saw them go to McCallister's house; I sent a person to tell the landlady to keep a sharp look out - I stood not far from the house; I was called in, and told she had done him - I found 3l. 18s. 6d. on the table; the man said there was another sovereign - the prisoner denied having any more; I searched her, and found this other sovereign in her glove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulterer in the Strand—I also deal in Welsh mutton. On Saturday afternoon, the 20th of March, between three and five o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and asked for some Welsh mutton for Mr. Tucker, of Long-acre, who is a customer of mine—my man weighed the mutton, and I made out the bill—it was 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner tendered this cheque, on the back of which was written "Richard Tucker, Long-acre"—I took it, and gave the prisoner the change—I put the cheque into the till with my other money, and paid it in to Messrs. Twinings, my bankers, on the Monday—it was returned in due course, saying, "No account"—I then went to Mr. Tucker's.</p>

I acted as guard to the Express coach on the journey up from Leeds, on Sunday, the 26th of November—I took the place of a man named Howard for that journey—the coach arrived at the Bull and Mouth about ten o'clock in the morning—it drove into the yard—I had a carpet bag with me which belonged to myself—I had received from the Yorkshire District Bank two parcels directed to</p>

               <p>Williams and Co., London, and another from another Bank addressed to Jones and Lloyd—I placed them in my own bag—when the coach armed in the yard I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> down and saw the passengers leave the coach—I had the bag in my hand when the passengers left, and then put it by the side of the coach-office window—a passenger came back to ask for a parcel he had left which had been taken into the coach-office—I then laid my bag down by the coach-office window, and went in to fetch the parcel—I was hardly gone a moment, and when I came back my bag was gone—I saw the prisoner going out the back way of the Bull-and-Mouth with my bag under his arm—that would lead him into Bull-and-Mouth-street—he had a Macintosh cape which covered the bag—he had got about five yards from the coach-office door—I followed and stopped him, and said, "What are you going to do with that carpet bag? that is my carpet bag"—he said a gentleman had ordered him to take it to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I took him into the office—I then said he was a vagabond for taking my bag—he said I was too harsh with him, he had merely taken the bag out of a mistake—a policeman was sent for, who came and took him into custody—he was dressed in a surtout coat, black waistcoast, and had a gold chain round his neck—he had quite the appearance of a gentleman—this it the bag—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the covers of the parcel are now in it—there was no name or address on the bag.</p>

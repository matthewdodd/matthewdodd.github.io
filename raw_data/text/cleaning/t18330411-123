            . The prisoner took a house of me in June last, from year to year: I have an agreement for it - there were fixtures in the house, the use of which was included in the rent; there was no sale of any fixtures to him; they remained my property, and no one had any right to remove them - the prisoner occupied the house for a little more than half a year; he professed a general sort of business, such as <rs id="t18330411-123-deflabel684" type="occupation">brokering and appraising</rs>

            . I am a broker, and live in Wells-street, Somers'-town. On the 20th of March the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I was at home; I was not - I went to No. 15, <placeName id="t18330411-123-crimeloc685">Milton-street</placeName>

               <p>JOHN NICHOLS. I took the stove to the last witness by the prisoner's direction, and I took one of them to my own house, where it was to be left till he came to tell me where to take it - I waited two hours; he did not come - I went back again, and there was no one at the house; the officer took the stove the next day.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PRICE (Police-constable S 21). I stopped two of the stoves coming out of the street; I found one at the broker's, and one at the last witness'.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at High-street; that I had taken a door and two stoves; there were two stoves taken off the premises - since I have been in prison they got in and took two others; I certainly wrote a note to the prosecutor, but changed my mind.</p>

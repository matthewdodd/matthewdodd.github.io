Three boys came round me, making a noise like a parcel of dogs, they lifted up the lid of the basket, and took one 5 s. paper out, which was tied up in brown paper; another boy took the other; I did not see who took them, but am sure the prisoners are two of the boys - the other boy was taller. Rose and the tall boy ran down Houndsditch, and I called out Stop thief! My mistress caught the prisoner, tore his coat, and took him into a clothes shop - the officer found a few halfpence on him; I saw Rose at the Mansion-house the next day, and am sure he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, ADOLPHUS. Q. Rose was looking in at the Mansion-house window next day, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130026"></xptr>was brought in - A. Yes, and I said he was the boy, who took the first paper. They went away, returned, and then took the other; I do not know that Rose was one of the three who took the halfpence - I saw him before they were taken.</p>

As soon as I came out of my house, which is about two hundred yards from Houndsditch, some boys hustled me - I will not be certain that the prisoners were then among them. When we were in Houndsditch they hustled me again, I turned round, and saw the prisoner take the printed paper of halfpence out of the basket, and give it to another boy, whom I do not know; I seized the prisoner, and never let him go until I had given him in charge - I think Rose was one of the party.</p>

               <p>"My dear, will you go on an errand for me to the corner, to Mrs. Brown's, my sister." I said I would go for her. She kept on walking with me, and when she got down the street, she met a little girl, and asked her if she had 2 d. to give me to go on the errand. She said she had; and the prisoner said I should have it when I came from her sister's; that I must go up stairs; but I must not carry the bundle, or her sister's husband would think it was some of his clothes, and keep it. She said,</p>
               <p>"I will hold your bundle." I said No. She then said,</p>
               <p>"Let the boy have his own way, and go with his bundle." I went up two or three stairs of the house; she pointed out, that I was to go to the first landing; she stood outside, as she said she did not want her sister's husband to know she was there. I went up two or three stairs, then the prisoner came behind me, and snatched the bundle away, and said she would hide round the corner. I ran after her, crying Stop thief! and in the market, a gentleman ran and caught the little girl. I am sure the prisoner snatched it from me. She was taken that afternoon. I saw her at the watch-house, and am sure of her.</p>

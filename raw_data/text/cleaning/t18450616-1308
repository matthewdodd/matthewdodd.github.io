                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Thomas Oliver. We live in Gloucester-street, Hackney-road—it is our dwelling-house—I am a laun<lb></lb>dress—I had several table-cloths and other things to wash—one of the table-cloths was worth twelve guineas—I do not know whether I shall have to make it good—the lady has not yet come to any settlement about it—Dimond was employed by me, and was ironing in the room where I dried my clothes—she was there on the 1st of May—Savage came that day</p>

                  </hi>. I work with Mrs. Oliver. I recollect, on the 1st of May, seeing my mistress's table-cloth safe on the corner of the dresser, about a quarter of an hour before dinner, and I missed it after dinner—Dimond was there then—I saw her pull off her petticoat, and put it on several times just after tea, and she went in and out of the parlour several times while Mrs. Oliver was in the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner Dimond hired a room at my house, and Savage was with her—Dimond owed me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on Thursday night, the 1st of May, when she came in I told the girl to go and ask her if she had got I any money for me—I heard Dimond say she had only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., what could she do with that—on the Friday morning Savage went out, and when she re<lb></lb>turned I let her in—she had a large white bundle with her—what it was I do not know—a little while after Dimond and Savage both went out, and I when they came in Dimond gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left.</p>

                  </hi>. My wife takes in mangling. On the morning of the 2nd of May, Savage came to my house, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, with a very large and beautiful table-doth—she asked me to mangle it—I put it on the table on one side—she said it belonged to the Jews, and she wanted it done as quickly as possible.</p>

                  </hi>. I mangled the table-cloth—it was a very large one, and very fine and good—I never had so valuable a thing myself—I was out when it came, and when I came in my husband said, "Mrs. Dimond's servant has just brought this, she wants it in a great hurry"—I mangled it soon after, and she had it—it was about six yards long, and as near the pattern of the napkin now produced as could be, and as fine.</p>

On the 11th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I saw one of the prisoners crossing the road; he had the cask of butter on his shoulder. I went up to him, and asked him what he had got there; he said he did not know; he then said he was going to take it to Mr. Clark's; I asked him who Mr. Clark was; he said he did not know. The watchman came and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

On the 11th of July, about half an hour after nine at night, I saw the prisoners under Mr. Ainsley's window; I saw they had a tub of butter; I saw Williams lift it into Edwards's arms; I hallooed out, who stole the firkin of butter. My brother was with me; he went into the shop and informed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see the prisoners - A. Two or three days afterwards I saw them at the office; I knew them again. I was not a yard off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140035"></xptr>them. It was a dark night. I saw them by the light of Mr. Ainsley's window.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Ainsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of this firkin of butter - A. About ten minutes before this firkin of butter was taken I saw Edwards in the shop bargaining about some pieces of bacon; he did not buy any. When the alarm was given we looked about; and missed the firkin of butter. It stood behind the door.</p>
               <p>ANN BARRETT. I am an unfortunate woman. On the 11th of July, I was in company with Edwards and Williams at the City of Carlisle in Rosemary-lane; we had a pot of stout there. It might be nine o'clock. Between nine and ten the robbery was done. Edwards asked Williams and me to go out to Ratcliffe-highway. Edwards went into this shop; he looked at two pieces of bacon. Edwards asked Williams to go into this shop to buy a relish for supper; I went in; he looked at many pieces of bacon; he had one piece weighed; he bought none. That is all I have to say.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS JACKSON. I am an officer. When I took Edwards into custody he said he had the firkin of butter of a man, he was to give him a shilling for carrying it. The next morning he said he would tell me the man, if I would go after him. I went after Williams. I brought Williams to the office; he then declared Williams was the man that gave him the butter; Williams denied it. I produce the firkin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my firkin.</p>
               <p>Edwards's Defence. When I came out of Mr. Ainsley's shop a tall man said to me. will you earn a shilling; I said, yes; he put the tub of butter on my shoulder. I told the patrol when he laid hold of me, a tall fellow gave me the butter.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. I am an innocent man. I know nothing about the butter, so help me God Almighty.</p>

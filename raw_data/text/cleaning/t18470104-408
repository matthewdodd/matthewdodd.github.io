                  </hi> I am chief clerk to Mr. James Sharpe Giles—he has no partner. The prisoner has been in his employ about eight years—he was a clerk under me—it was part of his duty to collect money from cus<lb></lb>tomers—this is what we call our long-book, used at market, containing the original entries of what sales are made on the particular dates—I find on the 5th of Oct. a sale to Aste, 626<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 7th of Oct., 718<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those sums became payable at two months after the sales—it was the prisoner's duty to collect them—he kept the book produced for that purpose—it is his collecting-book—it is his duty to make it out from the market-book—to copy it from the market-book—here is no entry in the col<lb></lb>lecting-book, on the 5th of Oct., of Mr. Aste's transaction—his name is not mentioned—on the 12th he has an entry, 626<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as if the sale took place on that day—there is no entry whatever on the 7th—there is no entry of the 718<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on the 7th, and that is not in the book at all—here is another book, which we call the market cash-book, containing the various sums received from the different buyers on the different dates stated, togehter with the trans<lb></lb>actions to which it refers—whoever received money at market would give it to the prisoner, and before he went to the banker's, in the afternoon, he would enter the various sums, which is done by putting the checks on the City banker's in an alphabetical list, first casting them up, and then entering the amounts, making the exact amount received—it was his duty to enter all sums he received on account of Mr. Giles—the other clerks who received would enter in this book, and give the money to the prisoner—there are several handwritings in it—the prisoner would see that he had the money, and write on the opposite page the different kinds of money of which it was com<lb></lb>posed, checks, notes, or cash—he ought to enter on the credit side of the book the sum paid into the banker's—I find no entry of 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Kirton, neither the name nor amount—the entries of the day, except two, are in the prisoner's writing—the discharge on the other side is his writing—he paid into the bank that day 1, 508<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here is another amount afterwards of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from James Ford, after making up the cash for the day, and it was paid into the banker's—Kirton's name does not appear, nor does any cor<lb></lb>responding amount of 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. appear to have been received in any way what<lb></lb>ever—I find no entry in the cash account, on the 4th Dec., on the side where he enters what he has received, of the amount of 626<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Aste, neither the amount nor name—on the discharge side I find an entry of a check on Spooner's of 599<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that indicates that he has carried to Smith and Payen's a check on Spooner's for that amount—I find no entry in the cash account of the 7th of Dec. of 718<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Aste, neither name</p>

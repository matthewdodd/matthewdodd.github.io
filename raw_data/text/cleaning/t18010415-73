             sworn. - I am a labouring man; I was calling the hour between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, in High-street, Mary-bonne, I detected the prisoner with the pump upon the shoulder; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me he was going to the plumber's in East-street; I had a foul suspicion of him, and I charged another watchman with him; he went past the plumber's, and chucked the pump down; he ran away; I am sure the man who was brought back was the same man.</p>
               <p>Another Watchman sworn. - I saw the prisoner; I asked him where he got the pump, and he told me from Mr. Woollet's, a cow-keeper; he said, he was going to take it to the plumber's, in East-street; he went past the plumber's, threw down the lead, and ran away; he ran about a quarter of a mile; I pursued him, and he hid himself in a trench in a garden; when I got close to him, he got up and ran away; a gentleman's coachman stopped him, I am sure he is the same man.</p>

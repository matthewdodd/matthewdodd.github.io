            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Bear-street, heard the cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw the prisoner, Ray, running, and the prosecutor pursuing him, calling Stop thief! I seized him, we struggled, and both fell - I held him, and gave him in charge. He was the only person that I saw running - He was running exceedingly fast, and tried to rescue himself from me.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS RHIND. I am a tailor. I was crossing Bear-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw Ray running at the end of the street into the square. White seized him both fell in the scuffle. I ran up, and held him down till he was secured. I saw the prisoner, Edwards, and another man, forcing their way through the crowd. Edwards came up to the prisoner, Ray, took off his hat, and said, "Give it to me!" I looked down, heard the watch jingle in his hat, and seized his hand with the watch in it. Somebody said,"Start!" he said, "I cannot." I took him down Bear-street. Taylor came up and held his hands - A scuffle ensued, and in the scuffle he dropped the watch, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Edwards receive the watch from Ray in his hat-Yes.</p>

            . I am a mariner. I was coming down Rider's-court, into Cranbourn-street, saw a crowd, and heard them say, "Mind he don't throw it away." I was just before Edwards, nearly opposite the end of the passage. I saw him stop to look back, and throw the watch away. I picked it up, and said, "I have got it." I took it into Mr. Taylor's shop, and gave it to him. After I picked it up it was snatched at twice.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What does an oath oblige you to do? - A. To say nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home on the 23d of November? - A. Yes; my father is a haberdasher and milliner: About half past six o'clock, the officer of the street came and asked me whether we had missed any thing out of the shop, it was quite dark; I looked, and found that the window of the shop was cut; I told him what was taken away; the street-keeper produced a handkerchief, which he opened, and shewed me the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been taken from your shop? - A. About fourteen yards of flannel, two silk handkerchiefs, and thirteen pair of gloves; they all lay in the window against the pane which was cut; I had put them there myself in the morning; the pane was not intirely taken out; the hole was large enough for any man to put his arm in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person draw fourteen yards of flannel through there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the glass appear to be cut - by a diamond, or broken? - A. The street-keeper found an instrument on the person that cut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar; had you seen him near your shop that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your shop-door shut at the time the street-keeper came to you? - A. It was.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of the Minories: Between six and seven o'clock on the 23d of November, it was dark; I saw the prisoner at the bar looking in at the right hand windows of Mr. Glanville; he went from there to the left hand window, there is a door in the centre; he stood there for the space of a minute, and he retreated up a court, called New-court; I crossed over the way, and I felt the window where he had been standing, and I found the glass taken out; I walked away, and he came to the same situation again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear to be any vacancy from the opening? - A. The things that were behind had fallen against it, so that the place was blocked up; I walked away, and he returned again; he took his observations, and went to the same place after the space of a minute; he looked about him, and looked in the other window of the shop; he then went to the place where the glass had been taken out, for the space of a minute, and then retreated into the court again; I stood still, and he retreated backward and forward to the window, and up the court, four or five times; I kept my eye on him; I crossed over the way, and I laid hold of him; I saw his pockets stick out, and I said, my lad, what have you got here; he said, nothing at all; he put his hand to his pocket to throw them down, but I kept his hands up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to throw them down? - A. He did, but I kept him from that; I took him across the way into Mr. Price's shop, the shoemaker, and there I searched him, and found upon him thirteen pair of men's and women's gloves; I found nothing else on his person. After I secured him, I went back to Mr. Glanville's, and informed them; then I went into Vine-street, that leads out from New-court, and there I found this roll of flannel, and two silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were watching this man, did you observe any body else go up in the direction of New-court? - A. No, I saw not any person with him; I found these things hid behind a truck, standing up against a wall; I then took the prisoner to the watch-house, and on searching the prisoner I found a knife; I have been a patrol for these five years; I produce the knife; the knife is for that purpose, to work the putty round the mouldings, and the glass flies in all directions.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observed at the time you were watching the prisoner, have you any reason to believe that he saw you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched him, and found this upon him, did he say any thing for himself? - A. He said so far as this, it is all over with me.</p>
               <p>(The articles produced, and identified by the prosecutor and his son.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Every thing that man has said against me is false; I was coming from Wapping, and coming down the Minories I saw those gloves laying on the ground, and I knocked at the door to see if the gloves belonged to the person of the house, where I picked them up; he came to me, and said, what are you doing; I said, I have been doing nothing at all; he said, come along with me, and he took me over the way into a shoe-shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050006"></xptr>Q.(To Forrester.) Was the prisoner knocking at any door when you saw him? - A. No, he was going to the same spot again.</p>

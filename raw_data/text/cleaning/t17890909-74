               <p>When you took your nine guinea note out had you any thing else in your pocketbook of any importance? - Yes, I had a note of 78 l. 15 s.</p>

               <p>What was the sum for which it was drawn? - It was in the face of it 78 l. 15 s.</p>

               <p>When was it dated? - February 1789, but I cannot positively say what day.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whom it was drawn upon? - It was payable to myself, and was due in three months.</p>
               <p>Had it been paid, as I see it is over due? - The principal part was.</p>
               <p>How can you say with certainty, that you saw it, when you was at the bankers? - I know I put it in when I came from home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090086"></xptr>as I thought I might see the man who drew it.</p>
               <p>When did you come from home? - On Monday, the 10th of August, I came from Guildford.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered your note, or pocket-book since? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any notion, positively, to the time you missed it? - I am not positive to five or ten minutes, either before or after.</p>
               <p>Did any thing happen to you, coming to St. Paul's from the bankers, that would lead you to suppose where it was taken from you? - I rather thought once, I was jostled as I was passing through <placeName id="t17890909-74-crimeloc374">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Then, it was not any thing at that time, that induced you to look whether your pocket-book was gone? - I did not that very moment; but a minute or two afterwards, I did.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen your pocket-book since? - Yes, at the publick office in Bow-street; I received a letter from the publick office, and came up from Guildford.</p>
               <p>How long might that be after you lost it? - Ten days or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>When you saw your pocket-book, was it open or empty? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who put it into your hands there? - Mr. Shallard.</p>
               <p>What was in it? - This promissory note was in it.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to think, from the appearance of the note, the date of it, and the hand writing, that it is your note? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Do you know, whether after you lost it, any attempt was made to procure payment? - I do not know there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. You know Benjamin Caseltine? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it you lost your note? - On the 11th of August; on a Tuesday, as I was coming from my bankers.</p>
               <p>A great many people were passing at that time of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you was at the bankers, you pulled out your pocket-book with the nine guinea note; there were other notes in it? - There were.</p>
               <p>On going from Mr. Harrison's, you felt somebody jostle you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If it had been the prisoner, perhaps you would have known who jostled you; you knew the prisoner before? - No, I never knew the man in my life.</p>
               <p>If you had seen him before, you must have known him? - I know nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Part of this note is paid? - I have received the whole of it since; I had received seventy pounds before I had lost it; and when I lost it, there was eight pounds fifteen shillings unpaid, which I have received since.</p>
               <p>Now, you do not know what date the note bears? - It was dated in February, but I cannot be positive to the day.</p>
               <p>Though you put it into your pocket-book in the morning, you cannot ascertain what date it bears? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Caseltine? - Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Where did you get your pocket-book? - In Bow-street.</p>
               <p>When Shallard gave you the pocketbook in Bow-street, what was in it? - I have not examined every thing in it; there was a note for seventy-eight pounds, fifteen shillings, in it.</p>
               <p>Has there any thing passed between you and the prisoner, in Newgate? - I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>Any letter? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Did you send any body to the prisoner ever? - No person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the Court, that as the indictment stated the value of the note being seventy-eight pounds, fifteen shillings; and at the time of the loss, seventy pounds had been received on the note by the prosecutor; and the real value of the note being then but eight pounds fifteen shillings, the Court could not proceed on the trial on that part of the indictment, which was granted; and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090087"></xptr>prisoner was only after this, tried on the pocket-book, value one shilling.</p>

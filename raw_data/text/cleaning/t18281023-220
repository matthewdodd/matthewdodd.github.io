            . I am the wife of Thomas Lewis, and live in Grange-road, Bermondsey. I have a little daughter named Jane Amelia. On the 12th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning (I had been confined for three weeks), I sent her to take these things to the mangler's, about one hundred yards from my house - there were all the articles stated in the indictment in a towel; a person came and told me my daughter was in fits in the street, and the bundle taken from her by a man; I took the officer, and found the prisoner in his own room, about four o'clock - a person went to show us the place; one of the shirts was on the prisoner's back - we found some of the articles in a corner of the room, and two duplicates were given us by a woman he cohabits with; he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am nine years of age; my mother gave me the bundle to take to the mangler's: I met the prisoner, who asked me to get him 6d. worth of trotters, and said he would give me a halfpenny - he gave me the money to pay for them; he took the bundle, and put it into his basket - I went for the trotters, and when I came back he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q, Did you go to a shop? A. Yes; I was not to meet him at a public-house - he said he would be standing till I came back; I was not gone above five minutes - it was only just over the way; I am sure he is the man; I did not ask him to hold it - he took it; I said I would take it home first; I inquired for him at the public-house when I came back, but he was not there; I saw him again at half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mrs. Lewis gave me information, and I went with her to the prisoner's lodgings, in Frying-pan-alley, a little after four o'clock - he had just come home; I asked if his name was Seabrook - he said No; I called in the child, who said he was the man - he had this shirt on his back, and his coat was on a nail; I found his basket in the room; a woman in the room gave me two duplicates, and I found a shift, a napkin, and pillow-case.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he offer to hand you over some money, which he said he got for the things? A. No; I took some money out of his pocket; he pulled this shirt off himself, and said he was sorry for what he had done, and hoped he should be forgiven - he did not say he was kept waiting almost all day.</p>

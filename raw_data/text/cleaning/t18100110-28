               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Arabin.</p>
               <p>EVERARD DENTON. I keep a public house, next door to Messrs. Nash; my cellar is separated from the next door by a partition. On the 19th of December between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoner came, and said, he wanted two parcels, I told him, I did not know any thing of any parcels, he said, he gave them to my man John; John came in, I asked him if he had received any parcel, he said, no, I called three more, they all denied receiving any parcel; he then said, if you will let me have a candle, I can tell you where they are in the cellar. Daniel, the boy that is here, lit a candle, and went down in the cellar along with the prisoner; the prisoner returned, and they brought up two parcels with them from off the butthead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open these two parcels. - A. No; I said, go to Mr. Nash, the officer went with him. I had been in the cellar, about six or seven o'clock in the morning; and after that I had been in the cellar fining the beer down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any hole cut in the partition of that cellar. - A. None at all, I went down into the cellar again, when Mr. Nash came, I found a hole cut in the partition that was not there in the morning.</p>
               <p>

            . Q. You live with the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your master's house on the 29th. - A. I heard him talking with my young mistress, about some parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he entrusted you with any parcels. - A. No; I am certain of that, I went into the cellar with him, he shewed me where the parcels were; they were upon the head of a butt, close to a hole in the partition, the hole was large enough to admit these parcels to pass through it. I could get through the hole myself. He brought the parcels up himself; I saw them opened when Mr. Nash came, they contained glass, I went down in the cellar again, when Mr. Nash came I perceived a hole cut in the partition that was not there in the morning.</p>

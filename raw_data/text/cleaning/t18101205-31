I repaired to the house, I observed the scutcheon was wrenched off the key-hole of the street door, by which means the lock was picked. There were missing, three feather-beds, eight blankets, two counterpanes, a quilt, three curtains of a four-posts bed, and a Brussells carpet. The drawing room curtain were cut off with a knife, as high as a man could reach, and they were gone. I have seen some of the property since at the watchhouse.</p>

Yes, in two nights after I did, in Drury Lane, I told him I apprehended him concerning the bundle he brought into No. 10 Short's Gardens. I took him to St. Giles's watch-house. At Marlborough Street office, the prisoner owned to every thing.</p>

               <p>Q. What are these articles worth. - A. The blankets and two beds are worth at least 10 l. I could not replace them for that. I am certain they are my property.</p>
               <p>Robinson's Defence. I was brought innocently into it, I did not know what was in the bundle. I was having a pint of beer in the night at a public house, a young man came in and said my brother wants to see you, I said, what does he want, he said he did not know, go and see. I went up with him, he said he would make a fire, you sit and bear me company a bit, will you fetch me a pot of beer and two pipes of tobacco. I fetched it, up came his brother between 12 and 1 o'clock, we stopped there till half after four, and then we went out. I said, what are you going upon, he said, no matter to you. I thought if it was no harm I would go. We then went into the Edgware Road, and from there we went into Oxford Street, to a public house. They gave me a pint of purl, in came a man, he gave me the bundle, he did not tell me where to take it to.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. On the morning of the 8th of November, I was in bed with my husband, I heard some person call my husband, he spoke to him, and when he came in, he asked him to let him leave a bed for a few hours, he said he was seized upon by his landlord. I did not approve of it, my husband and me had a few words, I was angry with him. He went out to find the man that brought the bed, and the watchman came in and found the things.</p>

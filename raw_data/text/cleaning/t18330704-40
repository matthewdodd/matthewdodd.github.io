               <p>JOHN GLENTON ATKINSON. I live at Peterborough. On the 1st of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was walking down <placeName id="t18330704-40-crimeloc207">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How did you first miss your handkerchief, did you see me take it? A. I happened to turn my head round, and saw you waving something - I did not go up to my father and tell him, I ran after you and caught you - I took you first; I did not see you drop the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask me to tell you the truth whether I took it or not? A. No; I told you not to get away when you scuffled - I did not say I would try to transport you.</p>

             (police-constable G 28). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Indictments here - I know the prisoner, and was present in April, 1832, when he was tried and convicted; he is the person mentioned in the certificate - (read) - I know him to be the man; I was not a witness on the case, but I had taken him on the charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The facts are as follow. On Saturday, the 1st of June last, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was walking in Holborn towards the City, and when near Leather-lane, and about to pass two gentlemen, one of them (the prosecutor) turned round, and feeling his pocket, accused me of taking his handkerchief; this I desied, and fearful I should be brought into trouble innocently, I attempted to make my escape and ran across the road, the prosecutor raising a cry of Stop thief, I was caught and taken to the watch-house.</p>

On the 18th of April, I was calling five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner lurking about Frances-street; I suspected him. I called the hour twice round Thorhnaugh-street, returned to Frances-street, and missed him; I went in search of him, and found him coming out of Frances-place, with the property on his back. I said, "Is this the way you conceal things until the watchmen are gone off duty?" he said he was going to take them to a broker to have them repaired. The wash-hand stand being broken, I thought it might be as he said, and told him I would go with him to the shop. He staid at the door while I rang the bell twice; as I rang it a third time he ran away. I pursued, and took him, with assistance, in Montague-market. I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Chertsey. My farm adjoins Mr. Spronston's, it is all round it nearly—I have seen his yellow-red cow many times—I think it was about four years old—I have seen it from a calf—on the 20th of October, I and my son were going to Kensington with a horse and cart and goods—we were at a place called the High-bridge at Littleton—I there saw the prisoner, and another man, with three cows—I knew the prisoner before—it was about twelve o'clock at night—they were driving them as fast as the cows could run nearly, from Chertsey towards town—they passed us, I ran after them, and overtook them as near as I could, to see if I could see the second man—I am sure the prisoner was one of them—I knew one of these cows to be Mr. Spronston's—I had seen it a great many times—there is no probability of being mistaken—it was a very bright moonlight night—I had known the prisoner from a child.</p>

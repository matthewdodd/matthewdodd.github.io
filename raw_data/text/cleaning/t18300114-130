On the 29th of December I went to a sale at the Two Mariners; while I was there the prisoner, whom I knew before, came over - the sale did not come on; I left at three o'clock, and went with the prisoner to No. 8, Vinegar-lane; I had been there many times before - I was not tipsy; I went with a young man who had been at the sale, and there were several persons there; we sent for some ale, and entered into conversation for the remainder of the afternoon - during that time the young man, the person who lived up stairs, the prisoner, and I got quite jolly: I went with the prisoner to another public-house, and in returning my foot stumbled, I fell, it being slippery, and knocked my head against the wall of the house - I then lost sight of the prisoner; I had been sitting on the sofa with her in the afternoon - she had been kissing me, and attempting to put her hand into my pocket; Richard Price, an acquaintance of mine, came up and helped me; the prisoner and I had been about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards towards the Back-road - I had not my watch when I fell; I went with Price to the prisoner's house - she was not there, but another female was; in consequence of what the other female said, Price went out and returned with Mr. Fell - when they came, the prisoner came into the room and laid on the sofa - I was sitting by her; Price and Fell saw her hand in a situation it had been before -I did not see her do any thing; neither of them said any thing to her about my watch that I recollect - I was stunned by the blow; the officer has the watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see your watch before you lost it? A.About four o'clock; the prisoner was present then - I can swear that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you? A. A carpenter. I knew the prisoner first in the middle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140068"></xptr>of 1825 - I was on the same terms with her that any man would be with a prostitute; I am married - my wife did not find out this till after I had the prisoner at thie Police-office - I told her of it myself; I had had some she rry and ale in the morning - I went with the prisoner about three o'clock - I saw Mr. Price about six o'clock; I was in a stupor from the fall - the liquor might have a little effect on me - I was not in a state of perfect drunkenness; what money I trusted the prisoner with I gave her - I never gave her a 10l. note - I never had one in her house in my life; I saw her perhaps six times in 1805, and not again for two years - I saw her perhaps six times afterwards; I did not find that she had got married - I had seen her the night before; I recollect having the watch, and missing it after I fell; I was at another house about one o'clock in the day, and a young man wound up my watch, as it was down, but that was not at the prisoner's - I took it out at her house to lend the young man my key; Price went for an officer, and I was sitting upright on the sofa when he came back; I did not speak to the prisoner - she was lying behind me; I had missed my watch and my money, and told Price who I suspected had taken it, and while he was gone, she came in, laid herself down, and was wanting to put her hand in my pocket; I was sitting by her when the officer came, but I was stunned; I was hardly capable of speaking - I do not recollect that I spoke to any one.</p>
               <p>RICHARD PRICE. I am a builder, and live in Ratliff-highway, near Vinegar-lane. I found the prosecutor on the pavement and picked him up: he appeared to be quite stunned by the fall - he said he had lost his watch and money at No. 8, Vinegar-lane; I went there, but did not see the prisoner - I saw a female, and in consequence of what she said I went for an officer: I was sober - when I went out I saw Fell and his wife; I knew Fell and sent him for an officer - I went to the prisoner's house, and stood at the door till Fell and the watchman came; we then went into the parlour, and saw the prisoner lying at full length on the sofa behind the prosecutor, who was sitting up and appeared quite in a stupor: I did not hear any thing said to the prisoner by any one, but I gave charge of her to the watchman for robbing my friend of his watch and money- I am sure I mentioned the watch; the prisoner ran to the fire-place, took up the poker, and struck me in several places - she struck me in the small of the back with a three-legged stool, and followed me some distance out of the house; I did not hear her say any thing about the watch - she was taken by the watchman and some others to the watch-house - she might have said something about the watch without my hearing it, while she was hammering about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prosecutor before he was on the ground? A. No, not for several days- I did not consider him drunk; he told me very sensibly and clearly, that he had lost his watch - he was three or four yards from the door: I did not see that he was bleeding - when the watchman came the prosecutor was sitting on a sofa; he did not attempt to put his hand into the prisoner's bosom in my sight - I did not hear her say,"I have the man's watch, and I will give it to no one but him, when he is sober."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell the same story he has to-day? A. Yes, it varies very little indeed.</p>

             FELL. I am a glazier. I was passing with my wife; Price came and spoke to me - I got a watchman, went to the house, and Price gave charge of the prisoner for taking the watch and money; she made no reply, but got the poker and began to hit Price - I heard her say out of doors, that she had the watch and would give it to no one but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q.Then she did admit that she had it? A. Yes, in the street; I cannot say that she had been out of the house and returned - I cannot say she was sober.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am watch-house-keeper; the prisoner was brought in custody of the two last witnesses, and a watchman - the prosecutor was not there at the time; it was stated that she had robbed a gentleman of his watch and some money; I asked her for the watch - she said she had not got it, and should not give any answer; I went to search her, and from some part of her person she took the watch - I forced it out of her hand; I found on her 19s. in silver, and 4 1/2d. in copper - I was sober and am positive she denied having the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did either of the witnesses tell you she had acknowledged having it in the street? A. No; when I said, "I must search you, where is this watch?" she said, "I have got no watch;" she afterwards took it from some part of her person, and it was in her hand - Fell and Price both appeared in a state of alarm, and said they never saw such a violent woman.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES HAVARD. Q. What did you lose? A. A silver watch, a sovereign, and, I think, 3s., but I will not be positive - I told Price I had lost a watch and a sovereign.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You say there were several persons in the room? A. There was a woman who lodges there, Fletcher, a (man who associates with her) a young man who was in possession at the Two Mariners, the prisoner, and myself - none of them are here; I returned to the house after I missed the watch, and the prisoner was not there - I do not know whether she could have got rid of the watch; she had not been out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the other woman tell you who had the watch? A. Yes; I would not bring such a woman as that here - her evidence would not be believed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gentleman gave his watch into my hand at three o'clock, to wind Mr. Fletcher's watch up, as it was down, and his own key would not do: he said, "This person drew up mine last night, and perhaps she can yours" - I bit the key and made it do; I returned the prosecutor his watch - my lodger then said, "Will you lend me 5s.?" he said, "I have but 3s., will that do?" she said No - he pulled out a sovereign; I went out, got change, and brought in half a gallon of ale, and 1s. worth of gin - they drank it, and then the others went up stairs; I was going out, and said to the prosecutor, "You had better give me your watch to take care of, I don't know who may come in;" he laid on the sofa, and my washerwoman put two pillows under his head - when I returned we drank again, and he asked me for the change; I said, "You slept with me last night, and I think there is not a great deal due to you" -I wanted him to go home to his wife, but he would not as he was jealous of the other man, and he said he would not do it - he knows he took me out of life, and first drew me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140069"></xptr>aside; I was acquainted with him four years before; I knew he had a wife - I then went to sea with a captain who was single; the prosecutor found me out twelve months afterwards, and used to come and drink with my husband, and told him I used to live with him - my husband got very suspicious of him, and used to ill-use me; I put my husband twice into the watch-house - I could not keep the prosecutor away; he dined with me on Christmas-day, and the next day he beckoned me over to the Two Mariners -I went there, and had a glass of brandy; then he came to my house, and drank till three o'clock - he gave me the watch and sovereign.</p>

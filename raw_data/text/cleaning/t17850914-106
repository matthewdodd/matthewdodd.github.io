               <p>What man was that that was at your house, when the other witness came? - I cannot pretend to say who it was that might come there, I was present at the time, there was a man that came to buy a pound of old nails, and I sold him some for two pence halfpenny, but who he was, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Foxhead. Who did you see there? - I saw the man that was with this man, I am pretty sure it was him that was in Mr. Laney's back kitchen, he turned his back; and I said to him in the presence of Mr. Laney, young man, you was with them, but I have not taken you.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know either of them? A. Yes - I am quite certain I should; it was a silk handkerchief, and worth 2s. 6d.; his companions went off; he was never out of my sight, till I gave him in charge of the watchman - I saw the handkerchief in his hand - I had used it two minutes before - I am certain his hand was in my pocket.</p>

             (Police-constable K 25). On the Friday night after this robbery, I saw the prosecutor, and heard of his loss, and on the Sunday morning, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner driving in a cab along the highway; she inquired for the White Swan, which was not open, but the Ship and Shears was, and she went there - I watched her, and saw her treating some persons out of the cab; she then went into the Ship and Shears, and was offering every body gin, or what they liked to take - I went up to her, and asked if she had any money; she answered rather vague - I saw her put her hand into her pocket, and put it down by her side; I took hold of her hand, and found in it thirteen sovereigns, 7s., and some halfpence, and in her pocket I found three half-crowns; I asked where she got it, but she was too drunk to tell - I took her to the watch-house; I asked her next morning where she had got it: she said a captain had given her 5l., and the rest she had saved up - I said hers must be a very good trade; she then said that two homeward bound seaman, had given her some - I found on her this bag, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

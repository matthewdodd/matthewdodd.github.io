               <p>Q. What is Mr. Jupp - A. A haberdasher; he had been a customer in a house in which I had been a partner recently. I was perfectly known to Mr. Jupp. He said, that he was sent for a piece of black twilled sarcenet; he afterwards stated that he wanted a shot sarcenet, and produced a pattern of a coloured shot sarcenet; he had accordingly fifteen yards and a half cut off the piece, that was about three pounds twelve shillings and four-pence. He had a whole piece of black twilled sarcenet. In the afternoon of that day he brought back the piece, stating that only thirty-five yards and a half were wanting of it; the thirty-five yards and a half were cut off; the amount of that is eleven pounds and odd; he took it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner before, did you - A. His person was familiar to me; he lived in the neighboured; I had no reason to doubt at that moment but that he came from the person as stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive the value for these - A. Not a farthing; I neither got the property or the value; I was totally defrauded of them all.</p>

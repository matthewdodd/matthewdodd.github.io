             (police-constable). I was on duty near the Duke of Wellington's, and from information, I went down Constitution-hill, and overtook the prisoner with this bundle under his arm - I asked how he came by it; he said, a boy gave it him to hold; I asked him what he wanted there, and he said, he thought the boy went that way, and he was running after him.</p>
               <p>RALPH DEAN. I was standing talking to James Bastin, and he left me to go on with the clothes; I then saw the prisoner pass me and tap him on the shoulder, to go with him down the hill; the prisoner had a watch-guard in his hand; he sat down, and the boy gave him the bundle, and went off towards the Barrack's - I was talking to a pieman, and I saw the prisoner get up and come towards the Green-park, he then turned and ran off, and I told the policeman of it.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH BASTIN. This is the property of Mr. Henbrey.</p>

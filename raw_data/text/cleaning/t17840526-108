               <p>On the 5th of May, in the morning, just after three o'clock, I was in Tottenham-court-road,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260126"></xptr> and from information I went to a door of a coal vault, where some houses were building in John-street, and I found the prisoner there packing up some linen in a bed quilt, I took him, he endeavoured to escape and the things, we had a tustle, and then he pulled some small articles from his pockets and dropped them, after I had secured him we took the things and went to the watch-house along with the prisoner, the things were carried down to the Rotation Office in Litchfield-street; after we secured the prisoner we found another bundle in the same vault buried under some rubbish, they were carried to the watch-house, and they were then given to the prosecutor, being wet, by the Justice, we first marked them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the prisoner. You went back and found a second parcel of things buried under some rubbish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it considerably buried? - No, so as to be out of sight.</p>
               <p>You searched the prisoner? - Yes, we found a knife, a picklock key, and a stock-lock key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you try these keys that you found upon him with the place from whence these things were taken? - I never did, they were not tried as I know of.</p>
               <p>What sort of place is it? - It is a garden from under a carpenter's shop.</p>
               <p>Was there not a dog there? - Yes, there was a dog by the vault, and he met me, he was a very large and a very fierce dog, that dog has been in the place where these things were said to be stolen several years.</p>
               <p>Could he get over the wall or not? - I do not know whether he could or not, it may be seven or eight feet.</p>
               <p>Is there a dog in England that can take such a jump? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he may? - Very likely he may.</p>
               <p>The Jury will judge of your credit after that; was that door open? - It was fast.</p>
               <p>What account did the prisoner give respecting these things before the magistrate and you? - He told me he only went in there to rest himself, he had been out upon the parole, he said he had been rambling about.</p>
               <p>So you call rambling about, the parole, what idea do you annex to parole, there is something very curious in it I dare say? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no door to the vault? - None at all.</p>
               <p>How far from the entrance of the vault was the dog? - About six yards.</p>
               <p>What was the dog doing? - At the first of his seeing me he made up towards me, he came as from the vault door, I did not see him in the vault.</p>

               <p>Coming home from work along John-street, a great dog jumped at me, the dog was down in the bottom of the vault, and as I was walking along the dog followed me, but could not get up.</p>
               <p>How high was the wall? - Seven or eight feet, but the boys had made a way down.</p>
               <p>Which way did the dog get up? - He could not get up at all, I never saw nothing but the dog.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This dog is a very important person, my Lord, I assure you.</p>

               <p>I was going my rounds at half past three o'clock, and I heard a cry watch! watch! I ran across the road, coming into John-street I saw the patrol have hold of the prisoner by the collar, I jumped off the paving, and the coachman was close to the prisoner, I took hold of him, the prisoner said, three or four buggers of you shall not; I took the piece in my hand and gave him a blow, the watchman took up the linen, I came back and jumped down, and found another parcel hid under the straw and rubbish, I carried it to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see the dog? - Yes, the dog did not fly at me.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it? - Between three and four.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - On Wednesday morning, the 5th of May.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260127"></xptr>It was pretty dark, I take it. - Not very clear, it was a cloudy morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where was this linen before it was stolen? - It was in a yard inclosed with a wall of about seven or eight feet high, with a door to it where we carry out our goods backwards, that leads to a waste piece of ground, I am a carpenter.</p>
               <p>How is that door fastened? - With a very strong lock on the inside, which locks into an iron staple, the key-hole goes through, there is no bolt on the inside.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing about this dog they have been talking about? - I bred him, I have had him about six years, the wall is about seven feet high, he is a very fierce dog, I am never in any danger when I let him loose; and every night about ten he is let loose.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether that dog was in the yard the night before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where is the key of that door that goes into the waste ground kept? - I think that night it was by the door, either hung up or laid down; there is a hole where cocks and hens go out, and I believe the dog got out there; I think it was big enough, and I saw some hair on it, and he met me in the yard at five o'clock, and that struck me how it was possible for him to get into my premises again.</p>
               <p>Who usually locks the door? - Sometimes my servant, and sometimes my eldest boy who is about eleven: I cannot positively declare whether I did not take the key off the nail. When I saw the things I knew them.</p>
               <p>How many people have you employed about your yard? - I have had two lately, but one constant these two years.</p>
               <p>They of course are familiar with the dog? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your man had access to the key on all occasions? - Yes; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Had he any acquaintance with the dog? - No.</p>

               <p>I live opposite Mr. Finney; on Wednesday the 5th of May about a quarter after three I was looking out of my window, and I saw a man come over the prosecutor's wall with a bundle in his arms, I saw him rise by degrees, and he stept on the wall, I could hear the step of men, he pushed into the second vault, and there was a coachman came under the window, and asked the patrol where the watchman was; he seemed to have a drab coloured coat on, and they took him to the watch-house; afterwards I saw a large dog run thirty or forty times to these coal vaults in agony as if he wanted his master, and then I saw him go down a hole where the cocks and hens go, and hard set he was to get into that hole.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So you conjectured that his agony was about his master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who are you? - I am a married woman, my husband is a brick-maker, I work at tayloring, I have nothing but what I work for.</p>
               <p>How did it chance that you was looking out of window at this time of morning? - My husband went to Kingstand the overnight after a job of work, and he did not come home, and I was afraid something had happened.</p>

               <p>I was locked out, I went to the Pilgrim in Holborn, and called for a pint of beer, and I fell asleep, they said I must not keep them up, I went strolling up this place, and I went to lay down, and I saw a check apron with these things in it, and I was looking at them and the patrol came round and saw me, or else I was going to give information of them.</p>
               <p>Jury to Slade. Do you know the person of the man at all that you saw get over the wall? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was it? - I cannot say what sort of a person, only that he had a kind of a drab coloured coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character, and said he was an ivory turner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All the shopkeepers in London know me in the ivory way.</p>

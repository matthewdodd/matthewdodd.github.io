                  </hi>. I live at Woodford, and am a smith. I lost these copper bits from my workshop on Thursday evening, the 6th of December—they are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner lives at Laytonstone—he had been to my shop to fetch some work for his employer—I went to him on the Friday, and found one of the bits at his place, where he was at work—I asked how he came by them—he said, "Your apprentice lent them to me"—I inquired where the other one was—he denied having that one at all, but I found it in searching his house afterwards—these are the tools.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Master gave him an order to make some tin spouts—I went to his shop for them, and he told me to ask him for an iron, and instead of one, I had two which I borrowed there.</p>

On the 12th of December, about eleven in the forenoon, I saw the prisoner come out of one of the warehouses with a basket of raisins and the sack on his back. On my going to the door, he slept back a step or two, and throwed it off his back. I stopt him at the warehouse door, and asked what business he had there, and how he could have the impudence to rob us in the middle of the day. He fell on his knees, and begged for pardon. I found in the sack a basket of Malaga raisins, about 50 lb. It was one of five we had received on the 5th of December from Reading; that was missing out of the five; the constable has had it ever since. The sack lay empty in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>There was seven or eight of us went down to look for work; we went to the bottom of the wharf, and they employed about four of us. I staid to see if there would be any thing for me. I went into this warehouse, and saw this sack by the door, and something in it. I kick'd it with my foot to see if it was a jobb for me, if it was but two-pence or three-pence. The warehouse is common for any body to go in from the wind. I had no design to steal it; I never did such a thing in my life.</p>

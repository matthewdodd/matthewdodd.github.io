               <p>I am a plumber; on Thursday the 19th of November (the last witness made a mistake in the month) the prisoner at the bar and two other of my people had been changing the lead from the sewer and the cellar to the yard; we had taken up between five and six hundred weight of lead at Mr. Pott's, when we are taking up old lead I always attend; it was lead that was to carry the waste water off, we could not take it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090025"></xptr>away till the bricklayer had cleared the way, it laying under the pavement; when we came from breakfast the ground was cleared and we took away what we could get at, but this lay near the cellar window. I wanted to persuade the prisoner to lay a few more bricks that I might get some new lead in, but he would not stay; the next morning the prisoner did not come, upon which he was suspected, and I heard he was in the watch-house, I went and examined it, and found it was the lead that was taken from the cellar window; there was another piece in the basket which matched with the first piece I took, they exactly fitted, and I tried it at Mr. Pott's, and they exactly corresponded with the nails; they had neither of them been separated from the houses by any of my men; I received the lead from the constable who brought it from the watch-house, or his man,

               <p>(The lead produced.)</p>
               <p>This is the piece belonging to the window sill, this was cut by our men: this lay under the pavement, we could not get at it without digging, I am positive this lead came from Mr. Pott's cellar window; when a piece of lead is put down we drive the nails at no regular distance; I don't think it would correspond with any other cellar window but this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That woman and I was going down Devonshire-street, and we found this basket at the corner of Devonshire-court, with the lead in it.</p>

We had at sundry times missed lead and iron from a room that we had locked up, and also from another place, in an old house that we were to repair, joining these buildings, at Fresh wharf. A neighbour gave me the descriptions of two men that he suspected, which were Green and Mend, who had stole some lead. I had people to watch several nights, but at last Adam Alsop saw them go in at the gateway: he came and told me of it; I bid him watch them again, and come to me to Fleet-lane, where I had had information they had sold lead. I went there, and got a constable to attend me. Alsop came, and told me he had seen them both come out, with each a bag on his shoulder. We waited in Fleet lane about an hour;

               <p>Q. Did Green confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No, he did not; we had taken the lead and iron upon Green, and that was produced there.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of lead did you lose?</p>
               <p>Hudson. We lost one hundred and three quarters of lead, cut from a flat on the top of a house.</p>

               <p>This was not produced before the alderman, this we had from Grayham's house, after Mead had confessed: Grayham is now in custody, for receiving this and more. I and the constable went with Mead, and found it in Grayham's shop.</p>

               <p>Mead. I know nothing of him but once; then we went into Fleet-lane, that was only once; Langley had no concern in taking this lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this lead?</p>
               <p>Mead. We got it from off a flat at an old house joining to where the fire was, near St. Magnus church.</p>

               <p>Mead. Green got it from off the flat. I and Langley pull'd it, while he cut it: Green had placed an old axe by on the joists, in readiness against night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell it for a pound?</p>
               <p>Mead. We can hardly tell what we had a pound for it. We cut it to pieces in his shop, he had not weights to weigh it at once.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Mead. He keeps an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What me did you sell it him?</p>
               <p>Mead. We sold it him about 8 at night: we were there four times. We all three work'd together as labourers, at the buildings after the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead did you sell in Fleet-lane?</p>
               <p>Mead. There were 102 lb. but we were paid for but a hundred, at a penny a pound, 8 s. 4 d.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What does this weigh?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This does not weigh above 25 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. What is the real value of old lead?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it was about 12 s. 6 d. or 13 s. a hundred, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mead. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Mead. We divided it equally amongst us three.</p>

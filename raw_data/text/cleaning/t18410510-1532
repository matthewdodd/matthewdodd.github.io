                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Pensbury, Wandsworth-road, Clapham—I am a connexion of ope of the learned Judges. The prisoner came into my service eighteen months ago as needle-woman, and afterwards to take charge of the empty hoube which I had taken it Pensbury—I had taken the house, but it was not ready for my reception—I removed my things there last March'twelve months—they consisted of clothes, plate, books, and various other things—I was in the habit of using part of them, the others were kept locked up in different rooms in the house—the prisoner knew where—the keys were placed in a bag—I kept my plate in a tin case under my bed for some time, and after that in a room where my niece was—I have frequently inquired of the prisoner for the keys of different places in the house, and they were lost in basket when I went to Brighton—I had seen it a very few weeks before I found it at the pawnbroker's—I asked her about this tea caddy when I returned home, on the 17th, or a few days afterwards, and she said, "Is it not there, Maam?" meaning on the drawers, where it was usually kept—I said, "It is not"—she said, "Then it is in the closet"—I looked in, and put the closet to rights entirely, and it was not there—she then said, "It must be in the glass case"—I said, "That is impossible, it is not its place"—she then said, "It roust be in the tin case"—when she went to the empty house she said her husband must go with her, and a man, whom she represented as her husband, came to live afterwards in the house where I was residing—there is no pretence for saying that any impropriety ever passed between me and him—he was a most horrid fellow, swearing and drinking continually—the prisoner left the house on Easter Monday, without giving me any notice—I did not know where she was gone to—I expected her to return that night—I never saw her till she was in custody—after I found she had left in this manner, I sent on the Wednesday for the police and the locksmith—when the policeman came, I asked him to go up stairs and look into her room—the door was fast, and as I did not wish to break the lock, the locksmith got in at the window—he found the door was not locked, but fastened by a night bolt and the tape—he unfastened it, and let the policeman in—when the policeman got in, I found a small box belonging to the prisoner—several of these duplicates Were found in it, five or six between the bed and mattress, some in a bottom drawer, one or two in the finger of her</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know Jones, a baker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he sued me for the same person's debt—my solicitor settled it with him—I never borrowed money of a loan-society, but I was security for Jones—I was not summoned to Union-hall to pay it—I paid the whole—it was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never been to Union-hall-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know a person of the name of Clark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know several persons named Clark—I did not, in the presence of an officer, order the prisoner to go out and raise money for me—I took the money out of my pocket, and paid it—I had two witnesses with me when I paid it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever taken in execution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my person was seized at my own house by an officer named Fletcher—it was an unjust debt—a man took me, and behaved very ill—I did not order the prisoner on that occasion to take out some of my property to pledge—I myself pawned on that occasion—I sent the prisoner to three neighbours, but she never went—I walked up the Wandsworth-road with the officer, to call on another friend—I took out my watch—the officer said, "Why don't you pawn your watch?"—I said, "I don't know how to go about it"—he said, "I will take it to a respectable man"—he took it, and brought me out the moriey—he said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "How much will satisfy you?"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not give the prisoner leave to go to the fair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not know there was a fair—she went out when she pleased—she did not come back the same evening, and was locked out—I know she did not come back—she went and slept at Mrs. Belger's, near the Temple—she was absent on Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday her sister came to know if she had returned—I said, "She will not come here again; I have no notion of a servant going out of my house and stopping two nights."</p>

               <p>—I was summoned to the Court of Requests—I do not know who it was got me summoned there—the man whom the prisoner says is her husband brought me a bill of 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Brighton for my niece's health—she is dead—I purchased some articles of mourning at her death, and paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I came to town it was applied for again—I sent the bills down to Miss Armstrong, to show they were paid—I was sued for two debts of Lawson's by a butcher and baker—the room in which the duplicates were found was one into which no one but the prisoner and her husband went—I did not know there was a duplicate in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in his presence, direct the prisoner to go and get the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I sent her to my linen-draper's, where I frequently cashed cheques—I told her to go to Mr. Swan and ask him if he had got such a sum in his house, but he was not at home—if'I had got it I should not have had to pawn my watch—I did not pay the officer by means of money the prisoner brought.</p>

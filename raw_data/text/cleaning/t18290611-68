On the night of the 15th of May the prisoner and I went to bed nearly together - the blind man came in afterwards; I told him to bolt the door - he said No; I got up and bolted it - my waistcoat pocket had seven sovereigns in it; on the following morning, which was Tuesday, I got up, put on most of my clothes, and then saw that my waistcoat had been moved - I ran to it, and my money was gone; the prisoner was gone then: I have never had the money since - he was taken on the Friday, but he came to the house the same night, very drunk, and fell down twice in the room; on the Wednesday he was riding about in a cab all day, and left some sovereigns at the White Lion public-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know me to come home drunk before that? A.No, not in pension time; the door has certainly been found open when blind Joseph has come in drunk of a night, but nothing has been lost before.</p>

            . I keep the White Lion public-house, James-street. On the morning of the 17th, which I think was on Wednesday or Thursday, the prisoner came and asked for change for a sovereign, which I gave him; he opened a paper, and there were three sovereigns in it- I gave him change for one, and he asked me to take care of the other two; I took them, and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>MARY ELLIOTT. I keep the house where these men lodged. On the Saturday before the prosecutor lost his money, the prisoner paid me 1s., and owed me 8s. 6d.; about a month before that I know he had been in constant work, and had had a guinea a week, but at this time I know he had not much money, for he borrowed the shilling of Thomas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is Joseph quite blind? A. He can discern light from dark, but he cannot see any thing on the ground; he does sometimes get drunk on small beer.</p>

               <p>FRANCISCO DENEGRI. I lost twenty-two shillings and my watch, on the 4th of November - I do not know where I was; I had been at a coffee-house, and drank too much- I did not miss it till I awoke the next morning; I saw my watch safe about nine o'clock in the evening when I went to the coffee-house - I left about ten at night.</p>

               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I keep Serle's Coffee-house, in Carey-street. The prosecutor was in my house on the night of the 3rd of November, when he was playing the guitar to some gentlemen - after he had been there some time, he was going away, and I observed he was tipsy; I called him, and asked his address - I then called the prisoner, who is my <rs id="t18291203-155-deflabel805" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>JAMES MEAD. I took the prisoner. I found in his trunk 6s. and some halfpence.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave me the watch and the silver - I took it home; I told the Police-man it was his watch when he found it.</p>

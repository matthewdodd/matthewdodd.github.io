The prisoner worked journeywork with me; she worked in my shop; she came to work for me at the latter end of May. In two days after she came, I missed the counterpane and the eleven yards of bed lace. On the 17th of July, my wife informed me that she missed five table-cloths and a sheet, and that she suspected the prisoner. I went to her lodgings to enquire about her: the people gave her a very bad character. When I came home, I missed these window curtains and a bed-tick. I went again in search for her. I found her near her lodging sitting in a room. I asked her how she came to leave my service; she said, I find you missed things, and I was afraid you should suspect me. I said, I suppose the plain truth is, you have robbed me; she said, yes, she had. She confessed to taking the goods; I then charged her with the counterpane, the tea-chest, and the curtains; she acknowledged she had stolen them. She told me she had pawned the counterpane at Mr. Rochford's in Bishopsgate-street; the window curtains at Mr. Davidson's at London Wall; and the tea-chest in Houndsditch. The next day I missed a great many more things; then I took her up, and she confessed stealing them.</p>

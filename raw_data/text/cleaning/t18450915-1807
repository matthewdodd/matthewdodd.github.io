In consequence of her missing the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, on the 25th of Aug., I said to White, "Mary, Madame Forgeot has lost a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; we had better search all over the place"—she said, it was very extraordinary; there was always something lost; and said, "Does Madame suspect me?"—I said, "I do not know; we are the only two in the place, and she may suspect me as well"—I looked everywhere for the note, and had the furniture removed—I had the coal-box in the kitchen moved, and searched behind it—the prisoner did not help me, nor seem to care about it—she said, "Oh, I dare say it is not there,"—I spoke to her about it twenty times—she always said she did not know anything about it—she asked me if that money would prevent Madame going to France—I said I did not suppose it would, as she could get money—she was taken into custody on Tuesday, the 2nd of Sept.—she had been sweeping the drawing-room the day before, and brought me a dust-pan with a few bits of cards and papers in it, and asked me if she might look among them for the note—she was taken into custody the next day—I know the prisoner M'Mahon—I saw him at the house three or four times a long time ago, but not since the note was lost—I saw him in the street—he used to visit White before the note was lost—it was the duty of nobody but me and White to go into the bed-room.</p>

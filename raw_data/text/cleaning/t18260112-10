This carpet was about eighteen feet inside my warehouse; between twelve and one o'clock in the day time, I saw it safe and went out; I returned in a few minutes, and missed it - I have not found it - there were twenty-four yards - it cost me 2l. 15s. I went almost immediately with an officer to Barnett's, in Catherine-wheel-alley, and then went into the next house, followed the officer up stairs, and saw the three male prisoners in the same room with the woman, who was washing; I accused them of stealing the carpet; no charge was made against the woman. I believe the house is let out in lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. I take it for granted your stock is frequently sold? A. Yes; this only came from the country a few days before, and I cut off forty-eight yards, leaving twenty-four; none had been sold while I was out; the men were all out - I only left a woman there. One of the prisoners was smoking a pipe, another on the bed, pretending to be ill, and the other sitting in a corner.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Imperial Gas-light Company. On Monday, the 19th of December, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw James King come out of Hare's shop, with a roll of carpet in his hand, and when he got six or seven yards from the shop, a person held his hand out, and received it from him; I did not see that person's face; he was dressed in a long dark coat and trousers; I saw nobody else - I did not see Williams - I directed a person who was with me to follow them, and I went to Mr. Hare's, and told a woman in the warehouse; I went to this room in less than ten minutes, and saw James King by the fire side, without his cap; I recognised him, and found a hairy cap in the room which he wore when he took the carpet. I believe William King, from his dress and appearance, to be the man who received the carpet - he was dressed exactly the same. Williams was on the bed pretending to be asleep - after rousing himself, he took hold of a pair of stockings, and said"Mother, wash these stockings, will you?" They were examined before the Lord Mayor the next day - the woman came as a witness and was ordered into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was William King's dress?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120009"></xptr>A. A long dark frock coat, which he put round the carpet to hide it - he wore dark trousers.</p>

            . I was with Butler; he said "That carpet is stolen;" I then saw two persons running away with it; I saw the features of one, which was James King; the other had a long dark coat and dark trousers; they turned into Catherine-wheel-alley; Williams was waiting at the corner of the alley for them - that is about fifty yards from Hare's, but within sight of the house; when they got to the alley they all three ran together; I followed them to the top of the alley; they turned to the left hand, directly I turned they got into a house which I understood to be Barnett's; I waited opposite the door for ten minutes; I did not see them come out, but in a quarter of an hour they were found in a house at the back of Barnett's yard; I found the four prisoners there; I had seen the features of all three as they ran up the court, and am certain of all three.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a long alley? A. Yes; it leads by some turnings into Petticoat-lane. Mr. Hare's house is on the same side of the way as the alley. Williams could see the house from where he stood, for I stood there myself on purpose to try. There is a communication from Barnett's yard to the house where they were found - there is only a low slight fence between them.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Hare to Barnett's house, in Catherine-wheel-alley, but could not find the carpet; I went into the yard, and found it easy to get over the paling to the house, where I found the four prisoners - the witnesses recognised them - nobody else was in the room - Smith spoke to all the three male prisoners.</p>

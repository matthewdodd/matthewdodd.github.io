                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in High-street, Shoreditch. About half-past six o'clock in the evening, on the 16th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, in the uniform of the police of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—I had seen him on duty there, and knew him as an inspector of their police—he came to me in a hurried manner, and said, "Mr. Hall requests you will send a sample of your best silver watches, with the lowest tender, as it is their intention to supply the police on the line with silver watches; you are to send a sample with the price you will do them at"—he told me to seal them up, and direct them to Richard Hall, Esq., Carnarvon Hall, Essex—I gave him four watches, all different, for the purpose of being shown as samples—I did not consider they were sold—I thought one would, be selected, and an order given perhaps for a dozen—they were invoiced at 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they were ticketed higher—I enclosed the invoice in the parcel to Mr. Hall.</p>

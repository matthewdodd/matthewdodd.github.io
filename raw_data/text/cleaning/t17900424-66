I told them five shillings and six-pence; the woman desired me to cut a yard; they came together, the same as man and wife; I knew nothing to the contrary; turning myself round I perceived the woman fumbling with her hands under her apron; the man prisoner asked her what she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240177"></xptr>doing; she said, she was feeling for her handkerchief; Phillips asked her if she wanted any thing else? she said, yes; Phillips desired me to shew her some more; but I took no notice of what he said, but took the wrapper, and put it on one side, being of opinion she had stolen some: I sent for my master; I immediately came back to the linen shop, where I left the prisoners, and found Trotter was gone; I had still stronger suspicions that she had stolen something; and I enquired of Phillips, who was in the shop, where she was gone? he said, he knew nothing about her, the prosecutor and I pursued her; we took her in Bowyer's court, a very small distance from our house; we brought her back, and found the property upon her, which is here; it has been in my custody ever since; it is the property of

R. it is my own writing; there is seventeen yards of it; it is muslin; it cost fifty shillings; it was under her cloak; I saw Mr. Worthy take it from under her cloak, after she was brought back to the silk shop: this piece was in the same wrapper with that I cut the yard from.</p>
               <p>When you saw her hand under her apron was she stooping? - Rather so; I was behind the counter; the wrapper was on one side of me; the movement of her hands was the first thing that induced me to think she had taken something: the prisoners were taken before a magistrate, and committed: they conversed together as man and wife; he purchased a gown for her at our shop, which she had on.</p>

                  </hi> I am a painter and glazier, at 8, Gun-square, Houndsditch. I am twenty-four years old, and have known the prisoner about three months—she went into service a few weeks before March—she came to my mother's, where I live, on Monday, 6th March, and asked me to go out for a walk—we went, and passed the night at 7, Angle-alley, White<lb></lb>chapel, and she spent the whole of Tuesday with me, and we passed the fol<lb></lb>lowing night there—we had no words—she had not left place—on the Wednesday evening we were in a public-house, in Bishopsgate-street, and had two pints of porter—she fetched a half-quartern of rum from the bar—I did not send her for it—she gave me a glass of it, which I drank, and found it a scorching heat—it burnt my tongue and throat, and caused me to vomit—I complained to the landlord—he drew me a small quantity of the same rum, as he said—I drank it, and found it quite different—I was sick after drink<lb></lb>ing what the landlord gave me—the prisoner did not drink any of the run she brought me, she put the glass to her lips—when I returned to the tap-room, after I had vomited, there was some left, which I passed to some people in the tap-room—they tasted it, and said it was a scorching heat, and burnt their tongues—I told her if she did anything to harm me I would make her pay for it severely—she said, "Do you think I would hurt you, dear Ben<lb></lb>jamin"—we slept at the same lodging—we had no dispute—I awoke about half-past four o'clock, next morning—the prisoner was then by my side in bed—I went to sleep again, and awoke just before six, and wanted to get up as I had work to do—she persuaded me to lay down for another half hour—I did so, and fell asleep—I was awoke by a sharp blow on the right temple—I started up, and found her kneeling on the bed, with her hand on the hair of my head—she again attempted to stab me with a penknife—I seized her right hand, and struggled with her, and got out of bed, and got it—she got out of the room—I was bleeding very much—she held the door—I pulled it open—she ran down stairs—I gave an alarm—a policeman came—I was taken to the London Hospital, where I was about a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I fetched the rum myself, as I did not wish him to know what money I had; he was always asking me for money; I sipped some of the rum myself, and spit it out directly.<hi rend="italic"> Witness.</hi> She did not—she said the stuff must have been in the measure, for she had none about her—I was not in the habit of obtaining money from her—I did not give her any—I was in work at the time.</p>

On 9th March, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was called to the house, in Angle<lb></lb>alley—I found Wenman bleeding very much from the head—I went up stairs, and found the prisoner on the top floor, standing by the bed<lb></lb> side, partly underssed—I told her the charge—she said she did not care, she would be satisfied to be hanged for him—she pointed out a knife in the bed, and said, "There is the knife lying in the bed, and the other part of the blade, I think, is in his forehead, for I cannot find it"—I could not find the other part—there was a good deal of blood in the bed and on the stairs—as I took her to the station, she said they had had a quarrel in bed that morning, and she told him she was in the family way by him, and he replied, that if she was, it was none of his; that he would do nothing for her or the child; that she might do what she could for it.</p>

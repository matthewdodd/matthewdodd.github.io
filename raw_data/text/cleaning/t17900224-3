A girl gave an alarm that a man had stolen a firkin of butter: I saw a man walking very fast; I ran across the way, and collared him: he threw down the firkin of butter, and struck me: I ran after him about two hundred yards: another person took him: I never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Bishopsgate-street, on the 9th of February; and the firkin of butter was pitched on a block, at a sadler's door, and a young man was standing by it; and he asked me to carry it, and he would satisfy me; and I carried it as far, very near, as Bunhill-row; and this young man laid hold of me: and the man that asked me to carry it ran away directly: I never was in the shop, nor near the shop, in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

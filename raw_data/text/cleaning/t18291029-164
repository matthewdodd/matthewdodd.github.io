            . I am a Police-constable. On the 18th of October I saw the two prisoner together in Tottenham-court-road - Wilkinson was carrying a leg of pork and a roll of Dutch cheese; I asked, in the other prisoner's hearing, where he got them - he said he had bought the pork in Oxford-market of a butcher named Davies; I took them there, and in going along Connell ran off - I followed, and brought him back; I went up to the butchers and asked if they knew any thing of the prisoners - they said No; I went round the market, and could find no person of that name - I took the prisoners to the watch-house; the prosecutrix swore to the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilkinson. Murphy and his serjeant agreed to discharge us, and keep the property between themselves.</p>

               <p>How did you find your house when you got up? - The front of the house was all secure, as I left it at night, I went into the kitchen with intention to open it, and found the sash up about six inches from the sill.</p>
               <p>What do you call the fill? - The bottom part that the sash rests upon; I put it down close when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was that sash secured over night? - I know it was positively; I went with intention to unbolt the shutter and found it had been forced open; it was bolted over night, about two inches below the bottom rail of the sash.</p>
               <p>How do you suppose that the shutter had been opened? - Either by an iron chissel or crow, by taking four or five different purchases on the outside; there were four impressions of some instruments.</p>
               <p>To get at the window, the shutter must have been opened? - Yes, they could not get the bolt off; they broke the lining of the sash out; I opened the bank door, I found that fast as I left it; the garden pots that stood on the inside of the window were taken off, and set upon the ground in the yard, close to the back door; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I know nothing of the taking of the prisoner.</p>

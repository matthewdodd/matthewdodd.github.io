               <p>Q. Did you at any time search his lodgings to find any of your property there? - A. In the beginning of September last I had occasion of going into the country; he then had the care of my business and property; that was the time he took my property. A little before Christmas last I catched him stealing some leather; I searched his lodgings on the 28th of December last, I found a new pair of boots there, the prisoner was present, and I had two officers with me; the officers have the boots (the boots produced); this is the pair of boots I found in the room, he had rubbed out the gentleman's name (I had wrote upon them) with vitriol, but when I ripped the morocco lining at the top, I saw there the name of Wilson; they were returned by Mr. Wilson in the year 1804, and they were in my shop till the time the prisoner took them; I always put the name on the front and back privately, they are my boots.</p>

             sworn. I am apprentice to Mr. Nutley; about the middle of September, the prisoner at the bar cut these boots shorter, and got them bound in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. By a mark that my master's son shewed me, and there was nobody else there to cut them, I saw him give them to my master's daughter to bind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him cut them? - A. No, I know they are the same boots by a cut in skiving them thin for the binder before they were bound.</p>

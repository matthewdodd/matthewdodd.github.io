At the back of that farm I had a hay-rick sixty or seventy yards from the high-road—on the 23rd of April, at a quarter to eight o'clock n the evening, I went round it, and saw it safe—at half-past eight, or a quarter to nine, I received information, which induced me to go to it again—I found it on fire, it was in a blaze all the way round—there were some faggots under it burning—it had been laid on faggots—with the assist<lb></lb>ance of some of my neighbours, I extinguished the fire—the faggots were burnt—it is impossible that combustion could be the cause of it, because it was old hay—I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

They also all declare, that they voluntarily make this statement, and that no promise has been held out to them; and that they have been properly cautioned that what they said would be taken down and produced in evidence against them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Webster's Defence.</hi> My Lord and gentlemen of the jury: the offence of which I stand charged is one of a very heavy character, and which, I am very sorry to say, has brought me before your notice this day. My Lord and gentlemen, perhaps you will not credit what I am going to say to you; but I will fearlessly speak to you, convinced that I am innocent, and that what I am going to say is true. It is true that I was in Richmond during the day on which the fire occurred, and I also was the company of the other persons charged with me, and that I was also present at the fire; but I can assure your Lordship that the stack was not fired by me. But being reduced to the deepest distress, through the want of work, and not having tasted food for some time past, I was induced to accompany the other per<lb></lb>sons, and accuse myself of committing the crime, which has caused my friends a great deal of anguish and regret, that I had not applied to them for assis<lb></lb>tance. My Lord, I was never in the company of those persons accused with me, but on theday the fire occurred; nor can I, to my recollection, ever re<lb></lb>member seeing them before. the only thing that criminates me, is the marks which the officer states was made by the shoes which I wore; but I can assure you that they were not the print of my footsteps; for I never entered the field where the ground was capable of receiving any impression. My Lord, it is not at all improbable that the marks were caused by some person who assisted at the fire, and who, in the excitement of the moment, has not since remembered crossing the field. But, my Lord, I hope you will pause before you proceed to sum up the evidence adduced against me; for it would be doing me a great injustice without being convinced of my guilt; for the confession which I signed in an unthinking moment, and which has been used as evidence against me, which the keen pangs of hungers has induced me to put my signature to, is a falsehood, of which I have had reason to repent. My lord, taking all these considerations before your notice, and weighing the evidence brought against me, I may be led to hope for a favourable issue of my trial, and which I may be led to expect from an impartial and uncorrupted jury.</p>

            . I am a barge-man. A load of corn was delivered to my care on the 12th of January, at the Adelphi; I assisted in loading the waggon - the loft they speak of is under the arches of the Adelphi, about one hundred and forty yards from where the waggon was - it is a loft not made use of, and I do not think it belongs to any one - sixty-five sacks were put into the waggon; I went for further orders, and the horses were put to it - the prisoner has worked for me several times, but not for a month before this; the oats were to go to Mr. Shenton, in Northrow - when they got there, one sack was missing; we lost three sacks about a month before - I was called to look at the oats, and have no doubt they belonged to Mr. Samuel Knight: the sack that had the oats in it, was marked 60, that I should know it.</p>

            . I was drinking with Joseph Wolf about a month ago at Downs's, the red Lion in Gardiner-lane. He said he had got a shirt in pawn, and did not know how to get it out, and was afraid of coming into trouble. (The two prisoners were soldiers.) I having the key of this woman's house, he persuaded me to go along with him to rob it: we went the same day and open'd the door, Wolf broke open the chamber door up one pair of stairs; then he got a hammer and chissel, and broke open three drawers, there being a bag of tools left in the house of Daniel Wright's, he is a sawyer; he took out a pair of stays, a holland shift, six damask napkins, and a damask table-cloth; then we lock'd the outside door, and went to St. Gyles's. Wolf gave a man, a stranger to me, the stays to pawn or sell, who went, and returned with 2 s. 6 d. he gave the man 6 d. for his trouble. We went to an old cloaths shop in Monmouth-street, and he sold the holland shift there for 2 s. after that we met with an old cloaths woman, to whom Wolf gave the six napkins to go to sell for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman?</p>
               <p>Moulding. I don't know her, my lord; she sold them, and brought him 5 s. then we went to the two Brewer's in St. Giles's, and he offer'd the table cloth to the woman of the house; she would not buy it, so we went to the brown bear, and sold it for 8 s. and two full pots of beer. Going out at the door I met with

            , who ask'd me what I had been about, and I told him the whole; he said, I am sorry you should let such a fool as Wolf into such an affair, saying, if I had let him know of it, he could have pick'd the lock and made things secure, so that it should never have been found out. Then he and I concluded to go the next day without Wolf, but we were both upon duty at St. James's guard; and as we could not hire our duty of the corporal, we took leave, and deserted our guard, and went to this house at Kensington Gore. We took out a pair of holland sheets, twelve damask napkins, and one damask table cloth; then we came back again to St. Giles's, and from thence to a pawnbroker in Denmark-street ; Martin went in with the pair of sheets. The pawnbroker stop'd them, and told him, if he could bring any body to vouch for him, that he came honestly by them, he would lend him 10 s. 6 d. upon them: he went to one Jenny Monroe, a washerwoman, and they went back; I staid in her house. They return'd, and brought 10 s. 6 d. she said; but Martin said he had but a crown: he went out again, I believe, in about five minutes, with the damask table-cloth and 12 napkins, to pawn at the same place; when they return'd, they said they had got a guinea; so he gave me half a crown and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share of what Wolf sold?</p>

               <p>Moulding. I had, my lord; I had a shilling out of the stays, a shilling out of the holland shift, and half a crown out of the six napkins; and I had four shillings out of the damask table cloth we sold at the brown bear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you surrender yourself voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Moulding. I discovered it to the serjeant last Tuesday se'nnight, and voluntarily delivered myself up to him.

             had been bragging of it, and I was afraid of being taken up. I did not meddle with any of the things either of the times going to the house, and I think Joseph Wolf is, of the two, a greater rogue than I.</p>
               <p>Eleanor Gibs. I live at the brown bear, St. Giles's Moulding and another soldier came to my house, and I bought a table cloth of the other man for 8 and a full pot of gin hot; he said he had catch'd another man in bed with his wife, so he had sold all her houshold goods, except that table cloth. I cannot swear to any of the prisoners.</p>

In about two hours after they came again, and brought a damask table cloth, and twelve damask napkins. I lent him a guinea upon them. He complained his wife lay in, and she said the same.</p>

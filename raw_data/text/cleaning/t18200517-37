On the 8th of May, about six o'clock in the morning, I opened the kitchen window and the box was safe close to the window. I left the house at that time, and shut the door; when I came back the box was gone, and the prisoner stopped with it in his possession - I never saw the prisoner before. There is a glass-door in the passage, the street-door is opened when the female part of the family get up. There did not appear any force, it must have been opened by a pipe key.</p>

            . I am a labourer by the water-side. I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Miller's house, about ten minutes before eight o'clock. He was a stranger to me. He went to two other persons close by the door, and said he could only open one lock with the key; he then returned back, and said there was a room up stairs with the door open, and a box on the table - they desired him to go and fetch it, and he did so. I let them go off the premises; they weighed the box in their hand to see how heavy it was. I stopped him before I lost sight of him, and the others went off. I took him to Mr. Miller's house, and delivered him to a constable. I did not see the box opened, I am quite sure he is the man that went into the house.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Martin. I was in the shop when the prisoners came in; Reuben asked for ribbon; she bought a yard and a quarter at seven-pence a yard; they had afterwards several lengths cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Giddes buy any thing - A. No; she was with her at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any alarm before they left the shop - A. Master came in, he was serving at one end of the shop; he saw them take a piece of ribbon away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Martin. Did you see either of the prisoners take any thing - A. Yes, Reuben; I saw her take a piece of ribbon, and gave it to Giddes. I threw the flap of the counter up, went and took it from her, and told her it was my property, and said, I should search and see if she had any thing else, and as they moved the umbrella, a piece of ribbon fell out. I picked up the umbrella, and found six pieces more in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that either of them brought the umbrella in - A. No. I believe the umbrella stood on the right hand side of Reuben.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these pieces of ribbon - A. Three pounds, rather more than less. I said, I would send for a constable. Giddes went on her knees then, and Reuben ran away; she was pursued and brought back. These ribbons have my shop mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen either of the prisoners take any of these seven pieces that were in the umbrella - A. This piece of blue ribbon, is the piece that I saw Reuben take and give to Giddes.</p>
               <p>Q. to James Authorn. Did you see either of the prisoners take any of these pieces of ribbon which were in the umbrella - A. No. There were three serving in the shop besides me and my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these three give any alarm of any thing being taken away - A. No. I did not see which of the prisoners brought the umbrella in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reuben. The gentleman took that ribbon off the counter, and put it into the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Martin. Reuben suggested that you put a piece into the umbrella - A. So I did. When I took that piece, from Giddes, I put it into the umbrella. They were all in the umbrella except that one piece. I put that in myself.</p>
               <p>JAMES WELCH. I was sent for to take the prisoners into custody. I asked them where they lived; they neither of them would tell.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was another person in the shop; she begged these girls off; she said, it was the first thing they ever did.</p>
               <p>Welch. She is a base character, and led these girls into it.</p>
               <p>Reuben's Defence. When I went into the shop I had no umbrella with me; there were several more people in the shop buying ribbons besides me.</p>
               <p>Giddes's Defence. When we went into the shop neither of us had any umbrella.</p>
               <p>Giddes called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

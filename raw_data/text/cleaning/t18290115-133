               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Written.) I was going home, running down Southampton-buildings; a short distance from the top of the street, a young man (running in the same direction that I was) as he passed me, slyly pushed something into my hand folded in a very small compass, which on opening I found to be a pocket-handkerchief; I directly threw it down, still continuing to run as before, until hearing the cry of Stop thief, I halted to ascertain who they were in pursuit of, and I, together with the young man who gave me the handkerchief were immediately taken and charged with the theft; but upon the witness, who has given his evidence against me, pointing me out as the thief, the other young man was suffered to escape - I solemnly declare that I never saw the young man who gave it to me before.</p>

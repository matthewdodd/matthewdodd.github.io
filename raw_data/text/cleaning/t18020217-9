            Are you able to swear to it if it is produced? - A. Yes; I have found none of the other articles; the coat, in the right-hand pocket, is stained with tobacco; he said, if I would go with him by myself, he would get me every thing again; I was loath to go with him for fear he should get away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there any particular marks to those things? - A. Yes, the right-hand pocket is stained with tobacco; I chew tobacco, and put it into my coat-pocket; I am perfectly sure it is my own; the waistcoat was one my uncle gave me, very much darned, the pockets are sewed up; there is a mother of pearl button on the left-hand side, and two upon the right; the shirt is tied with a piece of bobbin, it is very much torn with stooping.</p>
               <p>RACHAEL CARPENTER sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner at the bar was a flight acquaintance of my husband's; he frequently used to call upon us; he eat and drank with us part of what we had, when he came up; he called on Friday afternoon, the 22d of January; he had tea with us in the evening; he told us he had got a job of work to go to, on the Monday; he went about eight o'clock in the evening; he returned again about the 23d in the morning, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, my husband was gone to his work; he sat down for some time; he asked me if I would drink any thing: I thanked him, I had just had my breakfast; he asked me, if I would fetch him a pint of two penny, and half an ounce of tobacco; I told him yes; I put on my bonnet and cloak, and went down stairs; the public-house was opposite; I ordered a pint of two penny to be got ready; I went for the tobacco, when I came back, the pint of twopenny was on the bar, waiting for me; I was gone five or six minutes at the farthest; I went up stairs, and immediately found my door was wide open; the prisoner at the bar was gone; I missed a box and tea-chest from off the table, and a deal box, containing a coat, waistcoat, two half-handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, a shirt, and a hat-band; I know those articles were in the box; this is my husband's property, and my box stood upon this; the articles in the indictment were in my husband's box; he did not take that away.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020217-9-person125">Q. </persName>
            Did he put them into your box? - A. I don't know, that box was left empty behind; he took two boxes, and left one empty behind him; I have seen the property that was taken from him; my husband's coat and waistcoat, a shirt, and a pair of stockings, were in the coat-pocket; they were taken from him when he was taken to the watch-house; I was at the watch-house, and was with my hus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180202170010"></xptr>band at the taking of him; I know these articles to be my husband's property, the name R. P. is on the stockings; they were kept in the box that was empty.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARWOOD sworn. - I am inspector of the watch and lamps of St. Andrew's, Holborn; I saw the prisoner taken; the man and his wife brought the prisoner in, and another man with them; he said, he had been robbed, I searched him, and there were two small boxes, one tortoise-shell, the other brass, and cut in the form of a shoe; the small box was in his coat-pocket; when he was before the Alderman, he was stripped of the coat, waistcoat, and shirt, I have kept them ever since.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Carpenter. They are my boxes; a tortoise-shell box, with a looking-glass, one is a wooden shoe, with an oval on it; the cloaths are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, these things, as I was coming down St. Giles's, I picked up, tied up in a bundle, I put them upon my back; going up St. Giles's, this man came past me; soon after, I went past him, and this man followed me, overtook me, and swore they were his property, before I ever saw him; I am entirely a stranger.</p>

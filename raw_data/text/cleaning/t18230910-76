            . I am a constable. On the 3d of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming along Hatton-garden, and saw the prisoner running furiously along, followed by Mr. Brown, and some other gentleman - before I could get up, the gentleman had caught him, and was bringing him back. I took him to the watch-house, Mr. Brown delivered the handkerchief to me.</p>

            . I belong to a public office, and live in Hunter-street, Brunswick-square. On the 3d of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up <placeName id="t18230910-76-crimeloc434">Holborn</placeName>

I then observed the prisoner running down Holborn-hill. I followed him; he turned into Ely-place, and when he entered a passage leading into Hatton-garden, I had got very close to him, and he dropped my handkerchief. I picked it up, continued the pursuit, and finding he gained ground, I called out - a gentleman followed - he turned round Charles-street, and in a gateway there was taken. I only lost sight of him as he turned the corners, and have no doubt of him.</p>

I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Mecklenburg-square about nine o'clock in the morning of the 28th of June, and saw the prisoner in Cromer-street, about a furlong from the Commissioners' tool-house—he had a carpet bag in his hand, and went into a marine store shop—I folowed him in, and found him offering some lead for sale—I asked how he came in possession of that lead—he said he bought it in the country—here are five pieces rolled up—part of it was in the scale, and part in the bag—I afterwards went to the tool-house, where the commissioners kept their tools, and found the roof had been stripped—this is part of the lead that had been on the roof—there was more taken than I have here, but this fitted as far as it went.</p>

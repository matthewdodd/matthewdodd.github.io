            . In consequence of some information that I had received, on Monday, the 18th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, I searched the privy upon my premises, and over the entrance of the door, on the inside, there were a great many pieces of indigo secreted, it was in a dark place, where no light comes; it was concealed upon the loose timbers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in a situation that persons might have seen them if they had not been looking for them? - A. I think not; I marked four of the pieces with my pencil, with the initials of my name, and placed them in the same situation again; I directed one of my men, who saw me mark it, to stay there while I went home, and got my great coat, as I thought it was likely to be a night job to watch; I placed myself in an adjoining privy, where I could see whoever came to the other privy, and they could not see me: In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come out of the privy where the indigo was secreted; I let him pass the privy where I was, and went to feel if the indigo was gone, and I found it was; I followed him immediately, and as he was going past Mr. Calvert's brewhouse, on the wharf, I collared him; he asked me what was the matter; I told him, I had reason to think he was extremely fond of indigo; and as he went along, I observed he had his hands in his pockets; and I told him, if he did not take his hands from his pockets, I would certainly break his arm, I had a short stick in my hand; I took him to our accompting-house, and searched him; I took out of his pocket, two pounds four ounces of indigo, amongst them were two of the pieces that I had marked, (produces them); I went to search his lodgings, and then he said, it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour, or use any threat? - A. Not at all; he said, he had taken it out of No. 20, that is one of the warehouses that was full of indigo; he said, he had about a pound at home, that he took it when he went home to dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are there any other persons among the bull-porters, than those you have just mentioned? - A. There are not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100089"></xptr>Q. This privy is upon the open wharf? - A.It is close to the water-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore every person on the wharf has access to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a very tall man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he might have seen this indigo there? - A. It is a dark place, generally used for paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore in feeling for paper, he might have felt the indigo? - A. He might certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Was he a labourer in your warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- Fox sworn. - I am clerk to these gentlemen: I took a candle and lanthorn after the prisoner was brought into the accompting-house, and in the yard, between the privy and the accompting-house, I found several pieces of indigo, among them were two pieces marked

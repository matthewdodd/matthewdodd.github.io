I missed a silver tankard last Tuesday was se'nnight, about twelve at night. I advertised it, and found it the Saturday following upon the prisoner at the bar, cut to pieces. I saw the constable take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your house did you miss it from?</p>
               <p>Gallant. It was lost from out of a club room up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Gallant. He had used my house before, and behaved well; I never mistrusted him. He was there the night I missed it. When he was taken before Justice Fielding he confessed that it was my tankard ; it is cut in so small pieces I can't swear to it. Produced in court, cut in pieces almost as small as barley corns.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the nineteenth instant, and offered me these pieces of silver to sell. He produces a small parcel. I had seen him before, but did not know his name. I knew he was a taylor; I asked him his name, he said it was John Brindal, and that he was a periwigmaker. Then I stopped it, and he said he'd go and fetch the man he had it to sell for, but did not return. I advertised it and described the man; he was taken; that taken out of his pocket, and this which I stopped weighed much about the weight of the tankard, according to the prosecutor's account of the weight. I have sold him goods, but never heard any ill of him before this.</p>

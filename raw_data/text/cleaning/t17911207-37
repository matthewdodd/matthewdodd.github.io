Calvert and Co.; I observed they took a sledge and a barrel, nothing else; I observed a difference in the sound, that there was something in the barrels as they came towards Petticoat-lane, and empty when they returned; I took the prisoners the 19th of November, about four in the morning; the two first prisoners were coming again along with the sledge, and a barrel and tub upon it, as usual; I jumped across, and stopped the horse; Tiresman asked me what right I had to stop it; I told him I understood it was spirits or gin; he said, no, nothing but yeast from Mr. Calvert's; I said it was my duty to stop him; if he would go to the watch-house, we had officers that were looking after smugglers; he said, we will go back, and leave the sledge here; I said no, and they went with the sledge to the watch-house; they walked in; they saw no officers; I told them they would be there presently; with that, Tiresman says, we may as well shoot this barrel down here, and go for another turn, and by that time your officers will be come; I went and fetched the beadle, and the prisoner Tiresman shewed us a key of a storehouse, marked Rupert-street, Whitechapel; we told him he had better tell where he brought it from; he said, from Mr. Calvert's; the prisoners were secured; in the barrel there was yeast, and nothing in the tub, that I look upon to be a receiver; I did not go to Watmore after the 19th.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Leather-lane. On the 2nd of Novem<lb></lb>ber I was near the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner—I saw her try every door—at last she went to the prosecutor's—the street-door was open—she went into the house, into the back yard, and came out with something in her apron—I gave an alarm, and stopped her—she threw the things down—I picked them up—the prosecutor claimed them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I met a person whom I knew in Leather-lane; I told her my troubles, and she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pint of beer; she said she had no more with her, but if I would come with her she would make me a pre<lb></lb>sent of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she went away, came again, and said she had got something, but could not bring it out; I then went to her home, as she said, and she said, "You go and pledge my child's petticoat and my own." I went, and found them wrapped up with the trowsers—I was to come to her at Hatton-garden, but before I could get there the witness took me. I looked to see if I could see the woman, but could not, and I afterwards heard she did not live there.</p>

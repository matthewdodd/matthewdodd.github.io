                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wilkins, a brass-founder, in Great wild-street. On the 16th of April, I went out about ten o'clock in the evening—I lodge on the first floor—the door was shut, but not locked, I returned in about two minutes—I only went next door—I had shut the street door, and found it open—I went up-stairs, and found my room door open, and the prisoner in the room, standing by the window—I asked who she wanted, twice—she made no answer, but brushed towards the door; I laid hold of her and said, "What have you been doing here?"—she put her hand into mine, with two half-crowns, one shilling, and a half-penny, and said, "This is all I have got"—I said, "This is not mine, you shall not go"—she then threw down four gowns, two shifts, four towels, a handkerchief, and a petticoat, which belong to me—they were in her lap, under her cloak—I lost no money—I had left all the things in a drawer, except a dress which hung by the room door.</p>

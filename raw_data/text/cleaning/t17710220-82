            . I attended this court in December sessions. I took down the trial of lieutenant Hay, who was prosecuted by the prisoner at the bar for robbing him of a bundle of wearing apparel, specified in the indictment. The prisoner, in his evidence, swore, that he called in by accident at the City of Bristol, a public house near Iron Gate; that he had a porter with him, who had the bundle containing the things mentioned in the indictment. That Mr. Hay came into the house; that then he (the prisoner) ordered the porter to take the bundle away; that Mr. Hay insisted upon it he would have them; that there was a scuffle between Mr. Hay and the porter: that a press gang belonging to Mr. Hay came up to the porter with their clubs, which obliged him to deliver it to Mr. Hay; that Mr. Hay gave it to one of his men, and ordered him to lock it up for his (Mr. Hay's) use. Upon his cross examination, he said, he bought the goods for one

            's rendezvous, which was in the City of Bristol, a public house, at Iron Gate. At half an hour after six in the evening, I was in the public kitchen by myself, writing a letter: I might be there about ten minutes; one of our people came to me, and said there was a man in the tap-room wanted to speak with me. I asked him his business; he said he was come with an information to press a man. I asked where he was; he said he did not know, but begg'd I would go into the tap room. The prisoner at the bar and the landlord came into the kitchen to me with some gin; they asked me to drink I said to the prisoner, For what acquaintance? he said, he had come with an information. I said, if I must go, I must: I drank a glass of gin, and three of our people went along with me. Going along, I asked where it was to; he said, to the Queen's Head on Tower-hill. I asked who was there; he said, the second mate of a vessel was there now shipping hands. He said, there were two ways to go into the house: he said, you and I will go in at one door, your ship-mate and you at the other. The prisoner sat down; I did not take him to be the landlord of the house, I took him to be a stranger till afterwards; he said he would pay for the liquor. He sat down, and took a pipe, and kindled it. I called for some beer; the landlady was sitting. I said to her, Have you here a mate of a vessel shipping hands? she said, No, he was not there. Then a girl comes to me, and said it was treachery. I said to the other people, it is time for us to be going: what we drank we paid for, and came away. After we had been at the City of Bristol about ten minutes, a messenger came to us to go up again to Smith's; I said, they are only playing tricks with us, it is to no purpose to go: this was between seven and eight on Saturday. Afterwards the prisoner came in, and a porter with him with a bundle of clothes under his arm: they came into the kitchen, and a man, that I found afterwards to be Kennedy, stood just by the fire. The prisoner took the two-arm'd-chair, and sat down by the fire; he pointed to the man, and said aloud to me, that is your man. He was very well dress'd. Kennedy and I went up to him, and said, Pray, Sir, have you any protection? he said, None at all. I said, What are you? he said, Second mate of the Eagle, and bound to the Bay of Honduras. I was obliged to detain him till my officer came in. Kennedy look'd round to Smith, and said, Is this your friendship to me to betray me? Smith turn'd it off with a laugh; and then Kennedy, going to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200071"></xptr> the table where the bundle of things were laid, took it off, and put it on the copper. Then Smith took them off, and said, These are mine, and delivered them to the porter again: the porter set them on the table. Then Kennedy said, They are not yours, they are mine. Kennedy took them from the porter again, and delivered them to me. Words then ensued; Kennedy said, I insist upon it you take care of these; they are my property. Just about that time Mr. Hay came in, he said, William, what is the matter here? I said, Here is a man I have detained that has no protection. Mr. Hay said, Friend, what ship do you belong to? he said, The Eagle, bound to the Bay of Honduras. Mr. Hay said, he must send him on board the tender. Kennedy spoke to Mr. Hay, and said, those were his things, and begged Mr. Hay would let him have them. Smith said to Mr. Hay, No, they are mine, and he swore they were. Mr. Hay said, My honest men, or my lads, if you will come on Monday morning on board the tender, or here to my rendezvous (I can't say which) the right owner shall have them; then I was ordered to carry them up to the rendezvous to take care of them till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you ordered to carry the goods then?</p>
               <p>Williams. Up into the rendezvous room, where Mr. Hay and the rest of the gentlemen did their business. After that I came down; Smith and Kennedy still had words about the things: Smith said they were his, and Kennedy said they were his: Kennedy said, Do you or not owe me money? Smith said, No: Kennedy said, You owe me the sum of four guineas; he repeated it, and the second time Smith owned he owed Kennedy the sum of four guineas. Kennedy asked him the third time; then he denied that he owed him four guineas. Monday was the regulating day; I went on board the tender on Monday. As I was walking the deck, pretty near twelve o'clock, I saw Smith there. Kennedy was then in the hold; Mr. Hay was in the cabin. Smith asked me what was to be done with the clothes; I said he would hear presently. He said, Why they are mine. I said, You heard what our lieutenant told you on Saturday. He said, Here is the receipt; I bought the things. I said, Why did you presume to come down to our house to have this man press'd? I imagine you bought these things for the man to have if he went on board his ship quietly; he said yes' but he wanted a whore; he turn'd it off with a laugh, and swore he would play the devil with our lieutenant. The clothes were sent on board by order of the regulating captain: I imagine Kennedy had the clothes afterwards; no person touched them except myself and Kennedy, and the porter: he never had his hand on them; he only saw them under my arm.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You pressed Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the cloaths into the house?</p>
               <p>Williams. The porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the porter with?</p>
               <p>Williams. Along with Smith and Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose servant did the porter appear to you to be, upon your oath?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe, on my oath, he must be Smith's servant, as having the cloaths with him.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the porter and Smith remained there, the porter, to rest himself, I suppose, had put the bundle on the table?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; and put himself down by the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. The porter had never quitted the possession of the bundle?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not till such time as Kennedy took them from the table.</p>
               <p>Q. The man never voluntarily parted with the possession of his bundle?</p>
               <p>William. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, did he sit upon them?</p>
               <p>Williams. No; he sat-down along-side of them, on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What could be the intention of the porter sitting down by the bundle?</p>
               <p>Williams. It might be till he delivered them up to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Kennedy went and took them away. Were they on the bench or table?</p>
               <p>Williams. On the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did the porter part with them willingly?</p>
               <p>Williams. The porter never mentioned a word, nor a single syllable; he sat still.</p>
               <p>Q. He did nothing, nor said nothing to stop them?</p>
               <p>Williams. I cannot say the very particulars of what the porter said.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear, that the porter did or said nothing to prevent Kennedy's taking them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200072"></xptr>Williams. He did not move, and, to the best of my remembrance, he did not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of them?</p>
               <p>Williams. He had not his hand on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith speak immediately?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; he said, They are mine. When Kennedy put them down on the copper, Smith jumped up, and took them from the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the copper from the table?</p>
               <p>Williams. About two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy catch them up in a hurry?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, it might be so; he took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. So Smith went and fetched them?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was sitting by the fire, in a two armed chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith by that shew he would not part with the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Williams. He told the porter to take care of them, for they were his goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he deliver them to the porter again?</p>
               <p>Williams. He put them down on the table a second time, and bid the porter take care of them; he put them down by the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy say any thing to that, or give any reason why he should not do it?</p>
               <p>Williams. Kennedy went to the table again, and took them from the table, and gave them to me, and insisted upon my taking care of them for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that objected to by Smith?</p>
               <p>Williams. Smith said, they were his, but he did not offer to take them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the press gang were round him at this time?</p>
               <p>Williams. I and

            , and there might be one more; and Mrs. Gibson and her sister.</p>
               <p>Q. When Smith still persisted in having his cloaths, where did Mr. Hay order them to be carried?</p>
               <p>Williams. To the rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a public room?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; used by him and his officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the evidence you gave at the last trial?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give evidence that Mr. Hay ordered them to be carried up to his own room?</p>
               <p>Williams. That was not mentioned; that is to the rendezvous or his room; he rented the room at so much a week, but did not lodge there: he had another room.</p>

            . I was present when Kennedy was press'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy and Smith come together?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes; and a porter with them. The porter had a bundle of clothes under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to press him?</p>
               <p>Barton. Smith pointed to him, and said that was the man: he had been down before with an information.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said about the bundle of clothes?</p>
               <p>Barton. After he was pressed he went up to the porter, and took the cloaths, and put them on the copper. I believe the clothes were lying on the table near the porter; whether under his arm, or lying on the table, I cannot tell. Kennedy laid them on the copper; Smith, I believe, went and took the clothes; either Smith or the porter took them from the copper, and the porter had them in possession again. Smith demanded the clothes, and said they were his property. Kennedy talked to him, said several words to Smith: Kennedy said the clothes were his: Smith said they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after Mr. Hay came in?</p>
               <p>Barton. Before: he was not in the house at that time; he came in about four or five minutes after it was over, and the clothes were in our possession: the last witness had the clothes under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Hay came into the room what passed then?</p>
               <p>Barton. He asked what was the matter; I told him about the man being press'd. Smith said the clothes were his. Mr. Hay said, Good man, I cannot tell who the clothes belong to; but whoever they belong to, they shall have them. Kennedy insisted upon his keeping them for him, for they were his property. Kennedy insisted that as he was pressed, we should take care of them for him. Mr. Hay bid us carry them up into his room till Monday, and whoever they belonged to, should have them: he said so before Mr. Smith, and before all. Smith said but very little; then Kennedy insisted upon it they were his, and delivered them to us. He said the clothes belonged to him, and insisted upon our taking care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a talk of money owing between Kennedy and Smith?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200073"></xptr>Barton. Kennedy charged Smith with owing him money; the man was carried on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on Monday on the regulating day what passed?</p>
               <p>Barton. I was not on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw all this scuffle about the clothes between Smith and Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Barton. I saw him take the clothes from the porter, and delivered them to this Williams.</p>
               <p>Q. Kennedy, you say, insisted upon your taking care of the clothes for him?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the people of the gang?</p>
               <p>Barton. Yes; he insisted we should take care of the clothes for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Hay do; where did he order them to be carried?</p>
               <p>Barton. Up stairs, in the room: I cannot say whether he mentioned rendezvous room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith at that time say he had not parted with the clothes?</p>
               <p>Barton. Smith said at that time the clothes belonged to him; Kennedy insisted upon it they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Smith say he had bought them that afternoon, and had not been paid for them; did not he offer to shew a bill and receipt?</p>
               <p>Barton. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they carried into Mr. Hay's room?</p>
               <p>Barton. In the rendezvous room; he does not lodge there.</p>

            . I was present on Saturday at the City of Bristol; Mr. Smith, Kennedy, and the porter came in together: the porter had a bundle with clothes in it: when they came in, the press-gang press'd this Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to press him?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Smith came before with an information for them to press him: he pointed to him, and said, That is the man. Kennedy said he gave Smith a note to receive 4 l. for him, and he bought the clothes for him to go on board that evening. Kennedy said they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hay take the clothes to himself?</p>
               <p>Gibson. He never touch'd them at all: he said the right owner should have them on Monday, when the man that was press'd was regulated.</p>
               <p>Q. Each claim'd the cloaths and took them away.</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes; then Mr. Hay said he would order the clothes to be laid aside, and the right owner should have them on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard what was said by Kennedy at the time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I heard some words.</p>
               <p>Q. All that Kennedy said was that Mr. Smith had bought the clothes for him that afternoon; that he had given him a note to receive 4 l. of his wages. He did not say he had them delivered to him; Kennedy said Smith owed him money; they did not agree in their story?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No.</p>

            . Smith pointed to the man, and said, That is your man. They went and asked him what he was, and if he had a protection; he said, No; he was mate of the Eagle; it lay at Union stairs, bound for Banduras. There was some clothes, in a bundle, a porter brought in under his arm, that was put down on the kitchen table. The porter sat down on a bench by the table. Then as soon as Kennedy found he was press'd, he said, You villain! is this the way you brought me here to be betray'd. He went to the table, and took the clothes from the table, and put them on the copper. Smith said they belonged to him; Kennedy said they did not. Kennedy said they belonged to me, and besides that you know you owe me four guineas, and I have got your note for it. Smith denied it; at last he own'd he did owe him four guineas. Mr. Hay came in at this time; he said, Lads, what is the matter? Williams said, a man is press'd. Kennedy went up to Captain

               <p>Hay. It was about seven in the evening when I came in, or a little after. I found at my rendezvous three or four people in the kitchen. I desired to know the reason of the confusion; I found them a little confused. Smith and the men that were impressed were disputing about a bundle of clothes. When I came to be informed of the matter, that the man had no protection, I said, Very well my lad, I will put you on board the tender; and as for the clothes, whose property they are, that matter should be settled before the regulating captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Kennedy insist upon their being his own clothes in your presence?</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes; each of them claimed a right to the clothes: I was not at liberty to know whose property they were. I ordered the clothes up into my rendezvous room (a large room I do business in) till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smith any objection to their being put aside in order to being kept till Monday?</p>
               <p>Hay. I don't remember in the least that he made any objection.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday did you go on board the tender.</p>
               <p>Hay. Yes, I did; and the captains, as they usually do, asked the men if he had any chest and bedding, or clothes: he said he had a bundle of clothes, his property, at my rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith there then?</p>
               <p>Hay. I did not see Smith at all.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom were the clothes delivered?</p>
               <p>Hay. To the master of the tender; for which a receipt was given.</p>

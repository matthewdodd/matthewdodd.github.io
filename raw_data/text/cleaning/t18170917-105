            . I am an officer. On the 26th of July, I went to the prisoner's house at Woodford, about ten o'clock at night; I told him I took him into custody for stealing fowls, and asked him where the other man was that was at Leadenhall-market with him that morning, he said he had not been to Leadenhall-market that morning nor had any man with him, but he had been to Billingsgate, as he generally did, leaving Woodford at four o'clock in the morning, to deal in fish, and if there was no fish he dealt in vegetables, and that he never dealt in fowls; after pressing him a great deal on our way to town, he said he remembered taking a man up on the road with a basket, I asked him what was in it, he said he did not know, he said he took the man to Leadenhall-market, and was to have 6d for it; I saw his cart, it had a great flat basket in it which fitted to the bottom, it appeared to be made for the purpose. It was not like a fish-cart.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WEST. On the 24th of July, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18170917-12-crimeloc66">Fleet-market</placeName>

I immediately felt my watch drawn out of my fob; I laid hold of Dixon, and told her I had lost my watch, and she was the cause of it. Rowland passed me very quickly, and joined his companion. I took Dixon to the watch-house. I described the man to Collingwood, and he said, "it must be Rowland." I am sure he is the man. Dixon said it was not Rowland, but she knew who it was.</p>
               <p>RICHARD COLLINGWOOD. I am a patrol. On the 24th of July, West brought Dixon to the watch-house, and described the man to me; the description answered to Rowland, who lived with Dixon; the next day I met Rowland and secured him. West said he was the man.</p>
               <p>JAMES MESSANT. I am a constable. Dixon said she knew who it was but she would not tell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman-saddler and harness-maker, and live in East-street, Marylebone. I work for Mr. Kipps, coach-maker, in Great Marylebone-street—on Saturday, the 27th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in East-street, coming home—I had a small parcel with me, containing a few articles, which I had been purchas<lb></lb>ing—I saw four persons standing talking together—they appeared to me to be in company—I knew them all by sight well—the prisoner, who was one of them, came up to me, and said, "Old <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> are you going to give me any thing to drink?"—I said, "No, I am going home"—immediately afterwards he caught me round the waist with his left arm, held me tight, and, with his right hand, caught hold of my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and tore it clean out—he held me, and took it by force—it contained a half-sovereign, a half-crown, four shillings, a sixpence, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In coppers—I am quite certain that was in my pocket—one of the other men, named Burns, immediately came up, and knocked me down—they all four then ran down Dock-court—I immediately got up, and called "Police" as loud as I could, but there was no one handy—I went into Baker-street, met two policemen, and told them—I described the men to them, and told them how they were dressed—I then went home—f was called up about three quarters of an hour afterwards by a policeman—I went to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and saw the prisoner there in custody—I knew him perfectly well as soon as I saw him—I positively swear he is the man that took my waistcoat-pocket and money—Burns was taken into custody the same night, about half an hour after.</p>

I was coming down East-street about half-past twelve o'clock on this Saturday night, and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could, at the top of East-street and Davis-street—seeing him look back several times, I thought something was wrong—I afterwards heard of the robbery, and tried to find the prosecutor, but he had gone another way—I met the two policemen he spoke to, who told</p>

               <p>me where he lived—I went to his house, and told him I thought I could apprehend the party—as I went to the station-house I met the prisoner going down Thayer-street—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of com<lb></lb>mitting a robbery in East-street—he said, "I don't know any thing about it"—I took him to the station-house—the prosecutor came there, and identified him directly—I also took the other three—at least, two of them came to the station-house, and Burns I took in Oxford-street—the prose<lb></lb>cutor identified him as well, and said be was the one that bad knocked him down—they were all four taken before the Magistrate, Mr. Rawlinson—the prisoner was committed, and the other three kept all day, and discharged at night—I found a half-crown and three shillings on the prisoner—I had teen them all four together, drinking, after the robbery took place; and I also saw them all four together not five minutes before it took place.</p>

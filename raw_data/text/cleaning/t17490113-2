               <p>Hen. Jackson. On the 30th of Dec. I lost out of a little cupboard 9 different remnants of gold lace, 170 l. in cash; to the best of my knowledge there were 120 guineas and the rest Portugal gold, one bank note payable to one Lefeavor.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner at the bar that took those things?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He was my near relation and servant; he told me the 30th of Dec. he would stay no longer with me, and went away about half an hour after 8 that morning: my workmen after he was gone told me they had seen him with more money than they thought he could honestly come by, of late: then, after missing these things,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174901130003"></xptr> I got a relation to go to take him, who found him in Cheapside; I was sent for, he confest the fact, I put him in a coach, and he carried me to a Jew who keeps a little buckle-stall under the Baptist's head 21alehouse, Holborn; there I found all the money within about 12 pounds; the Jew took the money and note out of a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of the money here or the note?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, my lord, the prisoner said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

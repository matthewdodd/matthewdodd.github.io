                  </hi> I live at Praed-street, Paddington, and am in the employ of the Great Western Railway Company. On 26th March I fell in company with the two prisoners, and went with then to a lodging-house in George-street, Lisson-grove—we had some gin—I had my watch and some money—when I went to bed I put my watch under my head in my trowsers-pocket—when I awoke, between two and three o'clock in the morning, the prisoners were gone, and my trowers were lying by my side—my watch was gone, and the chain, worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a purse containing 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had opened my purse in the prisoners' presence when I sent for the gin.</p>

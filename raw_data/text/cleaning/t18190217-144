On the 1st of February, I missed a parcel of wool-cards; I went to Giles, and asked him to go to Smithfield with me, to ask the prisoner if he had taken any away or not. We went, and found him at his workshop, in the pig-market - he was a <rs id="t18190217-144-deflabel833" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

               <p>"Are you sure of that." He said</p>
               <p>"I am sure I have no cards, belonging to any one." Giles then said,</p>
               <p>"Have you robbed Mr. Fairburn of any cards." He said,</p>
               <p>"No; me rob Mr. Fairburn - I would sooner loose my last drop of blood, than rob him." He said he was sure he had no cards belonging to me - I remained with him, while Giles went for an officer. Harker, the officer, asked him if he had any? he said No. The officer then asked whose chest is this? he said it was his; the officer told him to open it, to let him see if there was any cards in it; he said he could not, for he had not got the key. Harker pulled out a hand-cuff; and said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not let us look into it, I must take you to the Compter, box and all, and I can get the box open there." Seeing the hand-cuffs, he asked to speak to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have some cards in my box, but I will show you how I got them." He opened a trap-door, and said,</p>
               <p>"I got them out of here last Sunday - Mr. Fell put them here." The trap-door leads to Fell's room. He said he put them into his chest to secure them for me. Harker said he had better open the chest, and let us see them - he said the officer might break it open - the prisoner took the screw-driver, and broke it open himself, and there were seven pair of wool-cards. He was taken to the Compter, and gave 
               <persName id="t18190217-144-person1254">Cameron</persName>
             the key of a chest, at his lodgings, in Air-street-hill, and said he would find three or four more pair there. I went to his lodgings, and found seven pair more of cards in the chest, and other things belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You employed the prisoner to make you a frame - A. Yes, it was not finished I - never authorized the prisoner to take the cards. I sold some to a man, named Marshall, but they were a different sort - I never sold anybody any of this sort.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner with Fairburn, and asked him if he had any of his property? he said No, and rather than rob Fairburn, he would part with the last drop of his blood; I asked him to open the chest? he said he would not, but I might break it open; I said I would not, but it would be a satisfaction to Fairburn to see if any of his cards were there - he said he would not. I got an officer. He denied having any cards whatever, in the box. The officer produced the hand-cuffs, and said he must take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170058"></xptr>him to the Compter, box and all. He then broke the box open himself, and seven pair of cards were taken out - seven pair more were found at his lodgings on Air-street-hill.</p>

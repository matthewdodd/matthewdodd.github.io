            , in Bridgewater-Gardens, Mr Molineux being out of town, Mrs Molineux desir'd me to go along with her to the Mansion-house, to get a search-warrant from my Lord Mayor; after which I and one of the deputy's servants, went in order to search the apartments in Mr Warren's house, belonging to the prisoner Lloyd. I found nothing in his chamber; but I found a padlock on a garret door. I ask'd whose room that was. Lloyd said, it was his room. I desir'd to look in it; he pull'd out a key and let me in. We search'd. It was a kind of a a lumber-room; there we found the things mentioned in the indictment, which I took an account of before his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention them.</p>
               <p>Chantrell. There were an iron chafing-dish, an iron stove-grate, one iron fender, one box iron, two pair of heaters, five gimlets, three papers of files, about a thousand of nails; an iron hand-vice, a parcel of brass rings, two knots of jack-line, two knots of pack-thread, and one ring of wire, part iron, and part brass. I ask'd him how he came by these things. He said, he had bought part of them of an Ironmonger in Barbican, and part of them at an Ironmonger's in Colman-street, and part in Morefields, and could bring the people of whom he bought them. I told him, I hop'd he would bring them along with him. Then I dispatch'd a constable that was with us to go and take the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He was a hired servant in Mr Molineux's house, in the capacity of a porter. Then the two prisoners at the bar were brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300015"></xptr> to the Mansion-house, before Sir Crisp Gascoyne and Mr Alderman Rawlinson; Hoskins acknowledg'd that he had stole all these things, at divers times; and that they were his master's property; and that he did it at Lloyd's infrigation: Sir Crisp ask'd him, if Lloyd gave him a valuable price for them; he said, some times he would give him six-pence; sometimes a shilling; and was very frequent in treating him with beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Lloyd present at this time?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He was; and the goods were there also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr Molineux's servant swear to any of the goods?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He swore particularly to the iron chafing-dish; there was their own shop-mark upon it; and another servant was there, and he swore to the nails and gimblets, to be Mr Molineux's property, to the best of his knowledge: after that, Lloyd did acknowledge he had purchas'd the chasing dish and nails of Hoskins. Sir Crisp ask'd what he gave for them? He said 6 d. and two full pots of beer. Then Sir Crisp ask'd the servant, What these things were worth? He said, they stood his master in upwards of 4 s. Then Lloyd was order'd to withdraw, and Hoskins was examin'd. Hoskins acknowledg'd, he had carry'd

Lloyd was ask'd afterwards concerning the stove-grate; he said at first, he could bring the person he bought it of; but when he heard Hoskins say he sold it him, he acknowledg'd he had it of Hoskins. Then Sir Crisp committed one to the Poultry-Counter; and the other to Wood-street Counter.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lloyd very willingly show you the goods in the garret?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. I told him the door must be open'd, and we rummag'd our selves.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before he open'd the door?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He said, there was nothing there but what he could give an account of.</p>

He confirmed the evidence given by Mr Chantrell, with this addition: that Lloyd would often come and drink with Hoskins; that the chasing dish was mark'd with chalk by his own hand; and he knew the nails to be his master's property, by the mark on the paper they were in, mark'd by the eldest apprentice; the gimblets were mark'd with the proper shop-mark; and that the stove-grate was worth fifteen or sixteen shillings; and that Hoskins had behaved well and honestly, to all appearance, 'till he got acquainted with Lloyd.</p>

            . I was sent for to the Mansion-house this day fortnight, when the two prisoners at the bar were under examination before Sir Crisp Gascoyne and Mr Alderman Rawlinson. I was ask'd if I knew any thing of them goods; I look'd over them, and found there were nothing mark'd by me, only one thousand of nails, and one single gimblet: the gimblets are commonly put in bundles of straw, a dozen in a bundle; I heard Hoskins own the taking of every thing; and that they were the property of my master Deputy Molineux.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Lloyd by at the time?</p>
               <p>Middleton. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Lloyd say upon his examination?</p>
               <p>Middleton. He, on his first examination, denyed buying any thing of Hoskins; but said, he bought them at three different places: but after that, he own'd (when Hoskins said he sold them to him) that he bought every thing that was produc'd of Hoskins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say what he gave for them?</p>
               <p>Middleton. Hoskins said, Lloyd gave him sometimes six-pence, sometimes a shilling; sometimes more, sometimes less.</p>

            . I rent a house in Bridgewater-gardens;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300016"></xptr> Lloyd lodg'd in my house; the prisoner Hoskins us'd to come and stand in the street, over-against the window where Lloyd lodg'd, and would call, (hollow, Lloyd) then the other would come down immediately and let him in; they would go up, and when they came down, Lloyd would say, Tom, when will you come again? I want such and such a thing; once he named a set of cannisters; said Hoskins, I cannot tell when I can come again, but as soon as possible I can, I will. The next time he came, he repeated the same, hollow, Lloyd, Lloyd at that time was very busy, having a carpenter making a bedstead in his room; he did not hear the first call.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Warren. I remember, the second time was on the nineteenth of March last; between the hours of eight and nine at night; Hoskins open'd my street-door and went up stairs; and staid a little while; then they both came down into my yard; there Hoskins took out a lock, from two sheets of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lock was it?</p>
               <p>Warren. It was a large street-door lock; he gave it to Lloyd; they tried it, to see whether the key went free or not; Hoskins said, you must go to a Smith; he will do it for you, for a pot of beer; there were two keys to it. Lloyd said, God bless you, my prince; Hoskins said, for the world, do not let the Carpenter see this lock: no, said the other, I'll take care he shall not see it; but when will you come again, my prince? They took their leave of one another; and parted; Lloyd carried the lock and put it openly in the garret, in a washing tub.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Warren. My wife and I went up stairs afterwards to satisfy ourselves in it; and there we saw it lying, with the two keys: Lloyd us'd generally to say; my prince, when will you come again? God bless you; I wish you a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there at the time of searching?</p>
               <p>Warren. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lock found in the garret?</p>
               <p>Warren. No; Lloyd took it out the morning after Hoskins left it; and where he carry'd it I do not know; he went with it into Red-cross-street; and came home without it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it when he carried it out?</p>
               <p>Warren. I saw the shape of it in his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. from Hoskins. Do not you think Lloyd made me in liquor several times?</p>
               <p>Warren. No; I never saw that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear him importune me to stay and drink?</p>

            . I am wife to the last witness; I have very often seen Hoskins come with something to Lloyd, in a sack; but what, I do not know; he us'd to call at the window, hollow, Lloyd; Lloyd us'd to come down, and oblige him to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day did he usually come?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. Always in the evening, or in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long time has he made a practice in coming to Lloyd?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. He has come too-and-again to him, for upwards of ten months: he came one Sunday morning between four and five; and call'd at the window, as before; and we were all in bed; his usual time in the morning, was about five, or betwixt four and five; and on evenings, he us'd to come at nine, ten, or eleven o'clock; I remember that Sunday morning, which was in February, I got up and open'd my door a-jar; I saw a ring of iron wire, with some brass wire, on the inside; he carried in into Lloyd's room, and left it there; Lloyd came out again, and let him out at the door, and told him he wanted some brass rings; and ask'd him if he had any in his master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of rings?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. They were to put upon curtains: Hoskins told him, there were some in his master's shop, and he would bring him some; Lloyd said, when? he said, he could not tell; he ask'd him to come on the Wednesday and Saturday night; he said he could not, because he had his master's shop to clean out; but would come as soon as he could: I once saw the shape of a round fender, in a bag, on Hoskins's back; which he carried through the entry up stairs to Lloyd; and always when he came, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300017"></xptr> used to make him punch or give him drams or fetch strong beer for him; Hoskin's was always very fearful of seeing me, he used to slide out and hang down his head.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he has given him punch and such liquors you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. I have seen him fetch punch and strong beer when Hoskins has come on nights, and have seen punch on his table afterwards; and heard Lloyd say he should stay and drink a little tiff with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the room at such a time?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. No: but the door has been ajar, and I have look'd in.</p>
               <p>Hoskins's defence.</p>
               <p>This man first inticed me, by getting me in liquor; I'll do myself justice, I have taken many a thousand pounds for my master, and never mole a mistake in my life.</p>

I bought a chafing-dish of him; I told him I had no more money in my pocket but a shilling, and I paid him seven-pence half-penny towards the reckoning; and said, I'll pay you the remainder the next time I see you; I paid for every thing time after time.</p>

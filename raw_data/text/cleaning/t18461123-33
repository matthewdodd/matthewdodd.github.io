               <p>urgency about it he had better make application elsewhere—I believe I took him with me to Mr. Smee, the chief accountant at the Bank, to know if this was sufficient authority, but I may have gone alone—I saw Mr. Smee, who said, "Let him write a request to make the transfer without his wife"—the person attended at the Bank and wrote this request himself on the back of the paper (A)—I attended at the Bank the same day, and sold the stock on account of the person who wrote that request—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the transfer</hi>) I identified the person making this transfer as George Edwards—I took him to be George Edwards on the representation of the young man, Mr. Bailey's clerk, who was under age, and the Bank would not allow him to identify—I presumed the young man knew him—the stock was sold to Clement Smith, stock-broker and jobber—I received the purchase-money from him, which I believe was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and which I paid the person I identified, and who I understood to be George Edwards—I gave Bailey the commission and ren<lb></lb>dered him an account of it.</p>

I was formerly clerk to Mr. Bailey, a stock-broker, of Lothbury, for two years and two months—I am twenty years old—I was in Mr. Bailey's employ in Jan. 1842—he is occasionally out of town—Mr. Crompton was in the same business, and lived on the same floor as Mr. Bailey—when Mr. Bailey was out of town Mr. Bullock transacted the business, and when both were out of town Mr. Crompton acted for him—I remember a person coming in Jan., 1842, to effect a transfer of some stock—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man—he came to the office when I was there by myself, and said he wanted to know whether he could sell some stock without bringing his wife there—that is a very Unusual occurrence when stock stands in the name of man and wife—he produced this note, pur<lb></lb>porting to be from his wife—I am not aware that he told me what the stock was—I read the paper myself—I cannot tell whether he produced a stock receipt—I do not know that he told me why his wife was absent—I fetched Mr. Crompton, who came into Mr. Bailey's room—this paper was lying on the table—I am sure this is the paper—I believe I looked at it while he was conversing with Mr. Crompton—he told Mr. Crompton he came from the country, and was rather urgent about having the stock sold—he said his wife: could not come from the country, either from indisposition or being in em<lb></lb>ployment, I am not certain which—he showed the paper to Mr. Crompton—I relieve Mr. Crompton said he did not think it could be allowed without laving a power of attorney to do it—at the same time, Mr. Crompton said he would take him over to Mr. Smee, the chief accountant—he took him there—I did not go with them—they may have been absent half an hour—I do not think they returned together—the same person came back again to stay till it</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Arnold, a cabinet-maker, at Newark. I know the prisoner—I was acquainted with him first about five years ago, for about a year and a half—I knew him by the name of Henry Barratt—I have seen him write many times—the name George Edwards in this transfer is very much like his writing—this request to the chief account<lb></lb>tant is in his writing, and the whole of this note (A), except the signature, is very much like his writing, but I am positive the other side is—(<hi rend="italic">this was the request to act, both being on the same paper.</hi>)</p>

Q.</hi> Which do you say is not his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The sig<lb></lb>nature to the letter, and this, "Allowed by the deputy-governor, W. Smee"—I say both the papers are his writing—I said this side was like his writing—it is his writing, but he was agitated when he wrote it, I can see that—I have not a doubt about this part—on the other side, all except "Allowed," &amp;c, is his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bloomsbury-street—in 1828 I, with others, set on foot a society called the Royal Standard Benefit Society—in Nov., 1835, the prisoner joined the society in the name of Henry Hitchcock Barratt, and continued a member till Jan. 1842, when he was excluded for non-payment—while he was a member I had communications from him, and have seen him write on other matters not connected with the benefit society—I believe this letter(A), except the signature "S. Edwards," to be his writing—this demand to act on the other side of the paper decidedly is—it is still more apparent—the signature, and the whole of it except the memorandum at the bottom, is his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever seen him write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not often—I have no doubt of its being his—I have had communications from him some times, and acted on them—I have seen him write in connection with a loan</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold-beater, and live in Eccleston-street—I know George Edwards and his wife—I have known Mrs. Edwards for the last twenty years—her maiden name was Sarah Swift—I have known Edwards since he has been married, which was in 1840—my father is a builder—I remember Mrs. Edwards coming to my father in the spring of 1840—I do not recollect what month it was—I believe my father went somewhere with her—I knew her when she was cook to Mr. Handley—she went there as cook, it may be a week or a month after she came to my father—I was then living at Eccleston-street East, Pimlico—in Jan. 1842, the prisoner called on my father—he told me he was butler to Mr. Handley, of Newark, and had come to bring Mrs. Edwards' compliments to Mr. Couldrey, my father—my father is laid up, and has lost his sight—the last time I saw Mrs. Edwards was on the apprehend<lb></lb>sion of the prisoner on the 19th of Sept., at Greenwich—the prisoner was with her—they represented themselves then to be Mr. and Mrs. Jones—the prisoner gave his name Joseph Jones—in April, 1845, I saw Mrs. Edwards, went with her to the bank, and took her to Mr. Peppercorn, a stock-broker, to purchase some stock—in consequence of what passed between us, Mrs. Edwards gave a description of a person to the Bank porter, in my presence, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Bailey's office, in Lothbury—I communicated what I heard there to Mrs. Edwards, and she immediately left the neighbourhood—she left on the Monday following, to go to Newark—I saw her off by the train—on the 4th or 5th of Aug. this year I saw her again at my house—the pri<lb></lb>soner came with her—it was not the first time I had seen him, but the first time I had seen them together—she introduced him to me as her husband Joseph Jones—I recognized him as the man who represented himself as Mr. Handley's butler three or four years back, and came with Mr. Handley's compliments—I said, "Why, you are Barratt"—he said, "No, my name is Jones, I am not Barratt"—Mrs. Edwards replied, "This is my husband; his name is Joseph Jones"—that was all that occurred at the time—I went to Norwood next day—I saw a gold watch in the prisoner's possession last Aug., and recognized it as belonging to George Edwards—in consequence of suspi<lb></lb>cion, after Mrs. Edwards told me, in the prisoner's presence, that her husband was dead, I made a communication to George Edwards's daughter—Mrs. Ed<lb></lb>wards had told me, in the prisoner's presence, that her husband had been dead two years, and pointing to her finger with a ring on it she said, "This la the only man that put that on"—I afterwards accompanied them to Norwood and Greenwich, to look for a beer-shop—in the course of that day Mrs. Edwards addressed him by no other name than Jones—sometimes she addressed him as B., not Mr. B.—she merely used the letter B.—I did not know what that meant—that was besides Jones or Joseph—I have seen the prisoner write seldom, but enough to form a judgment—I received a letter from him on the 28th of Aug. this year, and acted on it—this signature, "George Edwards" to this transfer corresponds with the writing of the letter I received—to the best of my belief, I believe the letter produced (A) to be his writing, except the signature, and should say the demand to act on the other side is his.

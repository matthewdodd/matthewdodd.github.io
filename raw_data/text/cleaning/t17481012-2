               <p>Rose. No, I did not. Mr. Jacobs stopped the prisoner, and advertised the spoon the 17th, and I went to Mr. Jacobs's house and saw the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the spoons you lost, and found at Mr. Jacobs's house?</p>
               <p>Rose. Yes, I was at the Gatehouse to see him, and he desired I would be favourable to him.</p>

             . I live in Hemming's Row by Leicester fields. On the 16th of last month the prisoner at the bar brought this spoon to me, between one and two in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it of him?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. No, my lord, I asked him how he came by it, and he said he bought it of a woman at Hounslow , I said that did not look likely, for I believed it was stole, for there is a Crest upon it, and I told him he should not have the spoon again unless he brought some person of credit to prove how he came by the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. Yes, I carried him before Justice Fraser, and he let him go.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174810120005"></xptr>Q. How did you find the prisoner again?</p>
               <p>Jacobs. He came on the Tuesday following and asked for his spoon, and I carried him before the same Magistrate, and then he owned that he stole the spoon, and it was the first thing that ever he did in his life.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner desired Mr. Rose might be asked whether that spoon was not delivered to him as a pattern for him to engrave the crest on some pewter.</p>
               <p>Rose. Yes, my lord, the fellow came to engrave the crest on some pewter, and he being a dirty looking sort of a fellow I did not care to trust him with the spoon, and he was to come to my house and do it, and he told my maid he wanted 2 spoons, and she let him have them, and he took the opportunity of going off with the 2 spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he them for any other Purpose than to take off the engraving?</p>
               <p>Rose . No, for no other purpose than to engrave the plates.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. The prisoner said he stole the spoons, and sold the other to one of his countrymen.</p>

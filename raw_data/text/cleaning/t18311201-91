On the 25th of November I was at the Royal Hospital public-house, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - I found the prisoner Western in the tap-room; I had never seen her before - I was taking a pot of half and half with a friend, and we asked if she would drink; she said she did not like that, and we called for some rum - my friend then went away; Western asked me to go home with her, which I did - I was sober; I said I would give her half a crown to sleep with her that night - she said she would not take it without I would stand some gin; we got a quartern of gin, and took it to her room in <placeName id="t18311201-91-crimeloc498">Jews'-row, Chelsea</placeName>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 25th of November I was passing at the time Oakes had Richardson and Lee in custody; he gave me information, and I took Western the next morning, at her own lodging, which is some distance from where the prosecutor went to - she said she knew nothing of the robbery; I took her to the watch-house - she then wanted to speak to the prosecutor, and said she had been with him, but knew nothing of the robbery - I searched her room, and found some duplicates, but not belonging to the prosecutor - I found on her 1 1/2d., which she said was all the money she had, and that she was going to pawn a cloak that morning to buy her some soap, but on seaching her room I found three shillings in a card-rack over the fireplace.</p>
               <p>Richardson's Defence. These two females know nothing of the robbery - I was passing the row, and met a girl and a man - they said, "There is a man up in your room;" I told them not to go near the place, but let him be - I went and had half a pint of beer - I then went back to see what man it was. and just as I got to the door the prosecutor ran out, and said he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Western's Defence. I met the prosecutor at the Royal-hospital - he asked me to drink; I staid about a quarter of an hour, and then came out - he came, and asked me where I lived; he was very much in liquor - I said I could not take him to my lodging, but I could go to another room, which we did; Lee came up - he said he preferred her, and I left the room, as he was going to bed.</p>
               <p>Lee's Defence. He asked me if I would go with him; I said Yes, if he paid me - he gave me 1s.; I said I would not go for that, but if he would give me half a crown, as he had the other girl, I would; he would not - Carter then came in, and he asked her to go to bed with him, but would not give her any thing.</p>

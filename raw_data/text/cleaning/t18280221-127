            . I am the wife of Patrick Newman. I had this property in a bundle, on the 26th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, and was going down Fish-street-hill; I saw the two prisoners - one was behind me, the other before me; Stone stooped down, and picked up a ring; I cried, "Halves!" he said, "Did you see me pick up the ring?" I said Yes; he said, "You shall have it for 2s.:" I said, "I don't know the value of it, but I will give you 1s. 6d.," Suthmer then came up, and said, "I saw you pick it up;" he said, "I will stand a drop of gin for you." I went on with them to <placeName id="t18280221-127-crimeloc673">the Minories</placeName>

            . I was at work, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I came down a ladder, and saw the prisoners running; I pursued, and saw them stopped; Stone had the bundle - it was delivered to me; I assisted in taking them to the office.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>STONE'S Defence. I picked up a ring; the prosecutrix came up, and said she had a right to have half; I said at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210091"></xptr>first I had picked up nothing; but she said she saw me pick it up, and tap two ladies on the shoulder; she afterwards said she would leave the bundle with me till she returned with the money; and, finding she did not come with the ring or the money, we went off with the bundle.</p>
               <p>SUTHMER'S Defence. I was going along, and this lady tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "That young man has picked up a ring;" I said, "Why don't you have some of it;" she said "Shall I cry halves?" I said, "As you like;" she said to him, "You have picked up a ring;" he said, Yes; I said, "I am entitled to a part of it:" he said, "I will give you a drop of gin for your's;" that is all I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brewer-street. I saw this waist-cost safe on the 2nd of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon—I was told it was stolen, and I went, by direction of the witness, about ten doors up the street, and overtook the prisoner—I told him he had got a waist-cost of ours—he said he had not, and he opened his coat to show me—I brought him back, and this waistcoat was given out of a shop.</p>

About a quar<lb></lb>ter to three o'clock, on the 2nd of March, I was standing at our shop-door, and saw the prisoner and another go to the prosecutor's, which is nearly opposite—the prisoner took the waistcoat, put it under his coat, and went off—I went and told of it—the witness went after him, and just before he got to him I saw the prisoner take the waistcoat from under his coat and throw it into a grocer's shop—I saw that it was a green waistcoat—I am sure the prisoner is the person—the grocer's young man gave the prose<lb></lb>cutor the waistcoat.</p>

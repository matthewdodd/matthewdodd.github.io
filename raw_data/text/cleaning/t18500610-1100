                  </hi>. I live at 1, Queen-street, Hackney-road. I keep tame pigeons in a pigeon-house at the back of my house—on 16th May, when I went to bed at ten o'clock, I had nineteen pigeons safe—at three in the morning, I was disturbed by a fluttering of pigeons, looked out of window, and saw two men in the yard close to the pigeon-house, and one went in—I undid my clock-weight, opened the window, alarmed them, and as they came out I threw the clock weight at them, and they went off, letting two or three pigeons fly—I called "Stop thief!" heard the policeman coming, and directly after, heard them going over the fence—the policeman brought back one man to the yard, and we found a bag which I saw opened at the station, and it contained four of my pigeons—one of those which was let fly is still missing—it is a young one, and I expect the cats got it.</p>

I ran, and saw the prisoner coming from the back of the prosecutor's, running very fast—when he saw me, he turned and ran in a different direc<lb></lb>tion—I pursued him, and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped by an "N" sergeant—he had no shoes on—we brought him back, and just where I had first seen him I found some shoes which he owned—I did not see him come out of the premises.</p>

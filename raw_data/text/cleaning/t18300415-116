On the 12th of March I lost five glasses out of different carriages; the Policeofficer came and asked me if I had lost any - I went to look, and missed five; they had been right at two o'clock in the morning, when one of the carriages came in - I know nothing of the prisoner; I fitted the glasses which were found into the frames, and they fitted exactly, and appear to be the same kind of glass, but I cannot swear to them -I can swear to the carpet and the check-string; there were four glasses brought in - this carpet has a loop to button on the carriage, and this string has a knot in it, which I tied myself.</p>

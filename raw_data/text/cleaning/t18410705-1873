                  </hi>. I was on my way from Norfolk to Dublin, and on the 25th of June I stopped at a lodging-house kept by Elizabeth Girle, at No. 5, Little Portland-street, which is in the parish of St. James, Westminster, I believe—I went to bed about one o'clock—I was awoke about two by a</p>

On the 26th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of the street door of No. 5, Little Portland-street, with a parcel—I asked where he was going with that parcel so early in the morning—he said he was going to the gar<lb></lb>dens—I stopped him, and examined the parcel—became out into the street—I followed him and saw another constable bring him back—I knocked the landlady up—the parcel contained the articles now produced—I also found in the pocket of the pilot-coat which he was wearing, one sove<lb></lb>reign, half a sovereign, one half-crown, two shillings, and three sixpences.</p>

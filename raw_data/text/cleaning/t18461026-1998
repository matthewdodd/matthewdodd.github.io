                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Park-road, Nottingham. I have five children—upon my husband's death I found I had an annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe myself to be a relation of the Rev. William Stokes, and was entitled to property from him—about June, 1845, I was introduced to the prisoner by a female cousin to investigate my claim—he told me that he could get the registers for me—I inquired shortly after if he had got them for me—he said yes, and had sent them up to London to a friend of his named Fitzgerald Strathern, a barrister—shortly afterwards he told me the barrister wanted 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take the matter into the Court of Chancery—I said I had not got 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked two gentlemen at Nottingham to advance me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my annuity, but they refused—he then said, "You have no occasion to be be<lb></lb>holden to anybody for money, you have an annuity, you must sell it"—he said the money was in the funds, and there was a good deal of property to be recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he the person who first told you that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After he said he had sent the register <hi rend="italic">to</hi> London he gave me a letter from the barrister, telling him what the property was, and the money—when he read the letter to me, I asked him to let me read it—it stated about the estate and the funded pro<lb></lb>perty, amounting to nearly 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and interest—he gave me the letter—I read it—it stated all that—I was going to put it into my pocket—he said, "Don't take that letter with you; I should like to take a copy of it myself, you shall have it when you call again"—I gave it to him, and could never get it again from him—I sold my annuity, by his advice, and gave him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him for the barrister's address before I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he represented the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the barrister's fee to take the case into Court—he wrote the barrister's name and address on this paper, in my presence, at Mr. Gilbert's commercial rooms—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Fitzgerald Strathern, Esq., barrister-at-law, Lincoln's Inn-fields, London")—I was to come to London to pay the bar<lb></lb>rister, but he said he was gone to the Isle of Wight, and I paid the prisoner four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I have given him money at other times—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was nothing compared with what he has had of me—I found out in July that it was all a deception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She never paid me a farthing; she frequently came to me; I told her I did not understand law. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did pay the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and often paid his expenses up to London—the last sum I gave him was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the day before I was to come up to London to receive part of the money, and be put in possession of the property—nobody was present when I paid him—I got the notes at Mr. Smith's bank, South-parade, Nottingham—he has had more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—he gave me seven or eight letters, which he said came from the barrister, stating when we were to come up to the Court of Chancery, and other places, about the property—this is the last letter I re<lb></lb> ceived from him—he said it was from the barrister—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I saw him write the barrister's address on the paper produced—I did not give him the letters—I received them from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She was in the constant habit of going to a man named Smith, and one <hi rend="italic">Little Joe</hi>, and his brother <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>; she said they used a magic-glass every day; she has told me so hundreds of times; her brother said he would come to London and expose the whole transaction for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that his sister was a wicked woman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never used a magic-glass—I have never quar<lb></lb>relled with my brother—he went with a policeman to take the prisoner.</p>

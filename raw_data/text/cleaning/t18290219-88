             re-examined. Q. You missed this quantity of potatoes the next morning? A. Yes - it was in the wet weather; I did not see any marks of wheels- it is a gravelly soil.</p>

            . Q. Were you never in any thing of this kind before? A. No; I was in service, and drove a team of horses over three ducks; the woman went and got a warrant for me - I asked her if she would make it up; she said she would if I paid for them - I said if I paid for them I should like to have them, and I took them; I was not tried for stealing them.</p>

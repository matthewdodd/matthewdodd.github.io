            . I live in Haughton-street, Clare-market with Mr, Chivers, and am thirteen years of age. I was about four yards from the prosecutor; the prisoner was first, and two others behind him. The prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, pulled the handkerchief out, and put it behind him. One of the boys took it from him, and ran by the pastry-cook's, then whistled and the other followed him down the Temple; the prosecutor caught hold of the prisoner. The people interupted me, and said I had better not say I saw it, as he would be put in prison, and so I did not like to tell at first. He was searched in a public-house, and the beadle was going to let him go, but I told what I had seen, as I thought it bad for him to be guilty of such a thing. I am sure I saw it.</p>

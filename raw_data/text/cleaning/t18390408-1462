                  </hi>. I was fourteen yean old on the 16th of last October, and live with my grandmother, Mrs. Fagg, at No. 9, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street. I was living with her in November last—the prisoner. had at one time lodged in my grandmother's house—I have taken half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences belonging to my grandmother a great many times by desire of the prisoner—in November I took two half-crowns, six shillings, and three sixpences, by her desire—I was in the prisoner's house when she desired me to do it—I went to her house be<lb></lb>cause she told me I was to go there—great part of the money I took was spent in drink, and the other part bought furniture—I bought some at Mr. Smith's at Crucifix-lane, and at Snow's-fields—I bought some chain and some fire-irons with the money I took from my grandmother, and they were taken to the prisoner's house—the prisoner was with me when. I bought some of the things, and her daughter was with me when I bought some of them—the prisoner told me that John Hubbard was to marry me—the chain that were produced from Mr. Warton's, the pawnbroker, were the same that were bought at Mr. Smith's—some china cups and saucers were bought with my grandmother's money, the prisoner's daughter went with me to buy them—I used frequently to go to the prisoner I in the after-noon, and stop all the afternoon—I slept there two nights—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect when I told my grandmother of taking the money, but I did tell her—I took the money because the prisoner told me—she told me several times to do it before I did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was forty-three miles down in Kent, and my daughter and John Hubbard, and this girl, kept company for two years, and they had the house to do as they pleased. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She was not in the country, she was at home in November—I did not keep company with her daugh<lb></lb>ter above nine months—I knew John Hubbard before I knew her—the prisoner told me to do this a great many times before I did it—a coat was bought with a sovereign that I took from my grandmother, and the prisoner gave me a bad sovereign to put in its place—I did not go to buy the coat—there had been 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid off it, and I paid 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the prisoner's desire, out of the sovereign—the rest of the sovereign was spent in gin and ale at the prisoner's house the same night—the prisoner forced me to drink some.</p>

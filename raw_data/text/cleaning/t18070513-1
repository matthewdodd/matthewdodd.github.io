               <p>Q. Had you known her before. - A. I knew that she lodged in the house with this person. On Tuesday she got up between five and six o'clock in the morning and went out; I was in bed, I saw her go out of the door; she took all my clothes, she left me in bed with nothing but my shift on; I had nothing left to put on, neither shoes nor stockings; I got up and endeavoured to pursue her; she got away, being an early hour, there was no body about to stop her; I sent a person to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker, to know if any of the things were there; they said they were not; they were afterwards found there. Last Friday I heard the prisoner was at the election at Covent Garden; I asked her what she had done with my things; she said some she had pawned at Mr. Harrison's, some she had sold, and the others she had wore out. I lost my things on the 20th of August, and I never saw the prisoner from that time till last Friday.</p>

I said, that man has picked my pocket, and I was determined to search him. I being alone, was something fearful: I searched the prisoner, and from behind him, under his coat, I brushed my handkerchief down; (produced and deposed to). I immediately seized him by the collar; he struggled with me, and tore his coat, and got away; I followed him into Crane-court, another man followed me; the prisoner slipped by me in the court (I saw him all the time); the other man laid hold of him: I believe they had some more desperate design upon my person.</p>

On the 21st of April, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner outside the gate, leading to the kitchen, with a basket; I suspected he had been in the kitchen, went in, and missed eight silver tea-spoons and a milk-pot, which I had seen safe about half an hour before; I went out, and saw him running away; I called Stop thief! and he ran still faster; when he found that I pursued him closely he dropped the basket: I picked it up, and still pursued him. I took him at the top of the lane - there were two other boys at the top of the lane, who he intended to give it to.</p>

I worked for Mr. Wilkes, No. 3, Hare-walk; he sent me to a chandler's-shop, and then to the Green Man, public-house, and I crossed the brick fields, and went up Rosemary-lane; I saw a man dressed in blue - he said, "Where are you going?" I said, "To the Green Man:" he said, "I will give you 6 d. to carry this basket;" I, being a poor lad, took it to carry. He went on about ten yards, and then told me to go up to the top of the lane, and I should see his brother, and to tell him to come to him; I left the basket by his side, and ran up the lane, when a man stopped me.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

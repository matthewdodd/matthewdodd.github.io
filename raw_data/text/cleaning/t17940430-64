               <p>I am a carman; I live with Mr. Moore, in St. James's Market. Jane Blissett asked me in the morning if I would bring her box from her master's town house to Kilburn? I called for the box the corner of James-street, at Mr. Strong's house, the 21st of March last, it was about two o'clock as near as I can tell, I put the box on the cart, and I went back into the house again, and I was watching my things on the cart, I saw the box moved on the cart, and I immediately goes out as fast as I could, and the prisoner had the box on his shoulder, at a little distance from the cart, running along with it; I had some other things in the cart, but they were nor touched; I pursued after him as fast as I could, and I soon overtook him, and as soon as I overtook him, he dropped the box and ran away, and I hallooed for the people to stop him, and they stopped him before he was out of my sight; I am sure that is the man. The box is here.</p>

               <p>James Lake. I am Servant and Son-in-Law to Mr. Gook; the Prisoner had worked with us about 10 Weeks; my Father had missed many Things before. One Day I observed that the Prisoner had got a Pair of Leather Breeches behind him, under his Coat; I asked him what he had got there, he said, he had only got his own Leather Breeches; I asked him whether he wore two Pair of Breeches; he run up Stairs and threw these down, and brought down an old Pair of Buckskin Breeches; I went up and found these Breeches, which he had under his Coat; I know the Cloth Breeches are my Father's, and that they were never sold; and that he never had Power given him to sell any Thing for us.</p>

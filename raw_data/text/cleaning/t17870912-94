               <p>Did he pay you for these stockings? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make any contract for them? - None at all, he asked me the price.</p>
               <p>Did you fix any price upon them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did any other conversation pass about these stockings, but that you have mentioned? - I do not recollect any other.</p>
               <p>Did you promise to change them if they did not suit? - Certainly I did; it is the rule of the business, if it is six months after.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said when they were to be paid for? - No, Sir, I should not have given him the least credit, being a perfect stranger; I am sure I was gone but a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. There was no contract, I understand, made between you? - - None at all.</p>
               <p>Nothing said about paying for them? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>The fact was, that he was to shew them to another person? - He said he bought them for a friend in the country.</p>
               <p>Why then you sold them? - I thought I had done so; he was to have bought them.</p>
               <p>When you returned, did you see some ill looking men lurking about the house that looked like officers? - Indeed I did not, I did not take any notice.</p>
               <p>You left them there for the purpose of fetching these things? - I left them there till I returned.</p>
               <p>If he had paid you the money, or returned them to you in six months, you would have changed them? - I should not have let him have them without the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if I understand you right, there was nothing said about money? - It was never mentioned.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the room when you left the stockings with him? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand by your evidence that in case he had paid you for them you would changed them? - Yes, I did not mean he should have them without paying for them at that time; if they had not suited his friend after I had received the money, I would have changed them for others.</p>

               <p>Did you go into the room after Johnson went away? - Mr. Berger and my servant went into the room together, but I cannot tell which went in first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. How many lodgers had you in that house at that time? - I had two, a lady, she had no servant.</p>

               <p>Had you known Mr. Berger before? - Never.</p>

               <p>All that you know it, that you saw some person go up stairs with a bundle - That is all.</p>
               <p>When Johnson went out you saw no bundle in his hand? - No, my servant was at the door; it was about nine in the morning; he wished me a good morning, and crossed the way, and seemed to be rather in haste.</p>
               <p>Court. You keep a lodging house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When you went up a second time, did the maid servant go with you? - We went both together.</p>

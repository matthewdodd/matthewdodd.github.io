            . On Saturday the 23d of November, about a quarter of an hour after 6, I had occasion for another candle. I went down into my kitchen for one.</p>

The street door was open, and the back parlour door was shut, but not locked. I might be gone down about two minutes; when I came up again, the parlour door was open. I went in and found the drawers open, and a stomacher and gown on the ground. I called my wife to see what was lost. She came up and missed the two gowns mentioned in the indictment; then I went about to the pawnbrokers, and about half an hour after 7 o'clock, I found the silk and stuff gown pawned to Mr. Watson, in Coventry-court, Coventry-street. I found the other gown pawned with Mr. Fryer, in Knaves-acre. The gowns produced in court. The prosecutor produced pieces of the cloth each were made of, and deposed to them, as being the same he lost that night.</p>

            . On Saturday the 23d of November, the prisoner pledged this silk and stuff gown with my master. I was present at the time. The prosecutor came about half an hour after, and owned it. On the 17th of December following, the prisoner came again. My master charged him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160017"></xptr> with robbing Mr. Jones of two gowns. He could not deny but he had such; all he said was, he defied any man that should say the gowns were stole. Then my master ordered me to take him to Mr. Fryer, the other pawn-broker. Going along Coventry-street, he wanted to go down Hedge-lane. I told him that was not the way. He would not go on. I laid hold of his collar, and said he should either go to Mr. Fryer's, or back to my master's. I brought him back to my master's, and took him to Justice Welch.</p>

            . I belong to Mr. Fryer, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Walker's-court. I took in this linen gown of a man, the 23d of November. He was a foreigner (such is the prisoner.) I believe he is the man.</p>

               <p>I bought the gown of a woman in the Strand, in the street; and after that I wanted a little money, and I went and pawned it.</p>

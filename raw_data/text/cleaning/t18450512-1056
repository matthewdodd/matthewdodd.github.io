Mr. Wood, the curate—when I lost the wash-leathers, there was no seal with a T on it on them—I cannot speak to the two pieces produced—they are rather disfigured—they have formed one piece—I have examined them—they are the tame size as one of the pieces I lost, but neither of those I lost had any teal on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy-clerk and sexton of St. Marylebone. I was in the church during the performance of the baptism on the 12th of Feb.—there are five outer doors to the church—it is not usual, on baptismal services to have more than two doors open, the side door, front<lb></lb>ing the New-road, and the High-street door—sometimes the vestry-door is open, as the clergyman frequently comes in at that door—I cannot remem<lb></lb>ber whether he did that day—I left at a quarter past four o'clock, leaving the pew-opener closing the church—it is her custom to lock the doors—I merely locked up the strong room, and the desks in the vestry, not the outer doors—on the following day I went to the church, in consequence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184505120056"></xptr>
               <p>information—I found the middle door, looking into the New-road, open, and the lock, which had evidently been wrenched off, lying on the ground—it could not have been wrenched off from the outside—the screws were drawn, a part of the lock, through which the bolt passes, was screwed on for more security to the side of the door—it comes round the door, and fixes down with a plate—that plate was left on, showing that the lock must have been forced off with considerable violence, and from within—I went to the High-street door and found a screw taken from the lock, and placed in the keyhole—I found a chisel by the side of the lock that was taken off the front entrance—on entering the church I went to the vestry, and found the inner vestry-room door, opening from the church, forced open—I found the outer vestry-room door perfectly safe, and locked—there were marks of a chisel on the inner door—I saw the inspector compare the chisel found with the marks, and they appeared to agree—two desks had been forced—I missed from a wooden box in my desk about eight half-crowns, belonging to the rector, the Rev. John Hume Spry, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of copper-money of my own from a wooden-bowl—a small seal was taken from my desk, with the initial T engraved on it—five brass candlesticks were also taken, and some wash-leather, but I know nothing about that—the impression upon this wash-leather appears to be an impression from my seal, but it was not put there by me—there are many seals alike—I know the seal now produced from a piece of blotting paper between the handle and the brass part, which I put there to make it tight, as it was loose—it was there when I lost it—I told the officer of it before he produced it to me, and when it was produced it had the blotting paper in it—these five keys belong to Marylebone church—one is the key of the money-box, from which the half-crowns were stolen, and one of the entrance to the vaults, one of the church-door, and one of the church gates—they were taken from the bunch which were on a brass chain—the chain was cut, and these taken from it, except the key of the money-box.</p>

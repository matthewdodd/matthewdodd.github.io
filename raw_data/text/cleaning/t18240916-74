Woodcock was close by his side. I took hold of Green by the coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"You thief, you have stolen my purse:" he said he had not got it; I saw him slip it into the hand of Woodcock. I said I knew he had not got it, for he had given it away - he got from me, and ran across the market. I cried Stop thief! Woodcock ran in a contrary direction, down Southampton-street. Green was secured within about a hundred yards of the place. Woodcock was taken on the Friday following - I had sufficient observation of his person to speak decidedly to him. When I saw them at the office I was quite certain of them.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer at Covent-garden-market. I saw the prisoners one on each side of Mrs. Newton - they were strangers to me, but I thought they were doing something wrong: I watched them and saw Mrs. Newton take Green by the collar, and while I was putting down a basket I had in my hand, he got from her, and ran across the market - Woodcock ran in another direction - I followed Green, and secured him. I saw Woodcock at Bow-street, and am quite certain he was the person I saw with Green at the time of the robbery.</p>

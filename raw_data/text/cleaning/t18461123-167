                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth. About half-past nine o'clock, on the night of the 15th of Nov., I was in Tooley-street with my wife, and near the end of the street was knocked down by three or four ruffians with their fists—they pinioned my hands behind me, and the prisoner knocked me down with his fist—I saw him plainly—he looked under my hat a second or so before he struck me under the chin, and with his other hand took my watch, which was in my fob—it was at the London-bridge end of the street—I had a guard to the watch—he broke the swivel—I was sense<lb></lb>less for two or three minutes, I believe—he ran away—a gentleman picked me up, and took me to the station—I had passed the prisoner and the other men before I was knocked down—there were three or four of them—I have not seen the watch since—it was gold, with a gold seal and key, and was worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live in Palestine-place, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green Between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 15th of March, I saw my house properly locked up—the doors were locked, and the windows fastened—I have a parlour-window looking into the garden—I went to bed about eleven, and about a quarter after twelve I heard a noise—I thought the next door neighbour had fallen down, or fallen out of bed—I laid a few mi<lb></lb>nutes, then heard some one moving or speaking—soon after I heard a noise—I said, "That is the celleret-hid shut down, there is some one in the house"—I got up, and got a light, and went below, and found nothing moved—I called the police, went into the back parlour, and found my desk open, and a. coat, some spoons, and a tooth-pick gone—the window had been broken, which would enable a person to undo the sash, and get in—these are my things.</p>

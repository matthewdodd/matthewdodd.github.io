                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am in the service of Mr. Williams, No. 5, Durham-place West, Hackney-road. On Tuesday morn-ing, the 2nd of March, I went down into the kitchen, about half-past six o'clock, and found the kitchen window-shutters unfastened, which I had left fastened the night before—the door leading from the pantry to the kitchen was open, and I found a hole in the partition which divides the pantry from an out-house in the yard, large enough to admit the person of a man—it had been made since the night before—I missed from my box two shawls, a scarf, four sovereigns, one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, one shilling, and some halfpence, which had been safe the night before when I went to bed. I directly alarmed my master, who missed his property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk manufacturer, and live in Durham-place, Hackney-road. On the morning of the 2nd of March I was alarmed by my daughter—I went down, and observed the hole io the partition, which made a communication with the back-yard—I missed articles of my own, and among other things a pair of Wellington hoots—I went to the stable at the back of the house, and found the gate had been forced open, which would admit a person into the yard—the pri<lb></lb>soner worked for me, about a year and a half ago, for nine months—he was not an in-door servant, but was employed in the manufactory—he often came to the warehouse, at the back of my house, for materials, and perfectly knew every part of the house, particularly the back part—the hoots, now produced, are mine, they were made by Barker, and were in the house on the night in question—I know them by having had the heels lowered, owing to breaking the cap of my knee about five years since, as they were so high I could not walk in them; I also know them by their having cork soles—I am able to swear they are my boots.</p>

I was called into the prosecutor's house, on Tuesday morning, the 2nd of March, about eleven o'clock—I found the premises as described—I found these bottoms of a pair of shoes in the stable, and the tops cut to pieces—I compared one of the bottoms with some marks in the garden, and it exactly corresponded—the ground had been newly turned up—to the best of my belief the shoes belong to the prisoner—the fore part of the upper leather of one of them is not com<lb></lb>pletely cut off, I put it on his foot, and it exactly corresponded with his toes—the shape of the toes corresponded—in consequence of information, on Thursday the 4th of March, I went to the house where the prisoner lived, 12, Wolvarley-street, nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I got there about half-past four o'clock in the morning—as soon as I saw the shutters open, about a quarter-past six, I tapped at the door—the prisoner's father opened it—I and Harris walked in—I walked through the front room into the back—the prisoner was in bed with his brother, who is about seventeen years old—I said, "George, I want you"—Harris picked up these Wellington boots in my presence—the prisoner said, "They are my boots "—he dressed himself—I then searched him, and found in his waist-coat pocket 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had been putting up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week to save it.</p>

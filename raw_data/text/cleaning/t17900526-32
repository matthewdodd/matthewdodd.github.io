               <p>I caught the prisoner in the kitchen, and nobody else; that was the second time he came in; I went up stairs, and he was alone; when I came down, I went to the bar, and soon missed my property; the halfpence were gone, and the farthings; I saw them half an hour before; I desired them to pursue the prisoner, as nobody else was in the house; he had a cobler's stall four doors off; he was taken; I saw him and the money at the justice's; I picked out one halfpenny which I had taken half an hour before, and swore to it; I do not know how much was in the measure.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after you left the prisoner alone in the room by himself, did you discover the halfpence? - About three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: I found the halfpence in a room in Sutton-street, No. 3, one pair of stairs; the prisoner was present; these are the halfpence and farthings; we did not find the measure; I was at the justice's; and Mrs. Dawson swore to one halfpenny.</p>

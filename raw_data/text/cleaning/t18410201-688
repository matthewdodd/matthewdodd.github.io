                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with Mr. Schofield to take the prisoner into custody—I asked his grandmother at what hour he left on New Year's-day, on the first day I went to search his box—she said he left between four and five o'clock—I went again a day or two after for his clothes, and asked her if he was ill on the 1st of January—I told her he had written to his master, to say he was ill, and could not come to his place—she said the prisoner bad told her he had leave from his master that day—I asked if she was positive of the time he left that day—she said to the best of her recollection it was a little after four.</p>

On Tuesday the 3d of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to our shop, with Kingston and another. They came into the lobby of the bar; he asked me for a glass of peppermint. I served him; it came to 3 d. He laid a 1 l. bank note on the counter, and I said I had not got change, but would go and ask if my husband had any. He asked the others if they would have any thing; they gave no answer. I took the note into the parlour where my husband was with Furzeman and Hearn. I showed Furzeman the note; he gave his opinion about it. I returned to the bar, gave it to the prisoner, and told him I thought it was not good. He made no answer. Furzeman was then in the lobby, and took it out of his hand, and asked where he got it? He mentioned a name, which I do not recollect. Furzeman gave me the note, I gave it to my husband, who marked it in my presence - (looks at it.) - This is it.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. On the 3d of November I was in the parlour of the public-house, with Hearn and Harrison. Mrs. Harrison brought a 1 l. note to me; I examined it, gave my opinion on it, then went to the bar, found the prisoner, Kingston, and a man named Dent. I went up to the bar-door, Dent turned round and was going away rather quick; I stopped him, and told him to go back. Mrs. Harrison then returned the note to the prisoner, and told him it was a bad one. I asked him for it, he directly handed it to me; I then handed it to Harrison, and told him to mark it. I also marked it, and then asked the prisoner where he got it; he said he got it from his master, Mr. Pocock, Whitefriars. I searched him. He held his arms for me to search him - I found nothing on him; I also searched Dent, who had a bundle of paper under his arms, and found 5 l. 2 s. 6 d. in silver, on him, and a good 1 l. note. I asked where he lived, he said anywhere when he had got money; at that time Kingston was swearing he would not be searched by anybody; I reasoned with him for about a minute before I attempted to lay hold of him. I then held him down while Hearne searched him; he found 24 s. on him - we took him to the watch-house. I then asked the prisoner where he lived, he also said any where when he had got money. I asked Dent again where he lived, he said in West-street, West Smithfield, and that he had the silver from a gentleman named Donelly, who was gone to Ireland. I again asked the prisoner where he got the note, he said he took it of a gentlemen on the water, but mentioned no name.</p>

He paid me a 1 l. bank note - I told him I had rather not give change, as I was short of silver. He then said he must go aboard without bread, I borrowed a few shillings of my daughter to make up the change. I asked his name and address, he said it was Taylor, on board a cooper's barge. I gave the note to my daughter, who was at the desk, and she wrote the name on it, in my presence - it was never out of my sight; she returned it to me.

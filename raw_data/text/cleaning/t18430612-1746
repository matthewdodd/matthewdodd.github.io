                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Holywell-street, Strand, in the parish of St. Clement Danes, and am a dealer in cigars. On Saturday night, the 27th of May, about eleven o'clock I was in my parlour adjoining the shop—I heard a noise outside, ran out of the shop, and observed a pane broken in the window, I ran to the door, and was pointed a person running off about thirty yards from the shop—I pursued, and he was taken at the top of Wyeh-street—I had not lost sight of him—it was the prisoner—he was brought back to my shop—the hole in the window was large enough for a man to put his hand in—I lost 2lbs. weight of cheroots, and one bundle of cigars, worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—I had seen the glass perfect five minuted before.</p>

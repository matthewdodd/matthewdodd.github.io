This woman cannot swear that she saw me after she asked me the way to Baker-street; I am very well acquainted with the place where she says she was knocked down, and there are two or three turnings about there. I had been with two of our men from ten minutes past six o'clock till half-past; I had seen Stanton about six o'clock, when I parted with him, and he was going to his own barracks; about half-past six o'clock I saw two men and a corporal, who told me they were come to look for me, as there had been a crowd about the barrack gate, and my name had been mentioned - I said I would go with them, as I had not been absent from any duty.</p>

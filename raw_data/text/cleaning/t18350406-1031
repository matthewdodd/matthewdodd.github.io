                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Robertson; we keep a cheesemonger's shop in Paddington-street. On the 30th of March I step<lb></lb>ped out, and returned in about three minutes—when I got on the pavement, I saw the prisoner at the shop, with his back to me, in a very suspicious manner; but I had no idea what he was about till I got on the step, when he turned round to me, with the ham in his hand—I took it from him as he was on the step—he got from me, and ran off, but was brought back—I am confident he is the man.</p>

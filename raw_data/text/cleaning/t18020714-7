            Did you, about that time, see the prisoner? - A. Yes, I saw him about a minute after.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to you? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-7-person94">A. </persName>
            Close to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the persons that pressed upon you? - A. I did not observe any one but him; several put up their hands to knock me down, when I laid hold of the prisoner; he was one that was in the gang.</p>
               <p>

            The watch was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing before the watch was found upon him, that induced you to think he was one of the gang? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-7-person98">A. </persName>
            Because he was close to me; he was one of those that squeezed round me to hold me fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive him pressing upon you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you did not see him till about a minute after the watch was taken from you? - A. He had the watch in his hand.</p>

            Was the pressure while the watch was going or before? - A. It was after the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you could distinctly perceive Charles Williams press upon you, or did you only conclude he was one from seeing the watch in his hand? - A. He pressed upon me very much after the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear distinctly you observed the prisoner press upon you after the watch was gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick to this, that you saw him distinctly press upon you after the watch was gone out of your pocket? - A. Yes, while I was attempting to lay hold of one of the gang, immediately the crowd pressed upon me.</p>

               <persName id="t18020714-7-person101">A. </persName>

            At the time the balloon went up, there must have been a great number of spectators pressing upon one another? - A. Yes, there was a bull brought in, and there was a great pressure.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether there was any more pressure upon you than there was upon any other person? - A. I cannot say that there was; there was a very great pressing upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. And great pressing upon every body else, was there not? - A. Yes.</p>

            About five or ten minutes after the balloon went up, or it might be rather more; there was a narrow passage between the carts where the people had to pass through, and there were four or five of them on each side of that passage, close to each other; I saw them pushing and huslling people about; the prisoner was in front; I observed a silver watch in his hand.</p>

Yes, I am sure of it; I then followed the prisoner, and laid hold of his collar; I was then immediately knocked down, and received several blows on my back; I called to the patrols behind me to take care of him; upon that a scuffle enfued; I recovered myself, and got hold of the prisoner again, with one of the patrols; after I got hold of him, endeavouring to bring him up Baker-street, he asked me to let him stoop down, and pull his shoe up at heel; and, in stooping down, I saw him throw the watch away; I ordered James Munyard, one of the men with me, to pick it up; I saw him pick it up.</p>

            Afterwards; the patrol came up immediately, and dispersed the mob; I laid hold of the prisoner, and Mr. Mayhew laid hold of him; and, as we were taking him to Bow-street, he stooped down, and I saw him throw this watch down, (producing it;) he threw it, I dare say, four yards behind him; I immediately stooped down upon my hands and knees, and picked it up.</p>

               <p>Mayhew. This bridge is close to where the carts were; they were drawn up close to the side of the ditch for the people to see the balloon.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Monday morning, I went, out of curiousity, to see the balloon; and, on my way home, coming over the bridge, somebody said there was a mad bullock, and there was a great press and a cry of thieves; upon which a scuffle ensued, and they all got away, and I was then taken; there was another watch produced at Bow-street, and an officer, of the name of Lloyd, swore that I had taken that watch from another man; and the man said, I was not the person; Mr. Justice Ford asked him how he could take his oath that I had taken it from the man, and then he said, he had not taken his oath.</p>

We came up to London, and I went to the prosecutor's house, and was hired to be his servant, and was there three weeks this last time, I was with him before; while I was there, he bought me two shifts and was kind to me; this woman came and persuaded me to come away; she came persuading me for three Sundays together; at last, I said I would come away; I ask'd her what she would have me to do? saying, my master has bought me two shifts, and they were very kind to me; she said take all you can, for you know you must never see their faces more, nor your own country neither; I said, what must I take? and said there was some money in the kitchen; she said, take all you can, but be sure take nothing that is mark'd.</p>

               <p>Ellise. I never heard any thing amiss of her 'till this time; she behaved in a very handsome way, and whether she is guilty of this or not, I can't say; I have known her to live twice with Mr. Langham.</p>

The maron said, she believed the prisoner had taken them out of the house and pawned them. She was sent for down, and charged with so doing, and before the board she own'd she had carried some out to pawn. The gentlemen desired I would take her before justice Manly the next morning. She confessed she had taken ten sheets out of the workhouse. I went to the justice to desire him to grant me a search warrant, which he did; then I took a constable with me, and we went and search'd at Mrs. Adams's, a pawnbroker, in College-street, and at Mrs. Griffith's, a pawnbroker in Tothill-street; we found five in each place, mark'd with the parish mark, SMW.

            . I am a constable of Paddington. On the 16th of May, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the Canal-yard, and watched him. I saw him again at three o'clock; he dodged me round the hay. He attempted to get out of the yard, but saw me, and would not come out. I concealed myself, and saw him come out - I ran up to him, and found the rabbits tied up in his apron, which was in his hand - He dropped it and ran off. I pursued, and told him he might as well stop, as I knew him. I gave the alarm, and he was stopped by Grace. The prosecutor claimed the rabbits. He had killed four of them.</p>

            . I am a reporter. On the 19th of April, about two o'clock, I was passing the Strand - I saw the prosecutrix before me, and on coming nearly opposite No. 48, I saw the prisoner and some other person push against her; I then saw a green purse, or cardcase under the prisoner's feet, which he was trying to conceal - I pointed him out, and he was taken; I went after the lady, and told her of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he was searched at the station-house? A. Yes - I cannot say what was found on him, but nothing that the lady could identify: he was within five or six yards of the spot where the robbery was committed; I had come from Charles-street, and had followed the lady down the Strand; after the robbery I run after her; for perhaps, one hundred yards - there was nothing found on the prisoner to cut the reticule with.</p>

            . I was going in an opposite direction, and saw the prisoner push against the lady - I suspected he had robbed her; there were ten or twelve persons round the print-shop; I looked at the prisoner, and he was shuffling this card-case with his feet - I called the officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

             (Police-constable F 41). I was called, and saw the prisoner near the picture-shop - there were ten or twelve other persons - I saw this green case under his feet, which he was trying to hide - I looked at him; he walked away; I took up the case, and went and took him.(Case produced and sworn to.)</p>

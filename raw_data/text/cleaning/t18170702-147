            . I live in Lamb-alley, Bishopsgate-street, and took a walk with Searle to see his cousin. Gregory and Leach were with me-Searles altered his mind and would not go - We went as far as Mile-end Turnpike. As we were returning down Brick-lane, five or six men crossed over from the other side - I am certain that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020059"></xptr>the prisoner is one of them.

            gory; Linch and Searles were together. A young man stooped under my arm, and shoved me against them. In half a minute Searles said his watch was gone. The prisoner said, "Oh no, it is not." A man ran across the road with it, at the same time Gregory crossed the road after him-the prisoner held her, and would not let her go; the man ran down the street with the watch. The prisoner then let us go, and when we got to the street he drove us back-they all held us. The prisoner said the man had run another way. Gregory fainted. I called out stop thief! The prisoner was taken while he was attempting to stop her mouth, to hinder her calling out - She came to, and laid hold of him. When he got to the watch-house, I said his name was Greenwood; he said it was Greenlaw - He afterwards said it was Greenwood.</p>

            . I live in Long-alley, near the Tenter-ground. We were returning home-when we got to Brick-lane, five or six men ran up to us; one of them caught hold of Sinfield, and shoved against us. I laid hold of Searles's arm - They surrounded us-the prisoner held us close together. Searles said his watch was gone. My sister (Gregory) cried out, stop thief! they would not let us go after the man who took it. Gregory had nearly caught him, when the prisoner caught her by the neck-she fainted away. The prisoner said he was gone another way; the watchman came up, I seized the prisoner as one of them, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man who hustled us.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CLARK. I am a watchman. I heard the noise, went up, and found Gregory fainting. Linch said the prisoner had robbed the young man of his watch - I took him to the watch-house. He struck me in the face, and made my nose bleed.</p>

             CLAYTON. My husband is a glover, I live next door to Mr. Furrs in Carey street. On the 21st of September, between two and three in the afternoon, I was standing in my room adjoining the shop, I saw a woman with a bed gown, dirtily dressed, looking at a boot at Mr. Furrs'; I saw her take it down and go away; I immediately went over to Mr. Furrs, I told him that the woman had taken a boot from his door; he went after her, laid hold of her, took the boot from out of her lap, and brought her back to the shop; Mr. Blundell was sent for, and she was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Furrs. Mrs. Clayton informed me of the fact, that the prisoner had taken a boot from my door; I followed her, I overtook her between twenty and thirty yards distance from my door; she was going up Carey street, I took hold of her by the arm and turned her cloak from off the basket, which she had on her arm, and took the boot from her; I took her back to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the boot - A. On her arm, covered with her cloak; I gave her and the boot into the custody of Mr. Blundell.</p>

On the 9th of July, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was at a public-house in St. George's in the East, having a pint of beer; the prisoner, whom I had never seen before, came and asked my leave to drink out of my pot, as she was thirsty - I gave her leave; after drinking she asked which way I was going - I said towards the Commercial-road; she said she was going that way, and walked on by my side, at times behind and before; when she came to <placeName id="t18280911-103-crimeloc535">Cabel-street</placeName>

Bank note - she took it out, flew out of the door, and knocked my hat off; I saw the note in her hand, and while I stooped to pick up my hat she was out of my sight; I saw no more of her till next evening, when I got an officer, and found her in a public-house; as soon as she saw me she tried to run away - the officer flew after her, caught hold of her, and she was secured; I have not found my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You never saw her before? A. No - I am a married man; I did not go there for any improper purpose - I was allured into her room - it is a lower room; I was not tipsy; I found her next night in the same public-house - my hand was on the note when she was unlocking the door; I had received the money from a carpenter that morning.</p>

The prisoner took me from my master's house, on pretence of marrying me, and took me to a church, and went in and spoke to a man, and then come out, and said we were married; I was not married to him, but he pretended to be taking me to be married. He told me he was a shoe-maker, but he was not. I staid out with him four days. He said he would take me down to his mother's at Epping; and when we got there, he said his mother had quitted there. He had my bundle to carry. When we got to <placeName id="t18151206-94-crimeloc527">Edmonton</placeName>

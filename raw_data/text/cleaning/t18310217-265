            . I was in Brick-lane, and saw Mrs. Powell and a lad in the cart; I saw a man, whom I think was the prisoner, following and watching the cart - he went behind the cart, and took out this bundle; he was running away - I had before seen a Police-constable, and given information; he took the prisoner with the bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he run? A. Yes, when we cried Stop thief! he ran, but not so much as two or three hundred yards; I had not had any thing to drink with the prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure you saw him with the bundle near the cart? A. Yes; I caught him running - there was no crowd there; it was not dark.</p>

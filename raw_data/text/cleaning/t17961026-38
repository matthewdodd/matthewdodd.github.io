On the 19th of September, in consequence of having lost a considerable quantity of gold, I suspected the prisoner; I gave him an ounce of gold to make nine rings; I watched him very close, and saw him make ten instead of nine; I saw him take the tenth and slide it under the skin that catches the silings, and, I suppose, he put it in his breeches; in the evening, after the usual hour of work, he wished me a good night; I called him back into the shop, and told him I suspected he had robbed me; he said nothing, but sprung towards his place where he worked, and I prevented him, and told him he should clear himself from the imputation before he went near his place again; he was silent several minutes; I told him it was in vain to deny it, I was confident he had robbed me; he put his hand to his breeches-pocket and brought this ring out;(producing it); he put it into my hand; I desired the rest of the men in the shop to taken notice of the ring he had given me out of his pocket, and then I sealed it up in the presence of an officer, and delivered it to him; he was taken to the Compter, and I got a search-warrant to search his house; I went next morning with the officer and two or three men, to search his apartment, and we found, in a dark corner of the garret, in a tin box put within a deal box, the gold property mentioned in the indictment, and some bars of iron that belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know Messrs. Thomas and Evans? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do they live? - A. in Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You are their foreman? - A. I carry on business in their house, but on my own account.</p>
               <p>Q. They are goldsmiths and enamellers? - A. No; they are merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Dealing in these articles? - A. Yes, and others they assign me an apartment in their house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260037"></xptr>to carry on the gold business; I employ men and discharge them when I please; they buy the goods of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you responsible to them for the gold and property these men work upon? - A. No; I find the materials, and they have no concern in any thing but what I sell to them.</p>
               <p>Q. This bit of wire was to make ten rings? - A. No; nine.</p>
               <p>Q. It often happens that you make an extra ring to make up for the loss in making rings? - A. I never knew any such circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. The ring was not finished? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not he often finish work at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He takes in work for himself, does not he? - A. Not that I know of; if I knew he did, I would not keep him. I will explain myself: when I say so, he does not do work at home for me; he has a large lathe at home that turns iron and steel; he has turned iron and steel, but nothing in the gold line.</p>

On the 19th of September, the prisoner had done his work and gone outside of the shop-door, the prosecutor called him back, and told him he had a strong suspicion he had some gold in his pocket; the prisoner made no answer, but seemed very much confused; he wanted to go towards his place, the prosecutor desired him to stand back; in about four or five minutes afterwards, the prisoner put his right-hand in his breeches-pocket and pulled a split ring out, he then put it into the prosecutor's hand; the prosecutor held it up, and desired the people in the shop to take notice that that was what the prisoner put in his hand; it was then given to a Mr. Hench, in the shop, to put a mark upon it, that he might know it again; it was then given to me, and I did the same. The prosecutor told him he had lost things of that kind before, and he had a great mind to get a search-warrant to search his house; he went next morning to the Police-office in Hatton-Garden, and got one; I went to his house, and found some split rings in his house, the constable has them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I have some gold which I received from the prosecutor, I don't know what it is, it was delivered to me sealed up. (produces it).</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Is that what they call a split ring? - A. Yes; it was taken from the prisoner; I did not mark it, but I saw the other witness mark it.</p>
               <p>Balley. This has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This gold ring I know to be my property, because I made it myself about a week before, and I am confident of my own work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. This is the ring that you took from him, and gave to the constable unfinished? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to say that is a ring, or can be sold for a ring? - A. No; it could not be sold for a ring, it is a round twisted wire, which is always called a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. A ring, I take it, is either for the purpose of wearing upon the finger, or keeping some link within it? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it is a ring then? - A. It is what is always called a ring.</p>
               <p>Q.Till it is bent you call it wire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe none of the edges of that come in contact with each other? - A. No; they don't at present.</p>
               <p>Jury. We look upon it as a piece of unfinished gold wire.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Balley.) Look at that piece of wire, what do you call it - Do you call it, before it is made up, a ring? - A. Yes; it is turned up for a split ring.</p>
               <p>Q. As it is, it is not a split ring? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Now look at the gold ring; did you find that at his house? - A. That is my own making; it is a wearing finger ring. I know it as well as my own hand-writing, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other gold split rings, are they in the same state as the other? - A. No; they are in a more forward state; one of them is in a state sit for a customer, it only wants brightening; it was made in my die; (produces it); I am certain it is my making; it weighs one ounce, fourteen pennyweights, eight grains.</p>
               <p>Q.Now there is an in got of gold, can you swear to that? - A. I verily believe it to be mine, as much as I believe any thing to be, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179610260038"></xptr>Q.Then there is an iron triangular bar, how do you know that to be your's? - A. Because I gave the prisoner the wooden model to get one of the iron bars cast from, for an engine which I have in Court, one had been delivered to me which is complete, and made into an engine; in searching his house we found these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever in your possession? - A. No, never; he confessed that he had had two made instead of one, and made me pay for two.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a brass cylinder piece, were you robbed of that? - A.Only in this way: that when he went to get any cases at the brass-founders, he always got two, and made me pay for two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Then you mean to charge him with stealing things that never were in your possession, and never belonged to you? - A. No; I don't charge him with having taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that that die is not the prisoner's? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never borrow any tools of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never work in your shop with his tools? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thousands of dies of this size? - A. I believe it is not possible, any more than coin dies.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that coin dies are of the same size? - A. I thought it impossible to make two alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any mark upon the other ring? - A. It has a mark upon it, by accident, the folder rather bolstered, and occasioned a number of little marks in it; I endeavoured to file them out, and they would not come out, from that circumstance, I was obliged to make another ring, and I said this ring by upon the board, and when I came to look for it the day after, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. These accidents in making rings frequently happen don't they? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no private mark upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.This man, himself, I believe, has worked a great deal at home, has not he, upon his own account? - A. If I had known he had worked a single little at home for himself, I would not have kept him.(The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.)</p>

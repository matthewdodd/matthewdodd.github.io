                  </hi> I am the daughter of Stephen Shorter. On the morning of the 17th of Sept. I was in Farringdon-market with some fruit, and saw the prisoner—I went to another stand—he followed me—I stood there talking to a woman—the prisoner was near me—I felt him taking his hand out of my pocket—I saw him at the time—he got away about twenty yard—I followed him, caught him by his jacket and waistcoat, and told him he had picked my pocket—he said, "Don't be impatient"—he tried to get away, by leaving his jacket and waistcoat in my hand—I seized him by his shirt till Breddon came—I had had about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, in a yellow canvas bag, two half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—there was only him and another man near me—he was the nearest—it was my father's money.</p>

On the 8th of December I was desired by my father to conceal myself in one of the warehouses, about four o'clock in the afternoon, so that a person coming in would not see me; the prisoner had access to the warehouse - I saw her come into the long room, and bring up a lot of old work, which she had the superintendence of; I saw her put it down - she then walked round the room once, then came to the front counter, and took a fur tippet from there - she directly went out of the warehouse, carrying the tippet before her in her hand; she had no cloak on - my brother Edward came into the warehouse in about five minutes; I then came from my place, and informed him what had taken place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your father any partner? A. No; the warehouse was not kept locked - every body had access to it; there was a great deal of property about - the prisoner had an excellent character.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090053"></xptr>GEORGE KNIGHT SMITH. I am the prosecutor's son. I had seen five sable tippets on the counter about four o'clock; my brother afterwards made a communcation to me - I went to the counter, and found only four there; I was present in the parlour when the prisoner was brought in there, by an officer, who searched her, and in my presence pulled from under her cloak a sable tippet. which, on examination, I knew to be my father's property; she had no business with such a tippet in that situation - she began to cry when it was found, and said she was going to show it to a lady; she did not name the lady - I said nothing whatever to induce her to confess; when I told the officer to take her to the Compter she fell on her kneas, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! pray, Sir - Oh! pray, Sir;" I believe that was all she said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said she had no business with the tippet in that situation? A. Yes; she was sometimes emeloyed to take one from one room to another; ladies do at times come to the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure she said forgive, or Oh! pray, Sir? A. No, the word forgiveness was uttered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Mr. Smith present? A. Yes - I stood at the prisoner's side; Mr. Smith was not so near - he stood at the opposite side of the table, and he was in a very agitated state; I heard her say."Oh! pray, Mr. Smith, forgive me" - I cannot answer for what Mr. Smith heard, but solemuly declare the truth of what I have said.</p>

            . I am a wholesale furrier. The prisoner has been about three years in my employ; I had employed her mother as a charwoman many years, and took the prisoner out of St. Dunstan's charity-school - this tippet is my property; the prisoner was never employed to carry tippets out of the house to ladies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would your mark be left on it if you sold it? A. Yes - we sell retail if a person happens to come into the warehouse, which may happen, but my business is wholesale; she would not be justified in taking it out - the mark is on the skin; I swear this was not sold, for it is a very peculiar one in point of colour, and has been in the warehouse all the season.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner warehousewoman or what? A. I took her as a <rs id="t18301209-95-deflabel551" type="occupation">workwoman</rs>

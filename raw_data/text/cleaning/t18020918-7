               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said you sold the chaise, and took the note in payment? - A. No, never to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner last year at all? - A. Yes, the first time was the 27th of December.</p>
               <p>Q.Had there been any money transactions between you? - A. He paid one or two days hire for a chaise, at five shillings a day, before he took it out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he was going to Brighton, and did you not tell him it would be better for him to buy the chaise? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between your father and him before the chaise was taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your father here? - A. No, he is in France; I never made any proposition to the prisoners to build a chaise for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him he should have the chaise at forty pounds, if he paid you at a short period? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who brought the note to you, say, that it would be paid when due, and that he should have a doceur, or something of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was forty pounds a fair ready money price for the chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Newman's, did you not say, although you have sold the chaise, you have not sold the harness, and desired it to be returned, which was done? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the harness returned? - A. After I had taken the chaise it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the date of the note? - A. The 5th of August.</p>

               <p>Signed at the back, by Edy, by the name of Hughes.</p>
               <p>I took the chaise home, and went out in it that day; I let it out afterwards, and have not seen it since the 15th, when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie. I cannot tell who I took the chaise from; they would not give me any information about it, and they have served me with a copy of a writ for it; it was a one horse chaise, with horizontal springs, painted yellow and black, and lined with blue cloth, with yellow nails; it was a rumble tumble behind of a peculiar make.</p>
               <p>Newman. That was the make of the chaise I brought on the 5th; Mackenzie insisted on having it; I said I had paid for it, but don't remember any conversation; Edy said, he had bought that chaise of him, which Mackenzie came to claim of me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You gave the fair value for it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mackenzie acknowledge selling the chaise? - A. He acknowledged taking the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was as a consideration for the chaise? - A. Yes, as a consideration for the chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did he not say that, although he had taken it, it was against his will, for that it was left there? - A. He said it was left by the man who brought it, and who insisted on leaving it; he was asked at Bow-street, whether he had taken the draft, and he said, Mrs. Duff's coachman came with it, and he refused to take it, but he would insist on leaving it on the desk.</p>

               <p>in the morning, I was in the Walworth-road—I saw a man standing at the end of a court by Mr. Fox's house—I went to the spot, and when I got up to it the man was not there—I pushed against Mr. Fox's door, and found it was unfastened—I went into the shop and turned my lamp on—I found the prisoner in the shop, which is in front—the dwelling house is at the back—he had not got anything down, but he had a piece of meat in his hand—it was still on the hook—I said to him, "Hallo, my friend, what are you doing here?"—he said, "George, come and serve us that half pound of steak"—I looked, and I saw nobody—I gave an alarm—Mr. Fox came, and I took the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and I live at No. 27, Crosby-row, Walworth-road—it is my dwelling house, as well as my shop—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—on 16th Sept., about 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was awoke by a noise in my shop, which opens into the street—there is only the shop door—you must go through the shop to go into the house—I came down, and found the prisoner and the officer there—I never saw the prisoner before—he had not the least right to be in my shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Fox. I and my master had shut up the premises about ten minutes past 10 o'clock on the night before—we were the last in the shop—we were in bed by a quarter-past 10—I fastened the door, I bolted it at top, and tried it afterwards, it was all safe—I was awoke by the noise—I put on my things in the room I sleep in, which is next to the shop—I saw all that passed, and heard all that passed.</p>

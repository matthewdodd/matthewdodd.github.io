About that time, I cannot state exactly; the house to which I belong owed a sum of money to the Glasgow Wharf, for wharfage; Mr. Whitehead had previously left a bill of the amount, in the usual way of transacting such business, and afterwards called to receive the amount, which I paid him, by a draft on our bankers, Messrs. Down, Thornton, Free, and Cornwall; this is the check; the prisoner wrote his name on the back.(The check read).</p>

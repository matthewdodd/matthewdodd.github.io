                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at No. 5, Lee's-build<lb></lb>ings, Chancery-lane; he is a law writer. On Christmas eve last I went to bed about half past 12 o'clock at night; my husband had gone to bed about 9 o'clock, or half past—he slept in a different bed, and in a different room to me—we have been living very unhappily for a long time—about half past 2 o'clock in the morning he came to my bedside and awoke me, saying, "<hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>, I am so cold"—I said to him, "Why come to me if you are so cold? "—he came into bed to me—he said those words as he came in, and I made that reply—the minute I said that, he stabbed me with the carving knife—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401300031"></xptr>
               <p>I felt myself stabbed—the knife went through my ear, and cut my neck—I bled a good deal—I called out to Mr. Hyatt, who lives in the first floor (I lived in the second floor), and begged of him to come up to me, that my husband had stabbed me; I was still lying in bed when I called out—my husband never spoke to me again—he walked into his own room, and left the door open—when I felt this cut at the back of the ear, I put up my hand to save my throat, and the knife went through my little finger and very nearly cut it off—it was after I was stabbed in the ear that I put up my hand to save my throat—I only received one blow—he had gone into his own room before Mr. Hyatt came to me—he went into his own room as soon as he stabbed me—I was still in bed when Mr. Hyatt came into the room—he brought a light with him; I was bleeding very much indeed—Mr. Jones, the surgeon, was sent for—my husband and I have not had quarrels before this—I had not been on good terms with him that week; he called me very bad names.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been living separately from him for any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was his wish that he should sleep with the two boys, and me with my two daugh<lb></lb>ters, for we had no other convenience—I have been obliged to support myself and family for some weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house as the prisoner and his wife. On Christmas morning last, I was awoke between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, by hearing some person cry out; it was Mrs. Willis's voice—my name was called out loudly—I put on my small clothes, and went directly to her room; I found her in bed, leaning over the bed, and bleeding very much from a wound in the ear and neck, and likewise a cut on the hand; there was a great deal of blood about—there was no one else in the room—from something Mrs. Willis told me, I afterwards went into the other room, where I found the prisoner on the bed, wrapped up in the clothes—I asked him what he had been doing, and why he did it—he said, if she was not dead, his hand must have been nervous—on looking more closely at him, I found that he had cut his own throat, or partly so; there was a great deal of blood all down his dress, and on his shirt—my son went into the room with me, and when I found the state they were in I sent him for a police officer, and likewise for a medical man; he very soon came back with both—I stopped in the room where the prisoner was, till he returned—I did not say anything further to him, nor did he to me—these parties have lived in this house about five years; they have quarrelled a great deal at times, and very frequently—it appears that the prisoner had been drink<lb></lb>ing in the afternoon part of this day, but I did not see him—I believe him to have been in a sober state.</p>

I was called to see Mrs. Willis, about 2 o'clock, on the morning of 25th Dec.—I found her lying in bed, her dress covered with blood—I found a wound in the lobe of the left ear—it was a punctured wound; it had passed right through the ear, and wounded the side of the neck just at the angle of the jaw—there was a cut on one of the fingers; it was not a very bad out; it seemed as if a portion of the skin had been sliced off, as it were, but it was not very deep—this knife would be a likely instrument to do it—it was not found that night—I was shown ft razor that was found in the next room, and I did not think that could have done it—I went into the front room, where the prisoner was; he wag sitting on the side of the bed, bleeding very much from a wound in the neck—it was a jagged wound, and appeared as if it had been cut from right to left, and from left to right, both ways—he had lost a great deal of blood—the wounds were superficial, not very deep—the wound upon the prosecutrix was not a dangerous one as it was—it was in the neighbourhood of the carotid artery, about a quarter of an inch, or so, but it might be influenced by the position of the neck—that is a very dangerous position for a wound.</p>

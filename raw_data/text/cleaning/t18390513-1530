On Monday the 6th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at Night, I went into the King's Arms public-house at Longford, kept by. William Godfrey—I went into the tap-room with him, and saw Stanley sitting behind the door, and the two female prisoners—I was sober—after a short time I had occasion to go into the yard, and while there the two women came up, one on one side, and one on the other—what they said I don't recollect, but I pushed them away, and one of them said, "Let me—old gentleman"—I said, "I don't want you"—she directly put her hands round me, and began to feel about my person, and before I could button up, the other put her arm round my neck, and said, "I will kiss you," and then we all went down together—I fell under them, and one of them directly said, "Stanley, Stanley!"—I could not call out, because that woman laid across my chest—she threw her body across my chest—somebody came and fell on my legs—I expect it was Stanley—I then felt somebody's hands in my pocket—I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 5 sovereigns, and a country 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in a red purse in my fob pocket—I felt a hand in my fob pocket, and they tore the button off that it was buttoned with—I am sure I had that money in my fob before I went into the yard—I could feel it outside—I hung to their clothes, and when they got up it pulled me up, and I saw Stanley standing close behind them—whether he pushed</p>

               <p>them or not, I cannot say, but I was pushed down again, and they all three ran away—I directly returned <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the house—I saw the two women turn to the left hand, and Stanley to the right, out of the yard into the high road—I missed my money as soon as I got up—I held my breeches up as well as I could, and ran to the house, and complained of losing my money directly to the company in the house.</p>

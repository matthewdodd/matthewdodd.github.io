            . I am apprentice to a ropemaker in Featherstone-street. On the 26th of July, I was looking out at a window up stairs, and saw the prisoner looking into the prosecutor's window - he then took the kettle, and walked up the street with it; there was another person with him - I told a man who worked in the room with me; I went down and pursued him, and took him in the City-road with the kettle - I lost sight of him for about five minutes, but I am sure he is the same person.</p>

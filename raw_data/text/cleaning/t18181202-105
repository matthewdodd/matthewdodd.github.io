            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of November, about one o'clock in the morning, a watchman in Brownlow-street called to me, and said a man was going down the Coal-yard with a sack. I went and overtook the prisoner, asked what he had got in the sack? He said it was waste onions, that he was going to take to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020047"></xptr>master's stable in the Coal-yard. The patrol came up, and asked who his master was? He said it was Mr. Stockbridge. He dropped the sack, and we took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Covent-Garden. On the 21st of November, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner crossing the street with a sack, just by where they were taken from. I asked him what it was? He said it was onions, that he was going to take them to his master's stable, and if he did not take them home, he should not get his wages. Knowing he worked in the market, I let him go.</p>

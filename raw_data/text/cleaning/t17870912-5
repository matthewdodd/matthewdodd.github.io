               <p>When were the prisoners apprehended? The 1st of September in the morning.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see them again? - Yes, at Bow-street; the people that stopped them took the rabbits and the turkies, for they were dead, and of very little use.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of September, about half after nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners coming out of a field that leads from Kentish Town to the turnpike in Tottenham Court Road; Holdsworth had a basket, and the other had a handkerchief stung to his shoulder with a stick; I followed them down Tottenham Court Road till they came to the Terrace, where my brother officer Hatch lives; I called to him, and told him I suspected these men; I immediately laid hold of Holdsworth, he dropped the basket, and we had a struggle; the other ran away, and Hatch pursued and took him; in Holdsworth's basket, four yellow turkies, a very large yellow rabbit, and a small one yellow likewise: I took them to Bow-street, and on Monday I heard the things were claimed by the prosecutor in the presence of the prisoners; they said they found them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners counsel. Which of them was it that said he had found them? - They both said so.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say that Holdsworth said so, or that the other had asked him to carry them? - I am sure he said so.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning was it? - About half after nine, or between nine and ten.</p>

               <p>Court to Froggett. Those things that were stopped, were shewn to you at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you tell with certainty whether any of them belonged to you or not? - They were not marked, but I believe they were mine; they were the same size, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120010"></xptr>the same number as I lost; the drake was a remarkable large one, greyish, and some green upon his head; I bred him in the spring.</p>
               <p>Can you say with any degree of certainty, whether it was your drake or not? - I cannot, but I believe it was mine.</p>
               <p>Do you think if it had been among a flock and you had look'd for it, you should have known it? - Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time in the morning were those missed? - About six or seven o'clock I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then they must have been stole between nine o'clock in the evening and that time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Saturday morning I got up about six o'clock, I went to Holdsworth's lodgings, and stopped there; I asked if he would go out and see for a day's work at hay-making; we went round the fields and could not get any work, and in the field near Tottenham Court Road, these things lay; we took them up, and did not know what to do with them; the other prisoner said he would take them home and have them advertised, and if nobody owned them, we would make use of them.</p>

               <p>I live in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, Bloomsbury; I keep a horse and cart, and sell greens about the the town.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house? - No, I have two rooms in the house of Mr. M'Cabe, a rabbit merchant, in Leadenhall Market.</p>
               <p>Do you know Holdsworth? - Yes, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day he was taken up? - Yes, the night before he went to bed in my back parlour, about a quarter after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your company before he went to bed? - All the afternoon long.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning did he go, out? - As near as I can say upon my oath, about ten minutes or a quarter past seven.</p>
               <p>It was not before seven? - No, it was not; my milkman always comes at seven, and I called him up to take the milk in, and I am sure he was then at home.</p>
               <p>How soon did you hear he was in custody? - The same day.</p>
               <p>Then are you sure he was at home at seven in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And slept at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of the house do you sleep in? - I sleep in the fore parlour, and the partition is taken down between the room where he slept, and the room where I slept, so that it is like the same room.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have not you been in custody yourself within these three months? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor within these six months? - No, nor within these two years. I'll tell you the truth; once I was a poor man; I went a begging, and was then taken up as a vagrant, but was never taken up upon any charge for any crime.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Holdsworth? - A shoemaker; his master is here that he was apprentice to.</p>
               <p>He does not go out a hay-making does he? - No, not that I know of; I don't know; he might; he had work'd some time back at Chelsea, and then he work'd at Knightsbridge, but he was out of work at this time, and had been seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>He was at home all that afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - He went along with me to buy a jack-ass, and I could not get one; and I bought a poor old horse, and brought him home about six o'clock in the evening, and he never went out after that, but staid with me at Mr. Price's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120011"></xptr>the public house, and had some beer, and passed away the time playing at all-fours till after seven.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Several; Mr. Price himself was there, and saw us there.</p>
               <p>Was any-body but you and Holdsworth in company together? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you sup at Price's or your own house? - At my own house.</p>
               <p>Was any-body there at all? - Yes, my wife.</p>
               <p>No-body else? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she sup with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What had you for supper? - A piece of cold breast of mutton and potatoes.</p>
               <p>Any beer? - Yes, a pot; we sent for it to Price's; my wife fetched it.</p>
               <p>What time of night? - About half past seven or rather better; it was not eight o'clock; my wife called me when supper was ready.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - About ten, or about five or ten minutes past ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did Holdsworth go to bed before you or after? - About five minutes after I had been in bed; says he I'll go to bed I think; ay, says I, do; I wonder what you staid up so late for; my wife sat up an hour after.</p>
               <p>Who was first up in the morning? - Holdsworth; my wife got up about eight o'clock; Holdsworth took in the milk, and I sent him to Price's for some spirits a little after seven, and he brought it.</p>
               <p>Your wife was not up then? - No.</p>

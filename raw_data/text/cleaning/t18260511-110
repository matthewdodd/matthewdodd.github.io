When we got to the corner of the court she took hold of me, and said she would suffer death before she would leave me, till she got the sixpence. I crossed to go to Poland-street - she then took hold of me again, and said, "The watchman is coming - I must go;" she then got away, and I missed my money - I followed her, and kept her in sight till Gook, the officer, came up. I had my money safe in my breeches pocket when she first came to me, for I had it in my hand not a moment before, in my pocket - I had hold of her arm when the officer came up; he asked what money she had got; she said, "No more than a few half-pence, which the young man has given me;" he then searched her hands, and took some money out of each hand.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called to take this woman - she was running, and the prosecutor after her - he appeared to be sober; he charged her with robbing him. I caught hold of her two hands, which were clenched, and said, "Now, what has she robbed you of?" he said, three half-crowns, a sovereign, a half-penny, and a farthing; I called a watchman, and gave him one of her hands to hold while I searched the other - she appeared to be in liquor - I found that money on her.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a painter and glazier; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010007"></xptr>known Ronaldson ten or eleven months: On Sun. day I met him in Stepney-fields, in consequence of which he afterwards called at my house for me; I went with him to the Wheatsheaf, near the Spice Islands; he said, where he lived, he had but 16s. a week, and there were little perquisites allowed him by his master; he said they were oil of turpentine; he asked me if I would sell it for him, as I being in the line knew better where to dispose of it than he did; I told him I did not like to have any thing to do with it; after that he called upon me again, and asked me if I had seen any person about it; I told him I was afraid to have any hand in it at all; he said I need not be afraid, for it was safe enough, it was perquisites that his master allowed him; I told him if it was so, I would look out for a person, that was about ten months ago; I was recommended by a person of the name of Beare to Mr. Carruthers; about six or seven weeks before Christmas I went to Mr. Carruther's house, in Pitfield-street, Old-street-road, he is a plumber, painter, and glazier; I saw Mr. Carruthers, and I told him I came from William Beare, and he said he knew him very well; I said I came about some turpentine that Beare had been speaking to him about last club night; he said he understood I did; I asked him if he would have some spirits of turpentine; he said he would; he asked me if it was good; I told him it was very good, as far as I knew; he then asked me if it was safe; I told him it was not mine, but it was very safe, as far as I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you understand by safe? - A. I don't know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you told him it was safe? - A. I did not know but it was the man's perquisites; he asked me how much there was; I told him I could not rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean at this time to swear that you thought it was the man's perquisites, that he came honestly by it? - A. Yes; then Mr. Carruthers asked me when I would bring it, and how much it was a gallon; I told him it could not be dear at 4s. 6d. a gallon; he said that was too much, he would give me 4s. a gallon; I told him I would bring it in the course of a day or two; after I had done work, at six o'clock, I told Ronaldson what had passed; he said, we will take him some, and so be took one bottle, and I another, two days after; Ronaldson and I went together.</p>

               <p>Q. How much do you think those two bottles contained? - A. The bottles contained about four or five gallons, but I cannot rightly say how much there was in each, we both went, I told him we had brought the spirits of turpentine; he said, very well, and took it; we told him what the bottles held; he said, are you sure of it; I said, there was full measure; I believe one bottle had three gallons, and the other two and a half; he paid us at a public-house the corner of Pitfield-street; he put the money upon the table, and I took it up; I gave the money to Ronaldson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enquire, either of you or Ronaldson, who he was? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Not how either of you came by it? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards taken before the Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with any of the officers to Mr. Carruthers's house? - A. Yes; I rung him up, he opened the door; I said, how are you, and then Brown, the officer, went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you work for? - A. Mrs. Baker.</p>
               <p>Q. How much turpentine do you use in the course of a year? - A.About six gallons, but we had hardly and business after my master died; we kept to plumbing and glazing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where the prisoner, Ronaldson, lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his mother-in-law? - A. Yes, but not by name.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was through the representation of Beare that you went to Carruthers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Carruthers, and he said, is it safe, that was before any bargain was struck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand by that, that he asked whether it was honestly come by or not? - A. I understood so, and I told him it was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you took it? - A.Between eight and nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the shop was shut up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know but it might be damaged? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, it was damaged? - A. I related that to Beare beforehand; I told Beare it was damaged spirits of turpentine, that was allowed to a young man by his master for perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid you in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any person might see it? - A. yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I belong to Shadwell Police-office: On the 9th of June, about six in the morning, I went to execute a search-warrant at the house of Carruthers, with Mr. Hillery, a clerk of Mr. Shuttleworth's, Sevier, Holebrook, and Elby; Sevier pointed out the house to us; I sent Savier forward to get admittance; when he got admittance, I followed him in: I saw Carruthers without his coat, he was then speaking to Sevier; I told him I was come for some oil of turpentine; he said, he had none; I told him he had bought some of Sevier; Sevier was in the shop with me; I desired him to shew me where he kept his oil of turpentine; he took down a key, and went backwards into the yard; he unlocked a little place like a colour-shop in the shed in the yard; I searched, and found a carboy full of oil of turpentine; a carboy is a glass bottle fastened in a wicker basket; I made further search, and under the bench in the shop there was another carboy, which I examined, and found to be nearly three parts full of oil of turpentine; I then said to Carruthers, how could you tell me you had none; I asked him then again how he came by it; he told me he had it from the young man, pointing to Sevier, and another young man, that they had come together.</p>
               <p>Q. What might this carboy hold? - A. I believe about seven or eight gallons, I am not certain; I then asked him how many times he had had of him; he told me from six to eight times; I asked him how much they brought at a time; he told me from six to seven gallons; he told me he did not always come with oil of turpentine, but sometimes for money, that they always came together; he said he had given after the rate of 4s. a gallon; I secured the property, and Mr. Carruthers was taken before the Magistrate; I was present when Mr. Hillery took samples of the oil; we have the car boys in Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What is the defendant's shop? - A. He carries on plumbing, painting, and glazing.</p>

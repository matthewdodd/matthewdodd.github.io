On the 8th of September he sent fifty-three sheep by me to Southall - I put them into Mr. Hawkins' field, and on the 15th two of them were missing; they had been penned in a field - I remember the marks on their skins; one was pitched brand on the hip in a star, and the ram was marked on the head, the shoulder, and rump, with red ochre.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you take them there? A. No; I told out fifty-three, and sent them there - I turned them out at Southall, and desired them to be sent to Hawkins' field - I did not mark them myself; they were not all marked alike - I had driven them to market, and turned them out at Southall; I had told the patrol the mark of the skin before I saw it; I am sure this is the skin of one of them - (looking at it.)</p>

            . I am a patrol. I heard of the loss of the sheep, and on the 17th of September I saw two men on the road with potatoes, and followed them to the prisoner's house- I saw the prisoner, and told him as I had followed these men, and found stolen property in his house, I should insist upon searching the house - he put himself in an attitude of resistance, and said I should not, he would sooner lose his life - I said I would search; he then begged I would allow time for his wife to dress herself - I said I would, and I waited a sufficient time for that; I then heard a bustle, and went up stairs - the prisoner was not in the room; I asked his wife what she had in bed with her; she said, "Nothing but myself and my child;" the prisoner had been up once or twice to dress himself, and to tell his wife to dress - I then saw in the room a pan and a small piece of mutton in it, and some droppings of brine from the pan towards the bed - I said I should search the bed- his wife began to cry; I searched, and under the bed I found the mutton - I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said he bought it on Tuesday night; I said, "Who did you buy it of?" he said, "I don't know the man by name, but I should know him if I saw him;" I said,"Did you buy the whole carcase?" he said Yes: I said,"Was the head and skin to it?" he stopped a few seconds and then said, "It is of no use telling a lie, my brother brought it here on Tuesday night" - this is the skin of the ram.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not follow the prisoner to his house? A. No - it was a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning; he came down undressed, except his shirt - he refused to let me search his house without a warrant - I waited eight or ten minutes; there is one room up stairs and one down - I shut the door of the house, and locked it; I had an officer outside - the prisoner went up stairs once or twice, and I should think he had time to put the meat under the bed; I had his brother in custody, and he called out, "Jack, it is of no use;" I think I have told the precise words he used, as near as I can - I am sure he did not say it was bought; he at first said he bought it, and then said his brother had bought it - I had not his brother then in custody; he had made his escape on account of the potatoes - I have the skin in my possession, and it has been so ever since; I showed that and the mutton that I had found.</p>

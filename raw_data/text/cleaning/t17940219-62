On the Wednesday the 19th of January, the prisoner came with two other women, between two and three in the afternoon, I see her lay her cloak on this musliner, and when she took her cloak up, she took up this muslinet with it, and put it in her pocket.</p>

She was going away with it, I stopped her, and desired to look into her pockets; and she told me she had no pockets on; I desired her to put her cloak back, and I found she had pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it at last? - In her pockets; I found the muslinet in one pocket, and this piece of printed cotton in the other; her pockets were put back behind her shoulders, she had two long great pockets; I know the cotton by the pattern, and I know the muslinet by the shop mark; it is Mr. Craig's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My sister and I went to this place, to buy a couple of muslin gowns, to the first thing that she bargained for, was a bit of muslin, and a bit of callico to make a petticoat, and she told me when she got change that she would buy them, and pay for them; on that account when I see her paying for the gowns, I took them up and put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did the sister pay for what she had? - Yes, and carried away what she paid for; I believe this to be a very old offender.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her a character.</p>

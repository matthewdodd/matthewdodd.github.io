On the 16th of March, about half an hour past 7 at night, I was sitting looking through my window; I saw a person's hand drawing a large nest of pans from the opposite corner. I gave the person an opportunity to carry them a little way. I went out, it was the prisoner; she had got about four or five yards with them. There was a man stood with open arms to receive the pans at the end of the bench. I took her by the arms and said, Ship-mate, where are you going with these? she said, D - n your eyes, what is that to you. I said, Pray, how far are you going to carry them? she said, You shall be d - d before I'll let you know, and spit in my face. I said, if that is the case, I will know where you are going: you shall come back and place them where you had them. She said, I'll see you d - d first. I took her back, and said, Put them down there. She said again, Ay! you shall be d - d first, and listed them up, and let them fall, and broke three of them, and spit in my face again. I pushed her from me against the shutter. The fellow said, Why do you use the woman thus? He was very pert, and she very abusive. I conducted her to the Counter: and when I came to take her out on the Monday, there was that man sitting by her. I have found since they cohabited together.</p>

Haddon said about their account - he said Mr. Haddon was out of town, and when he returned we should hear from him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About twenty years - he settled his accounts with me every week once or twice; if a person paid money, he entered it in a book, which I have here - here is the week including the 15th of October - there is no entry on that day; the whole of this is his writing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he ever make payments on your account? A. No; I supposed this money to have been due about Christmas last, but I never applied for it, as it was the first transaction I had had with them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Stone received part of the money with other monies; Mr. Stone has received money from me and not given me an account of it; I went after some other money, which the former clerk had not collected, and was proud to bring it to my master; I have been making him a reparation for some money I lost three years and a half ago.</p>

               <p>After calling the hour of three on the 26th of September in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man passing on the other side of the way, the prisoner with a sack on his back, I crossed to them and they walked faster, I got to the prisoner at the end of Bromley-street, Drury-lane I there attacked him, and asked him what he had got, I imagined by the answer he gave me, chips, I said, what carpenter yard is there open, he then said, it is a trifle of sugar brought from Temple-bar, and going up to St. Giles's; he then said, quarter-day is so nigh, and as I am under a little straitness, I am obliged to move, says I my friend you must go to the watch-house with me, and we went along very jocose together, he desired me not to take him to the watch-house, otherwise he should lose his goods, he then said he had brought them from Wapping, I suspected then he had brought them from the fire, he said he would satisfy me well if I would go into Church-street, the next door to the Hammer and Trowell, I said he must go to the watch-house, he then said the goods were not his own, but that a man gave him one shilling to carry them; I then passed three watchmen, I said it signifies nothing, and I was opening the bag to see the contents, and he desired me not to tumble the bag, for there was candles in it, and I should break them; he rehearsed almost every article that was in the bag, and I took him and the sack to the watch-house, I never saw him before to my knowledge? he did not make any forcible resistance.</p>

               <p>On the Thursday evening before this happened I went to Wapping to see an acquaintance, I staid drinking till after two, and at the lower end of Fleet-street I met with the young man that had the bag, the bag laid down, he asked me where I was going, I said to St. Giles's, he asked me to carry the bag and offered me a shilling, I agreed with him, he told me he lived next door to the Hammer and Trowel in Churc-street, he was along with me all the time, and when the watchman stopped me; he had before told me when I wanted to rest, to take care, for there were candles and soap, and such things in the sack, and if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290083"></xptr> put them down, I should break them.

               <p>Court to Jury. You see, Gentlemen, by reason of the absence of this woman, there is no direct evidence of the door being fastened again after it was opened to take in the parcel.</p>

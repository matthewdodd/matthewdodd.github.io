I had a purse containing four sovereigns and fifteen shillings in my trowsers' pocket - she did not come to bed, but asked me for 1 s. to get some gin - she went out for it, and did not return - I went to sleep, and when I awoke my breeches were there, but the money was gone, and my watch was taken from under the pillow. I was quite sober - I had not been drinking. I saw nobody but her in the house. I shewed her the money, and told her that if I lost it I should blame her for it. I found my watch in pawn. I saw Carty again in two hours, and knew her.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On Friday morning Leden described this girl to me. Carty was in the house at the time; I took her, and found sixpence halfpenny on her, a person said in her presence, that he had found the watch in pawn. I asked what she had done with the money, she made no answer. I took her to the pawnbroker's, he said she was not the person who pawned it. she said if the prosecutor would forgive her she would get him his watch back, and return part of his money, but that she had only taken two sovereigns and four half-crowns.</p>

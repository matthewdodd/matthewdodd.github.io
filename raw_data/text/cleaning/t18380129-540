                  </hi>. I am in the employ of James Kelly, a shoemaker—his shop is at No. 5, Little May's-buildings, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields—I sleep there. I went out last Sunday, the 21st of January, at a little before two o'clock—I fastened the door by a padlock, and the win<lb></lb>dow was fast which looks into the yard—returned at half-past ten o'clock,—it and found the door without the padlock—I tried to open it, but could not—it was fastened inside—I called to the next-door neighbour, and went round into his premises, got a ladder, and got in at tie window which looks into the yard-that was shut, but I opened it—I could see nobody at first, but when I got quite in I saw the prisoner lying across the fire<lb></lb>place, on the hearth—he pretended to be asleep—I tried the outer door, and found a screw-driver, a brad-awl, and a chisel, which belonged to me, placed inside to prevent my getting in—I took them out, and let the po<lb></lb>liceman in—I found some shoes which had laid on the show-board in the window when I went out, were gone—it was three pain of boots and three pairs of shoes—they belong to Mr. Kelly—I found them deposited in a bag in one corner of the shop, a short distance from the door, in a place where I put the shutters—the bag belongs to me—I asked the prisoner what brought him there—he told me he found the door open, and came in to lie down—I gave him in charge, but found nothing on him—I am quite sure the shoes and boots had been left on the show-board, and not in the bag—I gave them to the policeman.</p>

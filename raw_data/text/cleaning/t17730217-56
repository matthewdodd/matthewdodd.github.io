               <p>Q. What watch?</p>
               <p>Cummings. A pinchbeck watch; it was at one Mr. Sanderson's; he kept a public house; he is now dead; the prisoner came to Mr. Dickenson's house, knocked at the door, and asked if the maids wanted any muslins; I went to enquire; they said they did not want any. When I came back she told me she wanted to speak particularly with me, she had something of consequence to say to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I never saw her before. I desired her to go to the tap house and I would come to her presently; I went; she said she could not tell me what she had to say unless I could lay down a sum of money, as much as I could get, and count it before her; I went into the compting house and borrowed a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect from this, to let a person you never saw in your life have your money?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did not mean to let her have it: I went and borrowed ten guineas, and then I borrowed twenty more; she then said she could not tell me there, that the house was not convenient; we went to another; she said that would not do; then we went to another which was

            's, and I took the money with me; we went into a back room of his, and there I counted the money I had made up, 40 l. 8 s. 6 d. she bid me put it in a handkerchief; I did so, and she tied it up in three or four knots as I thought, and desired me to tie up a knot or two besides.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Was it her handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No, it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. You tied some knots too did you?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Cummings. One or two, I am not positive, and she gave me the money as I thought, and bid me take it home and put it in my box, and desired me to swear solemnly I would not look at it till next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your own handkerchief you took?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put the money in the handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Cummings. To the best of my knowledge I put it in.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170057"></xptr>Q. How long was you to secret and not open it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Till next morning; when I came to look at it in the morning, I found nothing but bad halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. But what profit was you to have from this?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She took such solemn oaths, and I was foolish enough to believe her, that there was a quantity of plate lodged for some years in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. In what cellar?</p>
               <p>Cummings. The cellar where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to have that plate?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes. I was to make it appear I had so much money; that I was worth so much, or else she could not tell me any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Court. You never was served so before?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did not think a man could be imposed on so.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you she put the plate there?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was all from her superior knowledge, she passed for a conjurer I suppose?</p>

               <p>Cummings. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you found your mistake?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I made myself content, for I thought it was all in vain to look after her.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say about the watch?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I took it out to see what was o'clock; she said it was a pretty watch; I gave it her to look at; I forgot to ask for it again; I never saw it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask to see it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she give it you again?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No; I never saw it again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. As soon as I got home; I went directly home from Sanderson's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you live from Sanderson's?</p>
               <p>Cummings. About 100 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any where in your way?</p>
               <p>Cummings. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to any body in the street?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I went straight home.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose plate was this to be; did you think it was to rise out of the earth, or come from the heavens?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She said it had been lodged there some years.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not lose your watch going home?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to meet with the woman now?</p>
               <p>Cummings. At present I keep a public house in the Minories, which Mr. Dickenson put me in; she came one morning for a pennyworth of purl and some bread and cheese; I thought at first look that she was the woman that robbed me; at the second look I was positive she was the woman; I then sent for a constable and sent her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Cummings. About three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure she had this money of your's?</p>
               <p>Cummings. Yes, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who held the handkerchief while the money was put in it?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She held it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put in your handkerchief, and then in a handkerchief of her own?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She had one of her own, I do not know what she did with it.</p>
               <p>Q. It took you up a good while looking for your plate I suppose?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I thought it was in vain to look when I found I was taken in so.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. When you took her did she say any thing?</p>
               <p>Cummings. She said she did not know any thing of me, and made a noise and wanted to get out; I bid her sit easy, I would not hurt her; two or three persons in the tap room came to assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was to have all the plate in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cummings. I was to look for the plate and to have it I suppose if there was any: I was simple enough then to believe it; it was the first time and I imagine it will be the last.</p>

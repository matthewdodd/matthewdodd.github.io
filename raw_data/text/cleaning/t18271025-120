            . I am an officer. I was applied to, on the 28th of September, by Timson: he went to the house; and pointed the prisoner out to me; she at first denied it, but afterwards said, the sovereigns she took from him she had left at the public-house - I said there was more; she said there was not - I asked if she had any box; she produced one, in which I found several new articles; she said she had bought them with a sovereign she had taken from him, and told me the shop - I went there; they said she had said for them with a sovereign.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she and the prosecutor were intoxicated, and he gave her eight sovereigns to take care of, saying she might keep three of them herself.</p>

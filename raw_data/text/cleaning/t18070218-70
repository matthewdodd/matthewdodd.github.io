               <p>Q. What room did he take. - A. A room across the yard, it formerly was part of a shop, we made it into a sleeping room; he took it by the week, and was to pay 3 s. 6 d. a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you expected him to stay one week. - A. Yes, he took it on the second, and slept there on the third of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him after the third. - A. Not till I met him in Carnaby street on the eleventh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any intimation that he was going. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he only wanted the room to sleep in. - A. No; he had for his use in the room, two blankets, a counterpane, and two sheets. On the next morning I went into his room to make the bed, I found the sheets, blankets, and the counterpane was gone, and a large quantity of horse-dung left, which had been emptied out of an handkerchief; when he came he had a large bundle in a handkerchief; which I supposed to be his clothes, and a great basket, that I supposed to be his tools; he said he was a carpenter. When I met him in Carnaby street, I spoke to him, I said you are the man that robbed me, he said he had not, I said I would take my oath he was the man, he said if I would let him go he would fetch me the bed clothes; I laid hold of him, he drew me into the middle of the street. I called Mr. Marshall, whom I knew in the market, he came and secured him.</p>

            . I believe I pawned three of these handkerchiefs; one in King-street, the others facing St. Giles's church: Hull and the prisoner came home together, when they brought them, and called me out of bed about ten o'clock.</p>

            . I was in Covent Garden, and did not see Hull and the prisoner come home that night with the handkerchiefs. I came home about twelve at night, they were both there. The next morning, being Sunday, I saw three handkerchiefs, one was about Wilcox's neck, the other two under his head, which two he gave me to pawn: I pawned one in St. Giles's and the other in King-street. I went afterwards, when they were taken out.</p>

            . When the two girls were taken up, we found where six handkerchiefs were pawned: we went and got them; (produced in court) and two others were found among the stockings upon Hull. Hull gave the same account before the Justice as he has now.</p>

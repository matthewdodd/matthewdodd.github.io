             sworn. - I am surveyor of the Thames-police: Early in the morning of Friday, the 16th of October, immediately after twelve at night of the Thursday, I saw the prisoner sculling a ship's boat on shore to Iron-gate-stairs; and, putting alongside the boat, I discovered a bundle liying in the bow of the boat; I stepped into the boat in which the prisoner was, and feeling the bundle, I found it was clothes; I put my hand in, and took out a pair of stockings, which, from their apearance, I supposed not to be his; upon which I said, these are not your clothes, where did you bring them from? he told me from an American ship, pointing to Iron-gate tier; on further enquiry, he told me they were the captain's; I asked him if the captain was on board, and he replied, no; but that he was going to take them on shore; I then took him into my boat, and desired him to point out to me the ship; he pointed out to me a ship, but not the one from which the things came; I called up the steward of that ship, and informed him what I had met with; he said, they were not his; but a boy, who was on board, was sent by the steward across the tier, and he brought back the owner of the property, Darrell; I shewed him a pair of stockings, and he told me they were his; a person, that is here, then searched his waistcoat, and out of the waistcoat-pocket took a gold watch; the prosecutor, Mr. Darrell, immediately said that was his watch; I took him before the Magistrate, and he was committed.</p>

On the evening in question, I was called out of the chapel at Brentford, and on going to Messrs. Booth's wharf, I found two snacks partly filled with barley, in the boat, and four in the saw-pit - the sacks were Messrs. Booth's, and the barley was theirs, I believe - from the appearance of the bulk, I believe some had been taken from it; I noticed an alteration in the bulk the moment I went into the granary - I have kept the barley separate which was in the six sacks, and I have no doubt it was the same as that in the granary; the sacks were worth 2s. each, and the barley 2l. 5s. - I suppose the granary had been entered by a window about two feet from the ground, two bars of which had been taken out, and then the doors were unbolted; the hole in the window was quite large enough for a man to get through.</p>

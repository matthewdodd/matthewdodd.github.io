               <p>Petty Matthews. The 19th of December, between 7 and 8 in the morning, I lost 24 yards of stuff; my lad was opening the shop, and carrying the things into the back warehouse, he called to me, and when I came down stairs, I saw the Prisoner at parly with him; she had then dropped the piece of goods at the door in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she dropped it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I saw her drop it; then I pulled her into the shop; she asked my pardon and said, it was the first fact that ever she did.</p>

               <p>Ubly. She was brought into the shop, but I don't know what she said to my master.</p>

               <p>King. That part which was unrolled; then I took hold of the Prisoner, and heard her say, she hoped my master would forgive her, for it was the first fact that ever she did, she said it two or three times at Guildhall afterwards.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 24th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, I went to a house in Twine-court, kept by Hays - I have seen her there repeatedly; I saw a light there - I knocked at the door, and they put the light out - I knocked repeatedly; they said,"Who is there?" I said, "Tom;" they said, "What Tom?" I said, "Oh, you know me very well, open the door;" I then said I was one of the Police, but they would not open it - I said if they did not I should use force, and in about ten minutes it was opened; I did not find either of the prisoners there - I took King to the station, and before she spoke I heard McCarthy say, "We are done;" I heard Hays say something about taking King's life.</p>

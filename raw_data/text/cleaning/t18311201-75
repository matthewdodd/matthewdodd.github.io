On the 7th of November, about a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Oxford-street, about ten minutes walk from the prosecutor's house, carrying a hat under his arm, and another on his head; I asked where he got that hat - he said, "My master gave it to me;" I asked who his master was - he said a Mr. Pemberton, that he had forgotten the hat-maker's name, but he lived in Bond-street; I found this tea-pot in the hat, and that the hatter lived in King-street, Covent-garden - I was going to take him, but he darted across the road, and ran away; I pur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010054"></xptr>sued, and he was stopped by another Policeman - I went to the prosecutor's, and called up Williams; he had before been called by the watchmen - I found the door shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner appear intoxicated? A. No - after he was committed he told the Magistrate a woman had given him the things, but he previously told me he had got into the back place, and fallen asleep, that he afterwards awoke, and let himself out with the things.</p>

On the 2nd of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I took four gentlemen to the Hay-market - when they got out of my coach they were jumping on my horses, and one of them tore his trousers; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came up to me, and said the gentlemen were having a bit of fun with me - he then asked me to have something to drink, and we did; when we came out of the house where we had it, the prisoner asked where I was going - I said to Whitechapel; he said he lived that way, and asked if I would give him a ride - I said Yes, and welcome; he then asked if I would let two women get into the coach, and he got on the box; as we were coming along Fleet-street I felt his hand in my pocket, and told him to keep it away - when we got on to <placeName id="t18310512-99-crimeloc584">Ludgate-hill</placeName>

            . The prosecutor called me, and gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of some money - he said at the watch-house in Paternoster-row, that it was four shillings and four half-crowns - he was in liquor, but had his senses; he seemed to know what he was about; we found four shillings on the prisoner and one half-crown - it was half-past two o'clock in the morning.</p>

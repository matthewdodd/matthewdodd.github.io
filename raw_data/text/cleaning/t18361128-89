                  </hi>. I am an assistant-surgeon, and live in King William-street. On the evening of the 16th November I was in Norton Falgate, and felt a twitch at my pocket—I had used my handkerchief shortly before—I then put my handkerchief more firmly in my pocket, and in about half an hour Groves spoke to me—I felt, and it was gone—I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

On the evening of the 16th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and saw both the prisoners in company with another boy—I saw them attempt several pockets—when Mr. Archer came by they all three followed him—he was walking at a very quick pace—he crossed into Hackney-road, and there Belsham took a handkerchief out of his pocket—Kett received it, and put it into his trowsers pocket—I then stood in the road—they all three turned into the road—I followed them, and Kett up with his fist and said, "Knock him down"—they turned down a court—I ran after the prosecutor, and he came back with me—I showed him where they went—we looked for a policeman, and found Palmer—I went with him to two public-houses, but could not find them—we came into Shoreditch, and at the corner of Church-street saw the two prisoners and the boy—I laid hold of Kett, and Palmer of Belsham—Kett up with his fist and was going to knock me down—the other ran away, he was quite a boy.</p>

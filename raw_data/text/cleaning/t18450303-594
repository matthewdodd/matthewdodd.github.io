               <p>Office. In 1835 a policy was effected in that office on the furniture in a house, No. 15, Regent's-terrace, White Conduit-fields, Islington—this is the policy—the number of it is 443116, and the amount 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on fur<lb></lb>niture at the dwelling-house of Mr. William Onley—the annual premium and duty is 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is our usual course to send out a notice when the time for the payment of the premium is arriving—one would have gone to Mr. William Onley in the usual course of business—I have no personal recol<lb></lb>lection of it—I have here such a notice, with the post mark on it—the premium upon that policy appears to have been paid, by my account, but I have no recollection of receiving it—I receive a great many—I have the book here, which contains the margin of the receipt corresponding with the receipt—on the 30th of Dec. I have an entry of my own—a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was tendered in payment of the premium—I put the number of the policy on the note—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">note</hi>)—I find the number 443116 on this note—that is the number of the policy put by myself—I gave a receipt at the time—I only remember the transaction generally—whether a man or woman paid it I cannot tell—it it my invariable practice to put the number of the policy on a note, in the presence of the person who gives it me—I marked the change for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the notice at the time—here is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked upon this notice—this is the receipt that I gave—it is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">This receipt was produced by Peak, and was dated 30th Dec, 1844, for the payment of </hi>6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">premium and duty, by Mr. William Onley, on policy number 443116, and signed by the witness</hi>)—this is the date the receipt was issued.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable acting at the General Post-office. On the 27th of Jan. I was in the Solicitor's office—the prisoner was there under an inquiry—he was asked where he lived—he said at No. 15, Regent's-terrace, White Conduit-fields—he was asked what rent he paid—he said 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—he was asked who insured the house and furniture—he said he insured the furniture for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the Royal Exchange, and the premium was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was then asked who paid the last premium—he said, "I did,"but then, apparently recollecting himself, he said, "Oh, there is some mistake about that; I lost my notice paper which was sent to me from the Insurance Office; I mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Wood, the charge-taker, that I had done so,"and that he did not know how he should get to know how to pay his insurance—he said Mr. Wood ad<lb></lb>vised him to take down the policy to the Insurance Office, and the number would answer the same as the notice—he said that he did so, and when he came there he found that the insurance was paid, but by whom he could not say, nor did he ask; that two or three days after he received a letter containing the receipt, which he showed to all the letter-carriers at the Islington district—he was asked to produce the letter, and he said he could, not—the Solicitor said that the insurance had been paid by a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which was inclosed in a letter addressed to No. 14, Upper Barnsbury-street, Islington—he said he could not tell how that could be—he was about leaving the Solicitor's room, when he said, "Can I see the gentleman?—he was asked what gentleman, and he said, "The gentleman to whom the letter was addressed"—he was asked what he wanted with the gentleman, and he said, to give him the money, if he pledged his bed for it—I then</p>

               <p>took him to my own house, at his request, rather than go to the station that night—in going along he requested to see a Mr. Whitewick, a lodger of his—I got a messenger to go for him, and he came to my house—I told them I must notice all they said—the prisoner said to Mr. Whitewick "I want you to go to Islington; you will be too late to see the man at the office; go to No. 6, Moon-street; he will tell you where Spinks lives and Spinks will tell you where the gentleman lives who was to have the letter, and get the money, if you pledge my bed"—they were about saying something else, and I stopped it—I went to No. 15, Regent's-terrace, where he was living—I made a search of the house, and found this policy, which I have produced, and this file of receipts—the receipts were at the top of a book-case, and the policy I found in a drawer of the burem underneath the book-case—I returned to the office, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any friend or adviser of the prisoner present when he was taken to the solicitor's office to be examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Mr. Sculthorpe, Mr. William Peacock, and another gentleman, Mr. Phillips, I believe, were present—I did not caution the prisoner there—the conversation at the Solicitor's office did not take more than fire minute—it was before he and Mr. Whitewick commenced conversation that I said I must notice what he was saying; and when I found the conversation was against the prisoner, I stopped it—I went to the prisoner's house, and saw his wife—I produced the policy to her, and said, "You paid this with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—she said, "Yes"—I did not, before she said so, say, "It is no use your denying it, for your husband said you paid it with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and it will benefit him if you can tell me the day upon which it was paid"—I said nothing to that effect; allow me to state what I did say; it was some<lb></lb>thing to that effect; I said, "Your husband says that you paid the last insurance;" she said, "Yes;" I said, "With a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?" she said, "Yes;" I said, "What did you do with the change?" she said, "Sir, that was part of it that you saw when you were here before"—I had been there on the 15th—it was untrue that the husband had told me this; he had never said any such thing, although I told her that he had—we are obliged to tell falsehoods to get truth, I swear that, and I could mention three cases that I have an object in now, where I have got the stolen property—the prisoner's wife did not at first deny that she had paid the prennn—she answered me off-hand, as I answer you—Mr. and Mrs. Whitewick were not present, I swear that, not during the conversation at all—Mr. Whitewick never came in till Mrs. Onley fainted away—she fainted away on a question I was asking her about the gentleman she paid the money to, whether it was an old or young gentleman.</p>

I speak the truth—I have been fifteen years in the police, and never was contradicted before—I never told the prisoner's wife that it would benefit her husband—I told Mrs. Whitewick that I wanted to get at the date—Mrs. Whitewick came down, and I said to her, "Mr. Onley has sent me, stating that Mrs. Onley has changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay the policy"—Mrs. Whitewick then said "I recollect Mrs. Onley going out clean one day"—I then pressed her to</p>

               <p>get at that date—she and her husband had a conversation on it, and came to the conclusion that it was on a day that her husband had a parcel sent from the country—I told the prisoner that his wife had admitted that the had paid the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for the premium—he said, "Oh, that woman will say anything to get me out of trouble, and put it on her own shoulders."</p>

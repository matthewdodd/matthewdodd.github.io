He emphatically asserts that he did not obtain possession of the same dishonestly, for in fact he never received it at all. Now the party has requested me to see you on the subject, and if perfected through my agency, you will be so good as to address a letter to my house, No. 19, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, London, stating the sum you will give on the papers being given up into your hands. The party is evidently a shrewd man of business, and says the documents are valuable; and further, that no good can be effected with the debtors unless the creditor has them back again. He has thrown out a hint that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ought to be paid as a reward, but he will take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which sum he will have paid into my hands ere he restores the papers, accompanied with a redemption on your part from any ulterior proceed<lb></lb>ings in the event of future occurrences. The cash may be safely depo<lb></lb>sited in my hands, as you will soon know upon an interview, and the papers not in my possession brought to my office within two hours after<lb></lb>wards. I shall be in town on Saturday morning, but must return again into Kent early on Wednesday morning, so I trust the matter will be arranged satisfactorily on or before Tuesday.

Fennelland Co., of Bed<lb></lb>ford-row, as his solicitors, who had done a great deal of business for him—I stopped him, and said I did not want his references, for I should pay no money until I had ray desk and my papers—I showed him the anonymous letters which have been read, and asked if they were in the handwriting of his principal—he said they were—he looked at them—I took them all up, and showed them to him—I had a good deal of conversation with him about the sura to be paid for the restoration of this property—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ultimately named—he at first wanted 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would give no such sum—he wanted me to accept his undertaking to restore the desk after I had paid him the money—I told him I would do no such thing, for bis principal was a great rascal, and however he might be disposed to perform his under<lb></lb>taking, his principal might put it out of his power to do so, in which case I should lose money and desk too, and I did not feel disposed to run that risk—he asked me whether there was any money in the case—I told him I thought he ought to know as well as I did, and I asked him if there was not ten sovereigns in it—he said, "Yes"—I then asked him how his prin<lb></lb>cipal came by it—he said he had stumbled over it in a bye-road, it was open, but all the papers were quite safe in it, and the money also—(my name and address is on the outside leather case, and upon a great many of the deeds inside)—I said it was of no use to tell me that, for it was stolen, to which he replied, "I should say so too"—the arrangement I made with him was reduced to writing, this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)" London, August 5, 845.

Vaughan Prance"—there are some words struck out—they are, "which were stolen from me"—he objected to those words, and said he would not have the undertaking if those words were in it—I repeated that they were stolen, and he said, "Oh, we understand all about that"—I do not know whether they were struck out before or after I signed it—they were struck out with my knowledge—I was afterwards at the Guildhall Coffee-house, in company with Mr. Nash.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you alone with Maynard at this meeting, or in company with Mr. Nash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was with Mr. Nash—he heard all that passed—either I or Mr. Nash put my pen through the words "which were stolen from me"—Maynard did not say throughout, that he believed them to have been found, because, on my saying they were stolen from me, he said, "I should say so too"—I do not recollect anything passing about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did not infer that they might have been originally stolen, then dropped, and found by his principal—that was certainly not the inference I drew from what he said—I do not think he knew who Mr. Nash was—I do not know whether he was introduced to him—Mr. Nash occasionally joined in the conversation—I conducted the principal part of it—I did not go for the purpose of getting his statement, and subsequently making use of it in a court of justice—I went there to see the person who pretended that he could restore to me my papers—I did not mean to pay him any money, certainly—my object was to discover the thief—I intended to pro<lb></lb>secute the person who I believed to be the thief.</p>

               <p>this property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell who I intended to prosecute, because I intended to be guided by circumstances—what he said was not extorted from him, to be used against him—Mr. Nash and I had not settled before we went that he was to be given into custody; because if he had given up his principal instantly, there would have been an end of it—if he had con<lb></lb>vinced me that he had only been acting <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, of course I should not have given him in charge—I am sure he asked me whether there was any money in the case; he also asked me whether there was any silver in it—I do not think I made any reply to that—I then asked him if there were not ten sovereigns in the case, and he said there were—Maynard sub<lb></lb>sequently put the case into my hands at the Guildhall coffee-house—at that time it had no sovereigns in it—Garratt was not apprehended for some time afterwards—Maynard said his principal looked like a publican—he did not say he was a person who wore large whiskers—he said he would do the best he could to find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any doubt that Garratt was apprehended in consequence of the account given by Maynard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot form any conclusion on that point, because I do not know what were the circumstances that led to Garratt's apprehension—I was in the country at the time—Mr. Nash told me he was apprehended—he did not tell me it was through the description given of him by Maynard—nothing was said at the Guildhall coftee-house about Maynard's being a witness—Mr. Nash was not left alone with Maynard there—I went out for about three minutes, but left Collard there—I was not away more than three minutes—I left quite accidentally—it was on that occasion that the desk was given up to me—Maynard brought if in himself—at that time there were no sovereigns in it—I do not think I spoke to him about the sovereigns not being there—he did not, on that occasion, express the greatest readiness to give all the information in his power—he said his principal was a stranger, and he did not know when he would call on him—Mr. Nash asked him when he would come to receive the money—he said he did not know, he could not tell when he might come, he was a perfect stranger to him, but if Mr. Nash would give him time, he would do all he could—that was all that passed, to the best of my recollection—he was then given into custody—he was not in an excited state—I thought him remarkably cool.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you mentioned to him three modes as to the restoration of the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I said, "Either your principal must entrust you with the property, and allow you to take the money too, (which he said his principal would not do;) or you will require the company to entrust you with the money, which they will not do; or you must give your prin<lb></lb>cipal an undertaking, and take one"—he seemed to listen to that, and thought that would be the course he should adopt—he asked me what was in the parcel—I told him I understood there were bills of exchange and promissory-notes—he asked if there was any money—I said I believed there were some sovereigns—he said, "That, of course, cannot be expected to be returned"—I said, "No, certainly not"—he at the same time held in his hands his pocket-book and some papers, and said his principal had dictated to him the terms upon which he would restore the property, and he had copied them down in short-hand—I said, "Do you write short-hand?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—he then said, "I will read to you the paper"—this is the paper he had—it has been translated—as far as I remember, it was, "Agree for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; destroy all letters; an indemnity or undertaking;" and a fourth clause, which I do not recollect—I also saw in his hands this short-hand paper—its peculiar appearance struck me—it has since been translated, and turns out to be a copy of the contents of the case, partly in short-hand and partly in long-hand—I walked with him to the window, and said, "It is very strange your principal does not come himself, if he is an honest man, because he must pay you something for your trouble—he said, "It is usual to pay five per cent, in these cases, but he will take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I shall get five per cent, on that"—after telling him that nothing short of knowing who his principal was, or how he came by the property, would satisfy the company; and advising him, for bis own protection, to ascertain who he was, and make some arrangement upon it, which he was to consider of, we made an appointment for nine o'clock that night (Monday the 4th)—he did not come, but sent this letter—I conversed with him afterwards upon it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"19, Howland-street, Aug. 4, 1845.

To Mr. Clark.")—Next morning he came again to the station—I then introduced Mr. Prance to him, and said, "Now tell Mr. Prance yourself all you have to say"—some conversation then took place, among other things, the amount to be paid was discussed, which was ulti<lb></lb>mately reduced to 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the same time, when he arranged that with Mr. Prance, I said to him, "You know what we were talking about yesterday; nothing will satisfy the company but knowing who is your principal—whether we prosecute him or not will be quite another ques<lb></lb>tion; but we must know whether he is a railway man or not; it is worth everything to us to know that."</p>

               <p>to negotiate with Mr. Prance—at that time I had not the slightest idea that Garratt was the thief, or that Maynard and Garratt were acquainted—he never gave me the name of Garratt his his principal, or any informa<lb></lb>tion that led me to him—I went to Maynard's office, in Howland-street, a few days after his arrest, and found the draft of the letter of Aug. 12, which has been read, in the grate, torn up, with these other papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some of that, you say, is written in short-hand, and some in ordinary writing; do you find that the name of Garratt is always written there in short-hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always—on the 17th of May it is written in the ordinary hand, and on the 21st of July I find "Garratt" written in long hand—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some short-hand papers found on Maynard</hi>)—I have made transcripts of these, but can read the originals—(<hi rend="italic">reading from the short-hand</hi>—"The writer hereof is—, who has deputed an agent and a man of integrity to negociate this matter, and with you alone, with whom you must deposit—<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, as directed, first satisfying you that it will safely be done, accompanied by a redemption on your part from any ulte<lb></lb>rior proceedings in the event of future occurrences. The agent knows not—, neither is he acquainted with his name, but—first satisfied himself that it must be accomplished through some agency, and if perfected through his channel"—then there is a word which I cannot well make out—"still let—emphatically assert that he did not receive possession of the property dishonestly, for, in fact, he never re<lb></lb>ceived it at all. First, whom have I the pleasure of addressing? Secondly, if two parties come, civilly say' Who is the principal?' If conversation is going on, put a stop to it by saying, 'I can only confine myself to the terms of advertisement. Does not your advertisement (rest confessed) show that you look upon it—for, in truth, you are a party to the compromise. If they ask, 'How can you mix yourself up in such a matter?' say, 'You would never have ob<lb></lb>tain possession of the box without my agency; and is it not better to re<lb></lb>ceive it from the hands of a respectable agent in preference to the stained and dirty channel of a practised thief?'"—here is another paper—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) "Finally, all letters which have been addressed to—to be placed in the hands of an agent. On the various—, as advertised, the contents of the box being restored, I undertake, on behalf of the claimant, to waive any proceedings either legally or criminally, and accept the terms con<lb></lb>sented to by—in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Monday. It appears from your search<lb></lb>ing scrutiny that I must give up a matter not enviable to hands more capable of conducting it than myself. You must give up the letters, and with it a redemption in writing from any proceedings against the party or his agent. The conditions annexed to your advertisement offering—<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward on a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances, would deter any man, even if his character were as pure as the driven snow, from giving them up")—there is no date to these—this is a paper found on Maynard: "I O U, Mr. Daniel Garratt, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES MAYNARD</hi>.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Queen-street, Edgware-road. The prisoner Garratt lodged there for six weeks, and left on the 12th of Aug.—I have seen Maynard there—he used to inquire for Mr. Garratt when he came—he saw Garratt there—I do not remember the last time he came there—it might be about a fortnight before Garratt left—I have seen them together.</p>

I have known Garratt since last Christmas, and Maynard for some time before that, I cannot say exactly how long—I have been in the habit of seeing them together at my house from last Christmas down to the time of their being taken into custody—I cannot speak to seeing them in June and July—I saw them in May—they used not to come very often—Gar<lb></lb>ratt lodged at my house somewhere about three months—he left about the last week in June or the first week in July, I cannot tell which—I have not seen them together since Garratt left my house—I saw Garratt and Maynard together at my house on the 17th of May—I might have seen them together afterwards, but I do not recollect any particular day—they appeared to be quite intimate.</p>

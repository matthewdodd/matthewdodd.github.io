            . I am the coachman that drove the prosecutor; I took the prosecutor up at the corner of Albemarle Street; he bid me drive him down Northumberland Street. The prisoner ran up to the horses, caught hold of the harness, and ordered me three times to stop; I did stop: then he ran up to the coach door, and ordered the gentleman to deliver, twice; he put his head in at the door; the gentleman struck him two or three times with his cane; then the prisoner ran away towards St. James's Street; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I use any violence to you or the gentleman?</p>
               <p>Head. No; only ordered me to stop; I did not see any weapon, though I supposed he had some, or I should not have stopt.</p>

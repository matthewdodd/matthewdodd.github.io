On the 6th of June I had a basket near my shop window, containing a quantity of coppers - I cannot tell exactly how much; it held about 30s. worth, when full - it was about half full of halfpence, pence, and farthings - about ten at night I saw it safe; I turned my back into the adjoining room, and in less than five minutes it was gone - a paste board, which had been placed before a broken square of glass, was moved; it was a small cake-basket, without handles - I saw the prisoners in custody the following day, but have not found either basket or money.</p>

            . I live with my parents. On Monday night, the 6th of June, I saw Canty looking into the prosecutor's window; he was alone, and watching at the corner, about six o'clock in the evening - at a quarter to ten I saw him running with the basket in his hand, close to the prosecutor's shop; I heard the money jink - he was about ten yards from the shop; it was a little oval cakebasket, without handles; I told Mr. Anderson - I did not see the other prisoner there.</p>

            . The two prisoners came to the White Lion public-house, called for two pints of beer, and paid for them both with farthings; several persons drank with them - they had a Scotch cap with halfpence in it, and appeared to be dividing them; our house is nearly a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I was shutting up soon after, and they were then sitting on the steps of the next house, and appeared to be dividing a great quantity of halfpence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not another gentleman with you? A. Yes, my brother - and there was a boy with the prisoner, and I saw the handkerchief shifting from that boy to the prisoner: my belief is, that the other picked my pocket and passed it to the prisoner - I seized the prisoner, and put him up against a shutter, that in case he dropped it, I might see it - I believe I did state at Guildhall, that the boy handed the handkerchief to him; the other was nearer to me; I know the boy's face; I have seen him there.</p>

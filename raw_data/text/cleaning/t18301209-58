            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 22nd of November, in Foster-lane, behind the New Post-office, where I was on duty, about seven o'clock in the evening, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I ran down and saw him running from Cary-lane; I took hold of him - the people who were passing said he had stolen a gentleman's handkerchief; I brought him back into Cary-lane, and Mr. Cops was holding up the handkerchief - he said, "He has robbed me of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090036"></xptr>handkerchief, and I have also taken this one from his pocket;" I myself found an old handkerchief on him, which I gave him back - he said the other two did not belong to him; Cops said this to him directly I brought him back - the prisoner said nothing more.</p>
               <p>MR. COPS. I believe this handkerchief to be mine - I have no initials on it; I know it by the pattern and use - it is silk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about the handkerchief - I never saw it till it was produced; I wish to ask Mr. Cops if he positively swears I am the person who took his handkerchief; the officer observed to me on the way to the Compter, that he thought the prosecutor was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>MR. COPS. I do not swear he is the person who took the handkerchief from me, but I can conscientiously swear he is the person I seized, and found in possession of the three handkerchiefs; but two days after I would not positively swear to him - he is the person I saw in Tyrrell's custody, and that is the man I had seized and found in possession of the handkerchief, I have no doubt; I said at Guildhall, I believed the handkerchief was my property, but had no positive mark on it - I believed it to be mine; I had one the same as that a minute or two before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you prepared positively to swear that the person who was brought back to you in custody, is the same person from whom you took the handkerchief? A. Yes, positively.</p>

             I thought Mr. Cops rather strange in his manner, and I might at the time have considered he had been drinking, but since I have been in his company I do not think he was in liquor - I did say so to the prisoner; he certainly knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was proceeding along Foster-lane and heard a cry of Stop thief! I joined in the pursuit, and saw several persons a-head, and several behind me; I ran on, and being a fastish runner I got a-head of them, and turned Foster-lane - I was seized by a man, and an officer came up; there was nobody with me on the night in question.</p>

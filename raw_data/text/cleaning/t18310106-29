            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I was with him when he counted this money in the bureau, and I had paid the prisoner 3s. 6d. from the same bureau<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060020"></xptr>the day before - I went to the shop with my husband, and no one could have gone to the parlour without our seeing them - we could see the street door, but I did not see the prisoner go out; if any one but the prisoner had gone, I think I should have observed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When they were in the shop their door was shut, and the passage door was shut - there was a man and a boy in the passage, and nothing to prevent their coming up as well as I. Witness. No, there was not any thing to prevent them, but we should have heard them, as they must have opened a door, which makes a noise.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I first went to the prosecutor's he agreed for me to go on the Tuesday; I had before been sweeping the roads for 1s. a day - the prosecutor went, bought a loom, and got me to put it up, that took Tuesday and Wednesday; I then said the harness would not do, and my mistress gave me 3s. 6d. to buy one; I went, and bought it - I saw a bill that there was a public-house boy wanted, and went to inquire about it, with the harness under my arm; I took the harness home, then went, and took the place at the public-house - I was there till they took me.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER SEPNCER. He had taken a place at the Virginia Planter; he had had the money from my wife to get the harness, and he brought it home - I had lent him a coat while he was with me, as he was so distressed - he told me he could do from seven to nine dozens of willow a week, at 1s. 6d. a dozen, and out of that he would have to pay 2s.</p>

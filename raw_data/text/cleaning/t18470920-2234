                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and live at 45, Portman-street, Vauxhall. On Saturday evening, the 21st of Aug., about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was in Battersea-fields, and overtook the prisoner Green—she spoke to me first, and said, "My dear, will you go with me"?—I told her, "No, I was going home"—I had never seen her before—I bade her good night—I did not stop, I merely turned round and walked on again—a boy then came up to me, crying, and saying he had lost a horse—I stopped to speak to him, and Green ran away—the prisoner Simpson then ran up to me, and said I had been with his wife, and if I did not give him something he would punch my head off, and he put himself in a fighting attitude—I told him I had not been with his wife, or any man's wife, and I would not give him anything—he put his fingers up to his mouth and whistled—I then saw several men running towards me from the tents in the field, and I ran away—they set a dog at me—in running away I stumbled over a mound and fell—Simpson then came up to me, and the other men also—there were about eight or twelve of them—I directly jumped up—he com<lb></lb>plained to the other men that I had been with his wife, and they all said I must give them some money—Simpson touched my waistcoat, and he and another man held out their hands, and said I must give them some money—I asked them to go to a public-house with me, and I would treat them with drink—I proposed that with a view of identifying some of them—they all said, "No, that will not do for us, you must give us the money now"—Simpson and another man then held out their hands, and I gave them half-a<lb></lb>crown each—they then told me to go away from the field and never come there any more—I gave them the money out of fear—they threatened to punch my head if I did not—I went straight towards Battersea-bridge, met a policeman, and returned with him to the spot—we saw the prisoner Green in the Old-House-at-Home public-house in the field, but I did not speak to her—I had not taken any sort of liberty with the girl, or anybody else.</p>

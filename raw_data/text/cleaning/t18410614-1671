                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and silversmith at No. 47, Oxford-street, in partnership with Thomas Mawley—I occupy the dwelling-house—it is in the parish of St. Ann. On the 15th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner Dobbins in our shop in company with another person—they asked to see some breast-pins—I put some before them, and both looked at them—they asked for some coral pins—I said Mr. Mawley my partner had got them out with him—they then said they were going to Hyde-park, and would come again as they came back—they left the shop, and shortly after Dobbins was brought back by an officer, who produced two pins, and asked if I knew them—I said "Yes"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-decorator, and live at No. 19, Bath-place, Bayswater. I saw the prisoner Dobbins in company with another one and Thompson, in Oxford-street—I knew Dobbins and the other one before by eight—I saw Dobbins go up to Mr. Pars' window—the other man and Thompson stood a little way, about a door off, in conver<lb></lb>sation—then the other man left Thompson, went up to Dobbins, and he and Dobbins entered the shop, while Thompson stood with his back to the gas-post, and his face towards the shop—I crossed over in a minute or so, passed the shop, and saw Dobbins and the other in the shop—I then passed on, and saw Thompson standing with his back to the gas<lb></lb>poet, looking towards the shop—I should think he was about fifteen or twenty yards from the shop—not several shops off—it is one large shop, a linen<lb></lb>draper's—it is hardly fifteen yards—I spoke to a policeman afterwards, and saw Dobbins and the other one come out, take hold of arms, and proceed towards Berners-street—Thompson followed them instantly, and when they got to the corner of Berners-street, they all spoke together, and ran up Berners-street, looking behind them two or three times—I followed on the other side of Berners-street, and when I got on a line with them, I crowed over—they all looked round, and whefl I got on the curb<lb></lb>stone, Dobbins put his hands into his pocket, and the other two ran on—I pinned Dobbins' two arms with his hands in his pocket—I called to the po-liceman to make haste—he came up, pulled Dobbins' hand out of his pocket, put his own hand in, and brought out the two pins—I hallooed to a gentleman to stop the other two—he stopped Thompson—the other es<lb></lb>caped—I said I charged them with felony—Thompson said, "I have never been into the shop"—I had said nothing about a shop—he repeated again it the shop that he had never been in there—I said I knew that.</p>

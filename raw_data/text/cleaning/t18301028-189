On the 15th of October I was at work in my back-parlour; I looked round, and saw a person taking three clocks out of the window - I went into the shop and he ran off with them; he ran fifteen or eighteen yards and then dropped them - I pursued him four or five hundred yards; he got out of my sight, but I had given the alarm, and the prisoner was found soon afterwards - I had not seen his face in my shop, but by his garments he is the person, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he did not see any one drop them. Witness. Yes; I saw you drop these three clocks - to the best of my knowledge he is the man.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard the alarm, and saw this man as I believe, (by his wearing apparel,) run, and a great many persons following - I came up, and a young man who had followed him close, said, "He is gone into this house;" I waited there ten minutes, and sent to the station-house - when the officer came I went in with the serjeant and some woman; we brought the prisoner out - he said, "Let me go; I will go quietly;" from his clothing I have no doubt he is the same person, but I did not see his face.</p>

            . I had information of the loss of these clocks; I went into the house, and saw the prisoner concealed behind a bed - I said, "You are the man I want;" I brought him out - he said, "Don't collar me; I will go quietly;" in going along, he said, "I never was in trouble before."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me whether I had been. Witness. I did not; I asked if your mother was coming, and you said, "I don't know, I never was in trouble before."</p>

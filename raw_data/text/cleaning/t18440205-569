                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 55, Museum-street, Bloomsbury. I have known the prisoner about twenty years—on the 27th of Dec. I went out about half-past four o'clock—I locked my door, and left my key over the ledge of the door, for my grandson, who was out—I came home about a quarter to six—I missed my key, and opened it with another—I found my box was entirely broken, and things banging out of it—I missed a great-coat of my son Thomas's, and a shawl, a pair of ear-rings, and a brooch, of my own, from the looking-glass—the prisoner's wife lived with me—the prisoner and her were separated—she was living with me at this time—she went out with me, and came back with me, so that she could not have taken the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Newell. I was stopping with my aunt, in a room next to the prosecutrix's—on the evening of the 27th of Dec, whilst sitting at tea with my aunt, the prisoner came to my aunt's door, opened it, and said, "I beg pardon," as if he had made a mistake—he closed the door directly—I took a light, went to the door, and saw him standing very near Mrs. Davis's door—I asked what he wanted—he pointed to Mrs. Davis's door, and said he wanted his wife—about a quarter past to five o'clock, a little after this, I went out to light a friend down stairs, and saw him stooping down, as if he was feeling for the key-hole of the door—after letting my friend out, I directly came up, and found the key in Mrs. Davis's door, on the outside, and the prisoner was in the room—I went and tapped at Mrs. Davis's door—he said, "Out"—I asked if Mrs. Davis was in, and he said, "Out," a second time—I knew the prisoner's voice—about five minutes after I heard the footsteps of a man going down stairs—that was about twenty-five minutes after five o'clock.</p>

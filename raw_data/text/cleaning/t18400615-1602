                  </hi>I am a publican, and live in Newgate-street. On the 11th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the excise man came to my house to take stock—I had a cash-box at the time in a drawer—I took it out to get the exciseman's signature to a paper, and placed it on the counter in the inner room—the prisoner was my pot-boy—he was at</p>

"—the prisoner answered, "It is me"—I said, "What do you come down in the dark for? why did you not call out? "—he made no answer, but went up stairs—I remained down for about a quarter of an hour, then came up, went into the inner room, and the cash-box with the contents were gone, and the prisoner also—I saw him in custody in the morning—he hid a new suit of clothes on, a new hat, and new boots.</p>

In consequence of information, I went on Monday evening, the 11th of May, to a gin-shop, in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross, I found the prisoner there, brought him out and said he must come along with me—I observed him thrust his hand into his left-hand coat-pocket, and throw money out on the ground—I heard it jingle—I put my hand behind him to the pocket—he took it off—my hand was then seized by somebody behind, who pinioned me for a short time—the prisoner then attempted to take something from his trowsers' pocket, and threw money out, and as he threw the last money out an officer came to my assistance—it was dark—I could not see what became of the money—we secured him, and took him to the station-house, and found on him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I took him to the Computer, I was afterwards sent for there—Anderson the keeper was present when the prisoner made a statement.</p>

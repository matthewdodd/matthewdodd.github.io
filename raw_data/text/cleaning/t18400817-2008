                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Margaret-place, Hackney-road. On the 9th of June I left my cart at a door in Bucker<lb></lb>idge-street—there was a boy in the cart, and a carpet-bag containing one sovereign, one half-sovereign, three half-crowns, five sixpences, ten shil<lb></lb>lings, sixty pence, and 120 halfpence, in a box—I was in the house about five minutes delivering some goods, when I came back for my book, I</p>

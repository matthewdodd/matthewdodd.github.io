             sworn. I live at No. 91, Watling-street; I was proceeding down the street between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there day-light enough to distinguish the features of a man, supposing there had been no lamps or candles in the windows? - A. I do not think there was. I observed the prisoner at the bar with a piece of white goods under his arm, near to Mr. Gill's door, he was not above a couple of yards from the door, and there appeared to be a piece laying on the ground, that had been dragged out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner alone? - A. I did not see any one with him, observing that I made the best of my way up to him as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you? - A. I believe he did, he set up a running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep the piece of goods still under his arm? - A. Yes, I overtook him about forty or fifty yards from the premises, I stopped him, I told him he must go back with me to Mr. Gill's with the piece of goods, he begged of me to let him go, I took him back, and the goods were claimed by Mr. Gill's warehouseman; he was secured.</p>

            ? - A. Yes I did, they were piled very near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Gill go out of the warehouse? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the door have been left a jar, by somebody going in, or coming out, between the time that Mr. Gill left the warehouse, and the time the prisoner was brought back? - A. There was no person in the warehouse but me, I never heard the door open, after Mr. Gill went out till the prisoner was brought back, I was only about ten yards off from the door in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes was it from the time Mr. Gill went out, and the time the prisoner was brought back? - A. I suppose about ten minutes, the door does not latch, it fastens very tight, it requires a great deal of force to push it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other piece besides that which was brought back with him? - A. That was the only piece that was brought back with him, the other piece was partly in doors, and partly out; both the pieces were Mr. Gill's.</p>

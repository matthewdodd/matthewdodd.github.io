On the 30th of November, the prisoners Wellington and Jackson came to my master's shop together, about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening; they asked if we had pork enough for the week, and if we would buy two pigs of them; I asked what they would weigh; they said about twenty-four stone each - they wanted six guineas for the two; I inquired if they were not old ones or sows, as they were so cheap; they said, No; and I took them over to Mr. Elton's house; Wellington put his hand on a pig there, and said they would hang about that length when they were dead; they said, would I go next day and see them - I said I could not - they said they would bring them down, which they did in about an hour - Elton thought it could not be all right from the price they asked; and he asked Jackson what they were fed upon; he said he was never asked such bl-y foolish questions as that when he bought pigs; we then all went, and had a pot of ale; Wellington stood by the donkey-cart where the pigs were; but came in and drank with us; Jackson then asked if I would buy the pigs; I said I had no objection if they were all right; we then asked him how long he had had them; he said from the Monday before, this was on the Thursday; I said I did not like to have them, I thought it was not all right; we then came out of the public-house; Jackson called to Wellington to go on with the cart; Jackson then said I should not have them if I would give him 30s. more; they were very impudent; I followed them to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070086"></xptr>back of Boston-street, where I knew they lived, as they had applied to me the week before to buy some small pigs of them; I then informed the constable; East came to the office as a witness and was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that nobody had access to the watches but yourself? - A. No, nobody.</p>
               <p>A. Where were they deposited? - A. They were kept in the parlour; nobody had access to them but me; they were only taken out twice to shew him; I presume he took them the second time, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Marcus Levi told me he saw a lot of your's; you are in the habit of shewing lots to different traders; your wife was there; have you not known me to be in the dealing line? - A. I have known you twenty years, but never sold you any thing.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker: I live at No. 4, Ryder's court, Leicester-square: about the 27th of January I bought this watch of the prisoner; I have known him as long as Mr. Windsor has, and considered him as a dealer in plate and jewellery.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for it? - A. I gave him a guinea and a half for this watch and an old-fashioned necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. I have known him 20 years, and is father likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day of the month was it you say you bought it of me? - A. I do not recollect exactly; I have not read the entry of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would mention the day of the week? - A. I cannot tell without I had the book with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the 3d of February; that was the last time you bought a metal watch with a necklace; it is trifling with me? - A. I cannot tell exactly; I did buy a necklace with the watch, and I gave you a guinea and a half for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought it on the 3d of February; I have not seen it since I have been brought here. (The watch produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Windsor.) Look at that watch, Mr. Windsor? - A. I am sure it is my watch; here is my private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is one of the watches that you shewed to the prisoner? - A. Yes; I have had the watch too long not to have known it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know any thing about it before last night, when I was arraigned.</p>
               <p>Windsor. I questioned him about it in Marlborough-street.</p>

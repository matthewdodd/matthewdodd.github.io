            . I live opposite the houses. I had suspicion the prisoner's intended to take the lead; I went to the officer and told him. I went with him, he gave me instructions; the officer blew the whistle; I saw the prisoners come up the railing; I shoved the railing down, and them altogether. I got into the area, the officer and the two prisoners were in the kitchen. Gregory surrendered, Bly would not: Mr. Hunt knocked Bly down. They had ripped the whole of the boarding from the lead of the cistern,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030047"></xptr>and moved the cistern from the wall with intent to double it up.</p>

            . On the 15th of March I had information that the prisoners were seen to go down the area, No. 16, Pentonville. I saw Brown and the other witness, I gave them instructions to stand at the front area, while I went in at the back part of the house; I went in and saw Bly; I gave the whistle, Brown and the other witness came down to assist me. I drew my cutlass, we had a scuffle, Gregory surrendered, Bly would not; I cut him down twice; when he was all over blood he surrendered. I went into the vault that Gregory came out of, I found this chisel. I have part of the chisel that they broke in wrenching off the cistern. This is the chisel that they wrenched the wood-work from the cistern, and this part of the wood-work here are the marks where the chisel has been. This knife I found upon Gregory, and this upon Bly.</p>

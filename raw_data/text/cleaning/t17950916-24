             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Chandler. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop (we had light all the lamps) he asked for a pair of buckles; I was so busy at that time with a lady I could not serve him, I let him stop about three minutes, just before I went to him, he said, are you going to serve me? On my going up to serve him I found the silver buckle drawer pulled open about twelve or fourteen inches; I told him that I suspected him taking a pair of silver backles out of this drawer, and I insisted on searching his pockets. I found two pair of silver buckles in them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the boy near the drawer while you were serving the lady? - He was close to it, and no other person near it. I took the two pair out of one pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would be very glad to go to sea, to serve, my King and country.</p>

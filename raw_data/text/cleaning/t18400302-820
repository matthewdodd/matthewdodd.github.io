                  </hi>. I live at Nos. 1 and 2, Horse-and-Groom-yard, Curtain-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; there is an in<lb></lb>ternal communication from No. 1 to No. 2. I sleep in No. 1. On the 5th of February I went to bed about eleven o'clock, every thing was safe then—MRS. Grove was up a quarter of an hour after me, but did not go into No. 2, at all—I had seen No. 2 quite safe—I was the last up, except my wife, and I did not go to sleep till she came to bed—I was called up between three and four o'clock in the morning, and went into the house No. 2—it appeared as it was left, except that a small portion of the parlour-window was open—the sash was lifted up a little—it was down the night before, but not fastened—a young man named David Bower slept in that room—I found him asleep still—he is not here—I missed two boxes from the back part of that room—the window had been closed the night before by a little servant-girl—she is not here, but I came home about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, and if that window had been up I must have perceived it—somebody must have lifted it much higher to get the boxes out—they contained a large quantity of linen, a variety of children's clothes, some printed books, and a tea-caddy—the boxes belong to my daughter—the value of all the property in the boxes is about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at a low calculation—when I was called up, I found the two prisoners and another man in custody, at the station-house, with all the property that was missed—I had seen it safe the afternoon before.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of February, about half-past two o'clock, I was on duty near the prosecutor's louse, and coming by Horse-and-Groom-yard I saw a man, not in custody, standing on the pavement opposite the yard—when I got near the yard, I saw the two prisoner's come out of the yard—they all three joined together, and went up Curtain-road—one said to the other, "I have <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> him twelve shillings, and the b——is not satisfied with that, he wanted the other two"—I turned down Horse-and-Groom-yard—there is a mews to the right—I turned my light on near the bottom, and saw two boxes, a tea<lb></lb>caddy, a writing-desk, and some wet sheets—in a few minutes Sergeant Kidney came up—I told him, he accompanied me down there, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up to Horse-and-Groom yard—Hull and another not in custody came running down the yard—Sergeant Kidney and I were there, and as soon as they saw as they re<lb></lb>turned and made a run—I pursued, and took Hull into custody—the other made his escape altogether—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing at the entrance into the yard—Morris was sitting on the box, and the door of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was open—it was the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that had driven up—Sergeant Kidney came up and ordered the <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man to stop—he put the boxes into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and ordered him to drive to the station-house—Morris remained on the box till they got to the</p>

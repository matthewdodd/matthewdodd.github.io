            . I am porter at the New Inn. - On the 25th of November, about six o'clock in the morning, Benton's waggon came in, and about eight I was informed a truss was taken from it; I ran into Carter-lane, and saw the prisoner walking, with it on his shoulder - he said a gentleman had sent him for it, and he would shew me the gentleman. I said, "Come with me;" he threw it down, and run away; I picked it up, and called Stop thief! I lost sight of him; I saw him in about half an hour, in custody, at the Albion coffee-house, Watling-street, and was certain of him. He hung his head down on seeing me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw him before? A. No; he ran very hard; I saw him for two minutes before he threw it down - he wore a blue coat and yellow waistcoat.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I had come up with the waggon, and in about an hour and a half I was coming out of the stable, and saw the prisoner take the truss out, and put it upon his shoulder; I thought he might belong to it, but when I saw him run I called Venables, and pointed him out; I returned, and in about five minutes saw him come running by the Inn, without it; he turned down a street by Old Change. I saw him at Guildhall about twelve o'clock, and was sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He chose to run by the same place again? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On the 25th of November I saw the prisoner in Carter-lane; he ran by me, with the truss upon his shoulder; the porter overtook him- he then dropped it down, and ran back, by me; I pursued, and lost sight of him, but saw him in ten minutes, and collared him; he said he was the person who cried Stop thief! I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him and the porter speaking together? A. Yes - I think he said a gentleman had sent him after it; he stopped just to drop the truss; I noticed him before he came up, seeing a respectable dressed man with a truss, and after he had passed I heard a cry of Stop thief!</p>

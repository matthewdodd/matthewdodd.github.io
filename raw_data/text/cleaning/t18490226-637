On Wednesday, 31st Jan., I carried the lunch to the dining-room at one o'clock—I carried on the tray four table spoons, four forks, two dessert spoons, a butter knife, and two salt spoons, all silver—at a little before two I went to dress, and while dressing I heard the street-door bell ring at about a quarter before two—I did not attend to it, Ann Grey the lady's maid did—that was the only bell that rung between one and two—it was my duty to attend to the door, except on particular occasions—at a little before two I went into the dining-room, and missed from the tray four table spoons, one dessert spoon, and a fork—the dining-room door is about six yards from the street-door, on the righthand side of the hall—I have not seen any of the things since.</p>

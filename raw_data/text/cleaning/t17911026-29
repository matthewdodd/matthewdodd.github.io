I did not hear her go to bed. I arose about a quarter after six, I heard no alarm in the night, it was the 7th of October, it was light. I observed the pantry window was broke open; it was a sash, the bottom pane of the bottom sash was broke; the sash was put up again, and the shutter shut to, a person might thrust down their arm, and open the window; I saw no marks of violence, only I found a little blood on the shutters. I missed the things in the indictment, they are my master's property; I saw them a quarter after eleven in the pantry, that was a good distance from the window, but in the same room. The things are here. I did not know the prisoner before, I was footman, and had been about ten weeks. The things were found at the pawnbroker's, I was not present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Petheram, and live in West-square, Lambeth. On Saturday night, the 8th of May, I went to a fishmonger's stall near the Marsh-gate, to make a purchase—I saw the two prisoners standing by me—I had my purse out to pay for what I had bought—it contained four sovereigns and three shillings—Marks looked very bard at me—he put his hand across me, and took up the crab that I had bought, and felt the weight of it—he then put it down, and offered 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three small ones—I tied up ray purse, and put it into my pocket—I turned from the stand, and in a moment I felt Hyams's hand in my pocket—I turned round and told him he was robbing me—the prisoners were standing together—I did not see them talk—Hyams said, "I am not"—I felt my pocket, and my purse was gone—he ran from me, and the mob secured him in a shop—Marks came over, and tried to defend him, and get him from me—he said he was not the person who had robbed me—I am sure his hand was in my pocket—the purse has not been found—there were several more with them—they are the only two I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Will you undertake to swear that the bread had not been purchased in your shop? - If it had, the money never came to me; I never sold it.</p>

               <p>Court. Where did you see the bread after it was taken away? - In a sack in the watch-house; I went there in consequence of an information.</p>
               <p>Was French in the habit of selling bread for you? - Yes; he carried bread out, and served occasionally in the shop.</p>
               <p>If any body came very early for bread, French being in the shop would have sold it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On the 27th of January, about a quarter before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner Talbert walking backwards and forwards before Mr. Wheeler's shop; Mr. Wheeler had lost bread several times, and desired me to watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270027"></xptr>just as the watchmen had cried the hour of six I saw him go up to the door; I heard somebody on the inside undo the bar, and he lifted up the latch, and went; and I saw French put six quartern loaves, and two two-penny ones, into a bag he had with him; he twisted the bag up, put it across his shoulder, and went across the road.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see any money pass at that time? - Not a farthing; he came directly out; I followed him till he came to the corner of Macclesfield-street, then I crossed the way, and told him he must go with me to the watch-house; I left him and the loaves at the watch-house, and went back to Mr. Wheeler's shop; I called the watchman, and then knocked at the door; I knocked three times before he would open it, then French listed up the bar, and opened the door, and I gave the watchman charge of him till I called Mr. Wheeler; Mr. Wheeler came immediately; he desired him to forgive him; he said he had never done such a thing before; we then took him to the watch-house; I have had the bread in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>What did Wheeler charge him with? - I don't know what Wheeler said.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Had not Talbert time enough, when he went into the shop, to throw down the money for the bread before you came up? - No, not without my seeing him.</p>
               <p>When French asked his master's pardon, you don't know whether it was for having stolen the bread, or having trusted a man his master would not trust? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any thing Mr. Wheeler said to French? - He said he was very glad he was taken; that he had been robbing him for some time; French said, I hope you will forgive me for this time; Wheeler said, do you think I will forgive you, when you have robbed me while I was asleep?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. A man may rob his master by taking his property without his knowledge; or by selling his property without his knowledge; and keeping the money; in which of these senses did he charge him with robbing him? - I don't know; that is what he said.</p>

               <p>I produce eight yards of ribdelure; I received it of the prisoner, the 21st of December; I am sure it was the prisoner; I have been acquainted with her eight years; she had a good character; I knew she had left her place, and I asked her who the goods belonged to; she said, they belonged to Mr. Riches, No. 4, Leicester-court, in the Strand; she said, if I had any doubt, I might soon stop her; she said, she lived servant there.</p>

               <p>(Shewn to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Is not there a thousand yards of this in London? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know it from any other piece? - By the pattern.</p>
               <p>Does not that pattern fit with any other piece? - No, I do not think you could match it exactly in colour.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to think so? - Because we have a hard matter to match them ourselves; I have the duplicate of the piece of goods which she delivered to me; (the duplicate shewn to the Court;) I am sure and positive she said it was my property, and gave me the ticket of it.</p>

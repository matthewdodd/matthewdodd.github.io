               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, found all these things, or only part of them? - A. Only part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner left your service, you had not missed your soap? - A. Yes, I had missed a great number of things; I missed soap daily.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not, before he left you, miss any yellow soap? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before he left you, ever accuse him of it to his face? - A. I did, when I turned him away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I went with Jones to search the prisoner's house in New-inn-yard, on Friday the 28th of November; I went up two pair of stairs, the prisoner was there, he seemed rather frightened, and Mr. Jones told him we came there to search his lodgings; he said, we should not search the lodgings, without a search-warrant; and I stopped there; while he was gone, the prisoner was very busy in the back-room; I was in the front-room, and he was in the back-room, shut in; I heard him throwing the things about; I called to him, and begged he would not spoil any thing; I looked through the key-hole, and saw him very busy, his body was partly out at the window, and he threw something out; when Mr. Jones came back, I went into the room, and found in his pocket some shaving cakes, and two or three wash-balls, and these keys; the next day, I went to a house, in Risdon's-buildings, one of these keys opened the street-door, and another the two pair of stairs room door, where we found a great quantity of property, which is here; I went into the kitchen of the house, in New-innyard, and in a little place, parted off from the kitchen, I found a blanket, containing a quantity of starch, hair-powder, and other things; we took the prisoner and the goods to the office.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. My brother is the proprietor of Risdon's-buildings, I collect his rents; the prisoner at the bar took a house there, in the month of October, it was a new house, not quite finished; when he took it, it had never been inhabited; he spoke to me several times about a window being put in backwards, he had the key about the 12th or 13th of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones.) Q. Look at those shaving cakes? - A. These are my property, they have my stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any of those articles to the prisoner? - A. No; these wash-balls are finished, but they are of my manufacture; some of these puffs have my private mark, in my wife's handwriting; and these bottles of essence are tied together, by my niece, with one piece of leather, and comes from my shop; this starch has no mark, but it corresponds with the sample that I have got;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140008"></xptr>here are seventy-five pounds weight of wash-balls, almost all unfinished, they are of my manufacture; almost every manufacturer weighs the soap of a different weight, and they are cut differently; I have cut one of them, and from the inside I am able to swear that they are of my manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell to the prisoner any unfinished wash-balls? - A. I never in my life sold any unfinished wash-balls; there is one ball among them, that we never sold a dozen of; these tin pomatum moulds I know particularly by the sizes, they are made on purpose for me; the size of every manufacturer differs a little, so that we may know them; this engine for polishing wash-balls, I can swear to, it is tipped round with brass, by particular direction, it was made on purpose for me, they are generally tipped with iron; here is a mark upon one of the boxes, in the hand-writing of one of my servants, it is the tare of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. These cakes, you say, are of your manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner works in your manufactory, and therefore knew how to manufacture like you? - A. He never manufactured any of these articles to my knowledge; he was a foreman in making hard soap.</p>

               <p>Q. As to this box, might it not have been sent out with goods? - A. No, I have made enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in your manufactory, he must have had the opportunity of seeing how these things were manufactured? - A. By chance, but it was in a different room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. These shaving cakes had your stamp? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nothing to do with the persumery part of your business? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he making little or much? - A. It was in a pan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was he making or finishing wash-balls? - A. He was making them, rolling bits of soap in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before your house was searched? - A. It might be two or three weeks, for he gave me a little bit of pomatum.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the pan? - A. It might hold two or three quarts; I did not take any particular notice, I was not long in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other materials besides this pan? - A. I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he got the materials from? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. This was when the officer was in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see him bring in any quantity of these things? - A. No; I keep a school, and my door is always open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones.) Q. Did you find, in the prisoner's lodgings, any instrument for finishing or polishing wash-balls, except that instrument of your own? - A. None.</p>

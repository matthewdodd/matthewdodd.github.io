                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, and live in Carlisle-street. I was at the William the Fourth public-house that day—I saw the two prisoners come in about three o'clock—they were three parts intoxicated—they had not sat long before Savage said, "We will have some more"—I did not know what he meant—I sat about three-quarters of an hour, and Savage again said, "We will have some more at all events; who has got a knife?"—I said I had one—he said, "Let me have it'—I said I would not—he said he would beat my brains out with a gridiron; and then an Irishman who was there went out and brought in a coal-chisel—they wrenched up the boards, and jumped upon them; then Savage went down and handed up two or three bottles—I went out into the grounds, and told what I had seen—I heard Savage say to a man that they had taken fifteen or eighteen at the first going off.</p>

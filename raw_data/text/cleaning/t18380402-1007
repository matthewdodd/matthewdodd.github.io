                  </hi>. I live in Austin Friars, and am the wife of William Dimes. About one o'clock on Saturday, the 31st of March, I was going down St. Botolph's-lane, when I got to the corner of Thames-street two or three people came before me, and an equal number I think behind—I tried to move backwards—I then made a push forwards, and a man behind me gave me a violent push, and I lost a purse from my pocket, which con<lb></lb>tained a sovereign and about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, to the best of my knowledge—there were two half-crowns—I cannot tell who any of the people were, but I think the prisoner was a man who was behind me.</p>

About one o'clock on Saturday, the 31st of March, I was in East-cheap—I observed the prisoner and several others—I had known them before—I saw the prosecutrix going down Botolph's-lane—I asked a witness here to follow her—I watched the prisoner and his companions—at the bottom of the lane they all surrounded her—the prisoner was one—they surrounded her purposely, at accident ally.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with Mr. Harford.

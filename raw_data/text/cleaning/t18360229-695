                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Sussex public-house at Hammersmith; I am master of that house. I know the prisoner very well by sight—he came to my house on the 21st of November, between five and six o'clock—he had a lodging there—he went to bed about nine o'clock—no one was in the room with him—I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock, and was the last person up in the house—I am sure I shut it up—I saw Mrs. Martin take the till up—all the doors were locked—our bed-room door was fastened, but not locked—I remember my wife's sister coming up to that room between six and seven o'clock the next morning—it was dark—she came and alarmed me—I had two £5 bank<lb></lb>notes, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and some silver, in my till the night before—I missed it in the morning—in consequence of something that happened last week, I came to Newgate, where I saw a number of pri<lb></lb>soneres together—amongst them I discovered the prisoner—I am sure he is the man who came to sleep at my house that night, I am positive of it.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 28th of August, in consequence of receiving information, I took steps to apprehend the prisoners, and placed three policemen in Mr. Drake's house, 14, Camden Villas—on the Sunday afternoon, I saw the prisoners together, about three hundred yards from Mr. Drake's house—I think I had seen Johnson before, but I am not positive—I saw them again about half-past nine o'clock that evening in a beer-shop, about the same distance from Mr. Drake's house—I saw them go towards Mr. Drake's house—about half-past nine I found them in custody at the prosecutor's house, and they were taken to the station.</p>

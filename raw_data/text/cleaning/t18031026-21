               <p>JOHN ALLEN sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Charles Flower; the prisoner was <rs id="t18031026-21-deflabel118" type="occupation">carman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. A certain quantity of butter had been delivered before that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner came for the remainder without knowing the number? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not these firkins nearly together? - No; one parcel was in the warehouse lowered down by a crane, and the other on the wharf.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS CORNELLON sworn. - I am cooper to Mr. Flower: On the 24th of September I saw the prisoner on the wharf; a cask of butter was missed, and I went after the prisoner as far as Tower-hill; I got up into his cart, and saw twenty firkins of Cork butter; I saw a hay-basket in the cart bottom upwards; I turned up the basket, and found a cask of Waterford butter; I charged him with having a cask of butter that he had no right to, and he denied it; I told him, of he did not give it up, I would have him taken up; then he said, it was a cask that was due to his master; I said, you should not take it without asking those that had the charge of it; I got a man to take it to the warehouse; he gave him a shilling to take it back, and then he begged I would not say any thing about it, and he would treat me with a glass of liquor, which I refused; the cask is here, it is the property of Mr. Flower; we always had a good opinion of the prisoner, or we would not have trusted him on the wharf.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not make any defence, but called his master, who gave him a good character.</p>

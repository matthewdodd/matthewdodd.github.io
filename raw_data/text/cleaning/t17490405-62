             to dispose of. She said, she could not do any thing with them till they were dry; then we carried them to Sir John Oldcastle's , and hid them. We went the next day, and carried them to Hornsey wood to dry, and then brought them home to her about eight o'clock at night . When we went in, there were two men in her house; we went up stairs, and she took what she thought proper; which was one sheet, and three tablecloths , and went out with them; she brought us 4 shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with them ?</p>
               <p>Borbam . She said, she had pawned them; there was one sheet she was to give us 2 s. 6 d. for; she asked us, where we got them, and we told her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she live?</p>
               <p>Borbam . In George-alley by Shoe-lane. I have been at her house several times, when I wanted lodging, being destitute, she directed me first to Black-boy-alley. We gave her two old sheets and a tablecloth. She was to give us half a pint of gin for a piece of flowered linnen. She keeps what we may call a Bawdy-house. In looking over the things, she found a mark on one corner; she took a pair of sizors, and cut it off, and flung it in the fire; saying, Why did you bring it thus? Do you know the danger you expose me to? We told her we did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what letters they were?</p>
               <p>Borbam . I do not know. She bid us go out, and get more; telling us, she designed to take a house to keep people to go out a thieving; and she thought she might get 2 d. a night of lodgers, as well as others.</p>

On Tuesday, the 13th, Mr. Stockdale, a pawnbroker, sent for me; I went to his house, and there I saw two crape gowns, my property: then he and I went to Justice Fielding's, and got a warrant to take up the two prisoners: they confessed the fact before Mr. Fielding. I mentioned all I could recollect at that time I had lost; they in general owned to the fact; they said they had pawned the rest, some in one place, and some in another, in several parts of the town. I have recovered some of the other things, according to their directions, and the pawnbrokers all gave me my goods again, that is, all I could find (five gowns and several other things produced in court): there are what I have recovered, my property.</p>

About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of September, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I watched the prisoner, and saw him go out—I fol<lb></lb>lowed, and came up with him, and asked him how he came to be there, and how he had left his work—he had been working on board the <hi rend="italic">Earl Bel<lb></lb>cara</hi> the day before, which had taken 3800 sheets of copper on board—I said I suspected he had something about him—he made me a saucy reply, and ran away—I ran and took him as he was going through a public-house, and found two sheets of copper inside the flap of his breeches, and a leather belt round him to keep it up—I produce it.</p>

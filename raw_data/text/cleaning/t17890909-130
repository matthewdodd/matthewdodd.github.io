I said, I will follow you, go where you will, to see what you have in the bundle; and he turned back towards Turnham-green again; and I turned with him; and when he came into the middle of the field, he threw down the two bundles, and said, you may have the bundles, if you will let me go about my business; and I took him by the collar; and he threw himself back, to get away from me; and drew himself clean out of his coat, and ran away; and I after him; I catched him at some distance, and brought him back, and put his coat on again; and he went down on his knees, and begged and prayed to me; and said he had a wife and five children; and he said, should I either hang or trouble him, what was to become of his family; then I secured him, and took him to Acton; and took the bundle; the constable has had it every since.</p>

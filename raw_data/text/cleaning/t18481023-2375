                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Cox, of 7, George-passage, Snow-hill—he has rented the house for four years—we let part of it—the prisoners lodged in the second-floor front room-in the course of Sept. they owed us eight weeks rent—we asked them for it, and could not get it—we then gave them notice that they must either leave or pay—my husband went to a broker, and while he was gone Mrs. Shea came down, to me, and said, "Tell your husband to bring up the bill?"—I said he was not in; when be came in I would tell him—she came down twice after that—my husband and the broker came in afterwards—they went up, and could not get into the room; the door was locked-Mr. Shea said he was to bring the bill by-and-by, and he would pay it when his wife came in—she was out then—she afterwards came in, and went up stairs—she went out twice again, and after she went up again I went and knocked at the door—Mr. Shea opened it—I said, "Mr. Shea, this is the broker's-warrant; will you settle this, and leave in peace?"—he said, "I will pay you"—I had gone into the room—Mrs. Shea came in at the time, and struck me with something, I did not see what, over the head, and knocked me down—she said nothing to me—Mr. Shea jumped on my stomach, as I was on the floor, and threw himself with his knees over my chest and stomach, and held me down, and she kicked me violently in the lower part of my body; I am very lame now—I screamed out "Murder!" and my husband came up to my assistance—I afterwards saw Mrs. Shea with a hammer—when my husband came in they got off me, and went to him, and Mrs. Shea knocked him down with a blow of the hammer on the fore<lb></lb>head—I got up, and said, "For God's sake, Shea, do not kill my husband!"—he said, "Yes, I will, and I will do for the pair of you"—I threw myself over my husband, trying to keep him from the blows, and then I turned round—I saw a shoemaker's knife and hammer in each of their hands—she had a large hammer with a large bottom to it, and he had a small one—we were beaten with them, and <hi rend="italic">cut in two</hi>—I was cut in the back of my head—I bled violently, and then they got off, as we were covered with blood—they got up to shut the door, arid I got up as well as I could, covered with blood, with no cap or anything on—I got to the window, screamed out "Murder! for God's sake, come to my assistance, for my husband is lying dead on the floor!"—Mrs. Shea ran after me to the window, and when she saw the crowds of people she said, "I will disperse that mob; you shall not have any witness," putting her hand to some flower-pots that were there, and throwing them out—she took me by the legs, and tried to throw me out—I held by the window by my two hands, and she could not get me out—she took my shoes and stockings from me in trying to get me from the window—she gave me several blows with the large hammer again on the back of the head, as she could not get me from the window—she then went back to Shea, who was nailing the door on both sides, to prevent its being opened, as he heard</p>

               <p>the people coming up, and she said, "Death or glory! we shall be hung for them, we may as well kill them"—he said, "Yes, and we will kill every—one that comes in"—she said, "Yes, we will kill the first that comes in"—the door was afterwards broken open—while that was doing I took mv husband between my arms, and he was there till we were released—they stood one on each side of the door with a knife and hammer in each of their hands—we were both taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital to be dressed—I was not then an in-patient, but after the Tuesday night I went, and remained there very nearly a fortnight; but I was forced to come home, as there was no one to mind my house-my husband was an out-patient.</p>

I am dead!"—I did not take up parts of the chairs, and strike the prisoners; nor did my husband—I had not been drinking at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the-last witness, and am a tailor. Some time before Sept. the prisoners were lodgers of mine for four or five months—they owed me some rent, and five weeks before this happened I told them to go away—they would not leave, and I could not get my rent—I employed a broker to distrain, after I had given them written notice—the broker's warrant was left with my wife, on Monday the 18th—I went out that day, leaving my wife at-home—when I came back I heard a noise—went up, and found her and the prisoners in their room—I turned about to speak to Shea, and the woman struck me with a hammer and knocked me down senseless—I did not see anything done to my wife—I had not time—I was knocked down the moment I went up—it appeared to me that they had been ill-using her—I had no time to see whether she was bleeding or not—I remained senseless till I was taken out of the room—I do not know what became of my wife—the woman struck me with a large shoemaker's hammer—I did not see any other hammer in the room at that time.</p>

Between four and five o'clock on Monday afternoon, 18th Sept., I went to George-passage, Snow hill, and saw the two witnesses standing at the window looking into the street—their faces were altogether covered with blood—I went up-stairs, and could not get into the room—I came down, got assistance, and the door was broken open—I found Shea standing rather behind his wife, with this hammer in his hand (<hi rend="italic">produc<lb></lb>ing it</hi>)—it is rather small, apparently a shoemaker's hammer—I seized him, took the hammer from him, threw it down, and got him down stairs, and took him to the station—when I got into the room Cox and his wife were standing at the window, looking out—they were injured.</p>

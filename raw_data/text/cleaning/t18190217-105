            . I live in Fleet-street. On the 16th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I had been drinking with a friend, and was walking towards <placeName id="t18190217-105-crimeloc618">Temple-bar</placeName>

While I was in conversation with him I felt a tug at my watch, put my hand to my fob, and missed my seal, and key; almost at the same instant a boy rushed by me; I turned round, and saw the prisoner with him, within a yard or two of me. I I collared him, and took him to the door of Mr. North's shop, one of the shopmen opened the door; I took him in, and charged him with stealing the seal, which he positively denied. He said he was the son of a gentlewoman, living in Coleman-street. I desired him to deliver up the seal; he said he was not the person, who took it. A lady came into the shop, and said, in his presence, that she saw him cut it off. He said she must be mistaken, for he had not got it - it was afterwards found by Mr. North's door, in the area, where I first detained him - a knife was also found in the door-way, where he was detained - my seal and key were cut from the ribbon.</p>

            . I live in Duke-street, Lincolns Inn-fields - my husband is a compositor. I saw the prisoner come from behind me, and push between me, and Mr. Elsam - nobody else was between us. He made a stop for a moment, and then made a motion like a snatch with his arm, and walked on very fast. I immediately took hold of his arm, and assisted in taking him into the shop, which was not above two or three yards off - nobody was near enough to take it but him, nor could any one have dropped it but him.</p>

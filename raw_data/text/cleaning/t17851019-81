You have been convicted of a crime which is one of the most dangerous to society of any that can be committed: perjury, in all cases, is a very heinous, and a very dangerous offence, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190135"></xptr> takes away the only security that the law can provide for the due administration of justice, which is the civil power in criminal prosecutions; and it appears to me that a perjury in criminal cases, is more criminal than in a civil trial, where property alone is concerned: this offence of perjury, in behalf of a prisoner, is somewhat less than that against a prisoner; for where that produces conviction in a capital case, it appears to me to fall little, if anything, short of the guilt of murder: but still this is a very high and dangerous offence, for the consequence of it is to endeavour to interrupt the course of Justice, and to screen the guilty from punishment; and it has this further tendency, to render all testimoney on the part of the prisoners suspected: you have in the course of your defence, made one observation which appears to be a just one, and which points out to the Court very distinctly the line of their duty in the present case, and that is, that by this transaction your character has been taken away, so that you will not have an opportunity of obtaining your living in this country, and must be obliged to go abroad; that marks out the line of conduct for the Court to pursue; and, therefore, the sentence of the Court is, that you be <rs id="t17851019-81-punish391" type="punishmentDescription">

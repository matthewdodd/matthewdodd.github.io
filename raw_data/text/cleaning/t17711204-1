             said she thought she heard a noise over-head. I got up and opened the kitchen door. As soon as I had done that, I heard feet over-head. I was much frightened, and screamed out immediately. Upon that I heard them run along the entry; there were several feet. I heard them pull back the bolt of the street door, and let themselves out. Then I went up stairs, and into the street, and call'd out, Stop thief! I did not see them, for they were gone out at the door before I got up stairs. I found the parlour door open, and the closet door, in which the plate was kept, was open. There was taken out of that closet a silver pepper castor, a silver cream-pot, and four silver table spoons. A drawer in the bureau was open, out of which the scissars and the buckles were taken: they took them out of the cases, and left the cases. I had seen them before that day. This pepper castor (producing it) is mine.</p>

            . I was coming home with Mr. Life. Just as we came against King-square-court, I saw three people running very fast. We heard the cry, Stop thief! and immediately we pursued them. We just lost sight of them when we came to the corner of Queen-street. We asked a green-woman if she had seen three men run by. She said they were just gone down Queen-street. We went down Queen-street, and then we saw the same three man again; they were standing together in a cluster.</p>

            . Yes, they stood under a lamp. Mr. Life seiz'd two of them; they struggled, and one got away from him; and just at that time I heard something drop from Coleman. Life had hold of him. I ask'd, what has he dropt? Mr. Life stoop'd and pick'd up this cream-jug (producing it). It was Coleman dropt it. Mr. Life felt down him, and ask'd him if he had got any more of these things about him. Then I left him, and pursued Ogilby, the other prisoner, and Mr. Pearce stopt him. Ogilby, when he came to the watch-house, said he was very faint; he desired to sit down at the watch-house door, as the watch-house was shut; and this pepper-box was found next day, as I am informed, in the place where he sat. (The cream-jug deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

            . As I was coming up Dean-street about half an hour after six o'clock, I heard St. Ann's bell ring before I came to it; when I got to the Highlander, which is three doors from Mrs. Jones's, I saw the two prisoners and another run by; I knew them as soon as I saw them; I had seen them at the justices before. I had often seen the three together. I am sure the prisoners. were two of them. As soon as I saw them I said to Crompton, they three have been doing no good; the words were not out of my mouth before I heard a woman crying, stop thief! I said to Crompton, you can't run so fast as me, but follow me that they may may do me no injury. When I came to the corner of Queen-street I lost fight of them. I asked a green woman if she had seen three men run by; she said they were just gone down the street; as soon as I had turned the corner I saw them before me. When I came just by Mr. Hammond's, the Glazier, in Greek-street, they were all three standing together. I said nothing but immediately caught hold of two of them; I had not fast hold of one; he got from me and run down the street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040004"></xptr> I kept the other fast, which is Coleman; they all three stood so close together that I can't say whether he that got from me was Ogilby, or the man that got clear off. I am sure Ogilby. was one of the three. Mr. Crompton called out, stop thief! and one Mr. Pearce stopt Ogilby. He was about seven or eight yards behind the other. I asked Coleman what he had stolen; I saw something in his hand; I took hold of his wrist and immediately he dropt something, I stoopt directly and picked up this cream pot. (Produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) They declared at the watch-house that they were strangers to each other. I told them that I knew them well; Ogilby sat down on the stop at the watch-house door, and said he was saint; the pepper-box was picked up near the place where he sat.</p>

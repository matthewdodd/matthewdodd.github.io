            . I am shopman to Mr. Martin, of Tooley-street, a pawnbroker. I have a handkerchief pawned on the 22d of June, in the name of Ann Murphy, and gave the person the duplicate produced.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HYAMS. I believe this handkerchief to be mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutrix had been twice divorced, was a common prostitute, and that she had given her the handkerchief in part of her wages.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HYAMS. I was divorced about eight months ago; I never gave or sold her the handkerchief; I had worn it on Sunday.</p>

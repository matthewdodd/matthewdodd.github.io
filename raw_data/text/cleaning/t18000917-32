               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you lose sight of the object you were in pursuit of? - A. I did for a few minutes; when I first saw him, he turned towards the back gate, but that being fastened, he turned back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you positively say whether the window had been open that day or not? - A. No; I was extremely ill, and occasionally obliged to lie down, and in that situation I should not have suffered the window to be open.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hester.) Was the man without a hat when you first saw him? - A. Yes.</p>

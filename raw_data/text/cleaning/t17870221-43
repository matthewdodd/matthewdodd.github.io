I said, you are welcome to see, and I gave him a light; I went with him, and as I went into the house, the first thing I saw was them two boys with their hands tied together in the passage, so I said, Lord, bless me, what is the matter here! they took the light and seemed quite busy looking about the place; I took no notice; I came back again with a light: I saw nothing more of these two children; they took them away afterwards on an information of a little girl; I took a light and went into my yard, and sought and found nobody: I went up to a room, and looked out at a window, a back window, and in the next yard, I saw a bundle laying in the yard; it was the 18th of January, to the best of my knowledge; I suppose it was about five or six minutes, to the best of my knowledge; the girl fetched it up; I took the bundle, and there were two shirts, a waistcoat, and a handkerchief; I asked what office them officers came from; I went to Justice Walker's, and took the things there; I know nothing of the prisoners; I have seen the two children before; I never saw them but twice; I saw them the night before; I let that room to two girls that sold matches and hat pins about the streets; I do not know who they were; they lodged about a week.</p>

             went with me to inform against the boys:</p>
               <p>Where did you come from? - I live in Carrier-street, St. Giles's; my mother lives in the same street.</p>
               <p>What is she? - Spins flax; she is an Irish woman.</p>
               <p>What has she bred you up to? - I have had nobody to take care of me; she sent me out with a few matches and pins; I was born in Dyot-street.</p>
               <p>What age are you? - Going of fourteen.</p>
               <p>You should apply to the parish officers to be maintained?</p>
               <p>Freeman. This girl was almost naked; where these boys were taken from, is one of the most infamous places that we have in the county of Middlesex not only on this business but on many other occasions; I have been under the necessity of going there, and have taken out boys, apprentices, where there were four or five girls; she is now naked; I furnished her with this pocket handkerchief for decency's sake; when these two boys were taken, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210094"></xptr>morning following when the Magistrate examined them, the youngest boy I believe, I went ten miles to find out his mother; I found her out; Mr. Walker himself observing the boy's age, though he examined the child himself; he delivered the youngest boy up to his mother: when I found out where this person lived that had been robbed; I got the biggest boy, he was put among a number of people, and the child took out the biggest boy; in two days afterwards, I went to the same house, and in the same room I found the same boy with two girls; I thought it my duty, as well for my country, as for my feelings as a father, to bring him to justice; the two girls were taken with the two boys; they were all committed; but Welch, the biggest boy, says she is innocent, and owned it himself; one of the other girls has related just such a sort of a story to the Justice, but as this girl came voluntarily, we thought it better to bring her; it is but lately that a man lost his life there, and five women were taken up, and Mrs. Hickey also; the Coroner's Jury brought in their verdict accidental death; in this very house: the parish has commenced a prosecution against these houses.</p>
               <p>Court. I am very glad to hear it, Mrs. Hickey ought to be included in the prosecution for keeping this abominable house.</p>
               <p>Freeman. The prosecutrix is a poor woman; this is a gentleman's linen; he charged her sixteen shillings for it, and he would not give half a crown of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Desire the churchwarden to call at my house after the session.</p>
               <p>One of the churchwardens. My Lord, I have been in Court from the beginning.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I am sure it is unnecessary for me to say much to you on the subject? - The parish have commenced a prosecution against Mrs. Hickey for keeping a disorderly house.</p>
               <p>Court. You have done very right? - I believe the bill is not yet found; Mr. Robinson in Russell-street is the attorney.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall order her to be committed for perjury in the face of the Court, till a Bench warrant is obtained on that indictment.</p>
               <p>Freeman. She has seen them many times before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>(Committed to Newgate.)</p>
               <p>Court to the child. How old are you my little girl? - Going of eight.</p>
               <p>Where were you sent to that evening that you lost the things? - Into Ryder's-court.</p>
               <p>Court to Freeman. Did you hear the boys say any thing at any time what was become of the things? - Yes, at one hearing before the Magistrate Welch said, he would take it all on himself, so that

               <p>Did either of the boys say what had been done with the bundle the night they were taken up? - Not that I remember; the things were twice produced in the presence of both the boys; I was not present at one of the examinations, Beamish was.</p>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court. There has been laid before the Court such a scene of wickedness and profligacy of the worst kind, going on the heart of this town, that cannot but fill every body with horror; it is not to be wondered at the number that parish at the gallows, harboured by such wretches as Mrs. Hickey; children trained up to the commission of every kind of profligacy and wickedness; all that is in our power is to take care that the guilty person shall be punished; with respect to the older boy, I am entirely satisfied with both parts of your verdict, that enables me to do what I have not the least doubt is an act of mercy to this boy, I mean that of sending him out of this country, and thereby save him from being hanged; let him be transported for seven years; with respect to the other boy, let him be detained, and carried before a Magistrate of the city of London, to be passed to the parish in which his mother has sworn he was born, in the county of Stafford.</p>
               <p>Court to Conway's mother. You, madam, have probably been reduced by misfortunes, which may have led you to expose that boy to the melancholly situation in which he stands; I shall therefore not reproach you any more on that subject; it is your duty to make all the reparation to God and your country; it is your duty to attend before the Magistrate, to make oath of the place of this child's birth; and it would be the most wise conduct if you was to attend him thither; have you gained any settlement since? - Yes, I kept a house nine years in the Borough; and I kept one since in Westminster; his parish is Westminster.</p>
               <p>Court. As this boy is past nine years old, he may be sent to the place of his birth in the country.</p>

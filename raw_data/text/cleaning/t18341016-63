On the 7th of October, I went out about half past eleven o'clock - I left my watch on a nail in the parlour - I was sent for about twelve o'clock, and it was gone - I saw it at the station-house, in the policeman Wells's possession - this is the 
watch (looking at it) - I am certain it is mine.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. Stevens. On the 7th of October, between twelve and a quarter past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner run from the step of the prosecutor's door - he turned up Bedford-street, which is no thoroughfare - he came back, and ran straight down Seymour-street - I ran to the street door, and saw Mrs. Stevens, and from what passed, I ran after the prisoner, crying, "Stop thief," and when I got up, he was in the custody of Wells - I saw a policeman pick up the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your shop is opposite Mr. Stevens's, I believe? A. Yes - master is a bookbinder - I was at work in the shop - I was looking through the window at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160044"></xptr>that time I saw him - I saw nobody near the door but the prisoner - I did not go over to Mrs. Stevens - I saw her, and she said something - the prisoner was then about 150 yards up the street - other people were going in the same direction, a-head of me - I saw the policeman pick up the watch near a new hat-shop window, half-way between the church and Mr. Stevens's house, which was in the direction the prisoner ran - other people walked in the same direction, but the prisoner ran as fast as he could - the other people did not run - I do not think any body ran till I said, "Stop thief" - he ran from the step of the door - I never saw the watch in his possession.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 7th of October, I was in Seymonr-street - I heard a cry of "Stop thief," turned round, and saw the prisoner running - I saw more running at a distance behind him - he being foremost I ran after him - he got up to a man with a placard board in his hand - I caught hold of him, and said, "What have you been doing?" - he said, "Nothing" - I took him about six yards back, and asked the people what he had done - they said he had stolen a watch, and supposing he had given it to the placard man, having seen him shove something toward him - I asked him what he had given him - he said, "Nothing" - Cooper said, "The watch lies in the trench," and I picked it up there; and at the station-house, I asked what business he had in Stevens's shop - he said he went to ask for a job.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a City constable: On Friday the 31st of July, I went to the One Tun, Holborn-bridge, to the best of my recollection, about four o'clock, or a little before four; I found Price, and Brown and his wife, in the tap-room, in a box adjoining the bar; there were two other men in the box, and at the farther end of the box, next to Price, I found this bag, (producing it); Price fat on the left-hand side of the box, all the rest were on the other side of the box; I took them all three into custody, and the bundle likewise; I asked Price if he knew any thing of the bundle; he said, he knew nothing at all about it; I asked Brown the same; he said, he knew nothing about it; I asked Mrs. Brown, and she said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any great coat upon Price? - A. Yes; that was taken off his back at the Compter. (Produces a great coat, and a bag, containing a bridle, saddle, and a martingal).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When you went in, what became of the other two men that were in the box?- A. They staid in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found only one bundle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Price any questions about the coat?- A. He had not a word to say about the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that he said he bought it of a Jew? - A. No; before the Alderman, he said he bought it in Monmouth-street.(The great coat, and the other articles, identified by Mills).</p>
               <p>Price's defence. I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; the great coat I bought of a Jew in the street.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I knew a young man that lived at this public-house, and my wife and I went in and had a pot of beer; there were six or seven people in the box; there was a Jew in the box that lately came from transportation, as I am informed, and he had his arm on this property when the officers came in; I did not know them to be officers; some of the people in the box jumped over the table, and went away; I was very willing to go with them.</p>
               <p>Parrot. When they were taken, there was a great skirmish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. In that skirmish, who was it that 
               <persName id="t18010916-130-person873">drew</persName>
             a knife? - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Graham) Q. When you took these prisoners, did they resist? - A. Yes; Price 
               <persName id="t18010916-130-person874">drew</persName>
             a knife, and I prevented him from opening it; I had a great deal of difficulty in securing Price; Brown and his wife went peaceably along.</p>
               <p>Brown called one witness, who gave him a good character. Price, GUILTY, aged 27.</p>

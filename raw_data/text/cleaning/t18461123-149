                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Jennings'-buildings, Ken<lb></lb>sington. On the 27th of June, I was standing near Mr. Gale's, the tobacconist's shop, in High-street, Kensington—the prisoner's wife came up and said something to me—the prisoner very soon after came up to me and went towards the Coach and Horses public-house, where there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he could not get in—he then came across the street and asked me how I was—I said, "Very well, how do you get on?"—he said he did not know hardly—my mistress came up, put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand, and said "Take him down to the Prussia public-house and give him a pot of beer"—I had had no quarrel with him before that—he said in the public-house that he had come with the inten<lb></lb>tion of taking Stephen Hayes' life away"—I said, Do not do it; never be guilty of such an action as that; he is a poor man with a large family; take and give him a good hiding, but do not take his life away"—(there had been a quarrel between Hayes' wife and the prisoner's sister—the sister had told the prisoner about it)—I took him away from the public-house after having a pint of beer to drink, and his wife and me and my wife went together—I took him across the street as far as the King and Queen—two men came and treated him to a pot of beer—I went back to my own room in a very few minutes—the prisoner came there—I then lived at No. 6—he came down the courtjumping about, and asking if there was any rascal who belonged to Stephen Hayes—Hayes came into the court and met the prisoner, and the prisoner struck him—I went and parted them, and Hayes then ran away to his own room—the prisoner then said, "Hayes did not have it; what Hayes did not have you shall have"—he then made towards me, and then struck me—I defended my<lb></lb>self as well as I could, and struck him—I tried to throw him down—he got away from me, and went across the street to the wall, went two or three yards from there—he only went across the channel about a dozen yards, and came back again and. stabbed me in the side—I did not see any knife when he and I were struggling together—he did not strike me with the knife before he went across the channel—he then returned and stabbed me—he did not go into any house—I was taken up the stairs to my own room—I said I was struck with something—I found part of my entrails protruding—I was taken to Dr. Merriman, then to St. George's Hospital—I was there ten months—I am an Irishman—the parish of Kensington have supported me and my family ever since—I have been laid up ever since, and unable to attend to my work—last Saturday six weeks I was obliged to come home from my work with one of my guts coming out—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was taken into custody.</p>

On the 28th of March, Ferninger and Wilson were in the Crown public house at Peckham all the afternoon—they came into the tap-room between six and seven o'clock, and played at "shore-half-penny" for a pint of porter—Hastings came in and they all three sat down together—Wilson said to him, "Come, Tom, our time is up, we must be off"—they all went together—and as near as eight o'clock as I can judge, Hastings came in with a bundle under his arm, they had gone between six and seven o'clock—Hastings came in alone with that bundle and we sat down—he kept opening the window-curtain and looking out—he called me as I was going out, and he said, "See whether there is a policeman out there"—I said, "Yes, there is"—he sat down, and kept opening the win<lb></lb>dow curtain till the policeman went away—he then went outside, and Wilson came and in called for half-a-pint of porter, and filled his pipe with tobacco—he brought nothing—Ferminger came in and said to him, "You bro<lb></lb>ther wants you"—he said, "I am coming out directly"—Wilson went out with Ferminger, and I opened the curtain, and saw them all three together—I saw no more of them—they went down the ground together.</p>

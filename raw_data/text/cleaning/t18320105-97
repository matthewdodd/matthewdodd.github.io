            . I am an officer of Portsoken ward. On the morning of the 24th of December I was in Cutler-street, about half-past seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner running as quick as he could, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I approached, and laid hold of him; I asked what was the matter - he said nothing; I held him a few minutes; a person came up and said, "That man has dropped a box in Hounsditch, at the corner of St. Mary-axe" - I took him back, and there was the box.</p>

I was in Camomile-street, and saw the prisoner carrying a box; I had some suspicion from what Williams told me, and watched him; he turned into St. Mary-axe - I followed him; he dropped this box, and made over to Cutler-street, where he was taken by the officer, to the best of my knowledge; the prisoner carried the box on his shoulder.</p>

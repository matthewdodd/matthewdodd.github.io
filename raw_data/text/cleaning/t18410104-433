               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was unfortunate to lose money on one or two occasions, and could not pay this money in consequence of customers being in my debt—I was not always paid when I took the beer, sometimes the lodgers would pay and sometimes Mrs. Baldwin; it has been so before, and other bills have been paid, such as 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on one occa<lb></lb>sion: I have got money owing to me now; in fact, I have lost a great deal.</p>

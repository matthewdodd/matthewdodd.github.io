               <p>Q. Did you lose a half pint pewter pot. - A. I did, on the 8th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the house at the time you lost it. - A. Yes, I served him at the bar with half a pint of beer; he took the beer into the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for his beer. - A. Yes, and in about a minute or two he left the taproom, my mother-in law was in the tap room at the time; she came and asked me what was gone with the half pint pot. In consequence of that I went into the tap room to see if it was there; not finding it there, me and an acquaintace of mine went in pursuit of the prisoner, and took him three yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the half pint pot with him. - A. It was in his jacket pocket. I know it to be mine; it was marked with the name of the person that lived in the house before me; I delivered the pot and the prisoner into the charge of the constable.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning specified in the indictment, it might be nine o'clock that I went into the house, I called for half a pint of beer, whether I had drank the half pint of beer I cannot say; I tossed up with two or three people in the tap room; we then played with a thing at the ceiling, like the hand of a clock, like that ventilator (pointing to the ventilator); I turned out of the house to make water, I got a little distance from the door, I was returning to go into the house, a man came up to me and said what have you done with the half pint pot; I put my hand to my pocket, there the pot was half sticking out; if I had meant to conceal it, I should not have carried it away in that manner; my pocket is so shallow I am sure it must have been put in by somebody out of spite and malice.</p>
               <p>Jury. (to prosecutor) Were there any other persons apparently drinking in his company at the time. - A. There was no other person, and he paid for the beer on delivery.</p>
               <p>

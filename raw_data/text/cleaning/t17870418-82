               <p>What became of him, did he go away? - Yes, and I sent for a constable; I picked up the things, they are here.</p>

               <p>I never saw the things, the prosecutor did not know his own property before the Justice; we were before the Justice three times.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How is that? - The first time I told the Justice I would not wish to hurt any man in the world; says he I can do nothing in it, unless you can swear to your property; we came back to the public-house, and had a pot of beer. the man was in a passion, he swore to his dam - n, if we did not prosecute him, he would prosecute us; then I went and swore to my property.</p>

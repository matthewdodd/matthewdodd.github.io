               <p>JOHN BAILEY. On the 8th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I started from London, and arrived at <placeName id="t18280221-32-crimeloc166">Isleworth-corner</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think you said these people overtook you? A. They followed me - I arrived at the post before them, and was resting on it, with my face turned towards them - my face was turned to the way I had come from, and I saw them coming up; the prisoner was within ten yards of me when Wyeth attacked me- Wyeth came forward, and left all the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had quite left you, the prisoner came up? A. Instantly: Wyeth followed the other two and the woman, and the prisoner came up instantly, as if he intended to assist me - he snatched my hat, and took the same direction as the rest; he did nothing else.</p>

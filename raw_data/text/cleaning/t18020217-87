               <p>JOSEPH SILLS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state the particulars of this transaction, and who were your partners? - A. On the 21st of November, our firm was Frances, Joseph, and Jonathan Sills; the prisoner was our clerk, and employed in receiving money on our account, which he settled every day. I have his book, and, on the 21st of November, 1801, there are four articles entered, but not the sum of one pound eleven shillings received of Mr. Willett.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that sum ever been accounted for? - A. Never. Mr. Gurney. Q. That article is entirely omitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WILLETT sworn. - I live in Aldersgate-street: On the 21st of November, application was made to me, on the part of Messrs. Sills, for the payment of one pound eleven shillings and seven-pence. I paid one pound eleven shillings, and the person to whom I paid it gave me a receipt, (produces it;) but I cannot say whether it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN-WINTER PIDGEON sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Sills, and know the prisoner's hand-writing. This is his writing, (looking at the receipt.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>

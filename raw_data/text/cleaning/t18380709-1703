                  </hi>. I live at Denbigh-hall, Buckinghamshire. I came up to town by the rail-road—on the 4th of July, about twelve or one o'clock at night I was going down Stephen-street, and I saw a young woman Standing at a door—I told her I would give her half-a-crown for half a bed—we agreed, and went into the room—I putted my purse out of my pocket, and gave her half-a-crown—my purse contained five sovereigns and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., among which was a crown and two hair-crowns—I un<lb></lb>dressed and went to bed—I asked her if she was coming—he said no, I had only agreed for the bed—I said she might stop away if she liked, and I dropped off to sleep—about half-past three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the room—that awoke mo—he asked me what bu<lb></lb>siness had there with his wife—I said I did not know she was his wife—she said she had no husband—the woman was then sitting on the bed, she had not come to bed—the prisoner went and gave her a kick, and said, "D—you, I will kill you both"—he then came and searched toy trowsers, but he could find nothing there, as I had put my purse between the bed and the mattress—I got up, and got all my things on except my shoes—I went to take my purse from under the bed, but the prisoner rushed, took it from rat, and ran out of the back door, and over the wall—I ran out to call the policeman, and saw the prisoner run out of another house two or three doors off—I ran and called "Stop thief"—he was chased so close, that he ran back to his own room again.</p>

I pursued the prisoner closely into the front parlour of No. 21, Stephen-street—just as I got in, he turned round from the part of the bed where the money was found—I asked him what he had been running away for—he said the man had struck him—I searched him and found two knives, and a bag which it not the prosecutor's—the prosecutor gave him in charge for stealing five sovereiges and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

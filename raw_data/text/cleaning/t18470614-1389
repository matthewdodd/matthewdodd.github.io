                  </hi>. I am a window, and live at 6, Dunstan-place, Ratcliffe. I knew the deceased, Ann Ford, for about eighteen months—she lived with the prisoner in the same house that I lived in—last Saturday month, I think it was, between ten and eleven o'clock at night as near as I can guess, she asked me to go to market with her—I did so—we were gone about half-an-hour—I think it was near upon twelve o'clock when we returned—we both had our laps full of things, butter, tea, sugar, cabbages, potatoes, and other things—I went up to her room with her—we got in by the door—it was shut—she pulled the panel of the door out—that had been broken a long time ago—she then put her hand in and unlocked it—she did not kick the panel of the door out—Mr. Harrison had kicked it out—we went in, and she put the things on the table—the prisoner was then sitting on his chair asleep, as I thought—he had not been awakened by anything, we did not make any noise—on her putting the things on the table, he got up—he never spoke a syllable, nor she either, but he flung the things out of the window—she did not say or do any<lb></lb>thing—she was going out of the room, he hopped across the room after her, knocked her down with his fist against the landing-place, and then kicked her—she</p>

               <p>had not said or done anything to him while he was throwing the things out of the window—I cannot say where he kicked her—she did not speak when she was kicked—as soon as he did it I ran down stairs for a policeman, and saw no more of it—she remained on the ground when I ran down—I was frightened, and did not go up again—I was gone not above five minutes, if so long—I did not go up again—I stopped down stairs in the parlour—I did not see her on my return—the policeman came, and went up stairs—a young woman, named Ann Kitchen, went along with him—she is not here—I did not go with him—I saw the deceased the next day, Sunday—I cooked her dinner—she was then in bed, and appeared very bad indeed—I saw her again on Monday, she was then getting worse and worse—I attended her till her death, which was on a Sunday morning at one o'clock—the prisoner desired me to attend her, and gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it—I got the first 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I got no more—she lived three weeks to the very day—I did not hear the prisoner use any expressions towards her, before he got up and knocked her down, or any bad word come out of his month.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Dalchon, of No. 6, Dunstan's-place—he keeps the house. I remember the prisoner coming home to his lodging the night the deceased was beaten—he lived with her—it was, as nearly as I can guess, about ten o'clock—I <hi rend="italic">lit</hi> him up stairs, and when he got into the room he locked the door, and I heard him say that no one should come in that night—the deceased was then out—he did not inquire for her when he came in—he was in liquor—the deceased came in in about half-an-hour—I <hi rend="italic">lit</hi> her up stairs, and told her that Mr. Harrison had come home—she knocked repeatedly at the door, and asked him to let her in—he never answered—the panel of the door had been broken open nine months or so age—they had fastened it inside very temporarily—the deceased pushed in the panel of the door—Mr. Ince was then on the stairs, not where we were, she was on the other stairs—this was a middle room—there are two flights of stairs to the house—the deceased removed the panel, and then could reach the key and unlock the door—the prisoner did not wake, as we heard—he did not speak—I went to the door—I did not go in—the prisoner never moved out of his chair—it was after that, that the deceased and Mr. Ince went to market to<lb></lb>gether—I remember their returning with some articles they had pur<lb></lb>chased—I let them in, and they followed me into my room, which is the front parlour, and showed me their marketing—I then list them both up stairs again, and they went into the room—the de<lb></lb>ceased has fastened the door again, so that she could let herself in—she</p>

               <p>got in without any difficulty—the door was open—they unlocked the door themselves—she had locked herself out when she went out, and when she came home, by putting her hand inside, she got in each way alike—I had only got from the stairs into my room, when I instantly heard a scuffle—I was in the parlour underneath—I had gone down after lighting them up—I ran to the bottom of the stairs to see what was the matter, and saw Mr. Ince coming down stairs as fast as she could, crying—I then heard the deceased cry<lb></lb>ing at the top of the stairs, and calling "Police!" and "Murder!"—I heard her say twice before the policeman was fetched, "Oh, Harry, you have mur<lb></lb>dered me!"—that was while Mr. Ince was gone for the policeman—I after<lb></lb>wards saw a bundle of wood and two or three potatoes out in the road—the policeman came—he went up stairs, and I went away again—I do not know why I did not go up stairs—I stood by the parlour-door—the deceased con<lb></lb>tinued to cry, after the policeman left—I heard the prisoner's voice several times after the policeman left—he came down to look for the policeman—I heard him say at the time he was in a passion, it appeared to me when he was hitting her, "I will do for you, you b—"—that was before the police<lb></lb>man came—I heard him say it several times during the night—I heard him say it before the policeman came, after Mr. Ford and Mr. Ince had gone up, when I went to the bottom of the stairs—I heard him say it several times in the course of the night, but not till after I first heard the scuffling—there was a second scuffling after the policeman was gone—two policeman came—only one went up stairs—that one went away, and did not return again—one policeman came to the door, and went away instantly—he did not go up stairs—after he went away, I again heard more scuffling—the prisoner came to the bottom of the stairs to look for the policeman, to ask him if he wanted a shilling—I heard him say that, because it was at my own door—I heard him quarrelling with the deceased after that—he made use of bad language to her several times, calling her out of her name, and such words as I said just now—their room was over my head, so that I could hear the scuffling and wrangling—after the second policeman was gone, I heard him scolding her, and telling her to hold her noise, because she was groaning—I heard him swearing, and telling her to hold her noise—I heard her all night groaning, until the morning—it was late when it happened—it was early when they went out in the morning, and I could not rest at all—my bed is under them, and I heard them as I lay in bed—I heard her say to him in the night, "Oh, my stomach! Oh, my stomach!" the whole night—I did not hear her say anything else, that I can call to mind now—she was using just the same sort of language all night, groaning and making complaints about her being in such pain—I heard her say several times in the night, "Oh, you have murdered me, Harry! Oh, you have murdered me!"—I was not examined before the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Ratcliffe. On the 17th of May I was called to attend the deceased—I found her in bed, labouring under a great deal of inflammation of the peritoneum—I attended her till her death—she apparently improved for about a week—when I first examined her there was a sight yellowness about the pit of the stomach, but I was very doubtful whether that was the result of an injury or not—after the end of the week she became much worse, the pains returned with a great deal more violence than at first, the bowels appeared to swell very much—that indi<lb></lb>cated effusion in the cavity of the abdomen—those symptoms increased till she died, which was last Sunday week, early in the morning—it did not appear to me that she was labouring under any other complaint than that which she communicated to me—after her death I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination—I examined the gall-bladder, and found it ruptured—that was the primary cause of death—that would cause inflammation of the peritoneum, which was the immediate cause of death, and would be followed first by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184706140055"></xptr>
               <p>severe pain, and then by effusion—a violent blow would be very likely to cause a rupture of the gall-bladder, or any other violence externally applied—the rupture was about half an inch in extent—I did not detect that injury till after death—that would be quite impossible—the symptoms would show inflammation and violence, but the nature of it could not be detected till after death—I examined the viscera generally, and found them all healthy, with the exception of the liver—I found no injury about the liver that would account for death—the tinge of yellow on the stomach was very nearly over the gall-bladder—I examined the head—there was nothing about it to indi<lb></lb>cate any cause of mortality—the rupture of the gall-bladder was quite suf<lb></lb>ficient to account for the death.</p>

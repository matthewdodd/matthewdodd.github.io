On Friday night last, in consequence of suspicion, we were induced to get the police officers to attend the premises against the time the labourers left work, which was about eight o'clock in the evening, and after they went out they were instantly brought into my partner's house, and the search of their persons commenced instantly. On the prisoner was found three cakes of soap placed in the waistband of his breeches before, two half cakes from his pockets, and two half cakes were in the crown of his hat; upon this being found in his possession he begged for mercy, and said it was the first time he had committed any offence of that sort.</p>

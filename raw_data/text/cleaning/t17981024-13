               <p>Q. You cannot swear to all of them, I suppose? - A. Yes, I can swear to them all; the prisoner told me he was ordered by a man to drive them from Hammersmith, and if he could sell any of them he was to sell them; that he was to have half-a-crown a piece for selling them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labouring man, I live near the King's-head, in the Edgware-road; the prisoner stood with the pigs about a quarter past six in the morning; he asked me if I knew any place he could put them in to give them some beans; I told him I did not; he asked me if I thought any body would take notice if he drove them under the gateway in the mews, and I told him I dare say he would not be interrupted; he told me he had bought the pigs very reasonable, and he could sell them cheap, they were different sizes, he sold one for ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. I cannot tell, I saw him take the money for it, and then the man bought the fellow to it; the man said, he thought they were over-driven, and were not well; he said, no, they had only come from Colnbrook, and he had brought them from Hammersmith that morning, and then I agreed for the two biggest of them, and as I was driving them away, Mr. Nevitt came up upon his mare, and collared the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Nevitt). What was the value of your pigs? - A. I was offered three guineas a piece before harvest for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Coming through Hammersmith, there was a man with these pigs, and he told me to drive them to the Wilkes's-head, near Tyburn-turnpike, and if I could sell a few of them, I was to have two shillings and sixpence a piece for selling them. <rs id="t17981024-13-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

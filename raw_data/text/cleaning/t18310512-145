            . I am mistress of the house - the prose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120082"></xptr>cutor has been with me for years. The prisoner came there on the 1st of April, to lodge by the week - on the 18th he left without notice; about half-past seven o'clock after the prosecutor was gone, I heard him come down and shut the door - he never returned; he took away his night-cap and his property - the prosecutor complained of losing his property; I went the same evening to where the prisoner had told me I might have his address, No. 38, Great Garden-street - as I went up the steps I saw him at the window; I went into the passage - the room door was locked; I saw a young woman, who made a sort of stammor - I said I wanted the prisoner, and it was of no use denying it, for I had seen him; she then went into the back room, and said, "You had better come forward, she has seen you;" he then came forward, and I accused him of it - he denied it; I said, "The young man is at the corner of the street, and you had better go with me to him;" he went with me part of the way, and then ran away - my brother, who was with me, ran after him, but did not like to follow him further; we afterwards heard he was at No. 21, Baker's-row - we sent for him; he was denied, but the officer got him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said you would give charge of me. Witness. Yes, I did, and I would if I could have got an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not run - the prosecutor's room door was wide open, and there was free access for any of the lodgers; I had not time to return to my lodgings - she came the same afternoon; I never did such a thing - I was at my father's house, and my sister told me she had come; she did not say she had seen me.</p>

               <p>- CAFFHAM sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Edward Freers, a pawnbroker in Little Pulteney-street, about ten minutes walk from Fitzroy-square: On Friday, the 2d of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180065"></xptr>shop, I have known him from a little boy, with a pair of table spoons, and tea spoons; he said he wanted to make up his rent; Mrs. Jardine claimed them the same morning: On Saturday, the 17th, the prisoner brought two sheets to pledge, and I sent for a constable, and stopped him; I saw Mr. Jardine's watch taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; when I took him into custody, he was going to put the seal of his watch in; I said, don't do that, because I must have it; he said it was his own; I took it from him, (produces it), I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jardine. I know these to be my spoons, one is stouter than the other, and they are a little rubbed at the back.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you, merely from this circumstance, have been able to swear to them if you had found them any where else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon the tea-spoon? - A. No, none; I cannot give any particular description of the watch, but it is familiar to my sight.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these spoons well, I have had them more than a twelvemonth; I know the watch perfectly well, the regulator is marked like a star upon the face of it; it is different from any other regulator; the maker's name is Addis.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about its being your watch? - A. None; the seal and key are the same.</p>

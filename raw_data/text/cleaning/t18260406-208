               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. What hour did you get to Chiswick? A. About six o'clock, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went to the Red Lion public-house, and there I saw John Simpson - he said "Halloo, master, you are up again;" I then drank out of his pot, and then had a pint myself - it was strong beer; I do not know how much I had afterwards - part of two or three pots, perhaps - it was porter or hock - three or four of us drank; I had no gin or spirits that night - I drank part of three or four pints of beer after that with old Middleton, the waterman; I went on board the barge again by ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know the sacks of malt that the watchman pointed out to you? A. Yes; they were part of my master's bulk, I am sure; I saw both the prisoners there that night, but Thomas did not come in till the latter end of the evening, just before I went on board.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Chiswick. On the 17th of March, after I had cried the hour of two, my dog barked a good deal; I then went to Dr. Turner's stable, and there I saw Thomas Simpson with a sack of malt on his back; I took hold of the corner, he threw it down upon another sack and ran away; this was about one hundred yards from the barge; I had known him from a child and have no doubt of his person - I said "I have got you now" - he made no answer but ran away; I sprung my rattle, and a man, named Davy, got up and came to a window to know what was the matter - I said a man had been stealing some malt out of the Ware barge - he got up and took one of the sacks into my house, and came back for the other; I then went down and called to the bargeman, but could not awake him - I met another watchman - he then went down and awoke the bargeman - he said "Get up, you will lose all your malt;" I did not see John Simpson till about twenty minutes after two o'clock, when he and his brother came to the place where the malt had been thrown down; I said "You are the two gentlemen who have been lifting off this malt;" John said "What malt" - I said "You will know in the morning" - he said "If you want me you know where to find me" - I showed the same sacks and malt to Lambert, and they are here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was past two o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; it was not quite bright moon-light, but light enough for me to distinguish him - we went the next day before a Magistrate; I did not say before him that I could not swear to the man, as I did not see his features - what I said to Thomas Simpson was, "I have got you - but he got away - I had hold of the corner of the sack - it was about one hundred yards from the wharf; I had no lantern; I had seen him in the afternoon - he had a lightish jacket and blue trousers on; I mentioned to the foreman of the brewhouse that I knew the person who had committed the robbery; I heard that John surrendered himself, but I did not know it; I only communicated my intelligence to the watchman - I was at work at the brewhouse when the prisoner was taken - I had not stopped a man with a sack of malt half an hour before - I did not see the first sack of malt before Thomas threw his sack down upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you had known them from their childhood? A. Yes; and I swear positively it was Thomas Simpson had the sack.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY REYNOLDS</hi>. I am a surgeon, of Cambridge-terrace. On 7th or 8th Aug. the prisoner applied to me to take a house of mine in Saville-row—they I asked him for what purpose he wanted it—he told me he was an engineer, and wanted it for the purposes of his profession, that he was surveyor to the Indian Rail-road, and had just returned from Egypt, where he had been two years, and I should see his survey, but he had lost it in its transit from Egypt to England; that his father was Godfrey Wentworth, of Woolley-park, near Wakefield, and as his father was so well known, he expressed his great sur<lb></lb>prise that I did not know him; that his name was Wentworth, and in all probability I knew his relation, Lady Augusta Wentworth, who was my neighbour in Connaught-place; that he was also engineer to the Northern County Coal Company, No. 10, Agar-street, Strand, and that he had just returned from Sunderland, where he had been making surveys of their mines, and if I inquired at any banker's in the City they would know his name well, and I should be perfectly satisfied with him—I went into the City, and made inquiry of a friend who was well acquainted with commercial persons—I heard that what he said about his father was correct, that his father had failed in 1825, but the family was quite respectable—I let him my house—theyhe took possession of it on 15th Aug.—he was to pay, for fixtures and im<lb></lb>provements, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me two promissory notes; this is one of them—they(read)—"London, 10th Sept. 1849, 31, Saville-row. One month after date I promise to pay Mr. Henry Reynolds 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for value received. J. Wentworth."—I did not see him sign this note, but I have seen him sign his name—I am sure this is his writing.</p>

               <p>was Wentworth, and he was the son of Godfrey Wentworth? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, Yes—the fixtures were to be paid for on the day he took possession, the 15th Aug., but he made an excuse that he was short of money, in consequence of having paid his sister's milliner's bill, his sister having gone to Ireland with the Queen—he said he was a father to his sister—from that time till he gave me these notes I made many applications to him—I do not recollect that I asked him to give me these notes—I pressed him to give me some security—I will not swear that the first proposition respecting these notes did not come from me—from 15th Aug. till 8th Sept. he remained in possession of the house—I found afterwards, from the "Court Guide," that Lady Augusta Wentworth was my neighbour in Con naught-place—I knew nothing about it before—after three weeks I sent there to inquire whether they knew such a person as the prisoner, and the servant's reply was that they did not—the prisoner had resided in the house before I made these inquiries—I had inquired in the City of Mr. Whitton, of Crosby-square, a gentleman connected with com<lb></lb>mercial affairs—I have never been on intimate terms with the prisoner, I received him as a gentleman—I did not ask him to dinner, but he has taken tea at my house two or three times—I think I did not give him any supper—he remained with me till two in the morning once—I introduced him to Mrs. Reynolds—he spent more than one evening with me—I am a homoe<lb></lb>pathic practitioner—on those occasions that subject was introduced, and that was what detained him so long—there was no discussion—I explained the science—I do not know that the conversation got so warm that I forgot altogether the subject on which the prisoner called upon me, or that he was obliged to recall it to my recollection—at the first interview I had with him he complained of a sore throat—I gave him two globules, two decilions of paregoric, it cured him—he thanked me, and I felt further encouragement to speak on my subject—I did not make any proposition to him about enter<lb></lb>ing into my speculation—he was asked to attend a meeting of the Homoepathic Association, of which I was not then a member—I do not recollect whether that was the only proposition I made to him—I do not know that I have entered into any other speculation—I once lent a man 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never drawn bills on tenants of mine, or received bills from them—I may almost swear that I never received a promissory note from a tenant of mine—I will not swear that I have not—I do not know Mr. Brandon—to the best of my knowledge I never did—no one of that name ever took a house of me—I swear I never solicited a former tenant to give me a bill of exchange—the prisoner entered into possession on the faith of the representation he made to me—he did not give me these two notes at my request—I objected to take them—I had requested him before to give me security because I had my doubts about him—Messrs. Cubitts called on me to make inquiries about him; that first raised my suspicions—I told them I had considered him a respect<lb></lb>able man, but it was true he had not paid me the 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the following Saturday I urged him to give me the means of identifying his respectability, or security for the 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then offered me two bills—he referred me to Mr. Vill, to Jones, Loyd, and Glyn and Co.—he said, "They will identify my name, and discount the bills"—I went to Mr. Vill, and he said he did not know him—I afterwards got the bills.</p>

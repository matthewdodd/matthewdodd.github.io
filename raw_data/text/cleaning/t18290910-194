            . On the 17th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Mile-end-road - we went to a public-house and had something to drink; I was going towards home - she still walked with me down Mutton-lane and down another lane; I had a purse containing 4l. 4s. 6d. - I took sixpence out to pay for the drink, and then returned the purse into my right-hand breeches pocket; we then went on to <placeName id="t18290910-194-crimeloc1086">Assembly-passage or place</placeName>

            . I was on duty and was called - I saw the prisoner throw this purse away, and the prosecutor caught her; he said before, that he had lost a purse of money - the prisoner said she wished she was dead, and had never been alive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me throw it away? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, representing that the prosecutor had given her the purse and money, but as she afterwards refused to comply with a very unnatural proposal, he charged her with a robbery, and ill-treated her.</p>

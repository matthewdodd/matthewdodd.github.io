            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw the two prisoners together, going up Skinner-street, and watching people as they passed. I then missed them, but saw them again in the Old Bailey, where I heard Smith say to Pawsey, "We will go this road" - they went on to Ludgate-hill, and I saw Scott go along on the Bridge-street side; Smith tapped Pawsey on the shoulder, and pointed to him, with the books; he crossed, and spoke to him - Smith followed, and talked to them, till they got to Bridge-street - they then turned down, and were talking for some minutes; Scott seemed loath to part with the bag, but it was put down on the step of a door, and Smith and Scott went on to the corner of Bride-lane - I passed on to see where Pawsey was, and saw Scott coming back, calling out, "Halloo, you have got my books"- I said, "Run on - it is all right;" I then pursued Smith, and took him by the collar as he was going down Bride-lane, in a direction to have met Pawsey again.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was going over Blackfriars-bridge, to see for a place, and this boy came and asked if I would go on an errand - I asked if it was far; he said No. The prosecutor put his bag on the steps for this lad to mind. When we got to the top of the street we both forgot the number of the house - he went back, and when he got to the corner he cried out "My books are gone," and I ran to get them - the officer then took me.</p>
               <p>PAWSEY'S Defence. I do not know the other prisoner at all; when the gentleman came to me the lad had got his books on his shoulder, and was going home with them.</p>

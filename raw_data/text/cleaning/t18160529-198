            . I am a blue-maker. On the 22nd of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoners; they were going in a direction towards the prosecutor's house. When they got up to it, they looked in at the parlour window; the little one shoved the window up, and went in; he did not remain in a minute, before he came out again; he brought nothing out. Then they walked up and down. Then they came back again, and the little one went in again; he brought something to the window, which he gave to Fox, and which he put into his right hand coat, pocket. Then he handed the pictures out. I gave an alarm, and caused them to be stopped; we followed them, and apprehended them in a field, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's house. The pictures were dropped, and the spoons were picked up in a direction in which Fox ran.</p>

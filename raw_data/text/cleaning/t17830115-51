               <p>Last Friday week, in the morning about six, I was patroling the street; and in Whitechapel I stopped a horse and cart; the prisoner at the bar drove it; I asked him who it belonged to; he said, he was going to carry hops, to one Mr. Chase, a brewer at Tottenham; I told him I believed it was false; I permitted him to go on; and I followed the cart unknown to him, into Bishopsgate-street; the cart stopped there; then I told him that I saw he was not going to Tottenham; and I took him by the collar, and told him, he should go with me before a magistrate; he told me, if I would let him go, he would tell me the truth about the robbery; I told him I should not let him go, and I would know the truth likewise; we went into a publick house, and the prisoner told me, he took them that morning from Ratcliffe-cross, out of a warehouse; he and Milton, (who was convicted this morning) I found by enquiring that these premises from whence they were taken belonged to the prosecutors.</p>

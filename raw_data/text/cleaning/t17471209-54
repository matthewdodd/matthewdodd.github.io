I then said, I would try whether he was an honest man or no, so we weighed our tea and some bails of coffee; and when the Prisoner came, as I was forward, I thought I heard the canister's head go off: so I says to the journeyman, I want to see how much tea is in those canister; and as he weighed them I looked at him, and he shook his head; I said is my tea right? he said, no sir; so I caught hold of the Prisoner and sent for the constable, and took the tea out of his pocket.</p>

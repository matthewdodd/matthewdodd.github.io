               <p>Is that some of the paper? - This is some of the same sort, I cannot say it is the same bundle I bought of him, and paid for.</p>
               <p>Was you present when your master bought them? - Yes, it was the same sort that I saw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are a great many thousand reams of the same sort in this town, you do not mean to say that any part of that is the same? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was it last night? - It was left with a person yesterday.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any marks upon it by which you know it to be the same paper? - Here are some of the marks of the chalk.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How long had this young man been with you? - About six or seven months.</p>
               <p>What was his character? - If you think proper, I will give you an account of all I know about his character, I would not have kept him in my service so long, if I had not thought him honest, but I lost upwards of five hundred weight.</p>
               <p>You cannot ascertain how long that might have been going? - He might have been stealing that paper for twelve months to come, and I never miss it; I suppose there is five or six thousand pounds worth there, it is impossible to ascertain how much I lost out of so great a quantity, some of it was printed two or three years ago, some of it is a new Bible that is just finished about a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When was that part finished that is produced? - About three or four years ago.</p>
               <p>When was that part of Rapin's History finished that is in that bundle? - It is a hundred sheets of one sort of history, there is a hundred of another, and they are all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230091"></xptr> different parts, a latter part, a first part, and all.</p>
               <p>How long ago was the latter part of that history printed by you? - A part of the Bible, and that part of the History of England, I believe not above six months ago; all the new Bible has been printed in the course of two years, it was finished about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Did much of it remain unfinished within two months past? - I can safely say, the History of England, and the Bible were not finished six months ago, this bundle consists intirely of the old Bible.</p>
               <p>Look at the other parcels? - This is chiefly the new Bible.</p>
               <p>When was the latest of that Bible printed? - About thirty weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When were these sheets printed? - This is page 158, we are now printing about four hundred, I believe this was done about three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Where were these works printed? - At my own Printing-office in town.</p>
               <p>You always print a certain number over for waste? - There is what they call over paper for proofs, only this is not proofs.</p>
               <p>But after you had printed a certain number of sheets for use, you print some over paper after? - I can say this in answer to that, that I never sold a sheet since I began business, and that there is no waste paper mong the men, till I leave of printing.</p>
               <p>Is not it your custom to print over paper to supply defective sheets? - We do print what they call over copies.</p>

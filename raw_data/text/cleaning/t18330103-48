On Thursday evening, the 6th of December, about nine o'clock, I was called into Mr. Arundell's house, to take the prisoner - Mr. Arundell's brother gave him into my charge with a purse, containing five sovereigns and some silver, which I produce; on taking him to the station-house, I told him I thought he had got a very bad connexion, which he denied - I asked what he had done with the remainder of the ten sovereigns; he said he had bought the clothes which he had on, and some segars and wine: I told him it was a bad job - he asked if it was too late to mend; I said, "I think not."</p>

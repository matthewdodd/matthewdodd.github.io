                  </hi>. I am porter at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate. On the 3rd of April, about three o'clock, I was sent with a van load of boxes to the Eastern Counties Railway—I went through Charles-street—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what Mr. Hughes told me, there I looked into the van, and missed a box—I ran in the direction Mr. Hughes pointed, and afterwards saw the prisoner in Princes-street with the box on his shoulder—I ran up to him and took it from him—Mr. Hughes was with me—I held the pri<lb></lb>soner till I was knocked down by some one, and the prisoner got away—I got up again in about half a minute, and called, "Stop thief!"—a policeman came up, and I told him what had happened—I saw no more of the prisoner till I saw him at the station, about a fortnight after—I am quite sure he is the same person—this is the box—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by the different marks—I had seen it many times before that day—I had placed it in the van myself.</p>

               <p>about half-past three o'clock, I was standing at my master's shop win<lb></lb>dow, and saw the van go by full of packin-cases—I saw three persons walking on the pavement together—the prisoner is one of them—I can swear to him—I had seen him before—I saw one of them, not the pri<lb></lb>soner, go into the road and take a box from behind the wagon—the pri<lb></lb>soner was on the pavement at the time—I ran down stairs directly after the wagoner—I came up with him and told him, and we went in pursuit—I afterwards saw the prisoner with a box on his shoulder, of the same shape and size as that which had been taken from the van—I came up with him—I staid a minute or two, and Crasher told me to take the box towards the van, which I did—I had not got to the van when I heard them halloo out, "Stop thief!"—I afterwards saw Crusher in Baker's-row, bleeding from the back of the head—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the station—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper at the Saracen's Head, Aldgate. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of April I sent Crusher with a van-load of luggage—I after saw him return bleeding—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he told me I went to the station-house and gave informa<lb></lb>tion—I found the box at the railway station—this now produced is it—it is constantly in transit—it came from Mr. Topham, of St. Al ban's, and was to go to Messrs. Betts, of Ipswich—it was then under the care of the carriers, Henry, Robert, and John Smith—Mr. Tophara, the consignor, opened the box in my presence—it contained prepared horse-hair, and bundles of prepared platted straw.</p>

When I first went in I stood at the bar for a minute or two before they saw me - I saw the prisoner give Wright some gin; after they were secured I went to search the prisoner's house, in Little Coleman-street, St. Luke, Middlesex - I know it to be his house - and in his room I found a drawer which had contained tobacco - there was about half a spoonful of tobacco dust in it; I found a little girl in the house; I afterwards searched a Mrs. Scott's room, on the first floor, and found this box, which was locked - I broke it open; it contained about 35 lbs. of tobacco - the box and all weighed 48 lbs. 9 ozs.; I brought it down stairs, and Mrs. Scott with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST, Q. Where is the tobacco dust? A. I have not brought it here; I did not think it necessary, it was so small a quantity; I showed it to the prosecutor - he took the drawer out, and shook the dust into one corner of it; Ryland holds part of the house, there are only three rooms - he had two of them; I always considered it his house; I took Mrs. Scott to the Magistrate - he thought proper to admit her evidence; she attended four days at Hicks'-hall; I have not seen her here: I found her in the room the box was in - I cannot say that it is her room; she did not take me into the room, I went there without being led - it was about half-past nine o'clock- Mrs. Scott stood at the street door I believe when I first went in; I asked for Mrs. Ryland, and she was looking for her.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Would the grains of tobacco give the drawer any smell? A. It would; I smelt the grains of tobacco - they stuck round the drawer.</p>

            . I was the prisoner's servant, and have lived nine months with him. I know that box, and have seen it in Ryland's room; I have moved it about when I have been cleaning - it was always heavy, and was kept by the side of his bed the whole time I was there; he lives in one room - I saw it in his room when I came down to light the fire at seven o'clock in the morning of the day the officer came - it was on a chair by his bed-side; I have seen Wright come to Ryland's, but not often - I was always turned out of the room when he came, and the door was locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the box that morning? A. Yes - I have often moved it; I once put it on the carpet - it was heavy then, but not so heavy as when it was full; it always seemed full of something, and was always equally heavy; I believe the first morning I went there I saw it open - I think there were a few clothes in it, but I did not look into it; I am sure it was not Mrs. Scott's box, for I saw it in master's room every day; I do not know how it got into her room - I was never in the room when master dressed.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. The first day you were there was nine months ago? A. Yes; I took no particular notice when I saw it open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any servants in the house but yourself? A. No. Scott cleaned her own room - I fetched her errands; I never saw the box in her room; she left the house about three days ago: my master is a shoe-maker - I never saw him deal in tobacco; I am thirteen years old; I have been to a Sunday-school - I believe God will punish wicked people who speak falsely.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS. I accompanied Vann to the prisoner's lodgings; I saw a large drawer there, and it had a small portion of tobacco left in it - it smelt as if much more had been there; I saw this box in a room which I was told Scott occupied; I am certain the tobacco in it is ours - it is manufactured by a peculiar process, and is worth about 7l.</p>

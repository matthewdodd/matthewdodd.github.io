                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 26, Man-chester-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone—I keep the house—the prisoners were in my service, one as butler and the other as lady's maid—the ladies' maid had been with me seventeen yean, and the butler two years—in March last my son was on a visit at my house sleeping there—the prisoner Handcox slept in the same room as me—there is a dressing room immediately adjoining the room in which I slept; it communicates with my bed-room, and there is another door to the dressing-room which opens on the landing-place—on Saturday, the 28th of March last, I had in my house the articles named in the indictment—they were altogether of the value of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were kept in a jewel-box in a drawer in a chest of drawers in the dressing-room—the jewel-box was a deal box covered with paper, resembling morocco-leather—it had a lock and an old fashioned white plated handle—the drawer was locked—I usually kept the keys of the jewel-box and drawer in my pocket—Handcox always had to put away those jewels when I used them—I thought her so very trust<lb></lb>worthy, and trusted her very often with the keys to open the box, and get them out and to put them away—I had dined out on Friday, the day before, and she got out my rings which I wore that day, and she also put them away—I went out in the carriage on Saturday, about two o'clock, and returned about five or half-past—I did not use any of the jewels in the box on that day—I went to bed that night between eleven and twelve o'clock, I believe—Handcox slept in my room that night—when I undress, my pocket was generally left in the dressing-room on a chair, and was so that nigbt, I be<lb></lb>lieve—it contained the keys of the jewel-box and drawer—I was disturbed between three and four o'clock in the morning—Handcox came and stood over me and said, "Madam! Madam! do not be frightened, there is somebody in the house; I am sure there is, because I heard something fall in the dress<lb></lb>ing room, and a scuffling noise"—I started up in my bed very much frightened and said, "For God's sake what shall we do I what shall we do!" and after a few minutes' consideration, I went into my son's room on the same floor, and alarmed him and his wife—he got up immediately, took up the poker and went over the house to search; and his wifo put her head out of window and called to the police—Handcox told me almost immediately after, that she was excessively glad she had locked the dressing-room door that night, if she had not, she should never have forgiven herself—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what appeared on an examination afterwards, I discharged the two prisoners on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's son. I was on a visit at my mother's, with my wife, sleeping at her house—on Sunday-morning, the 29th of March, I was awoke at three o'clock in the morning by Han<lb></lb>cock and my mother coming into my room, which is on the same floor as the dressing-room—there are three room doors opening on the same landing-place; it is on the second floor—I got up, and went down stairs with the poker, and on my way down stairs, I found a window on the same landing-place open—that window is below the drawing-room floor, and there was a shawl hanging out of it—that window looks out behind the house—it does not communicate with any place—it does not open into a yard; it goes down ten or twelve feet on a skylight, which is underneath it—the house is on the east side of the square—I laid hold of the shawl, and put my body out of the window to see if any body was there—it happened to be a still night, and every thing was perfectly still—on my way down, I pulled the bell on the landing-place, to awake those who were below—the men-servants slept below—I then ran down stairs, and down the kitchen-stairs along the passage—I saw Hall coming out of the pantry, or out of the room where he sleeps—he was in his shirt—the police were then knocking at the door—I went up with Hall to the door, and when I got to the hall they were let in—I took them up stairs to the different rooms—the female prisoner was present—the dressing-room door was pointed out to them by Handcox—she said something about "destruction" or "confusion"—she said, "See what is done; the door is open"—I looked at it; it appeared to have been cut down with a knife or chisel, or something of that sort—Handcox pointed out the circumstance, and said, "Look here! look here!"—we went into the dressing-room—I saw the chest of drawen—the drawer was open where the jewel-box had been kept, and there was a little chipping as if somebody had attempted to push the lock down—there was a small cabinet at the top, which opened like a door—I think there was a mark on that, but none of the drawers appeared to have any marks, except the one which the diamonds had been in—that drawer was open when I saw it—I and the policeman inspected the lock of the drawer, and of the door likewise—it was evident to me that it had never been broken open or picked—the two prisoners were turned away on the Sunday morning—I heard nothing more about the matter till the following Sunday—a com<lb></lb>munication was then made by Sumpter—it was made first to my lady, she sent for me, and Sumpter then made a statement in my presence and my wife's—a piece of metal was afterwards shewn to me, which is here—it was given to me by Mrs. William Collins—it was given to her by the footman, but not in my presence—I know the jewel-box had a handle on the top, and I think the metal was like this.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 81.) On Sunday morning, the 29th of March, I heard a cry of "Police," in Manchester-square—I went to Mrs. Collins's house at a quarter before four o'clock—the prisoner Hall opened the door—the footman was there, and the female prisoner—she said to me directly she saw me, "Oh, policeman, we have robbers in the house; there is such destruction; if you follow me, I will show you what they have done"—I followed her to the back drawing-room on the first floor—she said, "Look, here is destruction"—I saw a number of papers scattered about the carpet, and two small portable desks appeared to have been broken open—two or three parcels of pictures put as if ready for the purpose of being conveyed away—they were just merely packed in lots, one on another—she said, "If you will go with me, I will show you where they have broken open the dressing-room door and drawer"—I followed her up stairs—she showed me the dressing-room door, and said, "See, they have broken this door open"—she also showed me a drawer which she said had been broken open—it was one of a chest of drawers in the dressing-room—she took this chisel off the top of the drawers, and gave it to me, and said, "See, this is what they have done it with"—I did not then examine the door or drawer—I kept the chisel in my hand, and said to her, "There appears to be something very mysterious about this, for this is not an instrument generally used by regular housebreakers"—she said, "Indeed, do you think so?"—I said, "Besides, it is very strange they should have passed three bed-rooms, all of which were occupied, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110070"></xptr>
               <p>break open the door of this room; when, had they been strangers, how should they have known but what there was somebody in this room also?"—she said, pointing to one of the rooms, "But they looked into this room; they opened this room, and looked in"—she pointed to the next sleeping-room to Mrs. Collins—I said, "But ean you tell me where they came in at?"—she took me down stairs to the landing of the first flight of stairs—I there saw a window open, and a small piece of a chisel without a handle lying there—it had been broken—I found it on the cill of the window, just as it is—there was the ordinary sash-fastening between the two sashes of the window, but no shutter—that fastening did not appear at all forced—I put my head oat of the window to see the situation of the premises—I saw an immense iron railing, sharply pointed at the top, apparently about seven feet high, on the right-hand side, looking out of the window—the railing occupied the whole of the space on that side—the whole space outside that window is six or eight feet square—the railing forming one side of that square is on the top of a lead flat belonging to the next house, and about the level of the floor I stood on, and the railing above it—opposite to the window is a dead wall, forty or fifty feet high; and on the left-hand side is the window of a water-closet, and the water-closet ran the height of the house, two stories higher—it was the water-closet of the same house—the whole of the space was filled up at the bottom by a glazed sky-light—none of the sky-light was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have left the house by that window, could they have got out of that space without the assistance of a ladder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure they could not—I tried it myself—they must have gone over the leads of the adjoining house, and no other way—on looking info the space, I saw this portfolio standing on the lead flat, within about an arm's length, through the rail—a person standing at the window could put it there without going out—I asked Handcox how long it was ago since she heard the noise, before she gave the alarm—she said, not more than five minutes—I said, "I must go and get more assistance, for I suspect they are not off the premises"—I ran down to the front-door, and found the house was surrounded by policemen, so that it was impossible any one could have escaped without their notice—I found, among the others, Inspector Tyrrell, and accompanied him back to the dressing-room, and more particularly examined the marks on the door of the room—Handcox was there the whole of the time—Hall was more particular in attending to the street-door—I particularly noticed, that the side of the door, near the lock, had been chipped down; but we particularly observed, that there was not sufficient chipped off to admit the chisel to force open the lock—it was the post of the door that was chipped; there was a brass plate on the door-post, into which the bolt of the lock shut; the chipping did not make an opening wide enough to admit an instrument to reach the brass plate, so as to open the door; I considered it impossible—the brass plate had no marks or scratches of any kind—my superintendent arrived with a locksmith, and I went on the lead flat—a person must come over an immense high wall, from a mews, to get on the lead flats—the wall is two stories high from the ground—they would have to pass over the roofs of out-houses of three or four-houses, and then they would come to the iron railing, but they must have ladders to go up and down into the different yards—I got over the iron railing by a common pair of steps, seven or eight feet high, but could not do it without such assistance—I went along on my knees, not to make foot-marks—there was a quantity of black dust, as is usual in such places,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183505110071"></xptr>
               <p>but no foot-marks whatever—I had candle with me—the dust was in such a state that it would most assuredly have foot-marks if persons had been there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a dozen persons had been in the area or coal-shed, might they not have escaped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They could not have got there—while I was up stairs, persons might have got away, but the coal-cellar was locked, and the doors leading to that, and the area, were all locked and bolted—all the servants were called up, three men, including the coachman, and three maids—I saw the butler and footman, but not the coachman—I do not know how many servants there are—nobody but Handcox was present at the search till I got on the landing-place—at the time of the further search, I believe, three female servants were present—it was possible for persons in the house to let somebody out and bolt the doors—I inspected the leads about half an hour after the alarm—I could see no foot-marks for me to suppose any body had escaped—I did not examine them at any other time—it was light when I made the search—it was a quarter before four o'clock when I first heard the alarm, but by the time I got on the leads it had got day-light.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the police at the time in question. I went to the house, and examined the marks on the dressing-room door very minutely—I took the chisel which was given to me by Mr. Lincoln—I had the door locked inside, and saw the chipping—I tried to put the chisel in between the door cheek, but could not—there was not sufficient cut away—the door itself was not cut at all, not on that side—I then had the door unlocked, and turned the bolt to see if there were any scratches on the bolt of the lock, which any instrument must have made, and there would have been an indenture in the wood, from the pressure of the instrument—but there was no scratch nor mark whatever—I went to the staircase window and confirm the previous evidence—I searched the female prisoner's box, but found nothing included in the indictment—Handcox's mistress having said in her presence, that she had been with her seventeen years, I asked her if she had got any money—she told me she had none—she said she had a sister who had been out of place two years, and she had been supporting her—I searched Hall's box, and asked him if he had any money—he said, he had not a halfpenny in the world—on Monday, the 6th of April, I took Hall from the station-house to the police-office—I saw a female on the steps of the office with a baby in her arms, and he told me she was his wife—she said to him, "Hall, you see what you have brought yourself to"—he said, "I may thank you all for this"—she hung down her head, began crying, and walked off.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am an ironmonger and locksmith, and live in Welbeck-street.

                  </hi>. In March last I was in the service of Mrs. Collins, and had been so eight years next July—the two prisoners were also in her service—I was in the habit of conversing familiarly with them, as ser<lb></lb>vants do—I remember the night of the robbery perfectly well—about a fortnight before that I had some conversation with the prisoners on the subject of robberies—we were talking about so many robberies taking place of jewels and various things, and we said we thought servants were always errconcerned in the robberies—Hall asked Handcox what she thought mis<lb></lb>tress's jewels were worth, whether she thought they were worth 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the reply was, yes, she thought they were; and then he said, "Shall we all three agree to part with them?"—the reply from all three of us was, "Yes"—Hancox and I said, "Yes"—we talked further about it several times—we were to take an opportunity of taking them—the time was fixed—it happened on the 28th or 29th of March—it was to be fixed about then, but it was not settled till the night before it took place—I and Handcox were to take them out of the box, and give them to Hall—Hall was present at that arrangement—I had seen my mistress's jewel-case several times—it was a red box—I do not know whether it was covered with red paper or leather—it had a handle on the top—I saw the inside when I emptied the contents out—I cannot say I had not seen it before that, but not to know the particulars of it—there were two trays in it, covered with white satin and wadding—mistress went out on Saturday afternoon, but at what time I cannot say—but while she was out, I and</p>

               <p>Handcox took the jewel-box, placed it on a box by the side of mistress's bed, and emptied it—Hancock placed it there—it was there when I went into the room, and was open—I did not see it unlocked—it was unlocked—Hall was not there—I took out the two trays, and emptied the contents into two fine brown papers—I emptied out two head ornaments, necklaces, rings, a watch, and some foreign coin, and other things, and sparkling stones—I do not know whether they were set in gold or silver—when we had emptied them out, we both wrapped them up and took them down stairs into the back parlour, and gave them to Hall, who was there—his reply was, "Now I have got you both;" or "Now I have done for you both!" I do not know which—he then went down stairs to the kitchen floor, and after that, (but I do not know how long after that,) he went out—I saw him again before he went out—he went out about half-past five or a quarter before six o'clock—I let him out, and be asked me to wait till he came back; as he should be gone a very short time—I did not see whether he had the brown paper parcels with him or not—I waited for him—he came back in about ten minutes, and I let him in, and I let Evans the coachman in at the same time—he said, "Thank God, they are gone!"—Evans did not hear what he said, he was gone down stairs—when I took the jewels out of the box, we put the box underneath mistress's bed—it had been settled before what was to be done with the box—there were other servants in the house—the cook was down stairs—the footman was out with mistress—Mrs. Collins's nurse was up stairs in the nursery—my mistress dined at home at six o'clock—the footman was at home when the jewels went out of the house, and I think he was at home part of the evening, but I was up stairs a good deal—the coachman went away in his room about his busi<lb></lb>ness—I cannot say what time in the evening the footman was in the house—I did not see him sent out the first time, but the second time I was present when Hall sent him out, and told him to go and inquire after some man's health—I do not recollect the name—I think he was to go some-where to Lisson-grove, or the New-road way—Hall sent the cook out to get half a pint of gin—he said there were no good spirits anywhere near the house, but if she would go somewhere towards King-street, (I think it was,) she would get some good gin there—he gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get it—she wanted to know why he wanted her to go so far, and hesitated about going—she said it was a good way to go—he said she would oblige him if she would go that distance for it—when both those servants were out, we three burnt the remains of the box—some part of it was burnt in mistress's dressing-room, another part in the pantry, and some part in the kitchen—I and the two prisoners were present, but not at all the three places—I was chiefly in the dressing-room, but I saw part burnt in the kitchen, and I put some part of it on the kitchen-fire myself, and likewise in the pantry—I had mistress's dressing-room fire to do, and threw the ashes into the dust-hole next morning, but I have nothing to do with the other ashes—the cook returned first, and we four sat down to play at cards—the foot<lb></lb>man came in about ten o'clock, and told Hall the man was perfectly well that he went to inquire after—there might be more pass, but I did not pay attention to it—my mistress went up stairs about half-past ten, or I think at nearly eleven—I heard Handcox make an alarm in the course of the night—I knew it was going to take place—it was planned at what hour it should take place—all three of us planned it—I came down stairs after hearing the alarm, and went into Mrs. Collins's bed-room—Mrs. William Collins opened the window, clapped her hands, and called the police—when</p>

I am a sadler, and live in Paddington-street. know Hall—I met him in the street on the Monday after the robbery—I saw him on Tuesday—he asked me if I knew of a lodging—he came on Wednesday, and lodged at the same house as I do—while he was there he brought to my room door a small green box, gave it to me, and asked me to lock it up in my drawers for him—I did so—I saw it opened on the Sunday evening after he was taken into custody by inspector Lincoln—I saw one hundred and seventy-three sovereigns in it, and a few articles not of any value.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of hearing of the robbery, I saw the prisoner Hall on the 5th of April—I said, "Hall, this is a bad job"—(he was in the cell at the time—I knew him be<lb></lb>fore)—he asked me my advice—I told him I had no business to give advice under such circumstances—he said he wished me to give him advice, for he meant to tell all about it—I said it was of no use his telling all about it now, for Mary Sumpter had told all about it—he asked me what Mary had said—I told him she said he took the jewels down as far as Maryle-bone-lane, but she did not see which way he turned—he said that was false, for he did not go so far as the lane with them—I told him I would not hear any more there—if he liked to go in a coach with me to the office, he could tell me what he liked—I then left him, intending to go in a coach with him, but I did not go—I saw him afterwards at the office—I was</p>

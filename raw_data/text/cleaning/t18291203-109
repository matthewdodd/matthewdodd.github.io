About half-past twelve o'clock that day I was on a scaffold - I saw a mob, and Hurley was running; I came down a scaffold-pole, and pursued him - I saw him turn up his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and some money fell out; he jumped over a ditch, and fell - I jumped over, and took him; he wished me to let him go - I found two shillings and some halfpence in his pocket, and then took the people to where I saw him turn his pocket up; I saw Gavin coming, and told Thomas to take him.</p>
               <p>DAVID THOMAS. I was on the scaffold, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I took Gavin, and saw him drop a cloth on the ground - I then went to the spot where I had seen Hurley turn out his money, and picked up 6s.; I did not see the till till I had been to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN GODLEY. I saw Hurley throw this till into a ditch - it had been on the ground, and the two prisoners were sitting down with it between them in a field; some persons called Stop thief! and Hurley threw it into the ditch - they then ran away; I did not see them stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Langham-place, in the parish of Saint Mary-lebone—the prisoner was my under housemaid for two months. On Wednesday, the 31st of May, I placed a purse, containing a £10 note, a £5 note, two or three sovereigns, and some silver, on my dressing-table in my bed-room previous to going to bed—I missed a £10 note on Friday morning when I left my bed-room and came to my dressing-room to dress—the prisoner had access to that room in the course of her duty—I first missed the £10 note, and afterwards the sovereigns and silver, finding only the £5 note remaining—I had received the note from Hammersleys, my bankers, on the 30th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Hall. On Friday, the 2nd of June, my master told me of his loss—I mentioned, when the servants were altogether, and the prisoner was present, that master had lost a £10 note out of his purse in his dressing-room—they all denied all knowledge of it—the prisoner made no observation at all—on the Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, she came to me in the pantry, and asked me if master had found his money—I said he had not—she was in her working dress then—I saw her again about half past ten o'clock dressed in her best clothes—I let her into the house, I did not know she had been out—on the Sunday, while she was at church, I went up stairs to her drawer with the housekeeper, and found a good many new clothes, and among them some bills of different tradesmen, and one from Mr. Gotobed.</p>

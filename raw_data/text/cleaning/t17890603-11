               <p>The prosecutor rents an apartment from me, and I work hard and rise early, at 2 o'clock, I went to bed, at 10 o'clock I was just fell asleep and heard a noise, and I thought it might be a fire, I went up stairs and found the prisoner there, I am sure he is the man, he had run away I understood and had been brought back, and a bundle of clothes now here lying by his soot bag, making apologies that he did not come in for any hurt, but because the chimney was on fire; I took the prisoner down to Bow-street and the soot sack, I did not see him before he was brought back, I searched him at the office, and found these two keys down his back, this key opens the door of the prosecutor's apartment and locks it, he claimed the soot bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say when you came back that the key would not fit? - It did fit.</p>

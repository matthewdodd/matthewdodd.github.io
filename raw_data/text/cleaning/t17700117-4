I was employed in June last, to sell some goods, the property of a person who is dead, named William More.

Mr. Hall did not send for his goods till two or three days after the sale; and my porters, and clerk, and I had left the house. I had left the bill that was due from Mr. Hall, for his goods, with Mr. Williams, the keeper of the tavern; and had shewed to his servants, what were Mr. Hall's property; they were separated from the rest of the goods. I know I left the pistol in the room, which was afterwards missing. It was such a thing I never had in my hands before, made me take notice of it. It is made to turn round, in order to fire both barrels, one after the other. (A double-barrel pistol produced.) This is it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hall. The prisoner lodged at the red-cow, in Charter-house-lane; he has worked for me about six months: I was present when the pistol was found in his room.</p>
               <p>Langley. A few days after the prisoner was taken up, I went to him in prison, and asked him, whether or not he was guilty in taking other things? He said he could give no answer at that time, because there were two other persons with him I said, there is a remarkable pistol found, which I understand will be advertised. Said he, I wish you would go to the auctioneer in Holborn, and tell him not to appear against me, for I did take it, and I will pay him for it. Instead of going to Mr. Nelson, I went to Mr. Hall, and told him of it. Then Mr. Hall went and told Mr. Sing of it.</p>

               <p>What Mr. Langley says, is quite false. I bought the pistol with other things, at a sale at the half-moon tavern, in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>He called two witnesses to his character, who said they had known him some time, and they knew ill of him.</p>

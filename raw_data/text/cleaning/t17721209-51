            . I am a ticket-porter. Bishop Humphreys came to me in the morning about four o'clock; I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what month it was?</p>
               <p>Millan. I take it to be pretty near two months ago; he came to me and told me there were eight puncheons of brandy to pull up in the morning, and bid me step down; he said he wanted to speak to me; I dressed myself and came down; when I opened the door, Bishop said I might go up to bed again; I said, no, I have dressed myself, and will go about the 60 puncheons I have now got up; this was about four o'clock in the morning. When I came down with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090031"></xptr> the light, I saw a parcel that Bishop had put by; it was a bale or parcel; he asked where he could put it; I said I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was this bale or parcel?</p>
               <p>Millan. A little bigger than my thigh; there was another larger; he put it by himself. About ten o'clock in the morning I came home; there was Jones and one of these two men along with him; they asked me if I saw Bishop; I said no, I had not for some time; he swore and said I will never trust him any more to sell things for me, but I have sold it myself; he asked me to carry it for him to the place; I said I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man?</p>
               <p>Millan. He was a sailor-like man; I am not positive what his name is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it either of the men at the bar?</p>
               <p>Millan. No, I do not know; I fetched him down one; he said he would carry it with him, and took it away. I told Humphreys afterwards when I saw him, a sailor had fetched it away; he desired me to give

               <p>Q. Do you know what it consisted of?</p>
               <p>Millan. It seemed a fort of canvas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Millan. A black mark: I did not observe what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you delivered this bale to Jones?</p>
               <p>Millan. The same day about twelve o'clock.</p>

No. After we went out of the house I took the cloth upon my shoulder, and carried it part of the way to Bishopsgate-street; then Dormer took it upon his shoulder, and carried it to one Mrs. Kelly's, in Half-moon-alley, Bishopsgate-street; there it lay that night, and on Saturday the 31st, about nine in the morning, I went there; she measured the cloth; it measured 112 yards by her measurement; I believe she took pretty good measure; she bid me a guinea for it; I said it was not my property, I would not agree for it, but

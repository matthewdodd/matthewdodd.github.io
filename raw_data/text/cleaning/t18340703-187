            . I am a City constable. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Harris, a cornchandler, on Saffron-hill, to the first-floor room, and burst open the room-door, which was fastened - I found Joseph Denny there concealed between the mattress and the bed - I searched him, and on him found a bill of parcels - he had his coat off, but the rest of his things on - I do not know about his shoes - I then proceeded to search a box in the room, and in it found 115 sovereigns - and a 5l. note in a purse, 9s. and a watch - the prisoner asked what I wanted with him; I told him - he said he knew nothing at all about it in any way - The female prisoner was taken into custody, and brought to the compter while I was there - she was searched, and two keys found tied to her petticoat-string with a piece of ribbon, one of which unlocks the box the money was found in; I tried it, and the other key opened a small box which was shown to me at Mrs. Dicas's - I did not find any jewellery myself - the box in the prisoner's room was locked - I broke it open - I afterwards applied the key found on the female prisoner to it - it unlocked it - I have not a doubt of its being the key - I had broken the lock off, but not injured it so as to alter the wards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long after you went to the room was it that the female prisoner was in custody? A. I should think an hour and a half, or an hour and a quarter - Harris gave her in charge - I saw her in a policeman's custody, who is not here - I did not show her the lock - I merely took the keys from her - she said,"What do you want with them?" - I said, "I shall take them" - she said, "Let me have one of them" - I said, "I can't now" - she did not say she had just received them from her son - she said the keys were hers when I took them from her - I left her to be searched more accurately by a woman - I found a new gown - here is the box - it is a common lock.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the police. On the 20th of June, I searched the room occupied by Mrs. Denny - I have been on duty there the last four years, and know she resides there - I was present when the money was found - I went with Forrester to the station-house - I found this pocket-book, a pearl necklace, a pearl brooch, a gold ring, a garnet ring, and a snuff-box, in the box where the money was found - I also found a bill of exchange for 30l. - I was present when the female prisoner was brought to the compter - I found this bonnet in the room.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to JOHN FORRESTER. Q. Now the lock is opened, look at it, would not any key open it that would go into it? A. It is a common lock; any key which goes into it would turn it, certainly - the box the property was found in, was a kind of sea-chest - some of the male prisoner's clothes were in it, and there was some female apparel there - the property laid more at the top of the box than the bottom - the money was covered with some of the clothes - the new articles of dress which I found in it, laid at the top - the money and pearls were under the things which I produce - I found a new carpet-bag under the bed - these things were in the box, and there was a coat or two in it - the woman might certainly have opened the box, without seeing the jewellery and money in it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any key on the male prisoner to open the box? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not remember whether it was a male or a female? A.

            . I live in Farringdon-street. On the 30th of May, I received a twenty-pound note and a five-pound note from Messrs. Hankey's, the bankers - I paid them to Mr. Dicas on the 31st of May - I also gave him this bill of exchange - it has my endorsement.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Hankey, bankers. On the 30th of May, I cashed a cheque for twenty-five pounds, drawn by J. L. Jones and Son - I gave a twenty-pound note for it, No. 17085, dated 30th of April - (looking at a twenty pound note) this is the note.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DENNY to JANES HARRIS. Q. I paid you the rent myself? A. Yes; you gave me a sovereign and a half-sovereign, and I gave you three shillings back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. You swore the woman paid it? A. They were both there - she gave the order to the son, to pay it to me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. By whom was the room taken of you? A. By the mother, in August last - she was present when the money was paid - I did not see where the boy got the money from - I do not know on what day he came - I saw him there on the Thursday, and Wednesday, the 17th and 18th of June, and on the morning of the 19th they paid me - I do not know at what time he came on the 18th.</p>
               <p>JOHN DICAS (looking at the £50, £20, and £10 notes). There was no endorsement on the notes when I received them - the words, "Norah Denny," I believe to be the handwriting of the male prisoner, and the endorsement on the other two notes also - I believe them all to be his handwriting - there is £40 short of the money I lost - the whole house is in my occupation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. About eight months - he was as good a servant as I ever had - I have occasionally sent him to change me notes (£10 notes), but not so large as £20 - I always sent him to the grocers, North, Graham, and Co., Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of sending him to the Bank for change? A. Never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the female prisoner aware that her son was in your service? A. Yes: I saw her at my house on the Saturday previous to the 14th - I heard a knock at the door late in the evening, and it was her bringing home his clothes which she had to wash - he had asked me to advance him half-a-sovereign to give to his mother who was in great distress - his wages were £5 a year, and I was to give him clothes at the end of six months, which I did - his mother was certainly aware that he was in no condition to earn £10, or £20.</p>
               <p>Joseph Denny to WILLIAMSON. Q. You left me in the house when you went out? A. Yes; when I left for good I left you up stairs.</p>
               <p>MRS. DICAS re-examined. This jewellery is all mine, except this seal and key, which I know nothing of - this is my daughter's purse, she knit it - this watch belongs to a young lady who has left us for France.</p>
               <p>Joseph Denny to JOHN DICAS, jun. Q. Used not you to take me out with you of a night to singing places, and places of amusement, when master and mistress were gone to bed? A. Never - I did not take you to a house of ill-fame in Bell-court, and treat you. The prisoner behaved very attentive to me when I was ill - he would come up two or thee times a night to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DICAS re-examined. I had a good character with him, and he conducted himself well.(Three persons gave the female prisoner a good character.)</p>

On the 27th of February, I received thirty puncheons of rum into my charge from the last witness; there were tins over the bungs, and they were put into a craft belonging to Messrs. Faweelt, called the Shannon. I then went away to the officer of the gate, to take the samples there. I left no person with the samples in the intermediate time while I was gone to the gate. When I came back, the lighter was moved into the basin, on her way to the river. I went on board then; the rums were then all safe as I believe; there was no smell of any rum, having got out then. I walked on the quay, where I commanded a view of the vessel until about seven o'clock in the evening, and I was then relieved by the prisoner,

             and Robert Nichols. My attention was called on the River to a strange smell of rum opposite the old Custom House; it appeared on board a lighter there; I ordered our boat to go along side of it; that lighter turned out to be the Shannen. I then stood, and opened my lanthorn, which was a dark one, and looked, and saw the prisoner Williams, get up from the after tier, in the body of the lighter, from among the casks; he ran forward in the lighter, and into a deck barge; I pursued him immediately, and he went over the deck barge, and into a lug-boat, and I jumped into it after him; he went forward, and endeavoured to conceal himself between the main thwart and the other; but I secured him. I asked him what made him run away? and he said what run away, I have not run away. I told him that I saw him run out of the lighter, and he denied it. His breath smelled intolerably strong of rum, I searched him, and found in his pocket eight spoils. I then put him on board my boat. On returning to the lighter, I found a spoil struck into a one hundred and ninety puncheon slightly, like a pen into an ink-stand; it appeared as if it had been put into the cask with the hand, and not hatcnered in; as near as I can possibly say, Williams ran from the spot, On getting back into the Shannon, I saw Butts and Gough standing in the head sheets of the lighter; they were enquiring what was the matter. I asked them were they watchmen of the lighter, and they replied, yes. I understood that one was the lighterman's watchman, and the other the excise watchman. I told them they knew better than I did, what was the matter. I suspected that the rums had been plundered, and I proceeded to search them; I found nothing on Gough; on Butts I found two sail needles, and some twine. I gave a look round the lighter; but saw nothing farther at that time. I then searched the different crfts along side the lighter; but found nothing. I was not satisfied, and returned to the Shannon again. On searching her further, I found two bladders of rum in her stern sheets, between her timbers. I examined puncheon one hundred and nine, and found it wet, and the two casks one hundred and five, and one hundred and twenty were also wet; they were wet from having been spoiled. Near the full bladders, I found two empty ones also, and with them a gimlet and crane; it is such as would be used for such a purpose. The bladders were tied with string, similar to what I found in Butts's pocket. I took Butts and Williams to the office. I left Gough to remain until I returned. Upon him, I found nothing, and he remained there until I returned. I told him I had left a person on the wharf, who would watch him if he did any thing. I had not done so, but I told him so to avoid his going away. The vessel was laying about one ships length from the shore; not so far off as the midstream.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HAMILTON, and ROBERT NICHOLS. Corroborated the account of last witness.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HURST. I am inspector of the Excise watch. On the morning of the 28th of February, in consequence of what had passed, I went on board the lighter, and found Gough and Brewer there. I went up to Gough, and asked him what he had been doing to let his charge be robbed, and he said, he knew nothing of it. I then said, were you asleep, and he said, no. I said were you in that place, and pointed to a kind of a cabin; he said, no. I then said, where were you then, and he said, there, pointing to some timbers on the fore part of the barge. I asked him if he was asleep there, and he said, he was not. I said if you were there, and not asleep, you must have been a party to the robbery, for in that place, he could have seen all over the barge, and all the casks. He then denied all knowledge of the transaction. I asked if he knew the men who were in custody, and he said, he knew nothing at all of them.</p>

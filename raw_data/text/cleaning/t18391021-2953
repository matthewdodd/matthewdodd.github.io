                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Dix Davey, and live in Elm-street, Walworth. On Friday, the 18th of October, I missed a copper from the wash-house—a pane of glass was taken out of the wash-house window, which would enable a hand to be put in to open the window, which fastened with a hook and eye—I missed some shoe-brushes, which were kept on the copper—it was all safe over night, and the window shut—I have since seen the copper in the possession of the policeman—it was compared with the place and fitted—I am satisfied it was our copper by a mark inside—I cannot swear the window was fastened over night, but I know it was closed about twelve o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 169.) I am not related to the prosecutor. On the 18th of October I was walking down Vauxhall-street, and met the prisoner with the copper under his arm—I asked him whose it was—he said his, and he was going to take it home to his house—I asked him to point out where—he could not, and then he said a man gave it to him—at the station-house he turned the back of an old shoe<lb></lb>brush out of his pocket, but it was not taken from him, and I do not know what has become of it—I fitted the copper to the premises, and it fits exactly.</p>

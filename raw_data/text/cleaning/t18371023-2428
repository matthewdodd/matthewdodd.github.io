                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Matthew Fillmer, a pawnbroker, living in Kent-place. I was putting the shop shutters up, on the 7th of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I had put up three, and was putting up the fourth when I heard a smash—I turned round, and saw the pane of glass next to me was broken—it was the sixth lower pane of glass next to the shutter I was putting up—a person could then put his hand in, and take any thing from the show-board—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running across the road—I ran after him—he ran down Townsend-street, opposite—I did not lose sight of him—I caught Lim about 300 yards off, and on coming up to him, caught hold of him by his collar—as was taking him back, a person who had hold of him on the other side, asked him what he did it for—he said he had not got any thing—on tak<lb></lb>ing him to my master's I searched him, and found on him a lady's gold neck-chain, a coral necklace, and one gold ear-ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the parish of St. George, Southwark, Surrey, and am a pawnbroker—the house belongs to me jointly with my brother—I am in partnership with him. On the evening of the 7th of Oc<lb></lb>tober I was called from the shop, and informed that a window had been broken, and property stolen—I immediately made the best of my way to the front, and after putting a few things from the edge of the window, the wit<lb></lb>ness brought the prisoner back—I saw the articles found on him—this other gold neck-chain was handed to the shop man by a person—the necklace is coral, and has a label attached to it—here is a guard-chain and an ear-ring, the fellow to which was found on the ground outside, in the street, with several other things—I can safely swear to all these articles being our pro<lb></lb>perty—there is a communication between the shop and the rest of the house—you can come into the shop from the house without going out of doors—I have a perfect recollection of seeing the large chain in the win<lb></lb>dow on Saturday morning when I passed the window</p>

            . I am an officer of Cripplegate. On Monday evening, the 22nd of March, about ten minutes to eight o'clock, I was standing in Milk-street, near the prosecutors' house - I heard a door shut, and the prisoner immediately ran by me very fast, with a bundle under his arm - it excited my suspicion; I followed him to Maidenlane, and there stopped him - he had this bundle under his arm; I asked him what was in it - he answered, Nothing; I said, "Yes, you have something there - where are you going with it?" - he said to his mother's; I asked where he brought it from; he said from

            , of Milk-street. The prisoner was never allowed to take silk out to dispose of and afterwards account for it; no such practice is allowed - he had been with us between a month and five weeks; we had his character from Mr. Bew, of Newgate-street - he had lived with him about two years; I am quite sure this silk is ours - the lowest value is 9l. 5s. 6d., according to the present price, which is a depression; we both occupy the house - Mr. Mills does not sleep there, but occupies it, and has a right to sleep there; we pay the rent out of the profits of the trade - he has occasionally slept there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How recently? A. Within the last six months - he has a room at his service whenever he likes to sleep there: we had a very satisfactory character with the prisoner - we never allow servants to take out silk to show their friends unless by permission; if he had taken this out and brought it back, we should have objected to cut it for him, if it was taken out without permission - our private mark, in our clerk's hand-writing, is on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he ever given you any intimation of his intention to take it out to show? A. Not the least; his wages were from 8l. to twelve guineas a year - silk is never taken out to show to friends by persons in our employ.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM HENMAN. Q. Did you know what circumstances Mary Cole was in? A. No - she had a silk gown on, but she said she knew nothing of this transaction, and never asked him to purchase a silk gown for her; I understand her to work in the brush trade - the prisoner's parents bear a good character, but appeared in indifferent circumstances.</p>

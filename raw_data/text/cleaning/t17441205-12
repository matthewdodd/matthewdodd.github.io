               <p>Mr. Malpas. On Friday last, the Prisoner brought a spoon to me, and offered to pledge it. I suspected him; and upon asking him various questions, I found it was not his property. I asked him whose it was. He said it was the property of his sister, and he would fetch her, which he did; but her account being but slender, I stopped the spoon, and had it cried. Mr. Rann said it was his spoon, and when the spoon was produced to the Prisoner, he owned the fact. <rs id="t17441205-12-verdict87" type="verdictDescription">

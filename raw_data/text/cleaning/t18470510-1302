                  </hi>. I am single, and live at St. John's-place, Walworth. On the 5th of April I went to the Surrey Theatre with some friends—I left about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, and went into the parlour of the Equestrian Tavern, by the side of the theatre—after a short time I and another person left the parlour, and passed to the bar—the prisoners were standing together at the bar, but whether in company I cannot say—when I got to the street-door two females and a man stood there—I asked them to make way for us to pass—as we passed Spignell threw a glass of beer at my friend, but it did not touch her—he made a rush at her after that—he put the glass down, and said to a woman who was with him, "Give me my key"—that woman held her head down—I was passing at the same time, and he made a rush at me as I passed—I said, "That man has stolen my brooch"—he ran out at the side-door—I gave an alarm, and ran after him—I crossed the road—Duckett caught hold of me, and asked me what I wanted with that man, what I was going to do with him—I said, "The man has stolen my brooch"—he said, "You are not going to give him in charge for the brooch?"—I said, "Certainly I am"—he said, "What do you want with him? what are you going to do with him?"—I said, "I shall give him in charge"—he then laid hold of me, and threw me between the edge of the pavement and the road—my brooch was safe on my breast when I left the parlour—I had that moment fastened it, and I felt Spignell's hand at my neck</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Gabitass, of Market-street—I was with the prosecutrix about twelve o'clock that night—I left the parlour of the tavern with her—in passing the bar I saw the prisoners—the proseuctrix asked one of the women to move to let us pass—Spignell took a glass with something in it from the counter and threw it—it went partly over me and partly over the bar—he said, "Take that," put the glass down again, made a rush at somebody who stood there, and, said, "Give me the keys, or I will knock your brains out"—he struck at the person—I got out of the way—I turned round to look after my friend, and Spignell had got his hand at her neck, where her brooch was—directly she got past them to the door she complained of her loss—Spignell ran across the London-road towards the Borough-road—I went out after the prosecutrix—I crossed, and thought she was with the policeman, but she was not—I went to look after her, and saw Duckett had got hold of her round the waist—he threw her down and ran towards the tavern again, and there the policeman took him—I had seen the brooch in my friend's shawl as we left the parlour to go out not two minutes before.</p>

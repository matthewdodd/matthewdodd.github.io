I was passing Mr. Young's shop, in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel, on the 27th of March, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner inside the counter, with hisflund in the till—he took something out, and passed it from his right hand to his left, and from the noise I supposed it was copper—I saw him put his hand in the till a second time—I went in, and he let what he had in his hand fall—I said, "What are you doing; robbing the till?"—he said, "I have just come in for a halfpennyworth of milk"—I took two penny pieces from his right hand, and two from his left—he said, "That three-pence halfpenny is mine"—I said there was fourpence—Miss Young found 61/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the corner of the till, where I had seen the prisoner drop the money.</p>

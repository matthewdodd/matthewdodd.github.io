            . I live in Fox and Knott-court, Cow-lane. I was standing at my door between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday evening, the 13th of October, and heard an altercation at the top of the court. I went up, and had not been there more than two or three minutes, when the prosecutor came up, and at that moment the prisoner and another made a sudden dart in among the people. I kept my eye on the prisoner, and while the prosecutor was speaking, I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief from his (the prosecutor's) pocket, and throw it to the person who rushed in with him. While the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182210230023"></xptr>was securing him, I picked it up. His companion was trying to shuffle it under his feet, to conceal it. He ran off as hard as he could. I gave the handkerchief to the officer.</p>

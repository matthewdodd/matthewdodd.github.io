               <p>Q. How came you to suspect him?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Because he went on faster than I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176202240015"></xptr> he could afford; and I went to an officer, and he told me he would mark me 2 s. in half-pence, and I carried them home to my wife, who put it in the till; and the shop door was locked in the morning, there was a quartern loaf missing, and 3 s. 5 d. gone out of the till; so I called the officer, and he and I went up into the lodger's room, and there we found a quartern loaf; and when I mentioned the loaf, the officer said he would swear to most of the half pence which lay in the chair under his window, and there lay the key also.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at this time? was he awake?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes, and in bed, with his breeches and stockings on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Asked him how he came to do so; and he made us no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door locked on the Sunday morning?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes, and I had the key; and this is the key that was found in the chair with the money, and opens the lock of my shop door as well as my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the key of his room?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time you let him the room?</p>
               <p>Scarrolt. For aught I know to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any marked money into your till?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. Yes, I put 15 d. in marked halfpence into my till, and 4 s. 9 d. of other, on the 6th of Feb.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom did you receive the marked halfpence?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. From my husband, and the next day there was 3 s. 5 d, missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon finding you were robbed of the marked money?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. My husband had a search warrant ready, and he went for the officer, and they went up to his room together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Scarrolt. No, nor sawer knew any thing that passed, till they went thro' my room below stairs to have him to prison.</p>

I am a headborough-man; and, upon application of the prosecutor, I marked 2 s. in halfpence; I marked some with a punch, and some with a file; and when I came to Mr. Scarrolt, by virtue of a search warrant, to search the prisoner's lodging, and told the prisoner my business, I immediately saw a good quantity of half-pence lying in the chair under the window, in the prisoner's room; and, upon looking them over, I found a great many of the half-pence I had marked. When I charged him with the fact, he said he had taken them for his wages. I said, that was his mistake. I then gave the money to Mr. Scarrolt, and we took him for that day to New Prison, and the next day before Sir

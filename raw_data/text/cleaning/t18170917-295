I asked several others who were there to return my watch; they said they had not got it - I gave the prisoner in charge; I am certain he is one of them. After we took him to the watch-house, the watch was brought by one of the others to induce me to let him go. After he was taken into custody, he told Blackburn that if we would let him go he would fetch the watch. He went into the tap-room and said, "Jack, return the watch" - He did not.</p>

            . I am a milkman. I was on Saffron-hill between four and five o'clock, and saw the prosecutor turn from a print-shop. I saw five young men come by; they ran against him, and took the watch out of his pocket. He went on - I called after him, he came back. I told him they were gone down the hill, I went on with my milk. When I returned, in Bleeding-heart-yard, I saw them taking the prisoner, and told them I did not think he was one of them. I do not mean to say that he was not one of them.</p>

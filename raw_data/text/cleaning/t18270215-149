On the 18th of January, the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to my room in Coleman-court, Bunhill-row. I had been out of work some weeks; he said he wanted a mate, with a good saw, to go with him to a four months job - I asked about the job; he said they were good three-feet logs - I said I had no saw that would cut them, but could borrow one - I gave him money to get a pint of beer, while I had my breakfast, and got the saw; we then went on to Bow-church; he went into a public-house there, where he said he was known, and said "Leave the saw here, and step with me;" he took me down a turning, and told me to wait while he went into a house and got his things - I waited some time - he did not return - I went down the court, and found it lead into the street again; I ran to the public-house for the saw; they said the man who left it had taken it away; I went to Old Ford, where he said the job was; but there was no job there; he was taken a few days after.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th April I was at the Victoria Theatre—after I came out I went into a coffee-shop in the New-cut, and saw Seymour and the witness Melbourn—Seymour asked where I was going—I said, "Home"—she said, "Shall I go with you?"—I said I did not want her—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060122"></xptr>
               <p>she said, "Oh come along with me"—she said she was cold, and had some gin and peppermint, and then some coffee—I treated her—as we were going out of the house she said she did not want me for a minute—she went out and came in again, and then I accompanied her to 49, White Horse-street, New-cut—when she got in she sat down in a chair and said, "I want 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of you"—I said, "What for?" she said, "For showing you where I live"—I took my cap off the table and said, "I am going home;" and as soon as I had said that the prisoner Wake ran out from underneath the bed, took the poker out of the fender, and swore he would dash my brains out if I did not give the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—another girl came into the room, and she took and fumbled my pockets—the prisoners were holding me at the time, and threatening me, and pushing me about—they made me pull off my waistcoat, and the girl that is away took off my neckerchief—the prisoner was hitting me in the chest—as soon as they had taken my things away I went out of the house—they followed me down-stairs, and went down a street just before you come to the house, and I went after a policeman—I found one in the Waterloo-road, and he returned with me to the house—I lost my waistcoat, handkerchief, cap, tobacco-box, and pipe—the girl that is away, took a knife out of my watch-pocket, and Wake my tobacco-box and pipe—Seymour did not take anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I was near the Victoria Theatre on 15th April, and saw the prosecutor come out of the coffee-shop with Seymour—she asked me if she might take him to my room—I said, "Yes," but I did not know that this was going to occur—I went up-stairs with them—I did not know that Wake was in my room at that time—I came down and stood at the street-door; and shortly after, hearing a disturbance, I went up to see what was the matter, and found Wake holding the prosecutor by the collar of his jacket, and Seymour had got her hand in his pocket—there was no one else there—I saw Wake take a meerchaum-pipe from his pocket—I had seen Wake about half an hour before in the Waterloo-road—I did not see him with the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I am not aware that he was in the coffee-shop.</p>

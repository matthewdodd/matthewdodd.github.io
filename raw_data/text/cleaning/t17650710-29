            . After my meat was taken away from a cool place where I had hung it to keep, in the night, on the 5th of last month, I found some of the fat of the mutton near the door where the prisoners lodged; and after the boys were in custody, I put Laurence's foot into the print of a foot in the mould in my garden, and it fitted exactly. He then said he would tell me where my meat was. He took me over the Ruins of St. Giles's, and went up into an old uninhabited house; there was my meat under the roof of the house: he gave an account that Fluty and Williams were concerned. I took them both up. When before Justice Welch, the Justice would not admit him an evidence, but admitted Williams, who is very young.</p>

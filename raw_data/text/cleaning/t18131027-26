            . The prisoner was in the employ of our house. I missed fourteen or fifteen dozen of knives and forks. These are some of the knives and forks; they are part of my husband's property. They are new; they have never been used. They were bought for a public breakfast. They were deposited in the prisoner's care. I gave him a lock and key to take care of them. They were all in the care of the prisoner. The prisoner was many years in my service, and he lived in my service during that time.</p>

            . I know the knives and forks to have been in my custody. I bought the knives and forks for the Queen's breakfast at Egham races. I missed fourteen or fifteen dozen of knives. I asked the prisoner what had become of them. He said he knew nothing of them at first; afterwards he said he had them at my father's sale. He said, many things went away at the same time; he thought he might as well have them as any body else. I bought them myself of Mr. Rogers, at Eton, August 25th, 1811. The sale was in the year 1809. He lived in my service between eight and ten years.</p>

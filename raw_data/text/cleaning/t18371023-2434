               <p>22nd of October, I saw the prisoners High-street, Newington—Green-wood was riding a mare—the other prisoner was walking on the footpath close by, dressed in a smock-frock—it was a dark-grey mare which has since been claimed by the prosecutor—the prisoners were in company—I stopped Green ward and asked Where he came from—he said, "From the White Hart Inn, Lewes, in Sussex"—I asked him what time he started from Lewes—he said at half-past five o'clock in the morning—it was then twenty minutes after ten o'clock—I told him he had, made more haste than a four-horse coach could come—he said he had led the horse part of the way and rode it the other part, and was going to take it to Thetford, had employed him—Bird had got on a little way—I called him, and said, "What part have you come from with this mare?—he said, "From Godstone"—I then took them both into custody on suspicion of stealing the mare, as their stones did not agree—the mare did not appear at all exhausted—when I went to take a description of Bird's person, Greenwood came out and when he was going back to be locked up, he said he wished to speak to me, that he wanted to tell me all about it—I said what he told me would be given in evidence before the Magistrate—he said, at half-past five o'clock in the morning he stood by while Bird went into the field and took the mare out of the field of Colonel Campbell, at Bletchingly, in Surrey</p>

            . I live at No. 44, Princes-street, Leicester-square, and am a wholesale confectioner. I do not know the prisoner; I had a William Smith in my employ, but he had left me six weeks or two months before that - this order was not sent by my authority; I use Italian juice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050057"></xptr>to manufacture into fine juice, but I never had so small a quantity as - cwt. - I have seen Mr. Smith write; I should say this note is not his writing - it has not the least appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not write it; I was merely given it as a porter, by a man, to go and receive the goods- I was not aware of the crime; it was not my intention to defraud the party - I did not know whether it was right or wrong; I gave the goods to the man - I know nothing of him.</p>

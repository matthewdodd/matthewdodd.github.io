                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, at 39, High-street, Islington. On 23rd Feb. the prisoner came to my shop for some goods, and looked out a quantity—he then said he wanted me to make him some tin saucepans, with copper bottoms; but before that he said he supposed I should want a refer<lb></lb>ence—I said, "No." what he had looked out I expected he would pay for—he</p>

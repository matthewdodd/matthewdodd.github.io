             (Police-constable H 38). I was on duty in Essex-street about a quarter past nine o'clock- I saw the prosecutor there with only his drawers, shoes, stockings, and shirt on; he said he had been robbed in that house - I knocked at the door, and in a few minutes they opened it - both the prisoners were there; the prosecutor said the woman was one who had been in the room - he refused to go to the station till he got his clothes, but he afterwards went, and I took both the prisoners - I found none of the clothes; they denied that the prosecutor was there at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there another Policeman with you? A. Yes; but he went away, because the prosecutor would not substantiate the charge - he gave the woman in charge; but I took them both, for he said the man was there, and he had thrown him out of the room - he said two men had taken him into the room; he seemed in a very queer way; I do not know whether he was drunk, or any thing had been given to him - he was very drowsy.</p>

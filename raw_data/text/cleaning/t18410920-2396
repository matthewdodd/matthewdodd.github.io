On the 30th of August, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner about the garden-gate of No. 39, Vincent-square, in company with another lad—he went in at the gate—I waited, and they came out in about ten minutes—I saw the prisoner put his hands to his trowsers' pockets—I said I wanted to speak to him—he immediately ran off—I pursued and took him back to the garden, searched him, and found the whole of the plate now produced on him—the only remark he made was, that I did not see him get in—the house is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Hedge, of No. 30, Vincent-square, in the parish of St. John the Evangelist. This plate belongs to him—I had seen it safe half an hour before, in a drawer in the store-room, which is even with the hall—I had left the window a little open to admit the air-nobody could get in without further raising the sash—I found it quite up to the top when the prisoner was taken.</p>

               <p>(Stephen Cockrell, of Chapel-street, Westminster, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

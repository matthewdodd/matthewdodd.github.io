                  </hi>. I was on a visit at Meadow-croft. On the afternoon of Wednesday, between five and six o'clock, the 11th of August, I met the prisoner near Mr. Abbott's—I here was a boy near him but not immediately by him—I noticed that the prisoner dropped two spoons, and took them up again—in consequence of what I observed, I went in the same direction as he went, and afterwards met him with the same lad—I asked the prisoner if I had not seen him just now at Mea-dow-croft—he said, "No," and I suffered him to go on then—and after going a few paces, he started off across the field, making a motion to the boy to run too—I hey ran in parallel lines, but one <hi rend="italic">diverging</hi> from the other—I was alone—I met a painter, who joined me, and we saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in a hedge—I had not lost sight of him till I found him in the hedge—he was crouching down—after I came up, I was on one side of the hedge and the painter on the other, and he started up from the hedge and ran in a different direction, and I saw the painter scuffling with him—I afterwards pointed out the spot where he had been crouching down, to the officer.</p>

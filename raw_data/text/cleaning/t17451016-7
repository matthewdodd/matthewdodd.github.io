I asked what there was to pay, and this porter [Henwood] said 12 s. and 2 d. for bringing them out of the country; but there was some other charges for bringing them there. Said Howell ; why don't you tell her what it is? and Henwood said it was 14 s. 2 d. I went up for a guinea, and when I came down I offered it to Henwood to get it changed.</p>

               <p>Cooke. He snatched it out of my fingers, and run away with it; he staid a great while: said I, I believe the man is drowned with the money; said the men to me, do you know the man? No, said I, I thought he belonged to you: said they, he was on the outside of the door, and we thought he belonged to the house. We asked him whether this was my Lord

He asked what parcels we had for my Lord; I said three; and he knocked at the door, and we carried the things in. The gentlewoman asked what they came to, I said 12 s. 2 d. and then I said it was more: the Prisoner said, why don't you say all at once; then I said it was 14 s. 2 d. She went and fetched down a guinea; it was a Queen Anne's guinea with the head uppermost, and bid me change it, and the Prisoner snatched the guinea out of her hand, and said he would go and change it, and run away with it.</p>

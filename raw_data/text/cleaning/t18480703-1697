                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 160.) I know the Blakeney's Head—the tap-room is frequented by thieves and prostitutes, and has been for some time—on Friday night, 23rd June, I saw the prisoner Buck about ten o'clock—he came out of the City of Carlisle, in Royal Mint-street, which was formerly called Rosemary-lane—I saw him again about a quarter-past twelve, in Royal Mint-street, in company with others—he was not on a bench, he was in the open street—I did not see him from that time till I saw him here.</p>

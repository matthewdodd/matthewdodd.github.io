               <p>Q. How do you know this she-ass? - A. She has got a particular mark upon her rump; a long stroke almost like an I, burnt in her; it was put on before I bought her last Christmas; and I knew her by some white spots upon her thigh.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners? - A. I know them very well; I was with my master, Mr. Griffiths, when he bought this ass of them; I am bailiff to him; it was in the Easter week; he was to give two guineas for her in ten days; he mistrusted that she was stole, and so he gave them nothing at the time that she was delivered to my master, and she was owned in five or six days after my master bought her, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the men that sold her? - A. Yes, they were both together; they both said they swopped two jack-asses away for her.</p>
               <p>Vale. I and Aldey took the prisoners in the parish of Aldersham; one of them (Miles) ran away; squire Griffiths promised to stop them when they came for the money, but he did not.</p>
               <p> Lipscombe. They did not come for the money at all.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of March, about half-past two o'clock, I was in Piccadilly, and saw the prisoner attempting several people's pockets; I saw them close on the prisoner - Clapham took something from his pocket; I seized him, and he dropped it immediately - Brown had covered him; I had followed them from Gray's-Inn-lane with the procession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you saw Brown touch any pocket? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Thompson and saw the prisoners together - Clapham tried several gentlemen's pockets; the prisoner covered him - they were in company together; as the prosecutor came along they closed upon him - Clapham took the handkerchief and was handing it to the prisoner, we took them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Brown touched it at all? A. No; I have made enquiry about him, he is not known to the officers at all.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

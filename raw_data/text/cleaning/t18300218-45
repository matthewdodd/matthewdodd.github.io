               <p>MR. CRESWELL conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. I am constable of Hackney. On the morning of the 20th of January I was coming out of a gravel-pit, where I had been employing some men to clear the snow away; I saw Field with a flag basket on his shoulder - I went and asked what he had got; he said what was that to me; I took the basket down, and took him to the watch-house - I found in the basket two parcels of nails and some gimblets, and this saw was in his left-hand pocket; while we were in the watch-house Hensey came in with a sack; this bag was round Field, fastened with a gimblet. I took Hagger, I think, in about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who is Hensey? A. A man who was at work with me that morning; he is on the parish - this was about nine o'clock - when I saw Field he was alone; I had been after Hagger every night for about a fortnight - I might have seen him in the course of that time fifty times, or I might not see him at all; I will not swear that I did not see him a dozen times, but not to my knowledge; I at last found him in Charles-street, Dalston - I cannot recollect exactly the day; it was the latter end of January, or the beginning of February - it was about two o'clock; there are six little white houses, and the one I found him in was the last but one; I do not think it has any number; no one was with me at the moment I took him - Hensey was not the person who gave me the information: I had been in company with several officers during the fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any person with you when you took Field? A. All the men were coming out of the gate at the time - I knew Field.</p>
               <p>JOHN HENSEY. I am a ground-workman. On the 12th or 13th of January. I think it was, I saw both the prisoners - Brown took Field into custody; I was a distance off, and saw Hagger come round a corner, and as he turned he saw Field in custody - he dropped this bag near Mr. Burgiss' ground, and ran away towards Walthamstow - I took the bag to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you work for now? A. Mr. Gardiner, opposite the Peacock, at Hackney; I have seen both the prisoners four or five times before - Field was by himself when Brown took him; if Hagger had kept the bag on his shoulder he might have passed me without my noticing him - I never spoke to him before in my life, to my knowledge; I have spoken with him since- he said before the Magistrate that I asked him to give me 5s., but I can take an oath against it, for I had two witnesses with me when I was talking with him, three nights after the robbery; the reason I did not take him was, because I have children of my own, and did not like to have any thing to do with it; I told him he had better get out of the way, for if any thing happened I should have to come against him - this conversation took place at the White Hart, Horusey: I knew him when he was ostler at Stoke Newington - I had seen him as I passed, feeding the horses; I might have seen him twenty times, but I never drank with him - I had seen him at the White Hart, and thought that a likely place to find him, but I did not appoint to meet him there; a man named Mills was there - he lives in Union-street, Stoke Newington, and was formerly a bricklayer's labourer; I do not know what he is now - he had been at work with me the day I saw Hagger drop the bag; upon my oath I did not go with a view to get money out of him, but to tell him to keep out of the way.</p>

            . I do not know the day of the month, but one Tuesday night, when it snowed very fast, my master's premises were all safe, and on the follow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180029"></xptr>ing morning I missed these articles from the tool-house; these are my master's, and these tools are mine - I had seen them safe that afternoon, and locked the tool-house up in the evening; between six and seven o'clock the next morning I found the lock broken open - the tool-house is about ten yards from the house door; we lost a spade besides - there were more articles taken than one man could carry; Field had worked for us some time before - I know nothing of the other.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. I was going along the Lea-bridge-road, and met a man, who asked me to carry the things for him; I went on with them to Water-lane - Brown stopped me, and asked what I had got; I told him I had the things to carry for the man - I turned, and the man was gone; I know nothing of Hagger.</p>

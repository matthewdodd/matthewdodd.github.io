               <p>of 28th May, I went to bed—I was the last person up—the house was then fast—at a quarter before four next morning I was called by the policeman—the street-door was open and the kitchen window, which I had seen fast at half-past ten at night, was wide open—it had been lifted up with violence from the outside—I missed thirteen yards of woollen cloth, fourteen yards of waistcoating, some doeskin, and twenty-four handkerchiefs—I have seen some cloth since which I believe is a portion of it—I cannot swear to it.</p>

About two o'clock in the morning of 29th May, I was in Cambridge-road, on duty—I saw the prisoner on the foot-path—he had this piece of cloth under his coat, buttoned up—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, a piece of cloth he had found in Shoreditch on the foot-path, and he lived in Worship-street—I asked where he was going—he said, to have a walk—I said, it was strange he should come for a walk at that time, and he said he could not get in—he said, a man saw him pick this cloth up, and he asked him if it was his, and there was a female near, and he asked her if it was hers, and she said, "No"—he was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's.</p>

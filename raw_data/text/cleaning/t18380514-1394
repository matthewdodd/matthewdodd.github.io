                  </hi>. I am blind, and carry on the business of a cattle-dealer at Battersea. I had this filly nine months, and was well acquainted with it from frequently touching it—I had other cattle, and could distin<lb></lb>guish it from the rest by the feel—it had a large wart on the chest, and smaller ears than is usual for a horse, and three warts on the styfol—it was rather ragged in the coat—it had been turned out on the common, and cattle turned out in the winter are rough in the coat—it was four years old—I turned it out on Clapham-common on Good Friday—it was bought eleven months ago for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for it—in consequence of information on Tuesday, the 17th of April, I went to Wallace, a horse-seller, of Wands worth—Bickerstaff and Belcher went with me—a skin was produced to me there—I took it up in my hand, and by feeling it over there was the wart on the chest, and the others on the thick part of the thigh, called the styfol—I had no doubt at all that it was the skin of my filly.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at a lucifer-factory. I know Prior—I was in the habit of driving his filly from the common and back again every afternoon—I saw it on Good Friday, about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the common—I was in company with Prior on the common at that time—on Tuesday, the 17th, I went with him and Belcher to Wallace, saw the skin produced, and examined it—I thought it was the skin of his horse—that is my belief—it corresponded in all respects—it had one large wart on the chest, and so had the skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-slaughterer, and live in Garret-lane, Wandsworth. On the Saturday after the Good-Friday the prisoner came to dispose of a piebald filly—it was in a dreadful state—I gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he</p>

               <p>asked 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—it was in a very rough state—it was not much of a bargain—I afterwards produced the skin to Prior, Belcher, and Bickes staff—it was the skin of the filly the prisoner brought to me—I asked him where he brought it from—he said he brought it from Paragon-building Clapham—that it was a young one, four years old, and that he bought it from a widow woman—I heard something afterwards, and gave information to the police.</p>

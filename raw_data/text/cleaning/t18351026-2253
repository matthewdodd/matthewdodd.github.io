                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. John Batt, a salesman, in Smithfield. The prisoner was in our employ so far as to attend to business on the two market-days, in Smithfield—he had his victuals at our house sometimes—it was his duty, when he received money, to take it to Mr. Biggerstaff—he has not accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Foster and Batt.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to live with Mr. Batt—I received no wages—I then left him for two or three years; and after he was taken ill, I went and took his business in hand—things were very bad, as Mr. Big<lb></lb>gerstaff knows well, and I believe they are so now—Mr. Batt, being of a bad state of mind, said he was being starved—I was obliged to get him a home and cart, and whatever he wanted—he looked to me for every thing; and the distressed state they were in, obliged me to do as I did—when I found I could not go on any farther, I was obliged to leave Smithfield entirely—I came to a conclusion to set up for myself; and after three market-days I was taken—Mrs. Foster has not for a long time paid any expenses of the business.</p>

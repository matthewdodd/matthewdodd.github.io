               <p>and two halfpence, and a farthing, on the counter—the copper was not enough to pay for the gin, which was twopence—he took the sixpence and copper up off the counter, and gave me a bed half-crown—I called to my uncle and gave it to him, and told him he had given me a good half-crown at first, and now he had given me a bad one—he afterwards paid me for the gin with a penny-piece and two halfpence—I gave the bad half-crown to my uncle—he did not give it back to the prisoner.</p>

I was standing near Hunter when she served the prisoner with the gin—I observed what took place—she gave me a half-crown to look at—I found it was a bad one—I went round the counter and stopped the prisoner—she said, "This person has first given me a good half-crown, and has now given me a bad one"—I charged him with having passed bad money?"—he wanted to go out, and said, "You do not suspect me of passing bad money?"—I closed the door, and said, "If you will show me the good half-crown you showed the girl at first, you shall go out"—he said he had got nothing but the half-crown she had given me—I sent for a policeman—while my friend was gone for him the prisoner showed me the good half-crown in the palm of his right hand—he was then taken into custody—just as the officer was coming in he turned his back to me, and put something into his mouth—he put his hand up to his mouth, and appeared to have great difficulty to get something down his throat—what it was I did not see—I gave the bad half-crown to the officer.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. James Ricon Oliver and his partners; they carry on business in Alderman-bury. On the 4th of May I had a number of packages to take in the cart to the <placeName id="t18330516-101-crimeloc523">Horse and Groom-yard, St. John-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know the prisoner before. A. No, Sir - I did not see a woman near my van - I know Jerusalem-passage, but I don't know of any green-grocer's shop there - there was a tall man standing by my van when I left.</p>

            . I keep the Horse and Groom-inn. I heard of the loss of this package; I went out instantly down the Woodbridge estate - I saw the prisoner carrying this package, I asked him politely if he would walk back with me into St. John-street; he said no, that he was employed to carry it by a man - he then threw it down, and said I am d-d if I carry it any further - I collared him, and he struggled with me; I was a minute or more before I could get him to come back with me; he then said I was a hard-hearted young man, and he wished me to let him go - I brought him back, and gave him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not seize him by the throat? A. No - I did not tell him it was stolen at first, but I asked him to turn back - I had not seen a tall man about the van; I could not, as I was in the warehouse - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160058"></xptr>held the prisoner tight, and might have got my knuckles into his neck - I did not hear him say that a woman had seen it given to him, he said he was going to Percival-street with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not throw it down till he took hold of my collar and tore my shirt - I said you are not the young man that hired me to carry it; he said "You come back with me," I said I did not know why I should - I had been hired by a tall young man to carry it to Percival-street - I am a porter in the City.</p>

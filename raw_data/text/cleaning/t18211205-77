             - this lead pipe was fixed by two lead straps, to the pales in the yard, to serve the water-butt, there was a brass cock to it. On the 17th of November, at nine o'clock, I found it wrenched off, and in consequence of information, I took Tubbs, Judson, and Ball, in custody, and from what Ball told me I took Tubbs to Reynolds's, and asked him, in Reynold's presence, if he had sold a lead pipe, brass cock, and boss there, both him and Reynolds denied it. I went again at five o'clock, with Ball, who said to Reynolds "I and two others sold you the lead which was melted down in an iron pot, and it weighed 10 lbs., and you gave us 1 s. for it, and 5 d. for the cock and boss;" he said he could not deny it, if he had bought it of them, it was gone, for a cart came every other day and took away all his goods; there was six feet of pipe stolen, worth two pence halfpenny a pound, as old lead - the cock was sound and cost 7 s. five years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What are you - A. A carpenter. I know the value of lead, I have exchanged it for new, reckoning it at twopence half-penny a pound. Reynolds said he dare say he did buy it, I asked if he bought the cock and boss with the pipe, his wife said they did buy it in that way, not joined together.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-row, New-road, the prisoners live at Chelsea. On the 12th of November, about six o'clock at night, I was with them, we got over the paling of No. 1, Chapel-street, Tubbs proposed it; we broke off the lead pipe with the cock at the end, took it to Tubbs's house, and melted it in an iron pot; his father is a carpenter. We then took it to Reynolds, which is a quarter of a mile off; Tubbs carried it on his shoulder in a basket, he took it in, and said "Mr. Reynolds, will you buy this lead," Reynolds weighed it, and said it was 10 lbs., and gave us 1 s. for it. He then weighed the cock, and gave us 5 d. for that; we came away and divided the money. I was taken up, and told if I spoke the truth, I should be saved.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you all go into the shop - A. No, only Tubbs and I went in, Reynolds was in the shop when we first went in - I am fourteen years old, and was never in trouble before.</p>

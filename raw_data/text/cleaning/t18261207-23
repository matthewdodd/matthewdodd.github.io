               <p>AMELIA MATTHEWS. I am a <rs id="t18261207-23-viclabel134" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18261207-23-victim234 t18261207-23-viclabel134"></join>. I had just left my situation in Duncan-place, Leicester-square - I went to lodge at Mr. Rochester's on the 13th of October, and did not know either of the prisoners before that; Barrett lodged there, and I put my trunk into her room, it contained the articles stated in the indictment - it was not locked; I did not know her before, but my fellow-servant had recommended me to lodge there; I would not have taken 50l. for my property. I went there on the 13th, but did not miss all the property till the 16th. O'Bryan was there on the 13th, when I went in; she was also there on the 14th and 15th. On Monday night, the 16th, I gave charge of Barrett - she was searched at the watch-house, but nothing was found on her; I was taking her gown off her on Sunday night, in her own room, and a duplicate of some of my property dropped from her. On the 17th I saw the officer find a silk handkerchief, locked up in her box, and my gold ear-rings were found on the mantelpiece. I saw O'Bryan on Sunday night, in St. Martin's-lane, opposite Chandos-street, with my bonnet and whittle on; the whittle was taken from the box, but not the bonnet; I found a brooch in her pocket when she was searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not very intimate with them? A. No; I never gave them any thing to pawn; a man named Basterfield came to visit me there; I represented him as my brother, but he was not so, and that Barrett knew; I did not wish every one to be as wise as myself; no other man visited me till after I lost my property - then my fellow-servant came; I was never intoxicated; I did not have warning to leave the house. A watch was found at a pawnbroker's, which I claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a lady come forward, and swear it was her watch, and that she had sent her son to pawn it? A. Yes; I could not give the number of it, and Mr. Halls, the Magistrate asked me to open it, but I was not able to do so, being flurried. I told him I had opened it but twice; I did nearly open it, but I was all in a tremble - it was given to the lady, because she gave the number, and I could not- she appeared like a poor, working woman; I had bought it three years ago, at a watchmaker's at Charing-cross - I do not know his name; Mr. Rigby now lives at the shop - I gave 10l. for it - I was house-maid at an hotel in Spring-gardens at that time. I never wound it up, for I was not in the habit of using it; I bought it because I was going out one Sunday, and wished to be back to my time - I did not wind it up after I first had it - my mistress has seen me with it, and offered to come, but the Magistrate did not wish to see her, as she could not identify it; I described the inside works to Mr. Halls, but there were three of the boy's friends to swear against me - Mr. Halls told me to bring somebody else to identify it, but the family I lived with are gone to Spain - the boy had been stopped when he offered it in pawn, and the mother swore it was hers, and she had sent him to pawn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said you had no charge to make against Barrett, calling her the little b-b? A. Never, nor did I ever use such words; I know Mary Brian by sight; I never told her I had nothing to allege against Barrett - I gave an alarm in the house on the 16th, that I had lost my property - Barrett was taken that day in her own room, and O'Bryan on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you lose from your trunk a watch worth 6l.? A. Yes, and all the other articles stated in the indictment. I never allowed either of them to take the things to pawn them, or to wear them - they were quite strangers - I believe the watch now to be mine, and it had a key like mine to it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the prosecutrix swear to the watch at Bow-street? A. She swore to the best of her belief. The woman who claimed it appeared like a hard-working woman; she was dressed like a servant: I have no doubt but the boy gave her the number of the watch - Mr. Halls gave it to her after some hesitation.</p>

            . I am the officer. The Magistrate sent me on Tuesday to search Barrett's lodging, and in her box I found a silk handkerchief, which the prosecutrix<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070020"></xptr>claims, and half a sovereign - I found a pair of gold earrings in a goblet on the mantel-piece; I was informed of the watch being stopped at Queen-square, and I took her there; she described it to Pople, who had it in his possession - the boys who had offered it in pawn were remanded until Saturday, and then sent to Bow-street - the watch was brought there, and she described to the Magistrate the mark of a snake inside the cap, which the woman could not do - she also knew the key, and the string attached to it; she described it before she saw it, but she did not know the number; the number was on the face - it appeared to be a poor tradesman's wife who claimed it. When I apprehended O'Bryan, I found on her the gold setting of a cornelian brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before Mr. Halls? A. Yes; she told him of the mark inside the watch, and she opened the glass cover, but could not open the inner case- I believe the watch now to be hers.</p>
               <p>AMELIA MATTHEWS. I believe the setting of this brooch to be mine - the handkerchief, gown, and shift, are mine; also this silk dress; here is the gown I took off Barrett's back.</p>
               <p>BARRATT's Defence. She told me she had only two shifts, but she had stolen a pair of sheets from her mistress to make herself some - she asked me to cook a dinner on Sunday for some friends of hers, and told me to put her gown on, that I might not stain my own - she borrowed my lace frill, as she was going to meet a gentleman in the Park, and lent me her handkerchief instead; she gave me the ear-rings.</p>
               <p>O'BRYAN's Defence. A woman who works with me at Millbank trod on this brooch, and bent it; she gave it to me - I went to this house on Sunday, and Barrett told me to put on this shawl and old bonnet, as I was going to Chandos-street; I did not like it, but she said it made no difference; I returned, and gave them to her.</p>

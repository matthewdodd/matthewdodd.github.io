            , Esq; When I went out of town my books were safe, on Thursday the 28th of July; after I was gone I received a letter, informing me a man was detected in stealing my books; I came to town this day se'nnight, then I missed the books laid in the indictment, from out of my chambers (he produced a letter wrote by the prisoner, whose hand-writing he knew exceeding well; it was read, wherein he acknowledged the taking the said books, and had pledged them to three different pawnbrokers, and begs mercy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>James Brooks I live in the Strand (eight volumes of Swift's works, and seven volumes of Collins's Peerage of England, produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor;) the prisoner brought Swift's works on Saturday the 6th of August, and pledged them for half a guinea; and on Monday the 8th he brought Collins's Peerage; I questioned him how he came by them, he did not give me a satisfactory account, but after a good deal of talk he permitted me to go with him to what he called his chambers in the Temple; he with a key opened the door, I saw over the door the name Tindal; upon that I said to him, you gave me a different name than this; his answer was, that the gentleman who lived there before he had the chambers was of that name; he farther intreated me to go in and be satisfied, but I told him I was quite satisfied they were not his chambers; I went down stairs, and at the bottom of the stairs is a periwig maker's shop; I went in there, and enquired if Mr. Tindal had chambers there; the person told me he had, and that he believed he was then at Bristol; I went immediately home, and by that time the prisoner was got to my shop, I taxed him very closely with stealing the books; upon that he opened the door, and out he ran; I jumped over the counter, and ran after him, and brought him back, and had him before Sir

I went with my daughter to the terminus of the Northern and Eastern Rail<lb></lb>way, on the 6th of March, about half-part three o'clock in the afternoon, to go to Waltham—we got into a first class carriage—there were three persons opposite me—I knew them all—the prisoner came and took a seat on my right side, between me and my daughter—I had a purse in my right pocket—the other three seats were taken—the train stopped at Stratford, and the pri<lb></lb>soner hastened out, opening the door himself, and left it open—something was said by the Company's officer—I looked and found my petticoat and pocket were cut, and my purse gone—there were three sovereigns and a half sovereign, eight shillings, and a threepenny-piece in it—neither of the persons opposite leaned towards me—it was impossible that they could have cut my pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner attempting several pockets; he went up to the prosecutor put his right hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and took this handkerchief out - he then put in his left hand; I touched the prosecutor, and went to seize the prisoner's hand; he pulled it away: I collared him, and he threw the handkerchief down - I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said at the first examination that he took it out of my hand, and at the second that he took it off the ground; he says there was a crowd, and how could he see me take it; I was remanded.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIRTON. I did not say I took it from his hand; he was remanded to bring people to his character, but he brought none.</p>

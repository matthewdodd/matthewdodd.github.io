On the same evening, of the day we miss'd them, a slop-seller, that lives at the corner of St. Mary hill, came and told us: we did not miss them till, I think, it was the 23rd of December, when we had word from Gravesend there were two parcels deficient: the gentleman told us, he had seen our hedding at Mr. Godsby's, Church-lane, Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Todd. They were: on the Monday morning I went to the house of Mr. Godsby; there I found the bedding; it had been opened, and part of the things taken out: I found there two beds, two pillows, two coverlids, and two hammocks. The man at the bar was taken up either the Saturday or Sunday before: I went to him in custody; he had a flannel waistcoat, a check skirt, and a pair of canvas trowsers on, part of the things that were in the parcels for the East India soldiers: he first of all said he bought them in Rosemary-lane; afterwards he said they were taken out of the bundles that were at

He also confessed, one Wilkins, and two women, were concerned in taking them; and that the woman at the bar took some of them from Godsby's, and went to sell them in Rosemary-lane. When she was taken up, and before the justice, she denied it at first; but at last, she confessed she had sold a jacket to Mr. Brockholt, in Rosemary-lane; and a flannel waistcoat, and two pair of yarn stockings, to Mrs. Dennison, in the Lane. I got a search warrant, and she went with us there, where we found them.</p>

               <p>Court. You are greatly to blame: you should take care never to buy new things of people you don't know; it is such as you that give encouragement to such sort of people: you may think yourself well off, that you do not stand in the prisoner's place.</p>
               <p>Langham's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met Murphy with these two bundles on his back; he asked me to carry them, which I did, half way up Rosemary-lane: then he took and carried them to Godsby's cellar; then we went and had a pint of beer together: the next morning, I went again to the cellar, when the things were all cut open, and some things gone out of the bundle; I do not know where they were stolen from. After that, I was taken upon Saltpetre-bank, and committed to prison: I could not find my own things, and there were these, so I took them instead of my own: they are not half the value of mine.</p>

               <p>This young man wanted me to sell two or three of these things; I did not sell them; it was an acquaintance of his that sold them. When they took me up, I told them where the things were, as I went along with her; but she carried them, and I never took a halfpenny of the money.</p>

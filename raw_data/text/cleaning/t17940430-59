               <p>Q. Had your watch any seals to it? - Yes, a metal seal, metal cases, a plush steel chain, the seal was red, with hope engraved on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen this watch? - When I came out of my friend's house I looked to see what it was o'clock, and I put it in my left handwaistcoat pocket. I discovered it again, so far again as to know where it was pawned, by distributing hand-bills in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that woman before? - Not before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in her company? - I suppose about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any lamps thereabouts? - We were between two lamps talking in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that is the woman? - I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her again after that night? - It was about twelve o'clock, after I had been to Mr. Edwards's, the pawnbroker, I saw her coming from a passage by the door of Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the passage where you had been with her? - No, it was in Portpool-lane, they call it Tash-court.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened? - I told her she had stole my watch; she denied it, she said she had never seen me before in her life.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Where did you keep this watch? - In my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always keep it in your waistcoat pocket? - No, not always.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your waistcoat that very night? - I am very certain that after I had looked at it about one o'clock, I put it in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not put it in your waistcoat pocket in the house, but after you left the house? - It was after I left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the woman? - It was before I saw the woman, I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear before that when you saw your watch the last time, it was in the house where you left your friends? - It might be in the door; It was about the time I was leaving the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then before that it was in your fob? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put it into your waistcoat pocket? - I used to do it at night because I thought it was much faster of a night, because I buttoned my coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive it go from you at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not the least idea of its going? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that this account is the true account of it? - It is as exactly as I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it ever dropped out of your breeches pocket? - I am very certain that when I went into her company I had the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that it could not drop out of your breeches pocket? - I cannot take on myself to swear it could not drop out of my breeches pocket, it could not drop out of my waistcoat pocket unless it had been taken.</p>

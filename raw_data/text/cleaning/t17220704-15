             depos'd, that seeing the prisoner, (whom he had some knowledge of) go along with a Bundle of Cloths, he followed, and stopt him.

But in his Defence at the Bar, he said, he saw'em lying at a Door, and took'em up with an intent to advertize'em next Day; but being stopt, he was disappointed. <rs id="t17220704-15-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

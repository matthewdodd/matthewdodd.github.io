Christie and Shaw's passage; he said, he would bring the money in a few minutes; he came down in about five minutes, and asked the boy for a pen and ink; he took him into the office, and he wrote at the bottom of the bill, "Mr. Cutfield, pay the above to the bearer;" he told me to go to No. 4, Leicester-place, and Mr. Cutfield would give me the money; I went there, but no such person lived there; while I was standing at the door, I saw the prisoner go up Leicester-place.</p>

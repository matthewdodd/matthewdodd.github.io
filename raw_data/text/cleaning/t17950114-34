On the 1st of January, on or about twelve o'clock, the prisoner at the bar in company with one Williams and a girl, came into my house and called for a pint of gin, which I served him with myself, he said he wanted to write a letter, enquiring at the same time for a

               <p>Q. When did you see this gun before it was taken? - The gun was in a woollen bag, and I had seen it about two or three minutes before I missed it. I then threatened Williams to send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the gun here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have got a gun? - Yes, I was sent for on the 1st of January, by Mr. Hobson, about seven o'clock in the evening; at that time he had one Williams in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the gun? - I went by the directions that Williams gave him; I pursued the prisoner and took him at a public house along with a girl; the Blue lion, Red lion passage, Red-lion-square, and brought him back with the gun; he said, he only borrowed it to go out a shooting one afternoon and he would have brought it back the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was he drunk or sober? - To the best of my recollection he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him at another public house, and he came from the Orange-tree? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property; I know it by the particular figure and general appearance; I have had it to the best of my recollection two years, or two years and a half</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say than that I was brought up in the navy, and till now, have ever borne an irreproachable character. According to the prosecutor's own account I must be in liquor, for I had been drinking gin and water in the morning and afternoon; I did take the gun, but with no intent to sell it or make away with it; I was inebriated when I did it, and did it in consequence of a wager; Williams laid me a wager that I dare not take the gun out and go a shooting, and I took the gun out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Williams was taken up on this? he has been pressed, has he not? - I was informed so.</p>

This grindstone and spindle were safe on my premises at six o'clock on the night of the 27th of November, and were missing next morning. My yard is enclosed - I could see the place where they had been lifted over. The prisoner lives about a mile and a half from me - I saw him and two others there on the evening of the 27th, going up the road to the barracks.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 22d of December I searched the prisoner's father's house, at Twickenham, and found a grindstone, but no spindle or handle. - It was concealed in a shed, under some hay and rubbish. I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said he had had it two years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any iron work about it? A. No. Mr. Hester said his grindstone had iron about it - it was in an open shed. The prisoner lives with his father and his brother, about two miles from Mr. Hester's.</p>

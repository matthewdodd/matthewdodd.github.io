               <p>On Thursday the 1st of December, I went to the house of Mrs. Burkett, where I saw the three prisoners and this woman, and I bought some things; and in looking over them I saw these two table-cloths, and considered them as of no value, and the woman was present, and I gave them to her.</p>
               <p>You bought some of the other things? - Yes, seven sheets, eight table-cloths, with these two, and a white cotton counterpane; I gave three guineas for them, I bought them at a house in Duck-lane; Mrs. Burkett's.</p>
               <p>How came this woman there? - She was there when I went in.</p>
               <p>What had she to do there? - I do not know, she was there before I went in.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am not any thing at present; I am engaged in something.</p>
               <p>What was you at that time? - A pawnbroker at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Was you a witness on the last trial? - Yes, to prove my buying the things of the prisoners who were then convicted.</p>

               <p>Are those two table cloths, in your judgment of no value? - They would not to me, because I could not have made any thing of them; I thought if they were sold, they would only answer the purpose of cuting up for napkins or clouts.</p>
               <p>What would you have given for two such? - I would not have bought them; if I had them, I would have sold them for eighteen pence, or two shillings, most likely.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see any of these things before you missed them. - A. I had seen them on the Sunday when I shifted myself, they were all safe then. On Wednesday morning, when I came out of bed, I looked down by my bed, I saw my handkerchief on the ground; it should have been in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before. - A. Yes, he lodged in the house; I told the people of the house that my box was broken open; they said the soldier had not slept in the house that night. We went into the prisoner's room, we saw a bit of an old handkerchief and a bit of tape that I tied my pocket book with; I kept the bit of handkerchief at the bottom of my box, I used to wipe my razor with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your things again - A. Yes; I went along with one of the soldiers to some jew at Knightsbridge, and there were the shirts and waistcoats.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. On the 24th of July I was sent for, and the landlord or landlady gave me this turn-screw, which I found in the prisoner's room; I tried it to the box to see if this was the instrument made use<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160006"></xptr>of; I found it exactly corresponded with the marks on the box; the box was lined with blue paper. On the end of this turn screw was this piece of blue paper, as if it came off the box; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the prosecutor's watch; he said he had slept with a girl the very night he had taken it, and the girl had taken it from him. This is the bit of handkerchief and red tape; I have three pounds eighteen shillings that was delivered to me as part of the change of the five pound note; it was delivered to me.</p>

On Wednesday morning the 22nd of July the prisoner came into my shop, he brought me three shirts, and two waistcoats; he asked me to buy them, I said I should not like to buy them of a private unless he brought his serjeant; he said he could not bring the serjeant before night; he put the things on the counter.

About an hour after, as I was going down Tothil-street, I met him again, he shewed me a silver watch, a five pound note, and a guinea; he told me he had that in part of payment of the hundred pounds. We went to a public house, he called for a shillingsworth of gin and rasberry, he said we should drink together before we parted; he changed a guinea, I got the five pound note changed at

                  </hi>.

I took Biggins—he stated something to me—I found the prisoner's cap in Biggin's pocket—I had frequently seen the prisoner wear it—I afterwards found him in the skittle-ground at the Marquis of Granby public-house—when he got outside, he said he knew what I wanted him for—in going to the station-house he said he had sixpence and three penny pieces, which I took out of his hand—at the station-house I took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his pocket, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he spat out of his mouth on the table, and said, "There is some more of it."</p>

On the 23rd of October I saw him and a person named May—we were coming home—they persuaded me to go into the shop to see if they wanted a young man to work, which I did—then Gosling went in and took the money out of the till—I was standing on the path when he went in, and could see into the shop—May and I were looking in—I had a hat on—I had a cap in my pocket which I had from the prisoner, and I lent him mine, as he said it was warmer—that was about an hour and a half before—I don't know how the prisoner came to go into the shop—we had not talked about it before—I did not</p>

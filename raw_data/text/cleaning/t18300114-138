            . I am in the ninth year of my age -I know I must always speak the truth. My mother, Mary Waller, brought my breakfast in this can - we took our breakfast, and the 6s. were put into the can; the prisoner took it, and said she was going to take home a quart of milk for my mother - I began crying, and said she took my mother's money away; this was at the milk-house gate, in St. James'-park - a gentleman spoke to me, and he ran after her; a Police-man caught her - I did not see her stopped; a great crowd pursued her - I am quite sure she is the person who took the can, and the person who was stopped.</p>

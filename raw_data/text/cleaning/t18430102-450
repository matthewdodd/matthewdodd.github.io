I left there last Sept.—I do not think the pri<lb></lb>soner knew my husband's name was Robert—she knew I was married, and that I dealt with Challacombe and Co.—I had employed her occasionally as an upholsteress—the last time was about nineteen months or two years ago—she was not in my employ on the 6th of Oct. in any way, and did not send her to Messrs. Challacombe's for any calico, nor on the 13th of Oct., for two damask table-cloths—nor for 28 yards of linen for sheets, on the 17th of Oct.—she did not go by my authority at any time—she knew that I was a customer of Challacombe's, as I had sent her for some trifling things when she was in my employ.</p>

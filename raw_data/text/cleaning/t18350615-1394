                  </hi>. I came from the Hundred of Totness in Devonshire, and am a mason. I had been in town a fortnight—I had heard that the Tunnel and Westminster-bridge were to be repaired—I lodged at Ryan's house for a fortnight before this, in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's—it is a private house—I had paid for my lodging before this—I had in my watch<lb></lb>pocket six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and one guinea; and some silver in another pocket—when I went to bed at night, on the 30th of May, I had my money safe in my watch-pocket, sewed up—a man and his wife slept in the same room—M'Namara and his wife came home some time in the night—Ryan did not sleep in the room—I think I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock—when I was in bed, Ryan and his wife fell out, and hebeat her very much—she cried out—I saw Ryan come into my room—he asked me if I had paid for my lodging, I said yes, I had paid his wife—he went away and came in again not long after—he took my trowsers from under my head, and cut the pocket—some of the money which he got dropped upon the floor—after that, he left the room, and there was more differing—I continued in bed, because I was afraid to ask for my money—I got up next morning between seven and eight o'clock, and went to the police about eight o'clock, before I had breakfast—I told them—they came and took up Ryan—M'Namara was in the next room when Ryan took my breeches and cut my pocket; there was a lamp outside the street-door and a candle in the room—it was Ryan who did it.</p>

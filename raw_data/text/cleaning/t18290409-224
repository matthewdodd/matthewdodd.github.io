I lost six hanks of iron wire on the 24th of February; I saw Cotterell take it - and while he took it, McCarthy came to the door and said, "Now then, come along, come along;" McCarthy took it on his shoulder; I went and took him with it; Cotterell came for some wire, and remained for it - but I am positive he gave this wire to McCarthy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had not Cotterell been bargaining for some wire? A. Yes; he had been asking for some; I had seen him over the way at my other premises, and my lad had gone over with him; I think it impossible that McCarthy could hear him ask for it - it was while my lad was gone for some wire that Cotterell gave McCarthy this; there were three candles in the shop, two in the window and one on the counter; I had been lying in wait for them - I ran out of my private door, and collared McCarthy; they could not see me.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Hawkins. On the 24th of February, Cotterell came in the evening and asked me for a quarter of a pound of 16 or 17, meaning some wire - I said, "It is not here, you had better come over the way;" I went with him, and my master followed us - he went with me round to the private door, and I went into the shop; my master went and looked through a crack in the door - I went to serve Cotterell; he took the gauge, and said, "There is none here will do, you had better go and get some;" I went up into the kitchen, and presently I heard a scuffle and came down - I saw my master had got both the prisoners; the wire was on the shop floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the shop when you gave the gange to Cotterell? A. Yes; a person going by might see the bargain we made - he appeared like a customer.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; McCarthy did not run - he made no resistance; I said, "Now, you villain, I have got you at last;" he said the lad in the shop asked him to take the wire for him, but he did not say where to.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I took the prisoners and property.</p>
               <p>Cotterell put in a written paper, acknowledging the offence, and pleading poverty in extenuation.</p>

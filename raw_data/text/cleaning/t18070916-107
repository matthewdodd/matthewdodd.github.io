When I was a servant, I lived in Castle-street, Falcon-square, I left my place to go to Hornsey; and left my box in the prisoner's care some time the latter end of June. Being destitute of clothes, I came to town on the 7th of August; not finding my things as I left them, I left my box locked and corded; but I left more clothes that were not locked fast; when I enquired for them, she said she had pledged them; distress had drove her to do it; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160068"></xptr>should have them in a week or a fortnights time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said that. - A.Elizabeth Davis; the box was left in her care. She sent me them things according to her promise. Being unable to search my box when I fetched it from her house, I did not miss any thing directly. When I missed the things, I sent to her directly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you missed them. - A.Three days; she said she knew nothing about them; I sent to her; then I came to town in a fortnight before I was able; I had laid in. Afterwards Davis owned she took them out of the box, and that Dent had part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Davis, the woman. - A. I do not know, her husband is a glass cutter; they lived in Nelson's-passage, Arthur-street, Goswell-street. I do not know what the other woman is; the things that were pawned the pawnbrokers gave them up. I lost a one pound bank note and a half a guinea out of my box.</p>

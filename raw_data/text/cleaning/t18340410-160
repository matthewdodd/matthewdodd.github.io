On the 16th of March, at night, I was on my way home to White-cross-street, where I live - I met the prisoner in the street - she asked me to go home with her - I asked where she lived - she said in White-cross-street; but she took me to No. 7, <placeName id="t18340410-160-crimeloc915">John's-place</placeName>

I am robbed!" - I remained in the room till daylight next morning, and then went to the station and gave notice - it was about twelve o'clock when I went to the room - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long did you suspect that she was going to rob you? A. I did not think she was going to rob me, but when I was in bed, she began to feel about my pocket - I took off my trowsers for fear - I meant to stop there, but not all night - she had hold of me all the time - I dare say she had hold of me and the trowsers too - I had no silver, nor copper - I had seen my Â£5 safe about eleven o'clock in the day - I had been into three public-houses - I had been in company with one of my shipmates - I was with no ladies - I had felt my money safe after the morning - I had another half-sovereign when I went out in the morning - I paid my shipmate 5s., and spent the rest in dinner and drink - I had four or five glasses of gin, and a share of two pots of ale - I was not very tipsy when I took off my trowers - I thought she could not find my money - it was dark in the room, but not in the street - I saw her in the street - we walked under a gas lamp - I saw her the next day in custody - she at first denied knowing any thing about me: but, afterwards she owned that she took me home, but denied as to the money - I searched the bed to see for the money - I waited a long time, and fell asleep - it was safe when I pulled off my trowers.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in Chiswell-street - I had before been with the prosecutor to the room in John's-place, and found a bit of ribbon in the room - I took it with me, and in the course of the day I saw three women talking - one of them had a bonnet with ribbons like the bit I found - I took the three women - one of them was the prisoner, but she had not the bonnet trimmed with this ribbon - the other women were discharged.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 8.) I was at the station-house. The prisoner and two other women, one of whom was the witness, Walker, were brought in - I told the prisoner she was charged with talking four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns from a sailor - she said she knew nothing of the sailor nor the money - I said, "I shall send you and Walker before the magistrate" - she said, "It is no use sending her before the magistrate, she knows nothing about it" - I then saw the prisoner had something in her hand - I took her hand, and got 9s. 6d., and 3 1/2d. from her - the prosecutor pointed her out as the woman - she denied it, and said he ought to keep with his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he said he was married? A. Yes; his wife came there with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He had no money when he went with me, and of course I left him. He was quite intoxicated. He lives nearly opposite where I do.</p>

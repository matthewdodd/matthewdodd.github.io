               <p>BENJAMIN KANE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to the parish of St. Giles's, a bearer: On the 24th of December, about half past-five in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another in company, coming down Little Denmark-street: Mr. Sterling's shop is in Great Denmark-street, about forty yards from this place; he had a cannister of tea upon his shoulder; I stopped him, and he said a man had given it him at the corner of Denmark-street: I told him I knew better than that, for I knew them both well.(It was produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Mason. This cannister is Mr. Sterling's property. I left it in the shop when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon it? - A. I know it by the tare, the tare is twenty pounds, it is marked within side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your master had this cannister? -

               <p>Q. How much tea was there in it? - A. seventeen pounds, it was standing in the shop when I went out, we had two of the same kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Coming down Denmark-street, I saw a man with that cannister of tea, he said he would give me 6d to carry it into Hog-lane, and that man came and laid hold of me, the other man went away, and I have never seen him since.</p>

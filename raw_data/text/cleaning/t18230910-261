I forced him into a shop, and was obliged to hold the doors against them. The shopkeeper refused to send for a constable till I threatened him. He begged of me several times to let him go, saying he would not do it again.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENDRICK. I am a constable. I was fetched, and found the prosecutor surrounded by a parcel of pickpockets, men, women, and boys. I took the prisoner in charge, and asked if he could not leave off his old tricks - he made no answer.</p>

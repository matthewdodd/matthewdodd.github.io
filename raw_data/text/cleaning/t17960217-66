               <p>- WATSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am headborough in St. Luke's parish; it was my night up at the watchhouse; the 16th of this month I was walking down Golden-lane, as I generally do once or twice in the night; I heard two people coming up on the other side of the way talking one to the other, this was a little before three in the morning; I heard them making use of bad words; I crossed over to them, and seeing me crossing over, they walked along rather faster; as soon as I got to the corner, they turned up Playhouse-yard; I saw the glasses between the men, they were carrying them in their hands, and they made a great rattling one against the other, which gave me a suspicion they had got something they should not have; seeing me follow, the other went forward, and this man dropped the glasses, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the glasses broke? - A. No; they were set down by the wall, and were not damaged at all.(produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner had the possession of these two glasses? - A. Yes; I made a particular remark of him, his coat being out at both elbows, and his shirt hanging out.</p>
               <p>Rivers. This glass is mine; there were four lost out of the yard, only one of these is mine; they left each a stick in my ride, the one on one side, the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming round Golden-lane, I turned the corner of Playhouse-yard, and the watchman laid hold of me, and took me to the watchhouse, and afterwards brought two glasses, and asked if I knew any thing of them; I know nothing of them.</p>

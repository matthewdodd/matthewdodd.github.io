               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I was going up Fleet-street on Thursday, and saw the two prisoners together; I took them to Mr. Slee's, and the lad identified them - he expressed no doubt about their being the persons; it was from his description that I took them.</p>
               <p>ALLFORD's Defence. I was coming from over the water - I saw Matthews, and asked him if he knew of a place; the officer came and took us - the boy said at first, he knew me by my trousers, and then by the hat.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the 27th of Dec., I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—my husband left the parlour at the same time that I did—there was no one up in the house then—the back parlour window was fastened—I had shot the shutters of it myself, and fastened them with a bar—this silver goblet, and cups, and other things, were in the front parlour—the front parlour window was shut, and all the windows and doors in the house were shut—the servant got up at seven the next morning, and she came and called me—I missed the property stated—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—they are my husband's.</p>

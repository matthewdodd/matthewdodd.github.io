                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector.</hi>) On the 16th of Dec., at seven o'clock at night, I went to a house in Henry-street, Borough, accompanied by Bran<lb></lb>nan and Tait, in search of the prisoner—I went in with Brannan—Tait re<lb></lb>mained at the door—having made inquiry below, we went up stairs to the first floor room—I opened the door by turning the lateh, and saw the prisoner standing in his shirt-sleeves—he blew the candle out—he had something in his hand, which he threw out at the window, which was open, and jumped out himself—I had time to see something white in his hand before the candle was blown out—there was a large fire—after he jumped out at the window Bran<lb></lb>nan left the room—I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner running up the street—I went down directly—he was pursued, and I met the officers returning with him—we took him to the station in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I returned to the lodging with Brannan, and found on the hob of the grate this piece of line rag, containing twenty-two counterfeit half-crowns and fifty counterfeit shil<lb></lb>lings, all quite hot, and all in an unfinished state—while I was searching the room the landlord of the house came in—in consequence of what he told me, part of a double mould for casting half-crowns was given me by Martin, in the presence of his wife, who had picked it up—that was a quarter of an hour after the prisoner had jumped out of the window—I received from Mr. Martin a piece of a mould with the tail side of a half-crown upon it.</p>

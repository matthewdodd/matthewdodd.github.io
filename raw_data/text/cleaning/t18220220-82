I kept crying Stop thief! and he was stopped at the end of the passage. The men then left me - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a printer. I was coming out of Gough-square, into St. Dunstan's-court, and heard the cry of Stop thief! The passage is very dark,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200048"></xptr>and goes through a private house. I looked down the court, and it was clear - I saw the prisoner running towards me, and knowing nobody had passed me, I sprang out of the private passage, shut the door, and by that means stopped up the thoroughfare. The prisoner came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't stop me, for I am in pursuit of the thief." I said,</p>
               <p>"I shall stop you till somebody comes up, and in a few seconds, three men came up, apparently out of breath, and said,</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is." They looked round the corners, and kept asking,</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" I still said,</p>
               <p>"This is him," but they took no notice of me - I thought I had stopped the wrong person, and let him go. He instantly ran towards Fleet-street; the crowd were then coming up the court. The moment I saw him run, I thought he was the man, and called out,</p>
               <p>"That is the man," and saw him retaken. Mr. Carr immediately said he was the man.</p>

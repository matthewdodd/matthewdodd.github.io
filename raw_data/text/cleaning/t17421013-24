She catched hold of the Watch, snatched it from me, broke a strong Cat-gut, and I fell backwards upon my A - e.

            . I saw the Prosecutor in the Street about twelve o'Clock: He told me he had lost his Watch, and by several Circumstances I thought it was the Prisoner that had it: We went to Old Dad Welch, and he asked him, if he could help him to a Guinea, at last he said half a Guinea, to help him to his Watch. The Prosecutor said, he could not. We took him up, carried him to the Watch-house , and afterwards to the Compter. The Prisoner has said since, she wished she had not returned the Watch.</p>

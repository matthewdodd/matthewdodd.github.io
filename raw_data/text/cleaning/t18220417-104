I saw the prisoner go out of the building; he was charged with stealing the tools, and detained. They were on the second floor. I left them safe at a quarter before nine o'clock, and at a half-past nine they were gone.</p>

            . I was at work on the premises. I saw the prisoner come across the parlour floor, about nine o'clock; he had no business there. I saw Down pursue him; he returned and gave an alarm. The prisoner ran away; I pursued him to his lodging; he was concealed there, and denied to me; I went and got Down, and then secured him in Hanover Square; he made great resistance, and said he had nothing; at last he took me to a building, where we found them.</p>

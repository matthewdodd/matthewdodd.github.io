After that we met two men on horseback and one on foot. My brother said to me, Jack, don't go any farther, let us cross over the stile, fearing they should do something to us; so I jump'd over the rails, and fell upon one of these bundles. I then call'd to my brother and said, here is something lying, let's see what it is ? and as he was coming to me he found another bundle. These other things he bid me put into my pocket, and we should see what they were when we came to the light, but we had not gone thirty yards before they stop'd us.</p>

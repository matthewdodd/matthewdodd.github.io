                  </hi>. On Sunday morning, the 27th of December, about one o'clock, I hired a cabriolet at the corner of Hart-street, Long Acre—James Day was the driver—I am sure he is the person—I had, at that time, a silver watch in my pocket, and a seal, key, and ribbon, with a guard-chain—James Day placed himself in the cab, by my side, I made no objection to it, he was in the cab when I got in—I directed him to go to No. 66 wood-street, Cheapside—I had been drinking in the evening, but was sober—I fell asleep, and no awaking, I found myself at Battle-bridge—my watch was gone—just at that time Day stopped the cab, and got out, and went round the back of the cab to the hourse's head—I found my watch was gone and desired him again to drive me to Wood-street—he said he would not, and was very impertient—I would not leave the cab, I called a policeman, and gave him in charge—my guard-chain was cut—Part of it remained round my neck—here is the seal, the key, and the ribbon.</p>

He was in liquor when I took him up, and the policeman told me to take him to Wood-street—I took him there—he got out, and then got in with a female, and told me to drive him to Maiden-lane—I took him there, and then said he meant Maiden-lane, New North-road. Witness. No; I was not in liquor, I did not take any female in the cab, not did I get out at all.</p>

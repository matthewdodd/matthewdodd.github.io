            . I am a messenger. On Sunday, the 28th of January, I was in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; two men passed me, heavily loaded; and in moment the prisoner and another passed, heavily loaded also, with something covered with a mat; I lifted the mat up, and said, "What have you here?" - the prisoner threw down this lead, and ran away; I secured the property, and gave it to the officers, telling them I should know the men again; I was sent for to the prosecutors' in a few days, and saw the prisoner - I am certain he was one of them - the other three got away.</p>

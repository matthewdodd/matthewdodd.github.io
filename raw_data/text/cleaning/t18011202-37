               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I was told you were married again before the day this offence was committed? - A. I was married on the 18th of November, and the robbery was on the 9th.</p>

               <p>Q. You think the door was locked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were examined before the Magistrate, did you not say you did not know whether it was locked or no? - A. No; I said I locked it as I usually did, but I did not put my hand to try it.</p>
               <p>Q. It often happens that it don't lock? - A. It might so, I cannot say whether it was locked or not, I locked it as I usually did.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. I have some little doubt.</p>

               <p>- CROCKER sworn. - I went with Limerick to the house of Rimes, and found this bunch of small keys, some have been filed; one of them opens the lock of the prosecutrix's drawers; I afterwards met Scully and searched him, and in his right hand breeches pocket I found two skeleton keys, one of which undoes her parlour door. (Produces the keys).(The prosecutrix identified the shawls, gowns, and handkerchief).</p>
               <p>Bullock's defence. About eight o'clock in the evening, on the 9th of November, as I was coming from work I kicked something before me, which I picked up, and it was a few old rags, two pocket-handkerchiefs, and a duplicate; I carried them home, but did not then know what they were; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Scully and Rimes were not put on their defence.</p>
               <p>Leman. I would give a guinea for the gown, half-a-crown for this shawl, and one shilling for the blue shawl.</p>

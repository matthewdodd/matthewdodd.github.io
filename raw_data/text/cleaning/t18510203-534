                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Falkner, who keeps a marine-store shop at 3, Eyre-street-hill. On the evening of 14th Jan. Forrester came and asked me if I would buy an old copper and some old lead—I said, "Where is it?"and while I was speaking Crowther brought in a copper and some piping—I said my husband was not at home, and I did not like buying them—they said, "Then we will leave them," and both went out together, leaving the articles in the shop—I went to the door to see if my husband was coming—I saw Archer and Fisher, gave them information, and they afterwards brought back the prisoners—I am quite certain they are the men.</p>

In consequence of information I went to Leather-lane and saw both prisoners there together—Fisher took Crowther, and I took Forrester—I told him I wanted him for some lead pipe and a copper—he made no answer—we went to Mrs. Falkner's shop, and she said, "These are the parties that brought the lead pipe to me"—I saw the copper and pipe there, and took possession of them—I found some lucifer's on Forrester—I afterwards went to 25, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell, which is an empty house, and assisted in comparing the copper and lead-pipe—there was a hold-fast in the wall which had catched</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 127). I took Crowther, and the same night went to Brewer-street—I measured the place where the pipe had been cut off, and found it corresponded with the pipe, and the copper corresponded also exactly—there was a foot of pipe short, but a foot has since been found which also corresponds—there are about twenty feet—on examining the premises I found these matches, which are of the same colour as those found on Forrester.</p>

               <p>Court. How long have you been in this country? - About five years; I came from New York; I am servant to Mr. Culliford's; I remember bringing some shop goods to the prosecutor's, I carried a piece of cloth, I do not justly know what it was, I carried them, it was linen cloth, that was on the 30th of November; I found it on Mr. Longman's stairs.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Longman? - A musical instrument maker in Cheapside; I go up some stairs to Mr. Culliford's shop; it is a shop where he finishes instruments of music; when I found it, I threw it into a packing case, and went up stairs, and acquainted the men; and in about three minutes afterwards, I carried it up stairs into the shop where the men was at work; they advised me to leave it till the next day, to hear if it was enquired for; it was not enquired for, so I took it down to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120043"></xptr>Hussey's, that is next door; I do not know how it came there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Messrs. Longman and Brodrip employ a great many men in their trade? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Their house adjoins to Messrs. Hussey's and Witter's? - Yes; there is a church-yard at the back of both houses; there is a back court between his house and the warehouse; the court runs between the two front houses and the warehouses.</p>
               <p>Is there any difficulty in getting from Mr. Longman's warehouse to Mr. Hussey's warehouse? - I cannot say about that, there is no back way to go, he might go down the trap door where they put the linen, if he liked to jump down.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing held out to him? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120044"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. that was after the goods were brought by Allen? - It was after he confessed the former articles.</p>
               <p>You knew very well at that time he had made a confession? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Then it was a conclusion of the same transaction; it was an inquiry into more goods, the property of Mr. Hussey? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>You say, that after some time he confessed; how was that some time employed? - It was after it was known in the family.</p>
               <p>Was not it said, why you know you have confessed? - I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Try and bring your recollection a little back; because these mens lives are at stake. - That time was employed by Mr. Hussey's son saying he knew them to be their property.</p>
               <p>And adding to it, therefore it is no use your denying in it? - I did not hear him threaten him; he charged him with bringing the goods there, in a very pointed manner, several times, which he denied.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear it would be as well to confess? - He was charged with it very pointedly, and after that he confessed it, I do not recollect conversation about his having confessed any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether any of these goods were kept in the warehouse in the yard? - I do not know, they might be kept there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were kept in the fore warehouse, I know that of my own knowledge; these that the confessed made of the whole quantity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have two houses, one at the other end of the town? - I have.</p>
               <p>You deal very largely? - Yes; he confessed that he took it at two different times.</p>
               <p>What is the prime-cost value of any one piece of those that was found? - More than I have charged, it is charged at forty-two shillings.</p>
               <p>I ask you what any one thing, in the state in which it was found, was worth? - That piece of long lawn that was found on the stairs cost upwards of two guineas, I mean to say it cost me upwards of two guineas.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - Sometime.</p>
               <p>How long? - Several months.</p>
               <p>It is a commodity that sometimes varies in its price? - It is worth a great deal more.</p>

               <p>Court to Hussey. You have indicted this man on one charge with stealing goods, which in fact appear to have been stolen at several times; now the law does not suffer that; this ought to have been said in several counts, containing several charges; you cannot go upon all of them; which do you wish to proceed upon first? there was a piece of long lawn that was found on the stair case at Longman's, another piece, you say, was found at another time; you must go for one or the other; it is all laid as one charge, now it appears to be stolen at different times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you go for that second piece, it is charged at twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. It is so understood, that he goes for that. - I was with Mr. Potter; I found at Williams's several pieces of linen, I carried them to Mr. Hussey's house in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no evidence against the accomplice but the confession of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live in Leicester-fields, I am upholsterer to his Majesty; I have known the prisoner Martin, he was my porter five months; he came to me in November, 1785, very strongly recommended; I found him deserving the best of characters; I trusted him in a room between my shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120045"></xptr>and my house as a guard over all my property, he might have robbed me to a great amount; he was a very sober, decent man, and a man that kept the Sabbath extraordinary well.</p>

               <p>Mr. - KINLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I knew the prisoner before he lived with me, which was two years ago; I was very sorry to part with him he was so good a servant; he went from me to Mr. Campbell's; I have known him three years an extraordinary good character; I never had a servant I trusted more than I did him; I was astonished to hear where he was.</p>
               <p>- MARTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Hog-lane; he is not related to me; he lived with me five or six months; I have known him three years; I trusted him as I had done others, and always found him honest and faithful; he slept in my warehouse, where he could have done me a great deal of injury; and I always found him honest and faithful.</p>
               <p>- HECTOR sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known him between three and four years as honest, and as good a lad as ever came within any man's doors, and all his character has been of the same sort; he has lived with me when he was out of place, and that was the time to be a thief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The 17 yards of long lawn is such as I lost; but there are no marks by which I can swear to positively.</p>

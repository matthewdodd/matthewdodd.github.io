            . I am a waggoner to Messrs. Green and Barratt. I went on the Monday morning with the waggon, which contained the thirty-five sacks of coals, and Hughes with me as a mate; the other waggon was in the yard, but the prisoners had not come when I started - their waggon was corded up, but I did not count the sacks in it - I stopped at Whetstone to bait my horses, and the two prisoners came up with the other waggon; we stopped there about three quarters of an hour, and then went on to Mr. Oakgood's - when we got there, there was some complaint made by his servant; and Huckleby told me to speak to the footman - I told him that Huckleby wanted to speak to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What time did you start? A. A quarter before five o'clock; it was dark.</p>

            . I am a footman to Mr. Oakgood. I saw the two waggons of coals come to his house; I saw the two prisoners at the time - Lawney told me I was wanted in the coal-cellar; I went down for a minute, but I found I was not wanted - I came back, and saw Lawney in the act of taking two empty sacks out of the second waggon which had just come into the yard; Huckleby was down stairs with Hughes at the time - Lawney was running with the sacks down the yard, to where the empty sacks of the first waggon were put, but seeing me he concealed them behind the dog-kennel: I had before that asked Huckleby for the ticket of that waggon, and he said he had come away and forgot it - I counted the number of sacks in the second waggon, and there were but twenty-six; I examined the sacks which had been put behind the dog-kennel - they were regular sacks, and appeared to have had coals in them; I said to Huckleby,"As you have no ticket with this waggon, I shall count your coals" - I counted and said, "There are but twenty-six;" he said he knew they were short, and he hoped I would not say any thing about it - Lawney was by the other waggon, but he was within hearing, and not more than five yards off; I said to Huckleby, "As you had the charge of this waggon, you must be answerable for the coals" - he said they had been left at Holloway; I said, "That won't do for me, I must have my coals correct" - he then said it was at the Red Cap, or Mother Red<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030036"></xptr>Cap, I am not certain which, and wished me not to say any thing about it; I told him I certainly should acquaint Green and Barratt of it - he then told Seaney to come to me, and make it up - when Seaney came to me with a message from Huckleby to make it up, and I refused, Huckleby said he would pay me for them if I would say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you by when the waggons were unloaded? A. Yes, all but the first six sacks, which had been taken out of the first waggon; I think Lawney was within hearing when I spoke to Huckleby - when Huckleby said they were short, I understood short of the number; I made him no promise or threat.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. How long has Huckleby been in their service? A. He has been twice in their service - I think this last time about six or seven months; I cannot exactly say how long Lawney has been there.</p>

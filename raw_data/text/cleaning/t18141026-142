            . I am a constable of padington. I apprehended Parker on Monday, the 24th of October, in Oxford Road; Mr. Martin asked me what I thought of that man, he had some lead on his back; he put the lead down in a gateway, and set upon the lead; a soldier helped him up with the lead; he crossed Oxford-street; he came from the corner of Queen-street, Grovesner-square, to the further end of Oxford-street; there I laid hold of him, and asked him where he was going with the lead he had on his shoulder; he told me he was a porter to Mr. Stevens in King-street Seven Dials. I told him that was not the way to take it to the Seven Dials; he was going towards Grovesner-square. I took him to Marybone watchhouse; the watchhouse keeper was not there then. We took the prisoner with us to find his master at the Seven Dials; we could not find a Mr. Stevens; he got into a public-house at one door, and ran out at the other. I pursued him and catched him again, in a cellar in Munmouth Street, and brought him again to Marybone watchhouse. I could not find out a Stevens, his master. The weight of the lead he had is one hundred and thirty pounds. I went to the house in Upper Berkley-street; I saw that lead had been taken away, and the lead that Parker had been a part of that lead.</p>
               <p>MR. MARTIN. I live at 32, Adam Street West I was walking in Berkley-street, on Monday the 24th of October, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner Parker coming out of the front door of the house, with the lead on his baek; he shut the door after him; I followed him into Oxford-street, and gave information to the constable.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Berverdsell, who keeps a Manchester warehouse at the corner of <placeName id="t17570713-2-crimeloc9">Lawrence-Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17570713-2-crimeloc9" type="placeName" value="Lawrence-Lane"></interp>

A little after four in the morning, on the 5th of this instant, I awaked, and heard a noise at the door; I went down into the cellar, which also is a warehouse, and there I observed this piece of cheque was removed from off a counter and laid under the grating; there was a pane of glass broke in the window. (Producing the cheque.)</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is it?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. It is the property of Mr. Berverdsell, my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where it lay the day before?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I saw it on the counter when I shut up shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I stood in the cellar and saw the prisoner and another man pass the grate several times. There came a butcher's man and pitch'd his basket, then they walk'd off; after he was gone they appeared at the grate again. Then they put down this stick, with a hook tied to it (producing it ) and hook'd the piece up to the grating.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them hook'd it up?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. The prisoner was the man that hook'd it up, and the other man cut the string, with which it was tied-round, and it fell down again under the area of the grate; we have two doors, one opens into Cateaton-Street, and the other into Lawrence-Lane. I went up and opened that in Lawrence-Lane. They had just past the door, going towards King-Street. Then I shut the door and watched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130003"></xptr> their coming, knowing if they put their hook down the grating I should hear them. I soon heard them at it. I went out at the door, and the other person was on the watch, who call'd to the prisoner. I went and laid hold on the prisoner when he was within two yards of the grate, and took his hook from him; he beg'd I would let him go. I brought him in at the door and rang the bell, and the other two men came down; we got a constable and took him to the compter. He was examined before Sir

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. Last Tuesday was a week, about a quarter before five, the porter call'd. I got up, and from the window I saw him drawing the prisoner to the door. I came down; he told me he had seen him attempting to take away a piece of cheque from the warehouse. I call'd up the other man, and sent him for a constable. I went to the grating and saw this piece of cheque lying underneath on the ground, and the window was broke belonging to the warehouse or cellar. I ask'd the prisoner how he could go to do such a thing; he said it was the first time, and he did it for want, and pray'd heartily that we would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window whole over night?</p>
               <p>Kettle. I can't take upon me to say that, for I was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tharlfa. Did you see the window over night?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I did, and it was not broke then; it was one large pane that was broke out the next morning.</p>
               <p>Humphry Deacon. I am an apprentice to the prosecutor. Mr. Kettle call'd me up about half an hour before five. I came down stairs, the porter had got hold of the prisoner in the passage, and I was told he had been attempting to steal a piece of cheque out of the cellar. I went and saw it lying out of the paper, under the grating. I had laid that very piece on the counter in the cellar before, and saw it there over night, I went for a constable, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

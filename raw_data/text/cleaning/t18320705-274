               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not getting dark? A. No; my sight is pretty good: the prisoner had a red shawl on, a white straw bonnet, and a light linen gown, which seemed rather dirty.</p>

            . I am ten years of age, and live with my father in Little Pulteney-street. I was in Soho-square, between seven and eight o'clock, on the day before I went to the Magistrate; I saw the prisoner there with this little child - I said, to him - "Babby, where are you going?" the prisoner said she was going to give him a pottle of straw berries - he was dressed then; the prisoner is the person who was with him; she had a red shawl on and a white bonnet.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say, she had a black gown, a black bonnet, and a white apron? A. No, she had a blue apron; I do not know whether I said she had a black gown, and a black bonnet - I think I did, and I think she had them on; I told the Magistrate so: I said she had a white bonnet on, because the last witness said so.</p>

            . I am a jeweller, and live in Carlile-street. On the evening in question, I saw the child at twenty minutes past seven o'clock; I knew the child, and to the best of my belief, the prisoner was with him - she had hold of him, or he had hold of her; they were going towards Soho-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you tell how she was dressed? A. She had a white straw bonnet, and a red shawl on.</p>

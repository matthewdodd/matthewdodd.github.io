               <p>Where was this cloth coat and waistcoat? - Hanging on the back of a chair, against the bedside; I never saw it again; when I went to bed, the prisoner asked me if they were my best clothes; he was laying atop of the bedstead in the room; I said, yes, they were my best clothes, I had no other but what was at my friends; he began examining about the bedstead; he said, he did not lay high enough, and I gave him two old great coats; in the morning about half past three, I awaked my bedfellow to see what it was o'clock; that was Mr. Nuby; we went to look at his watch and it was gone; then I fell asleep; the prisoner was gone watch and all; I am quite sure the prisoner was the man; I valued the coat and waistcoat at fifteen shillings.</p>

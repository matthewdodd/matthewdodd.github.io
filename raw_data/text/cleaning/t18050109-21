             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. On the night of the 22d of December, was your poultry all safe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 23d, did your servant call you up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that hen-house with regard to your dwelling-house? - A. There is a coal-house that joins to the hen-roost, the coal-house is next to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it all under one roof, and connected together? - A. It is the same nature as the brewhouse, but not of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is not in an enclosed yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is within an enclosed yard, it is protected as well as the house - it is no part of the dwelling-house neither? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What time in the morning were you called up? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the turkey-house had been robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the tiles taken off the house? - A. Yes; we had a strong door made to the hen-roost, he got in the coal-hole way; we lost three turkies, sixteen ducks, and a gander.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your man pursue him? - A. Yes, and we found him in the lane; as soon as we came to a waggon, we asked the waggoner if he had seen a man with any poultry; he said, he was the off-side of the waggon, and he pulled the poultry out of the waggon in a moment, and said he had just put them in; the waggoner was quite a young fellow, I was obliged to hold the prisoner down by the butt-end of the gun; he said he would lick us all.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you quite sure that that man you found with this waggon was the same man you saw in the field? - A. Yes.</p>

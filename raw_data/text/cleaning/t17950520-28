               <p>Q.Did you serve them any check? - No, another did. As they were going out, they stopped at a wooden horse, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200090"></xptr>looked at some pocket handkerchiefs, and they said they could get as good handkerchiefs as that for ten-pence. The price of them were sixteen-pence, and they stopped there a long time. I was busy with another lady, and the lady after that nodded for me to take particular notice of them. I took particular notice of them; I never took my eyes off from them afterwards. A little time afterwards, I went to the bottom of the shop to take some goods to put in another place, and as I returned up the shop again, I missed something off from this horse, and I said, halloo! and I immediately pursued the prisoners. They were gone out of the shop, and I laid hold of

The handkerchiefs were pinned at the top, it was impossible to get them away, and they hung one from the other, from the top to the bottom of the horse. When they were both in the shop together again, Elizabeth Walker said, that she would swear that she see me bring the petticoat, and put it by her sister's side. The value of it is six shillings, the petticoat cost Mr. Gibson nine shillings, but it is rather out of condition.</p>

Then I asked the young man what the price of them were? and he looked across the counter, gave me no answer, and said, there is something gone.</p>

He went to the door, and I followed him. for I thought they had got nothing; when I came to the door I heard him ask Warner what she had got? and she said she had got nothing; she said, nothing; he said, you have got a a petticoat, and he turned her gown back, and under her apron there was a petticoat.</p>

               <p>I produce the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Turner. I can swear to its being my master's, and was on the horse at the time she was in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200092"></xptr>Q. Does there happen to be any private mark on it? - There was; but I believe it was tore away in getting it from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warner. Going out of the door I took the pocket handkerchief in my hand, and my sister said she thought they were no more than ten-pence or a shilling, for she bought the same for the same money; whether I knocked the petticoat off the horse I don't know; and whether I picked it up I can not hardly tell, I was so intoxicated in liquor, and I might carry it to the door to look at it, instead of taking it to the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walker. I am entirely innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Warner. My sister is innocent of the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Walker called five witnesses who gave her a good character; and Warner four witnesses who gave her also a good character.</p>

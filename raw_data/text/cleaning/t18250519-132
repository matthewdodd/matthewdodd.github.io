            . I live with Mr. Dark. On the 20th of April I had been out about three o'clock, and as I came to the end of my master's window, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop, with the tea-caddy under his arm; I did not follow him: I saw him again on the Monday following, and think he is the man - he had a light fustian jacket and blue trowsers on. Nobody was in the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I was coming down Chiswell-street on Wednesday, the 20th of April, at twenty minutes past three o'clock, and met the prisoner with something wrapped in a handkerchief; I let him pass, and saw him turn down Whitecross-street, into a narrow passage, and then into Red Lion-market-place - he then put the bundle into his apron; I collared him, and asked what he had there - he said a tea-caddy, which a gentleman gave to him in Finsbury-square, to carry; I asked where to - he said to some street in Oxford-street: I detained him, and on the Friday following I found the owner. I found two skeleton keys on him; one of which opens Dark's door; he had a fustian jacket and blue trowsers on.</p>

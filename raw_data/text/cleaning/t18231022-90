I had asked him on Sunday, if he had seen it - he said No. I went to Bury's shop, saw his daughter, and told her I had come for it. I afterwards went with the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. His daughter told you at once, that it had been sold there - A. Yes, for 9 d., and said it was sent to be polished, and I should have it when it came back.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 29th of September, I went with Holmes to Bury's shop. I saw Bury the last time I called, and asked him to shew me the pin, which I had seen, when I called with Holmes; his daughter shewed it to me in his presence. I asked if he objected to my taking it, and I would leave my watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220035"></xptr>as security - he said I might have it if I paid for it, and afterwards said I might take it without, which I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You said you wished him to appear at Bow-street, to see how he got it - A. Yes. I went to him next morning - he said he was busy, and could not attend that day - he came next day by a summons, and was detained.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 25th of November, between six and seven o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18291203-74-crimeloc403">Wood-street, Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It fell into the cart? A. Yes - whether it fell into the same place as he took it from I cannot say; it was a fine night - he did not get a yard from me before I re-took him: I lost my hold, and he was at liberty - I felt the effects of their violence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030032"></xptr>but am sure he was not out of my sight, nor out of the reach of my stick, which was in my hand; he was the only person in front of me - those who endeavoured to rescue him appeared thieves; I have seen them lurking about, not in the way a person would on business - three or four of them came near me; none of them were in front of me after the prisoner got away, but were while I held his arm; I never lost sight of him the whole time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the person you ultimately seized is the person who had the parcel? A. I am - it was the prisoner.</p>

             and his partners. I was in the cart in Wood-street, and saw the prisoner step on the near-wheel, reach his hand over, and take hold of a brown paper parcel belonging to Mr. Minton - he lifted it up, and got it out of the cart, but knocked it against the top rail, which prevented his getting it out; he jumped down, and turned to run away, but Henman took him - four more rushed on Henman, and rescued him - he was afterwards taken: I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far did he run when the four persons rushed forward? A. Not out of the reach of the officer's stick; I saw no handkerchief over his face.</p>

I think the officer has learned the boy what to say; both their evidence correspond: it was a dark night - I had a red handkerchief round my neck; he swore at Guildhall that I ran twice round the cart to get away, but he is able to swear any thing for a better situation.</p>

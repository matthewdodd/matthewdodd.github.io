On Thursday night, the 17th of March, I was sent to watch the shop window of Mrs. Stevenson, of 143, Ratcliff-highway—I was in plain clothes—about seven o'clock I saw the four prisoners come to the window together—they separated two or three dif<lb></lb>ferent times, and whistled—I lost them, but they came back, and about ten minutes to eight I saw Cooper go to the window—the other three stood be<lb></lb>hind—he pushed the glass in and drew these handkerchiefs out—the other three remained at the window—Cooper crossed over and crossed again to Denmark-street, the same side as Mrs. Stevenson's shop—the other three kept at the window—I went after Cooper—he began to run up the street—I ran after him, and finding somebody after him he threw the handkerchiefs down in the street—they had been in company for nearly an hour together—I caught him—he said, "I did not steal them"—I said I had seen him—I brought him back to the shop with the handkerchiefs—they were identified, and he was detained—the three others were then gone—I am certain they had been together and talking together, and at the time Cooper pushed the glass in—they stood behind him dose at his back, covering him while he did it—the others might have got more things from the window when I ran after Cooper—I did not see them again until next morning, when I took Henessey at No. 1, Sugarloaf-court, Essex-street, Whitechapel, in a room where there was several girls and boys—I told him I wanted him for a robbery in the Highway—he de<lb></lb>wed being in the Highway—he said he was not down there—I mentioned Mrs. Stevenson's shop—he denied having been there—I took the others on the Thursday morning following, between six and seven, at No. 2, in the same court—Irons was getting up the chimney, and Gadd was in bed—I just saw Irons' feet up the chimney, and he came rolling down.</p>

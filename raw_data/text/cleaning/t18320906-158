On the 16th of July, between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take a piece of carpet from the window - I was about the middle of the shop; he ran out, got about twenty yards, and was turning through a court, when I secured him - I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You do not know whether your master had sold him the carpet? A. He had not; it had been purchased by a Mr. Nutt, in Hertfordshire, but was not to be sent home till he wrote for it; when the prisoner was taken he said a gentleman sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060072"></xptr>him for it, but he did not say who he was nor where he lived - it was not paid for, and was not to be sent home till next March, or till we heard from him; I asked who sent him for it - he said a gentleman told him to go in and take it; there were several other pieces of carpeting with it - it is worth 7l.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Regent-street - a gentleman asked if I wanted a job, and asked me to carry the carpeting to No. 17, Vine-street; he took me to the step of the door, and pointed it out - I was following him.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Willell. The under ostler came to me and said, "I want you to do a job for me, go and get two trusses of hay;" I told the officer so. Witness. Yes, he did.</p>

            . I went with the waggon; when we got to Kingsland turnpike we turned off to the right- we did not pass the public-house in going to London; we went to London and delivered the hay, but two or three trusses were left in the waggon; we went home by Kingsland, and stopped at this public-house to have a pint of beer - while we were in there somebody took the hay from the waggon; I told Glenn of it, but he said nothing - I saw the other prisoner stopped with the hay in the truck - I went out, the hay was gone from our waggon.</p>
               <p>Glenn. When I unloaded my hay, a man asked me if I would take two trusses down Kingsland-road for him, which I did - I stopped at the King's Head, and I expect the same man took them out that put them in; I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Willett. I am innocent - the under ostler told me to fetch the truck, and put the two trusses of hay into it.</p>

            . I live at Hoxton. I was at the King's Head when the ostler asked Willett to get Mr. Bartram's truck and put the two trusses of hay into it, and he would give him a pint of beer for it - Willett told the officer who had employed him, but the ostler got away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was fetched to the watch-house, and met the prisoner being brought there; he cried very much, and said he was very sorry - that he had been deluded by a person named Williams, who lived at No. 6, Little Saffron-street, Saffron-hill - I have been there several times, but cannot find him - his father lives there.</p>
               <p>GEORGE - . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found three more handkerchiefs in his pocket: they have not been claimed.</p>

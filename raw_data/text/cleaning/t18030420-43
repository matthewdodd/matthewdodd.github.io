There were a great many goods on the counter, and from her conduct, I suspected she had taken something; I followed her out up a court, and stopped her, and took from under her cloak a piece of print; I sent for an officer, who took her and the print into his possession; I gave about 2l. 8s. or 9s. for it; there were three young men in the shop at the time, who are not here.</p>

I went out of his shop into Long-alley, and the gentleman came after me, and said, I had robbed him; he left me then, and run after another woman, whom he stopped; he afterwards came back to me, and took me to a public-house, while he went after another woman.

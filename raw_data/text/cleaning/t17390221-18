               <p>John Dew. Mrs. Lynnel and I had been to see my Mother in the Strand, on the 4th of February; we came back after Seven o'Clock, and at Fleet ditch we took Coach to carry us to St. Margaret's Hill. On the South Side of St. Paul's, the Prisoner came, and put something into the Coach, and another (who was with him) cry'd out, - Stop! stop! but the Coachman drove on; upon which the Prisoner ran from the Coach-door, and told the Coachman, - If he did not stop, he would knock his Brains out. The Coach was stopp'd by the Prisoner; and I open'd the Coach-door and jump'd out, Mrs. Lynnel jump'd out after me, and slipp'd down; I had no sooner help'd her up, but the Prisoner ran from the Horses Heads to the Coach door again, and cry'd, - D - mn it, where's the Man and the Woman that were in the Coach! I cry'd, here; and he laid hold of me; I took hold of him; he had a Hammer in his Hand: But a Gentleman happening to come by, assisted me, and we took him to a publick House, 'till we could get a Constable. When the Constable came, we found a Peruke under him, but he would not own it belong'd to him. This is the Hammer; and a Knife was also found in his Pocket. He beg'd hard to be let go; but the Constable secur'd him, and the next Morning when he was carry'd before Sir

I went to see what was the Matter, and found Mr. Dew and the Prisoner between the Posts and the Houses. The Prisoner said, - Where's the Man and the Woman that was in the Coach? the Prosecutor said, - I am the Man. Then the Prisoner struck him, and disengaged himself from him; but upon the Prosecutor's calling out, - (What will nobody assist in taking a Street Robber,) I seiz'd him by the Collar.</p>

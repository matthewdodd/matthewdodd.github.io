The prisoner came into my shop to buy a pair of buttons, on the 7th of November; there was another man crept in behind him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060053"></xptr> on his knees, and stripped the window of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take them?</p>
               <p>J. Jenkins. I did; that was when I went to give the prisoner change for the buttons; I cried out. Upon seeing them take the things I cried out, and they both ran away together. The prisoner aimed at the drawer to take that, as I had it out to give him change, but I snapped it in. I ran out after them and cried, Stop thief! and the neighbours pursued and took the prisoner, and brought him into the shop.</p>

            . On Tuesday night, the 7th of last November, I was at my door. I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went to see what was the matter. I met the prisoner with a pair of child's stockings in his hand. I asked him how he came by them. He said he picked them up in the kennel. I asked him if he had any thing more about him; he said, no. I took him into the shop, and upon examining him there were two pieces of silk and cotton handkerchiefs dropped from under his coat, by his side. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These were my property. (Several other things also produced.) These were picked up in the street, my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He asked me where I got them stockings; I said, I picked them up in a court where the things laid scattered about; they took me into the shop, then before a justice of the peace. I was then going to see after a place, when the gentlewoman ran out and called, Stop thief! I saw a lad run out of the shop, and scatter things all about. I ran after him and picked these things up; they were all over mud. It was not this woman but a shorter woman that came out of the shop. I went up the court with her, and picked up seven or eight stockings, and brought them into the shop; then I picked up another pair of stockings; and that gentleman asked me where I was going. I said I was going into the shop; then she came and catched hold of me in the court, and said I was the man that was in the shop, buying a pair of buttons. I was searched and no buttons found upon me.</p>

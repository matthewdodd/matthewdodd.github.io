On Friday evening, the 29th of March, I received two sovereigns from some one—in the morning of the next day I was taking a walk, and met some girls like myself—we drank together—I had my purse after I left them—part of the time it was in my bosom, and part of the time in my hand—I was out from five in the morning till six—I was at Newington-causeway at five—I was not the worse for drink till I went to the Elephant and Castle—I had my purse when I went there, which was about half<lb></lb>an-hour after I left home—I do not remember seeing the prisoner at all, till I saw him coming out of the station—I lost my purse—I cannot say how I lost it—the last time I had it safe was ten or twenty minutes after six in the morning—I was then at the Alfred's Head, near the Elephant and Castle—I had been home at night, and been to bed, and had got up—I am sure I had my purse then—I was not sober enough that night to remember what I was doing—I remember having it at that time, but I do not remember how long I had it after—I was taken to the station—the prisoner was there.</p>

On the night of the 13th of October I met the prisoner by Ratcliffe Highway—we walked down the street, and stood and talked a little while together, and then parted—in about five minutes I went to see the time, and missed my watch—I told the police—I did not give it her—I had not the least communication with her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at this house. Between eleven and twelve o'clock that night the prisoner rushed in—I said, "Why don't you come in as you ought to do?"—she told me to hold my tongue, she had got something, and said, "Will you have any thing to drink?"—I said, "No"—the landlady awoke up—she asked her to have something to drink, and she refused—the prisoner whispered to me, "I have got a watch in my bosom, "and the landlady said to me, "Take it, I will send for an of feer"—I had hardly taken it when the officer came in, and said he wanted her—he said, "It is no use, I want it"—I went to the box, and gave it to him.</p>

The two prisoners were brought to the station-house, and put into the cell; I heard Roberts ask Smith what sort of a plant she had made - Smith said an excellent good one, that she had run up the court, planted the watch under the balustrades, and covered it over with dirt - the book she have in the house, then run up stairs, and asked the woman whether she took in caps to wash, and said there was something lost in the court - that she ran in for fear of being taken, and threw her bonnet off, that she might appear as if she lived there.</p>

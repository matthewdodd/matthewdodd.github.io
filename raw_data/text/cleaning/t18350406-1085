                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Woolwich police. I went with the prosecutor to the field on the 19th, and saw six trusses of hay in an enclosure, and part of a hay-stack—I took a slip of paper, containing my report-notes, and tore off three or four pieces—I put them into the uncut part of the stack, and put one piece into each truss—I went to the field next morning, about five o'clock—the trusses were gone, also one portion of the uncut—one of my tickets laid on the ground—I went and informed Mr. Strother—I made search in the town, and on Satur<lb></lb>day morning I went to the field, and from the entrance of the field I traced tracks of hay to the prisoner's house—I called out, "Is Mr. Taylor here?" several times—I saw the stable door open—I opened it more, went in, and said, "Is Mr. Taylor here?"—nobody answered—I found the hay there—the prisoner's daughter came out and spoke to me—I went and told Mr. Strother that there was hay there, but I could not identify it—in the after<lb></lb>noon he went with me, and I found three of my tickets in it, which I had put in on Thursday night with my own handwriting upon them—the pri<lb></lb>soner's son was on the premises, and said he had purchased the hay—I took him into custody, and the father came up to me—I said I should take him, and I believe Chittendale took him into custody—I am certain the papers are the same—they are my own handwriting.</p>

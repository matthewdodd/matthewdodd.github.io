                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Ridgway, a tea-dealer in King William-street—he has no partner—the prisoner came to the shop on the 16th of December last, between three and five o'clock in the afternoon, and ordered tea and coffee, amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to be sent to Dr. J.

Brown, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., New Broad-street—he gave me the order verbally, and I took it down—he tendered this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in payment—he put it into my hand, and said if I gave him the difference he would pay me at once—I took the cheque, we sent it to the banker's, and before the young man returned the prisoner said he was going to Abchurch-lane, and would return in a few minutes if I would get the difference ready—he did not return—I found him in custody in about a fortnight or three weeks—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I have made inquiry for a person named Brown at No. 11, Broad-street, but no such person resided there—I inquired about the neighborhood—I asked the person at No. 11 if he was acquainted with a person of that name in the street—he said he was not—I did not inquire at any other house—(<hi rend="italic">cheque read</hi>—"Messrs.

Twining, on the same day, and if your Lordship will look into the deposition, you will find what time the witness says I was there, and if it was between three and five o'clock,</p>

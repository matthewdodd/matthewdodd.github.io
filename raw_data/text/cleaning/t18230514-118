On the 6th of May, about eight o'clock, at night, I left my inside Mr. Cheese's, I returned at six o'clock in the in Mr. Cheese's cottage - the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Cheese, and was disturbed between two and three o'clock in the morning by the dogs. I sleep opposite the stable. I looked out and heard the fence break. I called Mr. Cheese up - I and Harris went towards the stable, and found the door open and some fowls stolen - the laths of the hen-house were pulled down; we found a basket thirty yards from the stable, with the carpenter's tools and poultry in it - about four o'clock we were in the adjoining meadow, about a hundred yards from the premises, and saw the prisoner and another man come over the fence of Cheese's garden, we ran after him nearly a mile and at last took him in the cock loft of his mother's house - he ran through the canal cut, and was quite wet when we took him. I am certain of him; the garden is no thoroughfare.</p>

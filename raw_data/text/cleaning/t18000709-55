             sworn. - The first that I saw of the prisoner was in Earl-street; she came past a stall, where I was standing, with a soldier, about four o'clock, and went down Thames-street; she was gone about half an hour, as near as I can guess; she had no soldier with her when she came back again; she came to this stall, and asked the man if he had done her shoes; he asked her in what name they were; she said, Sarell, then she went away, and came again in about half an hour, with the child in her arms; that is the child; she stood talking with me at the stall for near half an hour, with the baby in her arms; she asked the baby if it would have a cake, and then she turned away, that was about a quarter after six; I am certain the prisoner is the same person.</p>

               <p>Bryan. I took the prisoner, about a fortnight after, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars: I am sure it was the same woman; I had no suspicion of her when I saw her with the child; when I took her, I told her she was the person that I saw carry the baby away; she said she was not the person; I took her down to the child's friends, and she was taken before the Magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Richards.) Have you seen any of the property since? - A. Yes; here is the frock and skirt; I went before the Alderman, and I walked by the side of her after the examination on Tuesday, as she went to the Compter, and she told me she had pledged them at Mr. Strangeways's, over Blackfriars-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A.No; She asked me to forgive her for taking the child; I told her I could not forgive her; she said she was in liquor at the time; I asked her if she had put them in her own name; she said, no, she had put them in her sister's name; I asked her if she had got the tickets; she said, no, she had lost them; she said her sister's name was Tibbet; when I came there, they were not in that name, they were in the name of Davis; they are my child's clothes; I have a piece of a skirt which the child has on now, there was no particular mark upon it; the frock is the same, I made them both myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much in liquor; it is the very first time I ever committed an offence of this sort.</p>

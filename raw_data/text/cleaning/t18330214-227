            . I keep a coffee and chop-house, No. 32, Lime-street. On the 6th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Casey came to me; I had seen him before - he offered me a sample of brandy and hollands; I approved of it, and was to give him 15s. a gallon - I ordered two gallons of each, and two two-gallon casks came to me, in consequence of the order, about seven o'clock the same evening; Casey and some stranger brought them - it was not Taylor; they took the casks into the coffee-room: Casey had one cask tied in a handkerchief, and the other had the other cask in a bag; they were placed in the coffee-room - I was to pay for them then; they came to 3l. - when they brought them, I desired my waiter to laste it, and he said the spirit was very good, but it was very thick and muddy, and I declined having any thing to do with it, but the other man said he had had it a long time, and I should have it for 2l., which I paid for it; at that time I believed the casks were full of liquor - I went down stairs to pay them; Casey said, "You will pay my friend, it will be all the same;" I paid his friend; they directly went away, and in about three minutes I examined the casks; I

             the hung, and put a gallon can under them; about half a pint run out of each cask into the can - I immediately got a ginblet, and bored a hole in the head of each cask, and dirty water came from it; there was rather more than four gallons of water and spirits together - I afterwards examined the casks, and found a bottle was fixed to the nose of the cask, and was fixed to the bung so that the spirits would come out at the bung, but not the water; I immediately gave information to the Police - I understood Casey was living at No. 14, White Lion-street, Norton-falgate; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140104"></xptr>Casey on the 14th, by Moorfields chapel, standing by a public-house, and I gave him in charge of my waiter while I went for an officer, and when I returned I found he had got away; he was secured the same day; I saw Taylor when we took Casey, but he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You were well acquainted with Casey? A. No, I had seen him about six times; he was introduced to me; I did not know him as a commission-agent - he did not say it was not his liquor: we were half an hour bargaining for it.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Did not you call at my house on the evening you bought the liquor? A. Yes, and saw your wife - I called in White Lion-street; I understood both the prisoners lived there; his wife told me some blackguard had been there.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Phillips. I did not see Casey when the samples were brought; I tasted them, they appeared very good - I only tasted the brandy sample; in about an hour or an hour and a half I saw Casey at master's, with a lusty man - it was not Taylor; they brought two kegs, each holding two gallons - I heard it was to be 15s. a gallon, but the Hollands was thick; Casey and the other man said they should be there in three weeks, when they would call for the kegs, and Phillips might pay them what he liked then - he gave them 2l.; immediately after they left, I went to measure it - I put a gallon can under each keg; the bunghole only ran half a pint from each - I shook the casks, and each felt quite full; we bored a hole, and to our great surprise, a great deal of dirty water came out of each cask - all the rest was dirty water; we opened the casks, found a pint-bottle was fixed to the bunghole, and glued round - the water could not affect the spirits; on the 14th I saw Casey at the bottom of Broker's-row, standing facing the

             asked if I knew him; I said "Yes, that is the man who sold the spirits" - I went up and collared him, while master went for an officer; Casey said, "Don't let me stand in the street, walk into the public-house, which I did;" Taylor was there, and said,"What do you do holding that man; does he owe you any thing?" I said "No, but he has committed a great fraud on my master" - "What," said Taylor, "I suppose you are vexed because you have been tricked: but we shall trick you again, if you don't mind;" he pulled out two pint-bottles, one out of each pocket - he drew the cork of one, and asked the landlord for a glass; he poured out what appeared to be brandy - the landlord said it was very good; he put the bottle into his pocket, then laid hold of Casey, and said, "Come along with me, and I dare that fellow to follow you" - I said, "If I can't hold you, I shall follow you;" I followed him with the intention of giving him in charge to the first officer I met - Taylor told me, about the middle of Broad-street-buildings, that if I laid my hand on him, he would knock me down; I saw master and an officer coming, and then collared Casey, and Taylor ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was the money paid to? A. Casey; the Bear is about half a mile from Lime-street.</p>

            , of Fenchurch-street. On the evening of the 7th I was at the Lamb Coffee-house, kept by Phillips; the prisoner Taylor was there - I am quite certain of him- Phillips was not in the way; Taylor asked Mrs. Phillips if Mr. Phillips was at home - she said No; he said he would wait until he came in: he sat down, had some ale and a pipe, and told me he had put them up to the scheme of selling the brandy to Phillips; I had called at his house with Phillips the night before, at No. 14 White Lion-street; he asked me what business I had to come there, and make a noise; I told him we made no noise, that Phillips sent there to inquire after Casey - he said he had put them up to it; that he should not have known that he sold it to Phillips if they had not gone there the night they sold it, and insulted his wife; he said he went to the public-house that the party who was not in custody used, and had put up three half-pints of gin to his score; he said that the casks cost 6s. - he left before Phillips came home.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Was not I smoking a pipe with the ale before me before you came in? A. No, he had been drinking, and was not quite sober, or he might not have said this: he knew what he said I should think.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Casey on the 14th, in Liverpool-street - Phillips charged him with felony; I detained him - he said he hoped he should not be charged with felony, and walked quietly away with me - I took Taylor in Guildhall-yard; he had been to visit Casey in the Compter, and walked with him from there to Guildhall - he said he was Casey's master; I said, "I hope you will come and get your servant out of trouble?" he said he would, but when he got to the corner he started off - I told Phillips, and in about two hours I saw him behind a chariot, and secured him.</p>

               <p>Taylor. When he came to the Compter he found me there: I said Casey was selling goods for me, and if he was in trouble I would walk with him to Guildhall - I went and waited outside - he said, "Walk in with me," and the Magistrate asked if I had been seen in the transaction till he had apprehended Casey - he said not; the Magistrate said he should bind me over as a witness, and afterwards that he would hold us to bail; I knew nothing of it till after it occurred - I went home about eleven o'clock; my wife said a person had been there about some brandy - on the following day I found Phillips lived in Lime-street, and went there to have an explanation; I waited two hours for him, and as it was getting late I returned - on the 14th, when Casey was given in charge, I said, "Does he owe you any thing, for if he does I will pay you?" he said No, he had defrauded his master; I said, "Have you any authority to take him?" he said No; I said, "Well, we may as well walk on towards home then," and in the street, the officer came and took him into custody - instead of my running away as they say, I went to the Bear, and waited two hours, thinking it might be settled.</p>

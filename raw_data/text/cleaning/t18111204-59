            . I am a patrol. On Saturday, the 16th of November, about seven o'clock I stopped the prisoner in the Commercial Road, he was resting this lead in a bag, I asked him what he had got in the bag, he said he had got a bit of stuff, I said, what is it, he said, it is a hit of lead, I asked him where he got it from, he said he found it in a hole near the first rope ground in the Commercial Road; I asked him what he was, he said he was a journeyman carpenter. I secured him and the lead.</p>

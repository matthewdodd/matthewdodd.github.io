I said I was going home I hoped - my bag and money were in my trouser's pocket, which was unbuttoned; the bag was safe when I left the wharf, in Thames-street, and I had come straight from there; this happened about fifty or one hundred yards from Barking-church-yard - I went no where with her; the moment I said I was going home, two men came up arm-in-arm, and gave me a violent blow, which turned me round, and that presented my pocket close to the prisoner; I did not feel the bag taken - I stood a moment, thinking whether I should follow the men; I turned round again, and walked as far as the pump - I put my hand into my pocket, and my bag was gone; I thought the prisoner must have done it - she had then gone away; she had a bonnet on, but no veil - I only saw her a short time, but am positive she is the person - I instantly turned back, went round the corner into Trinity-square, and overtook her in the square; I touched her arm, and said, "Young woman, you have robbed me;" she looked me in the face and said, "I never saw you before;" I called a watchman, who came - she was then sitting on some steps; she was taken to the watch-house - the watchman produced my bag without my money, except 1s.; the money was not in the bag when shown to me - I had no mark on the money; when the watchman came up, he found a sovereign on the steps where she sat - I saw him take it up; the prisoner did not claim it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Stollard with the prisoner, about half-past ten o'clock, at the end of Cooper's-row - she was on the steps of Allhallows workhouse; he charged her with robbing him - she declared she had not seen him, and knew nothing of his property; when she got up to go with me I found a sovereign on the step, directly under where she had been sitting; the officer of the night searched her at the watch-house, I was not present - after returning to my beat I found an old leather purse or bag, empty, ten or twelve yards from the steps where she had sat; she said she had an infant five months old - it was not with her; I searched further, and on the window-cill of the workhouse, about as high as I could reach, I found 12s. 6d. - the window was three or four yards from the steps - she must have put it there before I came up, if she did at all; there were two half-crowns, seven shillings, and a sixpence.</p>

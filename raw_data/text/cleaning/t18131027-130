He said, I had been an hour; I said I had not. I had a bundle under my arm; he said, then my master was very ill indeed; he said, you must give me the bundle, go back, and tell your master to come to my master directly; he gave me two-pence. I thought a good while, and gave him the bundle; I thought he had come from the place at whose house I was going to take the bundle to. I walked a little way, and I thought I had done wrong; he run across the road, down Leather-lane; I run after him, and holloaed out stop thief; he was stopped in Leather-lane; he chucked the bundle down; a groom picked it up. I knew it to be the same bundle that I carried. The prisoner was taken to Hatton Garden office.</p>

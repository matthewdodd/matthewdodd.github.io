            . On the Sunday the fire happened in Cornhill, between nine and ten in the evening, I went to see if it was out; I stood in <placeName id="t17730707-29-crimeloc164">Lombard-street</placeName>

               <p>- Squires. I am a constable and fireman: the prisoners were given into my charge on Sunday night the 6th of June, at the fire; I took them to the Compter and searched them, and up Cornet's back I found this red and white handkerchief (producing it).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is like mine, it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Squires. I saw the prisoners together several times at it.</p>

               <p>We had been down to Tower-hill to see an acquaintance, and came to look at the fire, and the young fellow and Squires laid hold of us.</p>
               <p>He called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

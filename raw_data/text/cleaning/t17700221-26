            . I am a journeyman to the prosecutor. He is a watch and clock spring maker. I went to work about a quarter after five that morning. I found the street door a-jar. I knocked at it, and my master's son came down. He went up to tell his father that the door was found open, and came down with a lights: then we found the house had been broke open, and ransacked in the same manner as my master has said.</p>

            . Colebeck, Murphy, and I broke this house open; about one o'clock that morning Colebeck and I tried to wrench open the shutter; but could not: then we went to the area and wrenched open a shutter there: then he desired me to hand him over the burner from the lamp, which I did. Murphy was standing by the watch-house to watch. I brought out a clock, silver spoons, a punch ladle, and several things that I cannot recollect; then Colebeck took and carried them to

            . I belong to the Rotation at Whitechapel. I took the prisoner as he was going to his lodgings in Holloway-Lane. I took him to an alehouse, and then searched his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he lodged there?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I was there informed so. He lodged with one Bush that had been an accomplice of his before; under his pillow I found this pistol (producing a pocket pistol) under the suit of clothes that the prisoner has now on, and in a box in the same room was this hand crow. (Producing an iron crow about eight or nine inches long, with two claws). I found also this stock and two center bits (produced in court, one of the bits bigger than the other), and this brass box with tinder, flint and steel (produced in court ): when I brought them to the alehouse to him, said he, I hope you have not meddled with my toggs ( meaning his clothes). I asked him if the clothes were his; he said, Yes. Then I went and took them, and found the buttons were all plate. (I thought they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210014"></xptr> might be some matter of evidence). He was taken to the Justice, and his clothes were returned him.</p>

            . I went with the prisoner to Justice Welch's. I carried the clothes there. The evidence and he were both put to the bar together. The Justice said to Crookhall, Now ask him whether he knows any thing of Mr. Nightengall's house being robbed. Crook-hall asked him and bid him speak the truth; he said he did, and that he was down the area, and he also had two guineas of the money, for what the things and clock were sold for; that they had from Mr. Nightengall's the man of the house where he lodged, who was taken up and examined but was set at liberty. He gets his living in the same way. He is in no visible way of getting his bread.</p>

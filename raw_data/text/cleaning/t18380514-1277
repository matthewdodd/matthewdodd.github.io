                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Stanborough, a labourer, and live in Richmond-buildings, Kingsland. I knew the prisoner for three weeks, by his coming backwards and forwards to the house—I sent him on the 28th of April for a quartern loaf, he got it, and asked me if he should take it up stairs to my room—I told him no, as the stairs were clean, but to put it on the stairs—he made some hesitation, and seemed to wish to take it up—I told him to take it up, and put it on the sideboard—I had a ring on the mantel-piece in that room, which I missed a quarter of an hour after he was gone—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the prisoner's uncle lodges in the house, he is a doll-maker, and respectable in his trade.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Charles Butler Harris, he is my master and brother, and keeps a shop in Nicholas-lane; he sells cocoa, tea, and coffee. I have known the prisoner upwards of a month—he is a watch-patrol—he asked me to take some tea from my brother without his knowledge—he came to me one night, and said there had been a man there who, when he came home drunk, used to give him some tea, not to say any thing about it—I told my brother, and he told me perhaps he was doing it to try my honesty, and to take something and offer to him, if be came again—I took some cocoa and offered to him—he took it—he put it into his pocket, and took it off home—he was taken the last time he came, and the tea was found upon him.</p>

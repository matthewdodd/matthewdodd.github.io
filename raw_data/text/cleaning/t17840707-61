             had got the prisoner by the collar, I asked the prisoner what he wanted there, he told me he came there to sleep, I told Williams to take him to the watch-house, and I found this key of the iron house, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it? - About three or four yards from the door of the iron house, under the knee of the head of a ship; then I got a light, and went into the house and found the other keys, there is a partition, the padlock was unlocked, and the keys were thrown among the nails; I think this is the key of the padlock; these keys are locked up in the foreman's counting-house every night, of which this is the key, and the labourer goes round to see that they are all locked; I then went to the counting house, which is on the other side the yard, separate from the iron house, and I found the lock strained off from the door; this hempen bag I found full of nails, I know it to be my father's property; I have no share in the house.</p>
               <p>Court. How many bags were there in the counting house full of nails? - Six or seven.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on the sack? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I took the prisoner in the iron-house, I heard a noise in the house, and I called out who is there, but no body made me any answer, I secured the door with some large paving stones which happened to be by and got a light, I heard a person run to the other end of the lost when I called out, I heard the nails rattle under his feet, and I heard the bag moved.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not it be moved by the running? - No, my Lord, it was so heavy.</p>
               <p>Can you say what bag of nails he moved? - One bag was moved from all the rest, I was in the lost that afternoon, and secured the lost door, I found the keys of the counting-house and of the nail lost laying down near the door at the bottom, these are the keys of the nail lost which I secured in the counting-house, which I carried into the counting-house, that evening, they were near the end of the head of the ship, the key of the padlock was there that opens the inner lost, I am positive sure I heard him in the lost trying to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in besides yourself? - No, I locked the door all the evening.</p>
               <p>Had you the key of the door all that time? - No, they are carried into the counting-house to the foreman at six o'clock who carried them home to his house, he is here.</p>
               <p>What difference was there between the situation of this sack of nails and the rest? - The foreman had that day ordered me to separate the nails which I did, there were two bags of them they weighed 168 pounds at least or more, when I went away I set them up an end one bag against the other, when I found them the bag was thrown down, it was moved about the length of the bag, by turning it down he had rolled it over.</p>
               <p>Court. If a man was to run with great violence against the bag might not he knock it down? - A man would fall before the bag.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But if it was possible for a man to knock it down would it not fall in the same position? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the door he was trying to get out at? - Yes, but I heard them fall before I attacked him, I was about five or six yards distance, I was going past the lost at the time.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He made no defence in the world, but said he knew nothing about it, and he came there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Mr. Meriton the elder had any bags there that were not his own? - Not that I know off.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Meriton. I ask you the same question? - No, Sir, I am sure of it, the nails were never opened, the bags were all filled with iron nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070089"></xptr>Court to Williams. Do you know whether on that day these bags were filled with nails and that bag in particular? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether the nails were not in the middle of the lost? - No they were supported by the lost side.</p>

               <p>About nine o'clock a girl asked me to go with her, she took me to this place, I laid down, I was asleep when this man came, I awoke and saw nothing of the girl, and when I awoke I told this man I did not know where I was, says he you want to rob the place, and they came and took me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gates of our yard were locked, and there is a possibility of a man's coming through the ruins of a fire that we had about three months ago.</p>

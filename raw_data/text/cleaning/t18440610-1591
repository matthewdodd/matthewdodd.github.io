                  </hi>. I am sixty-two years old—I am not in business, and live in Bartholomew-terrace, Essex-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—the prisoner is my nephew. On Sunday, the 21st of April, I had in a cupboard in my bed-room up stairs a tin cash-box, about fourteen inches long, about eight wide, and about six deep—I saw it last about eleven o'clock on Sunday morning before I went to church—the prisoner knew I kept it there, for when I was ill he has been to see me several times, when I have taken it out and put it in that place—when I went to church I left my wife at home to cook the dinner—I returned about five or ten minutes after one o'clock—after dinner I sat reading the Bible for an hour or an hour and a half—I remained in the house till about a quarter to five—the cash-box contained two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., eight sovereigns, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, some bonds and shares, a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill of exchange, another for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which the prisoner was the acceptor; also some leases and deeds—we keep no servant, and no one lives in the house but my<lb></lb>self and wife—the prisoner and his wife came to visit us that afternoon, about five o'clock I believe—I was out at the time, and found them there when I I came in—I did not exactly expect him—after tea, my wife and the prisoner's wife went to chapel, about half-past six o'clock—there are two keys to my front door, one kept by my wife, and one by myself—hers hung on the screw of the knocker, and mine on the bolt of the door—after our wives had gone to chapel we sat and talked a little, and he pressed me very much to go out—I wished not to go, but by his wish I went—it was about twenty minutes to seven o'clock—we went across by Robinson's house, up Coven<lb></lb>try-street, up Pitt-street, into Bethnal-green-road, and to the Sun brewery beer-shop—we stayed there about half an hour, and then left together—I turned to go the same way, down Pitt-street, and be wished not, because it was a drearisome road, and he wished to go round the Cambridge road—I directly consented—we went along Bethnal<lb></lb>green-road, and a little way down the Kingsland-road—I walk very slow—I was very lame that day—just after we got round the Salmon and Ball, by the trees, he said he wanted to go into Cleveland-street—I said, "Well, you go if you wish," and he put his hands to his coat, and set off at full run-away from me—I continued my way home very gently, because the crowd was very great in the Cambridge-road—when I got home I did not find any one in—the front door was locked—I unlocked it with my key, and went in—it took me from ten to twelve minutes to walk from the trees, where I parted with the prisoner, to my house—I did not make any discovery at first when I got in—when I had been in a short time, the prisoner came to the window, stood before it, and looked in at me—I went and let him in—he said "What, are they not come from chapel"—I said, "No, they will not come from chapel till half-past eight o'clock"—he then sat down—but previous to that,</p>

               <p>almost immediately, on coming in, I had been out in the yard, and saw that the back door was open, which I had left fastened by two bolts inside—I was in the yard when he came and looked in at the window—opposite the back door there is a little sort of wicket-gate, that was fastened with a bolt and a string—I found that string broken, and the bolt was open—when he came in he seemed very trembling and very queer, but I did not take any notice—we sat for ten minutes or so, and he said he wished they would come home from chapel—I said, "They will not come home just yet, you will take some supper before you go"—he said, "No, I should wish to go home as soon as they come in"—I said, "Well take this pot, and go to the corner, and get some ale or porter; you will take some refreshment before you go"—he went, and I was out in the yard, putting the shutters to, when he came back—he knocked, I said, "I am coming directly"—he gave a very loud knock, as if he was going to knock the door down—I was very cross with him, and said, "What did you knock so very loud for?"—he seemed very much agitated, and said he wished they would come home—he constantly repeated that—my wife and his came home, I think, about twenty-five mi<lb></lb>nutes after eight—as soon as they came in, he jumped up, and said, "We will be off home"—my wife said, "Do take something before you go home, you have got far to go"—he said, "O no, we don't want anything at all"—my wife said his wife should have something if he did not, and she said she would take a little—she took a glass of half-and-half, or something, and a crust of bread and cheese, and he took some himself; but he got up twice during the time, he was so agitated and wishing to go—my wife pressed him, and said, "Do have it comfortably"—they went soon afterwards, I think, from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after they returned from chapel—I went up to bed about a quarter to ten—directly I got up into my bed-room, I noticed that the cupboard was burst open, and my cash-box gone—I had been into my bed-room about six that afternoon, and the cupboard door was then shut and safe—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner with his hand on two spoons, a silver one and a plated salt-spoon, on the mantel<lb></lb>piece—I looked at him, and he said, "Here are two spoons here"—I said, "How came they there? my mistress never put them on the mantel-piece, I am sure;" and he took his hand off them—previous to our going out, he said he had taken some goods home to Osborne-street, to the amount of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the gentleman was gone into the country that was to have written the check, and had forgotten it; and he was very short of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "If you are very short of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will lend you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for to-morrow, if it is sure"—he said, "No, no, don't go up stairs for it, if I want it, I will come for it to-morrow"—he never came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Robinson. On Sunday after<lb></lb>noon, the 21st of April, I was at the window of our room on the first floor—I know the prisoner by sight—the first time I saw him was about ten or or eleven months since, at the time of his wedding, which took place from Mr. Dearlove's house—I have seen him three or four times since then, four I believe—I saw him about half-past six o'clock on the Sunday evening, come out with Mr. Dearlove, and go by, as I supposed, to chapel—about three quarters of an hour, or it might be an hour after, I saw the prisoner return alone—he came past our window, and went to Mr. Dearlove's door—he made two attempts to open it, with a key I suppose, and with the third attempt he got in and shut the door after him—I am quite certain he is the man—I had noticed a woman that afternoon walking to and fro, and round the church di<lb></lb>rectly opposite our house—when the prisoner went into the house I lost sight of the woman, and saw no more of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the silk trade, and live at No. 2, Pearl-street, Spi<lb></lb>talfields. I know the prisoner—he has been to my place several times—I saw him on Sunday evening, the 21st of April, in the Dog-row, which is now I think called the Cambridge-road—it is the road with the Salmon and Ball</p>

               <p>at the corner, between that and the Bethnal-green-road—he was speaking to an old gentleman about a hundred yards from the railway road, nearer to Whitechapel—I should suppose it was between seven and eight o'clock, but I cannot say, for I had no particular reason why I should take that notice—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the prosecutor</hi>)—that is about the size of the old gentleman he was speaking to, but I cannot say—I did not take any particular notice—he left the old gentleman, and came and tapped me on the shoulder on the other side of the way as I was looking over the gardens—he commenced asking me about my son, who was a companion of his at one time, but is now gone to sea—Ryan was with me—I was going towards Red Cow-lane, and he walked with me—he had left the old gentleman just by the four or five trees—I was going towards the Mile-end-road, not towards the Salmon and Ball—I had come out with my friend, and was taking a walk—I know Cleve<lb></lb>land-street—that is what I call Red Cow-lane—I was going towards that, and Ryan with me—the prisoner walked with me that way—he did not run from the old gentleman—I did not see him till he tapped me on the shoulder after I saw him on the other side—I cannot say whether he ran across—I saw him go to a house on the left hand side in Cleveland-street, near the end of it going into Mile-end-road—he was about to bid me good bye—he rang a bell, and said he was going in there—he rang it a second time, and I bid him good evening—Ryan was with me the whole time—I did not observe what became of the prisoner after he had rung the bell twice—I went on taking my walk with my friend, and left him at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Cross-street, Church-street, Shoreditch, and am a weaver's harness-maker. I remember being with Mr. Duff on Sun<lb></lb>day evening, the 21st of April, in the Dog-row—I do not know that it is called the Cambridge-road—the railway crosses it—it leads to Mile-end-gate one way, and to Hackney the other—I saw a young man and an old gentleman talking, but I did not take any particular notice of them—they were strangers to me—the old gentleman was much such a person as the prose<lb></lb>cutor, but he was not dressed as he is now, nor had the young man the same</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100093"></xptr>
               <p>sort of dress on the prisoner has now—the young man crossed over, and spoke to Duff—I did not hear their conversation—I walked on—I was about five or six yards from them—we went up Red-cow-lane, which is now called Cleveland-street—the young man went up Cleveland-street with us—I walked behind him and Mr. Duff—they walked together I should say be<lb></lb>tween fifty and sixty yards up Cleveland-street, and the young man stopped at a house there, and made an attempt to pull the bell, but I kept walking on to look at some new houses—I saw him stretch out his hand to pull the bell—that was on the left hand side of the street, and towards the middle of it I should say, but I was busy looking at the new houses—it was no business of mine, and I took no notice, as he was a stranger to me—that was all I saw—I walked on about my business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time in the evening was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock, for when I came round Whitechapel, and looked at the London Hospital clock, it wanted a minute or two to eight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I lost my great coat on the 1st of January, about five o'clock; the night being dark my coat was in a single horse cart; I was leading the horse; my boy was behind on foot; it was a jockey cart. My boy saw the prisoner take the coat out of the cart; he told me and pointed to the man; I followed him; he dropped the coat before I got to him. There were three of them together; the prisoner was in the middle. I saw the man in middle drop the coat; I continued following him until I overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he is one of the three that you followed, and dropped the coat - A. Yes; after the boy pointed him out to me I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I was following my master's cart: master was leading the horse. I saw the prisoner take the coat out of the cart; I told my master immediately; he run after him. He had not gone far when I poined him out; there was nobody close to him when he took it. I saw master lay hold of him. I am sure it was the same man. I am sure the man I pointed out and the man he took is the prisoner.</p>

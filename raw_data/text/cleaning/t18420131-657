                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. William James Chap<lb></lb>lin, coach proprietor, of the Swan-with-Two-Necks Inn, Lad-lane; I have the management and superintendence of the money in the office. On Monday, the 10th of January, there was a cash-box in the desk in the counting, house, containing three bills of exchange, not due—one for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were four others which were of no value, as the parties had been bankrupts—three of them were for 12<hi rend="italic">l,.</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and one for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had been lying in the cash-box several years, as far back as 1837 or 1838—I think there were eight cheques on our bankers, Messrs. Glynn, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes, and four sovereigns, my own money—there was also a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns and silver, making 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the property of my employer—I missed the box about eight o'clock, on the evening of the 10th—I had seen it safe about one o'clock, when I had occasion to use it, to go to the corn-market—I was sitting in the counting-house till near seven o'clock, and had occasion, from pressure of public business, to go into our public office, and left the keys in my desk—on my return, I went to the desk, and immediately missed the box—the desk was open, and the keys were in the lock—on the evening of the following day, the 11th, I saw part of the property again, in the possession of the policeman Hunt—I do not know any thing of the prisoner, he was not in our employment.</p>

On the 10th of January, near eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the bar, and asked for a glass of brandy and water, and change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him I had not got it, because I never gave strangers change—he kept it—I saw that it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—I saw no other property that he had—he said, while he was at the bar, he must have change of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, for he had just lit his pipe with one—he made quite a smile of it—he appeared to be sober.</p>

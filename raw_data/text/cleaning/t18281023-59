            . I am a watchman. Between one and two o'clock in the morning I saw the prosecutor and prisoner together; the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about - he had hold of the prisoner, and charged her with robbing him of three half-crowns and a shilling; she said she had taken no money, but did take the box, and he might have it if he liked: the prosecutor gave the same account he has now - she said she did not intend to steal it; I opened the box - there was nothing in it. I knew the prisoner before; a man came up to her in the street, and wanted to speak to her; I would not let him, and he knocked the prosecutor down.</p>
               <p> - HORTON. I took the prisoner, and searched her as far as decency would allow, but I knew by her position she had something about her - I could not get a woman to search her, and from a certain part of her person I took three half-crowns and a shilling, which I gave to Noyes, who is not here.</p>

I was in the shop when she came home, between eight and nine in the evening, with this man; they went up stairs together; after they had been there about five minutes she called upon the stairs to know if the bed was ready; I went up the stairs and she gave a bag into my hand, and desired me to take care of it; it was a linen bag; I believe there were in it two guineas, two half guineas, and a quarter guinea. A little after that I heard her scream and make a noise, and she was sent to the Round-house; she sent a message to me from the Round-house to make away with the bag; I threw it away.</p>

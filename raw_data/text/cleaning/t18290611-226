               <p>RICHARD RICHARDSON. On the 7th of May I lost a handkerchief, as I was at the back of the Islington stage; it had been in my inside coat pocket - I did not miss it till I got home; I know I had it when I was at the Royal Exchange, at four o'clock - I afterwards saw it in the possession of the officer.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . On the afternoon of the 7th of May, I saw the Islington stage go by - the prisoner was behind it; he put his hand into the gentleman's pocket and took out this handkerchief - I went and took it from him and gave it to Mr. Powell, who put it into his pocket, and went to get the officer; I know this to be the handkerchief.</p>

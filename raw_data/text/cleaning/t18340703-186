               <p>COURT. Q. They were perfect strangers to you - they came up - one held you, and the other put his hand in your pocket? A. Yes - Schofield came up; he was knocked down and myself too.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. You had charged them with attempting to rob you? A. I felt their hands in my pocket - I had not been drinking for five hours before - I am seventy years old, and had been nine miles that day - the prisoners pretended to see me home, and Schofield said he would see me home - I was perfectly sober.</p>

On Saturday, the 11th of July, I had been to the Opera, and re<lb></lb>turned about twelve o'clock at night—I found my room in order, just as I had left it when I dressed to go to the Opera—I went to my club to get tea, leaving every thing safe—I did not lock the room-door—I shut it, and at the time I went out a Captain Cape came in, but the outer door was shut—I heard it shut to after me—I returned from my club about two o'clock, and found two policemen, the two porters of the house, the maid-servant, and Mr. Lane, in possession of the room, and property worth at least 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was gone—there were articles of apparel, Bank-notes, gold coin, half-sovereigns, gloves, boots, and other property—a reward of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered—on the 24th of July I accompanied the officer, when Miles was apprehended, to the crossing of the street, near Leicester-square—a pair of straw-coloured kid gloves were taken from him at the station-house—they were exactly the description of gloves which I threw on the table when I left the room—I could not exactly swear to them—Miles was asked where he got them—he said he had them given to him—I was shown a pair of boots and shoes be<lb></lb>fore that—I was present when Bennett was taken into custody—I saw a shirt, a hat, a pair of stockings, and a duplicate taken from him—Miles was taken before the Magistrate on Saturday morning, having been appre<lb></lb>hended on Friday night—he was remanded till the next Saturday—Ben<lb></lb>nett was taken before the Magistrate on the Monday—Inspector Covington asked the Magistrate to remand him (having found property of mine on him) till the Saturday to which Miles had been remanded—I heard the Magistrate, after a statement Bennett made, say he would not take that down—he said he should keep that till he was brought up for another examination.</p>

I remember the officers coming to search—I had before that seen Miles at the house—he came and knocked at the door one day—it was about a week before the officers came—he asked for the name of William Ashley—I let him in—he went straight up to Ashley's room—there was a young man with him who I should not know—Miles had a dark coat and trowsers on—I did not no<lb></lb>tice the dress of the other—I saw the men come down again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and the man who is not here carried a bundle—Miles went down with him—they both went out together—they went up to the room as if they knew it.</p>

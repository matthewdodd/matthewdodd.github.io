Hardy's, 125, New Bond-street, made against him, in consequence of which Mr. Alderman Gibbs told us to take him to Marlborough-street Police-court, the district where the burglary was committed—I went with him, and there was a charge of burglary made against him there—he was remanded for a week—I went there again on 2nd May, and he was not there then—he could not be found—I did not see him again till 29th.</p>

On Wednesday, 29th May, Storey was brought to my house, in Bow-lane—I examined his head—it was covered with blood, and his hair was saturated with blood—on the upper part of the back part of his head I found a ragged, bruised wound, about an inch and a half or two inches long—the skin was completely separated, and it was bleeding very much—it had perhaps been bleeding more than when I saw it—I think such an instrument as this would produce such a wound—I did what was necessary at the time, and have not seen him professionally since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the City police. I visited Storey on the afternoon of 29th May, about four o'clock, at his home—he was in bed—I examined his bead, and found that he had received a contused wound, of more than an inch in extent, at the. upper and back-part of his head—he appeared to have lost a large quantity of blood, judging from his clothes—he complained of dimness of the sight, and noise in the ears, clearly indi<lb></lb>cating that the brain had sustained a very severe shock of some kind—he has remained under my care to this day, and still complains of those symptoms,</p>

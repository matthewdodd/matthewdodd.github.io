                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Andrews, and live in Ocean-street, Stepney, very little way from Mrs. Bruton. On the 11th of January, about half-past twelve or a quarter to one o'clock, my attention was called to her house, and I saw two men come out, and bolt the door after them—the prisoner was one of them, and Boxer the other—the pri<lb></lb>soner had a very large bundle—I should not have noticed them, but a gentleman who was passing at the time directed my attention to them—I looked particularly at the prisoner—he was the first of the two that passed me—I looked at his face distinctly—they went up Church-row—I knocked at Mrs. Bruton's house, and found nobody at home—I then went next door, and stated what I had seen—I afterwards saw Mrs. Bruton on her return home, went up stairs with her, and found every thing in confusion—had known the prisoner before for years, and knew his father and mo<lb></lb>ther—he lived in the neighbourhood, and I saw him frequently—my hus<lb></lb>band</p>

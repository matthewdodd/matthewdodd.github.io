               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not to pay you the cash at the end of the month? A. No: I told him he must bring me back money or goods.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Bow-lane - the prisoner lodged about a month with me, and left the day before the prosecutor called, which was on the Monday; he only had a sleeping-room - no warehouse; I never knew him in any business - he paid me 6s. 6d. a week for his room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I leave of my own accord, or was I turned out? A. He was turned out on the Sunday; I should not object to his taking a friend into my parlour, to speak to him, but it was our room - he did not breakfast or sup there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not let it to him as a warehouse? A. No.</p>

Dundas has known me for fourteen years, and is it to be supposed he would trust me, without knowing me - of course he had faith in me by giving me credit; I owe him for the goods and will pay him - I took it for granted he meant cash at the end of the month.</p>

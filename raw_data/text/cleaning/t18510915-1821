I missed about 21/2 cwt.—I taw them again the same day at Bow station, in the possession of Storey—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know them by their being burnt, and smelling of cheese they were burnt in a fire, and there was a chese-floor underneath—I packed and sorted them myself.</p>

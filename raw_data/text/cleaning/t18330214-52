            . I am in the service of the prosecutor. On the 17th of January I was cleaning the second floor window; I saw the prisoner on the area steps with this basket, which had the tea-pot and milk-pot in it, but I did not see them in it - I saw the basket, it is a fruit basket; I ran down stairs, and missed from the pantry the tea-pot and milk-pot - I went after the prisoner and found him in custody of a Policeman; in my way back from the place where the prisoner had been stopped, to the prosecutor's, I received the same basket which I had seen the prisoner with in the area, and in it I found this tea-pot and milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No; I had a down view at him - the area gate is always kept locked; I cannot tell whether it was open on that occasion or not - he pulled the gate too, but I do not know whether it was closed; I lost sight of him, but for not more than five minutes - I had a sufficient side-view of his face to be able to know him.</p>

            . I am a servant, and live in Gordon-place, Tavistock-square. On the morning of the 17th of January, a little after eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another person at the corner of Ansley-street; the prisoner had a flag basket, and was doubling it up - the other man had a sailor's jacket on; I passed the prosecutor's house again about half-past eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner coming up the steps with the same basket hanging down which I had seen him with before, and it seemed rather heavier - I made a pause, and had a great mind to stop him; he crossed from one side to the other, and then ran - I ran after him, crying Stop thief! not knowing whether he had stolen any thing or not - while I was pursuing him he threw the basket, containing the milk-pot, tea-pot, and some lemons over the enclosure, and these articles fell out of it; I saw a fishmonger's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140037"></xptr>servant, whom I had known for some years - I told him to mind it; I ran after the prisoner, and found him in custody of a Policeman, about a hundred yards further - we returned and received the property; the other man who was with the prisoner ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? A. In a dark jacket, with either white or pearl buttons; I had not known him before - I lost sight of him about two minutes; I stopped and took up the things when he threw them down, and gave them to the other person.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PAINE (Police-constable E 1). I heard the cry, and saw the prisoner running; I stopped him - he said he knew nothing about it; I asked what he was running away for - he said nothing at all; I took him back to Tavistock-square, and saw the parties coming after him - these are the property.</p>
               <p>MR. JACOB MONTEFIORE. These are my property; I had used these articles at breakfast on the 17th of January, about ten o'clock - I suppose the tea-pot is worth 9l., and the cream-ewer, 2l. or 3l.; I live at No. 24, Tavistock-square - I keep the house, and pay the rent and taxes; it is in the parish of St. Pancras - I do not know the prisoner; I know these articles by the maker's name on them, and by a dent or two on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer did not stop me, but a man who owed me a grudge did; he winked at the officer, and said it was all right; and when he got back to the house he told the servant to go and see if they had lost any thing - she went down and brought up some spoons; she said the gate was locked and the kitchen door shut, and I must have got over the rails.</p>

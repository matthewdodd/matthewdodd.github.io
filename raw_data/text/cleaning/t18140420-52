               <p>Q. Was it merely putting his arms round, or did he close your arms down - A. It was putting his arms between mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it prevent your arms from acting freely as you could have done before - A. Yes, he confined my arms. As soon has he had left me I missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider him doing any violence to your person, or was it in a friendly way - A. I am sure it was not in a friendly way. He ran up the yard, and I followed him for the space of ten yards; he then turned back; I caught him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find upon him - A. Nothing. I have not found my pocket-book at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took it - A. I know, because half a minute before I put my hand to my pocket-book; I found it was there. It was only the distance of crossing the yard; the prisoner accosted me. I felt my pocket-book half a minute before.</p>
               <p>Q. And in this pocket-book was a five-pound note - A. Yes; I had seen that five-pound note in my pocket-book about six o'clock, on board my own vessel. I was by myself; I doubled it up, and put it in my pocket-book, and put my pocket-book in my waistcoat pocket. I missed it instantly he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear it was the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes.</p>

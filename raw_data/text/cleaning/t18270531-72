            . I am a watchman. I heard a cry of Stop thief! about half-past twelve, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner; he gave her in charge for taking 18s. or 18s. 6d. from his pocket; she said nothing; he was holding her hands, one of which was closed, and I found in it two half-crowns and thirteen shillings; she did not say how she came by it.</p>

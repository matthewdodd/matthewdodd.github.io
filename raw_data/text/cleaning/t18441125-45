                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and my place of business is with my brothers in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street. My private residence is No. 23, Hanover-square—on Sunday, the 6th of Oct. last I left home about eight o'clock in the evening, to visit a friend, named Goodbairn, who lived near the Middlesex Hospital—it is the last house but one in Mortimer-street—he was not at home—finding him absent, I thought of going to spend the evening with Mr. Davison, a friend of mine, in Piccadilly—I walked to the end of Mortimer-street, and down Goodge-street, to take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or omnibus, as there were not any where I was—that brought me to the corner of Goodge-street, in Tottenham-court-road—I just looked about for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or an omnibus, and saw the prisoner—he was very respectably dressed—he had on a white great coat, and an umbrella in his hand—he seemed to me to be looking for something, and said to me, "Are you looking for anything, sir?" or just that question—I said yes, I was looking for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or an omnibus to go to Piccadilly—this was at the corner of Goodge-street in Tottenham-court-road, exactly at the corner</p>

               <p>not hear it—after that I left the house—there are two doors—the count<lb></lb>ing-house consists of two houses—one stands backwards, and the other forwards—I came in by the backward door, and went out through the other door—I did all I could to avoid the prisoner, and for that occasion I escaped him, and went home—on the following morning, at seven o'clock, before dressing, I put on a dressing-gown, went to my brother, John Louis, who was in bed, and told him what had happened to me—he gave me advice how to act in case I ever saw the prisoner again—on the Friday week following, the 15th of Nov., I was walking home from the Counting-house with my brother Amedee Francis Mieville, who had been told what had happened to me, and saw the prisoner at the same place that I had seen him in on the 5th, close by the door—I pointed him out to my brother, and said, "That is the man; I shall get a policeman to take him up"—I got a policeman, who followed me, and I walked close to the pri<lb></lb>soner, but he said nothing at all to me—he did not appear to know me then—I passed him close once or twice—I then gave him in charge to the policeman—I told the policeman, in his hearing, that I charged him with robbing me—the prisoner did not answer anything then—we all walked to the station, and then the prisoner said he was surprised that we had him arrested; that he did not know us, and had never seen either of the gen<lb></lb>tlemen before, speaking of my brother and myself—I said to him, "Did not you follow me to the counting-house last Tuesday week?"—he said, "No, I never followed you anywhere; I do not even know where your counting-house is, or anything about you."</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor and Mr. J. L. Mieville are my younger brothers—I am married, and have a large family—I live at No. 32, Notting-hill-place. On Wednesday, the 6th of Nov., my younger brother made a communication to me of something that had hap<lb></lb>pened to him—I was in his company on Friday afternoon, the 15th of Nov., about a quarter past four or a quarter to five o'clock, coming from my office—at one of the arches leading to the Bank, my brother pointed out the prisoner to me—he was given in charge of a policeman as soon as we could find one, and taken to the station-house—when the charge was made against him at the station, he said that he had never seen either of the gentlemen before in his life, meaning me and my brother—I believe on that my brother said to him, "Did not you follow me to Angel-court?"—he said, "No, sir, I never saw you in my life," or "never saw you before," or something of that sort—he might have said, "I don't know your counting-house," or something of that kind—my recollection is not perfect on the subject.</p>

Q.</hi> Did I say anything about the counting-house in the street, when you came up to me and gave me into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were given into custody, and never spoke till the policeman asked my brother what he charged you with—he charged you with having robbed him—you did not speak till the inspector asked you a few questions at the station, "What have you got to say against these two gentlemen's charge against you? "—you said, "I never saw either of these gentlemen before"—the inspector took it all down in writing—the inspector or my brother asked, "Did not you follow me" or "that gentleman, to his office?" and you said, no, you never did.</p>

               <p>last—I was on the stand in Tottenham-court-road on that evening—I was called off the stand by somebody.</p>

On a Sunday evening, a few weeks back, I was first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the stand in Tottenham-court-road—I had been there a good many hours—I had not seen the prisoner—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was called, and I pulled down to the comer of Percy-street—that was in the evening, about nine or ten o'clock—the prisoner and another gentleman got in—the prisoner had a kind of white outside coat on—I was told to drive to Pic<lb></lb>cadilly, by the person who let them in—I drove to Piccadilly, and when at the other side of Half Moon-street, the check<lb></lb>string was pulled, and I stopped—there was a sort of a wrangle, and I heard the words, "Drive to the station," and I was about to turn round to do so, when they both got out—I then stopped, and asked for my fare, and the gentleman gave me a shilling—the gentleman then ran up Half Moon-street, and the prisoner after him—I then lost sight of them—the prisoner did not return to me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. That is all correct—that is what I said, and I still adhere to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why do you say that you do not know who got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I did not know who got in at the time—if I said I did not know who got out, it was a mistake—I did know it was the man I had known for seven years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you awake before you got to Piccadilly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly—I had a very fast horse in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I drove fast—I drove to the other side of Half Moon-street when the check<lb></lb>string was pulled—if it had not been pulled I should have driven to the top of Piccadilly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The prosecutor does not say anything about the check<lb></lb>string; he says he called to him to stop; I do not wish him asked whether he pulled it or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as clerk to the Justices at the Police Court, Bow-street—on the prisoner's examination on this charge, he was asked if he had anything to say—he made a statement, which I took down in writing from his lips—after I had done so, I read it over to him, and Mr. Jardine, the Magistrate, put his name to it—this is the examination.—(Reading—" The prisoner says, 'He has charged me wrongfully; I never saw him before last Tuesday week; I then went up and spoke to him, taking him for a friend of mine whom he resembled; I said, "How do you do, sir? you know me?" he said he did not, and ran away. 1 said, "O, nonsense, you do;" and his running away induced me to think that he was the man; and 1 followed him—I became satisfied that he was not the person whom I took him to be, on his passing me twice yesterday; he then came up with a policeman, and gave me in charge. I told him that I had never seen him before, to rob him; he said I had, and gave me in charge.'")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was standing outside the Bank, waiting for a friend of mine, when the prosecutor came up and gave me in charge for robbing him: I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250087"></xptr>
               <p>declared I did not know him, which I did not at the time, till I got to the station-house; and I should not have known him then had I not seen his porter, which made me think it was the man I had spoken to on the 5th of Nov. He gave me in charge for robbing him, which I declared I was innocent of. He says he met me on Sunday night, the 6th of Oct.; that he was waiting for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Tottenham-court-road; that I came up and addressed him, and asked what he was waiting for; that he told me, and that I said there were no omnibuses, but plenty of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>; and with that he called one, and asked me to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. Is it feasible that a gentleman should ask a stranger to get into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with him? How<lb></lb>ever, he says he asked me to do so, and that we rode to Piccadilly; and as we were going along Piccadilly, I should use some rough language to him inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and say I wanted some money from him, that I asked him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to go to the station-house? He says he told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to stop, got out, gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran down half-moon-street; that I followed him, and asked him for money, and that he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and his watch and chain. Now, is it feasible that any gentleman would give any lad his money like that, or his watch and chain, under such circumstances as that? With that, he says I told him to go one way and me the other; and he says he went in his fright, and never saw anything of me till the 5th of Nov. I was then coming through the City with a friend of mine, and 1 said to him, "There goes a gentleman that resembles a man who owes me something;" he said, "Why don't you go up to him?" which I did, and said, "How do you do?" I could not see him clearly, not his features; he said, "I don't know you." I said, "Yes, you do know me, sir;" with that be ran away as hard as he could, which made me think it was him; he ran into the office, and nearly slammed my fingers in the door. I waited till the porter came to the door, and said, "Can I speak to the gentleman who has just gone in?" he said, "Which gentleman? there is one just gone out" I said, "No, the one who has just gone in;" he said he did not know who it was. I described him as well as I could; the porter went up stairs; whether he spoke to him I do not know, but he came down again, and said he was gone, and if I wanted him I must come to-morrow; as he was talking, I saw the prosecutor come down with a light; I then had a good view of him, and he turned to the door at the left. I said I would come to-morrow, but I did not go near the house since; and the next time be charged me with robbing him. If I was the man, why did he not know me on the 5th of Nov., and give me into custody then as well as a fortnight after? He says I had a white coat on; they have been to my lodging, and I never bad a white coat; and if I rode in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with a gentleman for only three or four minutes through the streets, and had a white coat on, would not that make a great deal of difference in my ap<lb></lb>pearance? How would he know me a month after, in a black coat, so well as that? I have my master here, Mr. James, a shoemaker, whom I work for.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was he lodging on the 6th of Oct.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why he was lodging with me about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250088"></xptr>
               <p>that time—he was lodging in Gough-street, on the 6th of Oct., with me—that I swear—he was lodging with me about that time—I do not know exactly to a day, because I do not bear those things in mind—the last time I saw him was the first Sunday in Oct.—the last time I saw him when he left my lodgings was on the first Monday in Oct.—he came home very tipsy on the Sunday night, and I told him he should not come home any more, for if he could find money to get drunk with, he could find money to pay me—he did not lodge with me after that—he has not been there since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time had you seen him before on that Sunday when he came home drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He went away soon after dinner, it might have been two o'clock, perhaps, but I cannot say to a minute—it was towards the morning that he came home drunk—I believe it was turned twelve—it might have been two for what I know—I was in bed, and he caused a dis<lb></lb>turbance coming up—I got out to give him the key to go into the room, and told him if he could not come home sober, not to come home any more, if he could afford to get drunk he could afford to pay me—I cannot say whether he was in my debt—I never kept any bill against him—I always gave him money because he is a relative of mine—I cannot reckon him in debt, because he never owed me any money—he used to do work for me, shoemaking—I believe he had done some that week—he had been at work during the week—there are two or three pawnbrokers near me, one is named Brown, and one Lindell, I think—one lives at the corner of Wilson-street, and the other in North-place—I saw the prisoner when he came home that night, because I believe he struck a light—I gave him the matches to get a light—he had my candle to go to bed with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What means of living had he when he lodged with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had no means, I believe, no more than what I gave him and what he did—I cannot say what I had given him during the last month—he had a good many shillings from me I reckon—I cannot say how many—sometimes I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., perhaps sometimes 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or what not, according as I was situated myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What will you swear you had given towards his support for a month previous to the 6th of Oct.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him his victuals, according to what I had he had—I never saw him in any particular gentleman's clothes—I cannot say what means he might have had—I never saw him in any gentleman's clothes—I never considered that he had as much as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What relative is he of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My nephew—I do not know Rous at all, only by seeing him at Bow-street—I never saw him before—the prisoner was at my house on the Monday morning—he had no shoemaking to do for me then, nor myself either—I was not particularly badly off at that time—I might be without work a day or two—I am badly off at any time, when I am at work—my circumstances were the same that Monday as they might have been at any other time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had you last, before the Sunday night, given him any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> During the week—I cannot say the day—I might have given him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during that week—I had not given it to him all at once—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sometimes, and sometimes 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not give it to him without his asking me for it—he asked me to let him have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him according to what I could—I think the last I gave him was on the Friday—I think it was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave him then—it was at night—of course he asked me for it, or I should not have given it him—he asked me if I could let</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250089"></xptr>
               <p>him have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—of course I expected he was without money, or I should not have given it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know where he could get half-a-crown from to pay for an umbrella? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Monday morning, as he came home on the Sunday night, and told him not to come to my place any more—he asked me if I could let him have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then, and I said, "Don't you come to my place again; if you can get drunk you can keep yourself with<lb></lb>out getting money from me"—I have not got any umbrella of his, I have no use for it—I occupy three rooms on the second floor—I have a wife, but no family—I work at home—the prisoner occupied the back room—I worked and all in the room—we lived in it, all together—they are but small rooms—I do not know where he lived after he left me—I told him there and then, not to come any more, and I never thought anything fur<lb></lb>ther about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you hear of his being taken up charged with this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I had heard of it on the Saturday, I think, and two gentlemen came to me on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he ever in the Refuge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he has been—I should say it was about five or six months ago—I have never been in such a place, nor in any prison at all—I cannot say how often the prisoner has been there, I have never inquired—I did not come here to give him a character, I came merely to hear the trial, as I understood he was to be tried.</p>

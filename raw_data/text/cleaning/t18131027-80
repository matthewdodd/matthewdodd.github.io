I went to his shop; I there found a large quantity of nails, files, and ironmongery in general. I examined the papers carefully; I found a deal of circumspection had been used; the parts of the papers that had been marked were cut off, and had been marked in another place. I selected one parcel of files, with my mark upon the files; they are a particular sort, and never sold in London; it was three dozen, marked S. W. I never sold them in London. There were several bags of nails, most of them had my marks upon the bags. After I had removed all the property away from Peake's house, I called Pike into my accompting-house, I questioned him concerning the business; he denied it at first, but when he saw I had all the property away from Peake, he began to paulter, he sent to me just before he was going to be put into the Compter; I went to him. He then told me that he had regularly sold a large quantity of goods to Peake; he said, he stole the files. He nearly enumerated all the articles I have got here; he sold them to Peake for three-pence a pound.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of July I lost three locks and three keys, they were the property of the prosecutors, they were lost off the counter; the prosecutors are <rs id="t17860719-53-viclabel260" type="occupation">ironmongers</rs>

               <p>I went into the shop to buy some hinges, there was nobody in the shop but this gentleman, with the newspaper in his hand, he seemed rather attentive to the paper, it was an exceeding hot day, and there were twenty parcels on the counter, as I came in with two pound of pewter, and another parcel, I put down my parcels on the counter, he undid one paper, and then another, and they did not suit, says I, Sir, I have given you the trouble of opening the papers, I will have a pair of these, the handkerchief laid on a parcel, and I put it in my pocket, he said you have taken a parcel.</p>
               <p>Had he any parcel on the counter besides this? - No; my Lord, I am sure I saw him put it into his pocket, he said I am very sorry, I made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Did he put his handkerchief on the counter? - He said he did, my Lord.</p>

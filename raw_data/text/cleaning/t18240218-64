            . I keep the Aberdeen Arms, public-house, at Great Stanmore. In August last, I had nineteen ducks in a small place under my dwelling-house, which had been used as a harness-room; the door opens into the stable-yard; there is a bed-room over it. It was secured by a latch, staple, hasp, and pin; it could be opened outside by taking out the pin. They were stolen one night, about the middle of August. I have not found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say on what day - A. No; there is a wall round the yard, and gates at each end, which were shut.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner seven or eight years - he lived at Stanmore, and is a rat-catcher. I went with him one night, just before harvest, about eleven o'clock, to Mr. Seabrook's - we lodged just opposite there. We took nineteen ducks from the house adjoining the dwelling-house - it was fastened with a latch and staple. We killed and put them into two bags, and carried them away - the bags belonged to the prisoner. We took them to Worrall's, at Edgware; he would not buy them with the feathers on; we carried them away and concealed them in a hedge, and left seventeen of them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180034"></xptr>there till the next night, and took the other two home unpicked. Mrs. Clark dressed them for us - she picked them. We went at night, got the seventeen, and Worrall gave us 6 s. for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first tell this story - A. Three or four months afterwards, to Mr. Wadlington, the Magistrate. I was taken up for stealing a hare, and kept four days; was then taken to Clerkenwell prison for six weeks. I mentioned about the ducks four days after I was taken. I saw the prisoner at St. Alban's gaol; I was to have been a witness against him there, but the Grand Jury threw out the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling the prisoner, that as the evidence was not enough for him there, you would do for him in London - A. I never said such a word. Worrall lives about two miles from Seabrook's. We got to Stanmore-marsh about three o'clock.</p>

            . I am a constable. Worrall has been tried here, and is under sentence of transportation. I went to his house when he was in custody, and found twelve ducks hid in a dung heap quite putrid; it was about the first week in October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you count them - A. I counted twelve, and there were parts of others. He told me he had buried them there, and that the prisoner brought them there; they were covered with straw, not with dung.</p>

            , ESQ. I am Magistrate of Hertford. Oskley was brought before me on the 25th of October. Before I committed him he said that he had a communication to make to me, respecting other offences. I cautioned him against criminating himself; and took down what he said, (reads) -</p>

               <p>"I and Thompson took Seabrooks' ducks; we took them to Worrall, and got 5 s. for them; there was about seventeen I think; it was in 
               <persName id="t18240218-64-person681">August.</persName>
             I and Thompson also stole some copper from Seabrook's about six weeks before, and sold it to Worrall. The door of the place where the ducks were was not locked."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That confession I never made. I was put into the cage, and in the morning a man came and gave me half-a-pint of rum and some beer, and told me Worrall had been saying that I had done different things; and if I ever confessed to it I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>MR. WADLINGTON. He made this statement before twelve o'clock in the morning: and seemed to have his senses completely about him. I read it over to him, and he said</p>
               <p>"Have you taken down Sir, that the door was not fastened, because it was no burglary."</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 49.</p>

            . I am Mr. Moore's clerk. On Saturday evening, the 7th of March, we were desired by Mr. Moore to examine the men that went out of the gate, Mr. Gilham and myself; Mr. Gilham said there was a man throwing down some soap out of his apron; I was directed to the accompting house, there was a piece of soap there which was not there when I went to the gates; I directly accused him of it, he fell down on his knees and asked for mercy; I told him I could say nothing in the case, he must go to Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>- . I am a constable. In the prisoner's lodging we found seven bags, a pair of clogs, and likewise a piece of paper that soap had been rolled up into, and a small piece of soap of the same sort.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

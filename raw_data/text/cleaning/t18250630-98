            . I am an officer. I was on duty on the 25th of May, in Old-street, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoner carrying a copper; I asked where he was going with it; he said to Featherstone-street, and he had brought it from Providence row, Islington - he was going to repair it, as he was a smith; I said I would go with him; we went till we came to a court which leads to a notorious house; he then threw it down, ran into a house, and shut the door; I took it up, and saw the lead in it; I went to the court in about three hours, and saw him coming out of the next house to the one he had gone into - without his coat; I got a brother officer, and we secured him; I did not know him before, but am positive of his person. I took the copper and lead to the prosecutor - it exactly fitted the place, and the lead corresponded with what was left.</p>

On the 24th of May this copper was safe in the back kitchen; it was fixed, and had lead round it; I missed it about nine o'clock next morning - the kitchen had been locked, but it was but a common lock.</p>

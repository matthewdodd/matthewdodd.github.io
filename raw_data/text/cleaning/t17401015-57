               <p>Mr. Jones. On the 17th of September, I was standing with a Man in <placeName id="t17401015-57-crimeloc306">Fleet-Street</placeName>

He passed me, and I ran after him, and took him to the Sugar Loaf Alehouse, and gave him into the Custody of the next Witness. I found these 8 Handkerchiefs concealed about several Parts of his Body. - He could give no Account how he came by them, nor say any thing for himself, or his Character.</p>

             . All that I have to say is, that it was about half an Hour-past 8, when Mr Jones brought the Prisoner into the Sugar-Loaf Alehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you there?</p>
               <p>Bushell. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Very well then.</p>
               <p>Bushell. He had one Handkerchief taken from one Arm-pit, another from the other, and so from several Parts of his Body, and were all separate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Case is this. I was coming from a Place, - what do you call it? - by Fleet-street, where they sell Saloop, my Ship-mate met me, and we went into a House, and drank 2 Full-pots of Beer; he gave me these Handkerchiefs, that my Wife might wash them for him, and that Man took them from me: I know no more of them. Here are some Witnesses to my Character and Behaviour.</p>

What he is taken up for, I can't say nothing (any thing) in his Behalf; I have heard no ill of him, any farther than as People have said, that he has been a wild young Man. I have 'trusted him, and never lost any thing by him.</p>

               <p>Margaret. I can't say - I have heard - but I can prove nothing against him. He goes to Sea, but he is not always at Sea. I never lost any thing by him.</p>

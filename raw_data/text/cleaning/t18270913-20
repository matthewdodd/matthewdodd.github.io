I met the prisoner that night, between twelve and one o'clock - I was coming up Regent-street and she overtook me, and asked me the time - I said I thought it was near twelve o'clock; she said she was afraid it was later - I pulled out my watch, and said it wanted twenty minutes to one o'clock; she said she had been spending the evening with some friends, and was afraid she was locked out, and should be obliged to walk the streets all night. I took compassion on her, and asked her to go home with me to my lodgings - she did so; we went to bed together - I put my watch under the pillow, with the seals and chain; I cannot say whether she saw me put it there - I went to sleep, and awoke about six o'clock in the morning - she was then gone, and my watch also, with the chain, seals, and key - they were worth 7l. or 8l.; I had worn the chain four or five years - it was a gold chain, three gold seals, a gold key, and a silver watch, which cost 9l. 10s. by itself, about twelve months before; she had not told me she was going - I did not know where she lived then - I saw my watch on the Monday following. at Mr. Joyce's, pawnbroker, of Euston-street, Euston-square; I had advertised it, and sent hand-bills round to the pawnbrokers. I happened to go into Joyce's shop, and asked if he had such property - and he produced the watch and appendages, all complete, as I had lost it - I had not given it to her - I am certain of her person; I did not lock my bed-room door - Mr. Finch lives in the house; I only have the second floor front room, and I am single.</p>

            . I live in Hill-street, and am out of place now. In August last I lived in the same house with the prisoner, at No. 26, Euston-crescent. On Friday, the 10th of August, some time in the morning, I saw her come home - I was then in bed. I saw her about eleven or twelve o'clock - she asked me to go and pledge a watch for her, and told me where to go. I do not know where it was - but it was in the neighbourhood; she told me to ask three sovereigns on it, but I made a mistake, and asked for two; she sent me back, and I got another on it - I gave her the three sovereigns, and the duplicate. I had only lived with her about a week - she did not say where she got the watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Crescent-street, Euston-squarre. On the 10th of August Williams pawned a watch with me, for 2l.; I asked if it was hers - she said it belonged to a Mr. Clark, of No. 26, Euston-crescent. I gave her 2l. with a ticket for the watch, chain, and seals - she returned in less than a quarter of an hour, and asked for another pound, saying, she had made a mistake. I gave her another, as it was worth the money. On the Monday following, Byers brought a hand-bill - I told him I had got the watch - he claimed it; it answered the description on his bill. I went with him and the officer, that evening, to No. 26, Euston-crescent, and Byers pointed out the prisoner, among four or five other women there - Williams was not there; the prisoner denied it strongly. I said she had better tell the truth; the property is worth 5l. in the trade. I do not think it would fetch more - I think that the full value.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Elephant in Fen-church-street. The prisoner came and staid a fortnight with me—his bill at the end of that time amounted to 51. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I talked about payment he gave me this bit of paper—I said, "This is not a proper cheque"—he said, "Will that not do?"—I said, "I think not"—he said, "Yes it will, if it were for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I believed that as far as the paper went—the prisoner then asked me for a bottle of wine, and I let him have it—I said, "You have written this cheque for more than the amount"—he said, "Well, that will do"—a few minutes after, and before he left the bar, he said, "Just let me have half-a-crown,"and I did—it was on the faith of this paper—I would not have let him had the wine nor the money but believing this paper was good.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have this observation to make; at the time I drew this paper, I did it merely as a joke; that evening I was rather over<lb></lb>done done with liquor, and was not aware actually of what I was doing; I re<lb></lb>collect there was a man of colour there, and it was Mrs. Eaton's desire as he had been there so frequently to see a man named Cook, and had not called for anything to drink, that I should call for a bottle of wine, with the understanding that I should not have to pay for it, but it would be all right; I borrowed the half-crown to lend that man, as he had no money; it was not done with the intention of gaining any credit; the credit I had from her was before I had done this; she knew I was going into the country the following morning; I told her so; she had never pressed me for money; and had this not come forward, she would have had her money; I have respectable friends in Leicestershire, but I hope they will never know my situation; I was honourably brought up to the profession of the law; this is the first time I ever committed myself.</p>

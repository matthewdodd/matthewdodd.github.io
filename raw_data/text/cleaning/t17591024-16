I said, You have got one of my tankards; No, I have not, said he; I lifted up his pocket lid, and there I saw my mug; he would have pull'd it out in the street; I said, no, you shall go back to my house; when he was in my house he pull'd it out of his pocket, and set it on the table before many witnesses.

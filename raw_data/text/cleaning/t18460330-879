                  </hi>. I am the prisoner Meatyard's brother—I am a pork-butcher, and carry on business at No. 185, Whitecross-street—my brother has been out of employ for some months—I have contributed to his support—I remember the Friday on which this matter is said</p>

               <p>to have happened—I saw my brother that day—he came to me that Fri<lb></lb>day morning, and my wife said he had better walk to market with me, and we could talk about what I was going to do far him—when we got to the Bull and Mouth we saw Fidler on the van—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "Home"—I and my brother jumped into the van—Fidler drove on to Morrison's—he there took out a few things, and we went into a public-house close at hand and had a pot of half-and-half—Fidler told my brother he was going to leave his situation—he said he was keeping a man and a boy at a shop, he did not see why he should pay a man and work out himself he might as well be at home—I said, "Certainly not, do you think there is a chance for my brother?"—he said yes, he thought there was—I said he had been out of work some time, I thought of doing something for him, and said, "If you could speak for him and get him a situation I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he did not require anything of the kind, but of course he Would speak for him—I said, "Perhaps my brother had better go now, perhaps an hour too early may be better than a minute too late"—he said no, he had to give warning—I then came to the door—it appeared he had something to say to my brother, and I left—it was then from twelve to one o'clock.</p>

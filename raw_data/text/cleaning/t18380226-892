                  </hi>. I am a hosier and glover, and live at No. 9, London-road, St. George's. At eleven o'clock, on the morning of the 6th of January, the prisoner came to my shop with another, whose name I haw since ascertained to be Ireland—Ireland came in, and requested to see a cotton shirt—I produced one—he objected to it as being rather higher in price than he meant to give—I had asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said J had striped cotton ones lower—I showed him one at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he agreed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> take it, and then said he wanted a handkerchief—the price of the handkerchief was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I agreed to take 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this shirt and handkerchief—the prisoner gave me the shirt across the counter, and he said, "Take this, master, then it won't run away"—Ireland then directed my attention to a black leather belt, but he did not purchase it—they then went away—I was then about to reinstate my goods in the shop, and missed this pair of braces—I spoke to my wife, went out into the road, and left my busi<lb></lb>ness in possession of another individual—I looked in different direc<lb></lb>tions about the Obelisk, but not finding them, I went to the Crown public-house—I saw the prisoner and Ireland, and by the side of the prisoner, a man in a dark coat—I said to the prisoner, "I want you, I wish to speak to you"—he looked at the man on the left, said something to him, and handed these braces from his coat to the other man in the brown coat—I got over the table, and said to the man in the brown cost, "You are my prisoner"—the prisoner made little reply to that—the door was open, and the prisoner ran out—I pursued him down Joiner-street—I called "Stop thief," but no assistance came, and I lost him—I went to the inspector in Tower-street, to give notice, and saw Ireland near there, looking at the station-house door—a person of the name of Cook was on duty—I said, "Take that man," which he did, and Ireland was taken, but I said, "I give no charge against him, I wish to make him a witness"—these are my braces.</p>

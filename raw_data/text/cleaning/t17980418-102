On the 7th -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We must not hear that.</p>
               <p>Newlin. Horribin was taken up, I believe, on the 10th of April; I took him myself in Dyot-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you saw this, you went and informed the master? - A. Yes; I followed him home, and he set the cann at his master's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the kettle? - A. I think it is, but I cannot say; I picked it out from the ranks, where there were a great number of them, and the master said that was the kettle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You describe yourself to be a carpenter-are you a carpenter? - A. Yes; I follow the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any other business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been employed by Police-officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. Monday morning the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. And when was he taken up? - A. I think the 10th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Five weeks afterwards? - A. Yes; the master wished me to watch to see if he could not catch him with more.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the half-guinea that Pittman gave him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you saw some oil pour out of the nozle of the kettle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that in your first information? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you never thought of it till you found it necessary to prove it was oil? - A. I think I mentioned it to the Magistrate at Bow-street, I know it to be true that it did run out of the nozle of the kettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180098"></xptr>Q. You had seen nothing but the kettle before till that circumstance? - A. I saw it poured twice into the measure, and after that is the cisten.</p>
               <p>Q.And you swear that that is the kettle? - A. I went down to the door of the office, and looked at the kettle, it was marked No. 10.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you saw it marked No. 10 before? - A. No, I will not; I know it by the nose being bruised; the nose being so short that there is no other kettle like it in the whole boiling.</p>
               <p>Mr. knapp. Q. What induced you to watch? - A. The inducement I had to watch was, I had seen several people many times going into this shop with oil in canns, and I have seen the prisoner Horribin go into the shop repeatedly with a cann full of oil.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did your conscience suffer you to see that repeatedly? - A. I stopped till I could not bear it any longer; I was determined to know whether they had any perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear they were full? - A.Apparently, from the weight of their carrying it; I waited till I saw the money was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know why it was worse that time than any time before? - A. I had seen them several times, and that made me watch.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a contractor for lighting lamps, in partnership with Joseph Lucas and Christopher Spencer; the prisoner was our cellar-man, at the lamp-office, in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Pittman's shop? - A. Yes; about 4 or 500 yards from our cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any information from the last witness, respecting your servant Horribin? - A. Yes, on the 5th of March, a little after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any kettle? - A. Yes; Newlin pointed it out.</p>
               <p>Q. you did not apprehend the prisoner till some time after? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's duty? - A. To measure the oil; he was among tons and tons where he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q.Is it possible to miss by your eys two or three gallons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. In point of fact, you did miss it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this charge being made, some weeks afterwards, Mr. Pittman surrendered himself, did not he? - A. No; Mr. Bond sent for him.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went without being taken up by a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of as much oil as that? - A. About five gallons are worth 13s. 6d. the cann holds about five gallons and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if he gave more than half-a-guinea, it was not much under the value? - A. No; it is worth 2s. 8d. a gallon, that is what it cost us; the common price is 3s. 6d. a gallon.</p>
               <p>Q. An oilman would not give 3s. 6d. for it? -No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much oil may you have at a time? - A.Sometimes we have 200 tons in the warehouse at a time.</p>
               <p>Horribin's defence. I am innocent of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Pittman's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Pittman, called six witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuckey. I never had reason to suppose that Horribin had been guilty of any thing of this sort before.</p>

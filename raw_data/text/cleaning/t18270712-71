            , No. 9, Whitmore-row, Hoxton; he fetched a horse, and in about an hour he came and took away the gig - I asked when he expected to return - he said about seven or eight o'clock in the evening; he paid me 3s. for the use of it on going out - if he had told me he should be longer I should have charged him more. The gig did not come back, and on Monday I heard there was a man before the Magistrate - I went, and found him there - he had a cheque in his pocket, for 14l.; I traced the drawer of the cheque to Cockspur-street, and there I found the gig. I certainly did not intend to sell it to him. I inquired at Hoxton, but no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I just wish to ask if it was a gig? A. You may call it a gig or a chaise - he asked for a chaise.</p>

               <p>JAMES COLLINS. I am a Police-constable. I was applied to by the prosecutor to go to No. 4, Church-street, where I found Edwards in the first floor room - the prosecutor pointed it out to me: I found Jones in the floor above -Edwards was some time before she opened the door; I asked her for the young man's watch - she said she had no watch of his; I then asked her for the duplicate - she said she had no duplicate but what was her own; I said she must go with me to the station-house - she said why did not I take the other girl as well as her; I found this bag laying on the table, and in it the duplicate of this watch - I then went up stairs with her, and she knocked at Jones' door; I was asked what was wanted - I said I wanted her respecting a watch; she said would I allow her to dress herself - I said, certainly; I then took her to the station - it is not a house of ill-fame; it is for travellers and working people - here are the prosecutor's trousers; the watch-pocket appears to be torn.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HAMPSTEAD. This is the duplicate I gave for the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoners put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had treated them with liquor, and sent Edwards to pledge his watch.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Did you treat the prisoners to any drink? A. Yes; we had a pint of beer and a quartern of gin at a house in Long-acre.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. I was in the Poultry—I was not acquainted with the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner drawing his hand from Mr. Tucker's pocket—he held out his hand, which was clenched, to some of his companions—I did not see what was in it—I should think he had fourteen or fifteen companions—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

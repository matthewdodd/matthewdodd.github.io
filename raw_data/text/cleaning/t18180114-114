            . I am a salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. On the 18th of December the prisoner, Spears, came to my shop, and asked the price of a handkerchief; he asked permission to leave two baskets which he had, at my house till the evening - He did not call for them; next morning he came, and said he wanted other things, and that he could serve me with a few candles - I said I had no objection; he left the baskets till next morning. He came again on Saturday night, with a box, containing 64 lbs. of candles; I told him I did not want that quantity; he said they were not all for me; I told him they would not suit me - He went away, I followed about one hundred yards from him. I met Fair and Morris, and informed them; they went with me, and stopped him in Red Lion-street. I had not seen the other prisoner. I went home, and in about half an hour the prisoner, Carruthers, came, and asked if a young man had been there with candles? I said, no; he said he was his partner, and he told him he was coming there, and he not returning, made him come for him. I told him he had better wait, and asked him up stairs. I sent for the officers; he said his name was Thompson, that he lived with Godfrey, a tallow-chandler, in the Commercial-road. The officers came and secured him.</p>

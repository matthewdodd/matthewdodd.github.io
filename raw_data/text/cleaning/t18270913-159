On the 7th of August, the watch was in the drawer, the coat hung on the back of a chair, and the other articles were in the shop - the prisoner is a neighbour's son, and lives just by - I had seen these articles safe when I put up the shutters in the evening, and missed them about seven o'clock the next morning. The house had been entered by the back premises, through a hole, which had been forced in the partition - these shoes, and this bed-gown are mine.</p>

            . I am an officer. The two houses were formerly one - there is a partition now between them. I went to the prisoner's father's house, on the 8th of August, with a search-warrant - in one corner of the shop next to the prosecutor's premises, I found a hole, and a bag hanging over it; I lifted up the bag, and found this blue nightgown, and this pair of shoes; and on the other side of the partition, I found this cap, which the prosecutrix identified. I was looking after the prisoner the whole of the day, but the prosecutrix met him, and took him to the watch-house. I saw him there, and asked him what he had done with the things - he said he had given them to his brother, and knew no more about them. His brother, I am sorry to say, is a very bad lad. He was taken up, but not committed.</p>

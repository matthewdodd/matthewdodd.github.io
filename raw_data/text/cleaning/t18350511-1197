Oliver"—he said it was his signature, and that he had delivered the letter, and taken a receipt, which he produced—this is the paper he produced—it was his duty to keep the receipt, as his voucher—he said he had delivered the letter to a boy, near Mrs. Martin's house, No.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six months, as the letter-carrier of the district—I have never talked to him, but asking him if there was any letter, and he has said "Yes" or "No;" that is all I have said to him—I think I have asked him twice, (not more to my recollection,) once in Portman-street, and once in Bryan<lb></lb>ston-street—I think Portman-street was the last time, but I cannot be certain—it was about a week before February—I think I did not receive any letters from him on either occasion, when I asked him if there was one—he answered me both times, "No"—I remember when the officer, Mr. Peacock, and the prisoner, came to my mistress's house—I think it was on a Thursday night—I think four persons came—nobody had spoken to me on the subject before that—I had had no conversation about the letter before that night—I never asked the prisoner if there was any letter for Miss Spong—I never asked him if there was any for Mrs. Martin—he once asked me for that name, but it was not a money-letter, and it was some time before that—I cannot recollect how long, but I</p>

               <p>think it was about three weeks—Miss Spong had not told me she expected a letter—nobody had said any thing to me about one—they had not said they expected a letter from Ireland—when the four persons came to the house, they asked if Mrs. Martin was at home—they told me to wait out<lb></lb>side a little, that I should be wanted, and after that, I was called into the room—I do not think Mrs. Martin was in the room when I went in—they had said nothing to me on the subject of a letter, before I was called into the room—the prisoner asked me whether I recollected taking in a letter—Mr. Lawrence was by at the time—I said, "I did not do such a thing"—that was all that passed before I went into the room—that was in the presence of the prisoner; and Mr. Lawrence, Leadbitter, and Mr. Pea<lb></lb>cock were up stairs in the room at the time—I said, in Mr. Lawrence's presence, that I did not recollect receiving the letter—that was in answer to the first question put to me—I never saw a letter given to a servant in the street—I never took one in the street myself; it has always been at the door—I should not have had the money to pay the postage in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you asked him on two occasions if he had got any letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have gone back with him, and taken them up stairs to Mrs. Martin, and got the money—I never received a letter from a post-man in the street—I was in the room about a quarter of an hour—I was asked a good many questions, and I had to write my name down—I was asked if I ever had a receipt for a letter put into my hands—I think Mr. Peacock asked me—he and Leadbitter questioned me—the prisoner was in the room at the time—he said what I said was false—I was examined twice at Bow-street, and I went twice to the Post-office, where they asked me some questions—I went from there to Bow-street both times—Mr. Peacock asked me some questions at the Post-office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to say you did not recollect any thing about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not at first; but when I <hi rend="italic">stood up</hi> and recollected myself I recollected not receiving the letter—I was uncertain at first whether I had received it or not—I recollected about a letter which we had up in the second floor, where Mr. Jeffries lived, but that was not from this postman; that was one without a livery—I heard the name mentioned of the person who signed the receipt for Mr. Jeffries's letter, which was a money-letter, but I did not sign that receipt—the postman offered me that letter, and I said I would go and fetch Mr. Jeffries down; that is since this—I never received a money-letter in my life, or signed a receipt—I do not remember paying the prisoner any postage higher than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the highest I ever paid for a letter—it came from Paris, I think for Mrs. Martin—I do not know whether there was any thing in it—I am almost positive it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I would not say it was not 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—there is a boy about my size living at the shoemaker's, next door to us—there are two boys at No. 11—there is one at No. 31, and one at No. 32, and there is one more in Mrs. Martin's house, named Roberts—he is about fifteen or sixteen years old—he lives there with his mother and father who keep the house—Mrs. Martin is a lodger, and I am her errand-boy—Miss Spong lives there now.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever happen to lose a letter while you were at Mrs. Mar<lb></lb>tin's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—Miss Spong never asked me whether I had received a letter for her—she never told me she expected one—I left Mrs. Martin's more than two years ago—she then lived in the same house—I left her be<lb></lb>cause I got a better place at Mr. Squib's, in Orchard-street—I never</p>

               <p>served any body before that—I have lived at a Mr. Pitt's, a china-shop, in Berkley-street—Mrs. Martin's was my first place—I lived with Mr. Pitt about nine months—I left him because he stopped my money because I broke a pan—I left of my own accord—my mother took me away because he took my money—I never heard that he made any complaint against me—after leaving him I came back to Mrs. Martin's again—I lived with Mr. Cox, a butcher, in Portman-street, who I was going to be apprenticed to, but I did not like the business—that was before I went to Mr. Pitt—I was there about eight months—that was after I had left Mrs. Martin's the first time, and before I went to Mr. Pitt—I left her to go to Mr. Squib, a surgeon, in Orchard-street—I left him because I was very poorly one morning, and went out in the Park to take a walk, I stopped longer than I should have done, and my work was not done, and he turned me away—he gave me no other reason—I have been at jobs at places in the neighbourhood, wherever I could earn 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I have been out of place—I have done jobs for about three persons, I think—I do not recollect telling Mr. Flower, at Bow-street, that I had not lived with any one but Martin and Squib.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you were called into the room, you said to Mr. Lawrence, that you did not recollect having received such a letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had opened the door to them—the prisoner said, "That is the boy"—he did not say what he meant in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to any body at anytime, that you once received a letter from the prisoner for Miss Spong, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do recollect that I said so—I do not recollect when it was—I think it was soon after I went into Mrs. Martin's service the last time—I received that letter at the house—I have been a year with Mrs. Martin the second time—I cannot recollect whether I received the letter from the prisoner or any other letter-carrier—I do not recollect to whom I paid the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I paid it to the prisoner, and I think it was to the prisoner—I am sure I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I do not know to whom.</p>

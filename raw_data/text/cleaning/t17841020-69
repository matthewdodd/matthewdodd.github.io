               <p>Court. With respect to surplusage in this case, there strikes me, there is some little doubt which word we should strike out; there is an antecedent to which the word said may refer: if there was no antecedent, if the indictment had begun that he made an assault on the said

               <p>Mr. Silvester. There was an Indictment against a man for feloniously setting his house on fire, and the crime itself was not felony; the Court of King's-Bench were of opinion that the word feloniously should be considered as surplusage, and it was struck out; now in this case, it immediately refers to the goods and chattles of

               <p>You must have been in a pretty considerable state of alarm not to have known a pistol from a blunderbuss, may be you would not have known it from a little cannon? - It was about eighteen inches long and a brass barrel.</p>
               <p>Was the face of the person that came to the cabin door in a disguise? - He had a handkerchief tied about his head not over his eyes.</p>
               <p>Had that person any light in his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was he in your view? - I suppose a minute, or a minute and an half, at one time, he received the things from the others, and came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>When you saw Wood before the Magistrate do you recollect saying you could not swear to him, nor did not know him? - I never said so.</p>

               <p>Was there or not, a handkerchief put over the head of Wood, before the Magistrate in order that you might see whether you knew him? - I am not positive whether it was over Wood, or Giles, but it was over one; but I had sworn to him before, the handkerchief made no difference to me; I said positively before the handcherchief was put on, that Wood was one of the men.</p>
               <p>How long were they on board in the whole? - Fifteen minutes at most, we had four more hands besides me.</p>

            , I stood upon the hatchway with a cutlass, the other four went down, they pushed open the door and drew out the two trunks from under the cot and brought them on deck and put them into the boat; then Wood brought two red leather little trunks and put them into the boat; we went over to the Horse-ferry facing Limehouse and tied them up and carried them over to one Brown at Limehouse, who keeps an empty house on purpose to take in those things.</p>

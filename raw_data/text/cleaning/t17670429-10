I can swear to the knee-buckles to be my property; the buttons are of the same sort as mine, and I believe them to be the same I lost; but as there are many of the same sort, I do not swear to them.

               <p>Q. How came you to lie at the King's Head that night?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. I was trusted with that money of my master's, and I very imprudently lay out.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do at the King's Head, Covent-Garden?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. I had spent some of the money, and I was afraid to go home again.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you received that money for your master?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. I had received it a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that King's Head?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. It is a night-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner in that house before?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. I had, two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the money when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Lacuse. I put it under my pillow in my breeches, and went to bed about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you served of your time?</p>

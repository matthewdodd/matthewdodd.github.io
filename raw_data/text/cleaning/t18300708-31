            . I am an officer in the army. On the 18th of June I saw the prosecutor followed by the prisoner and two other young men; I saw the prisoner take up the prosecutor's pocket, and take the handkerchief - I took hold of him, and told the prosecutor; the prisoner swore he would do for me if I did not let him go - he got from me, but I took him again; he struggled and broke a window - the handkerchief fell from him; I could not pick it up, but I believe this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About half-past nine o'clock - there was light enough; there were several people there - he was walking abreast with two others, immadiately behind the prosecutor; I could not be mistaken in the person who took it - there was quite light enough; some shops were open - the prisoner threw down the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two corner shops were shut up. Witness. Yes, they were - there were not two persons between the prisoner and me; I did not state that I saw two young men, who ran away - there were two with him; I did not say they went away - I did not notice; I did not say I would serve him out for it; he was very violent, he shoved me away, and I caught him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness allows two shops were shut, and is it likely he could distinguish me from two or three others, when there was no gas-light at the corner - he let me go, and a lady came out and said I broke the window; she caught hold of my coat, and then he took me again - I am quite innocent.</p>

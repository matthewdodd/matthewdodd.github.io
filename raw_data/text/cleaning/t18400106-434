                  </hi>I am a police-sergeant. On the 30th of De<lb></lb>cember, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a house in Church-street, St. Giles's, with Scotchmen and Fink, two other, police<lb></lb>men—we found the outer door open, and three females in the passage—we passed them—one of them cried out, <hi rend="italic">"Bill, Bill"</hi>, look out, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—there was a door on the right hand side of the passage leading into a room which was fastened—persons inside that room could hear that call of "Look out, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—we broke open the door, and found it had been fast<lb></lb>ened by a bed-screw in the floor, about eighteen inches from the bottom of the door, and a piece of wood put up against it—on entering the room I found the three prisoners there, standing by a large clear fire—Holliday had a blue coat on—I believe the others were in their shirt sleeves—there was a table behind them—I handcuffed Holliday—he was the first that was secured—the other constables had a scuffle with the other two men, and during that time I saw something thrown towards the fire—it came from that part of the room where they were scuffling—it fell on tie hob—I took ii up, and found it was a counterfeit sixpence, so hot that I could not hold it, and it had a <hi rend="italic">get</hi>attached to it—I produce it—I then proceeded to search the room—I found on the hob, by the side of the fire-place, this pipkin, with a quantity of hot metal in it, in a liquid state—the pipkin was very hot—the metal is in it now—I found two pieces of metal spoon, and a pair of scissors on the mantel-piece, and under the ashes this piece of metal—I saw Scotchmer take an iron spoon off the fire with fluid metal in it—the prisoners were secured, and taken away—Holliday's hands were white—I did not notice the others' hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Mitchell and Mr. John Julph, executors for the late Mr. Samuel Julph—they carry on the bu<lb></lb>siness for the benefit of the children in Broad-street, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields—the executors hold a lease of the house, and I oc<lb></lb>cupy it as their servant. On Tuesday evening, the 2nd of May, I heard a blow at the glass—I immediately ran out, but before I got out, I heard a second blow, and the glass falling—when I got out, the prisoner was in the act of withdrawing his hand with a gold watch in it—I seized him by the arm, and with some little difficulty got him into the shop—he would not give the watch up to me—I took his side-arms from him, and threw them behind the counter—when the constable came, he took the watch from his hand—he was a perfect stranger—he was dressed as one of the third regi<lb></lb>ment of Scotch Fusileer Guards, in full uniform, and had his bayonet on—he appeared perfectly sober—I went to the station-house—we could not get him to say much for himself, but ultimately he turned round, and said, "I know I stole your watch, "and also before the Magistrate he said, "I am guilty, I stole the watch"—this is it.</p>

I am a colour-sergeant in the Scotch Fusileers, and am pay-sergeant to the regiment the prisoner is in—he has been eleven months in the regiment, and I have known him seven months—his character has been that of an honest, sober man at all times—I hear he has been a man who has been in good circumstances—he almost ruined his father in money matters, which has preyed on his mind and rendered him totally unfit to perform his duty as a soldier—he has only been twice outside the barracks (though never confined for punishment)—the first time be at<lb></lb>tempted to drown himself, and the second, this has happened—before going out this very morning he asked the easiest way to get transported—At men told him to break a pane of glass—I only heard this, and cannot speak to it.</p>

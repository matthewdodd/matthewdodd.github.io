            , I heard a strange voice and I had the curiosity to look into the servants hall, for I was doing up a parcel to go into the country, and I saw this person coming out of the house-keeper's room, and seeing me he let these things fall from his arm, he asked me if Captain Johnson was at home, I said, there is no such person lives here, he was making off, I said, do not be in such a hurry, I will enquire for you, I caught hold of him; says I, pray who was that gentleman that informed you to come down, why did not you knock or ring, he said, he saw no bell or knocker, he said, he had not taken any thing; I sent for our baker, and he called a constable; the prisoner was taken into custody, he was never out of my custody at all; the constable searched him, and found one spoon with my master's cypher upon it, I searched every room in the house, to see if there were any more of the gang; I found nobody else, the table cloths were kept in a closet in the house-keeper's room; the first table cloth is not marked, the second is marked B. No. 4, the third, B. No. 3, another marked B. No. 2.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the cupboard kept locked where these things were kept? - They were in the room in order to be used.</p>
               <p>What do you swear all the property to be worth? - The value of the table cloths is 4 l. 10 s. the spoons and the tea tongs are worth 10 s. there is the cypher S. B. on all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of George Summers, a tobacconist, of Mile-end Road, Stepney, and sleep there. On the night of 21st Dec. I was going from the shop to the parlour, and heard a knock, as I thought, at the next shutter—I went to the street-door, and saw the prisoner with his hand in the window, and the glass was broken—it was not broken before—he made off—I could not catch him—I called "Police!"—he was brought back, and I recognised him—I missed cigars from the window, and found several under it—the policeman brought this bundle of cigars—they are George Summers's—they are tied in a particular manner, with ribbon.</p>

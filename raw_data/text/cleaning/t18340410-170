            . I have known the prisoner from a child - he has had an honest character - I heard Vehall say she could not swear to him, as she only saw him sideways' and she saw a youth at the fair who was the very spit of him, and she thought she must have swooned in her chair.</p>
               <p>MARY VEHALL. I saw a person who resembled the prisoner so much, that I had a doubt about him, but that was since he has been in custody.</p>

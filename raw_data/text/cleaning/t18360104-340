Wheeler, Card-manufacturer"—there is a shop door, with "H. Wheeler, Card-manufacturer and Printer" on each side—I went in with my companions, at the shop door—I asked for Mr. Wheeler—I went down stairs into a cellar-kitchen, and there saw the prisoner—I asked him who he was—he said his name was Wheeler—I asked if he was master of the house—he said, "Yes"—I told him I had got a warrant to search his house for a forged ace of spades—I do not ex<lb></lb>actly recollect what he said, but he requested I would let him look at the warrant—I read it over to him, with the exception of the name of the in<lb></lb>format—he made no particular observation at that time, and I went up stairs—he afterwards said some person had done it (laid the information) out of spite, or something to that effect—I left him and his wife, two sons and daughter, in charge of Mace, and went up stairs with Stowell—we just took a cursory view of the different rooms, and I returned back and found the prisoner in the cellar—I had left him in the kitchen—I told him I must go and search the house, having searched the shop in his presence—I told him I would go up to the top of the house to begin—he said, "You had better begin at the bottom," or something to that effect; but we went to the top—I went first into the attic, which was partly divided into two, but part of the partition was down—in the back part of the attic, I went through a trap-door into the roof part, and there found a quantity of playing-cards, some loose, and some in packages—unfortunately, after taking the prisoner away, all the cards I found got mixed—I handed the cards I found there down to Stowell—the prisoner was present—I then went into the front part of the attic, and found a hole in the ceiling, through which I got into the roof of that part, there being no other way to do so—I there found a quantity of cards—there might be ten or twelve packs—I also found this bag—it is in the same state as I found it—I gave the second parcel of cards to Stowell, and dropped the bag down to him also—I examined it (<hi rend="italic">opens it</hi>)—I found in it these papers—I believe they are all the same—there are thirty-four sheets with ten impressions of the ace of spades on each sheet—being three hundred and forty impressions—I also found in the bag thirty-eight impressions loose—I tied them up together, and am sure these are the same—they are in a state to put on cards—some of them are pasted on cards—I then sent for a coach, and took the prisoner into custody—I searched the house afterwards, and found a great quantity of cards, and materials for making cards—there were a great many more packs of cards in the bag, consisting of fifty-one cards each—those wanted the ace of spades—they were loose in the bag—I also found this parcel, which con<lb></lb>tains ninety-nine aces of spades, some on cards, and some on papers—here are thirty-seven aces of spades without the stamp—they were in the bag—I also found some blank cards, some old spade aces, some stamped, and some not—these were in the bag—I found a great quantity of papers and cards in various parts of the house—in nearly every room—here are the materials for making them, which I found—here is a block for printing, with the knaves and kings and queens, and other materials for card print<lb></lb>ing—here are some cards in the process of manufacturer, not finished—alto<lb></lb>gether there are one hundred and eighty packs wanting the ace of spades.</p>

                  </hi>. I am deputy-supervisor of stamps in the stamp department at Somerset House. (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the thirty-eight impressions of the ace of spades</hi>) these are forged—the circle round the garter is very dif<lb></lb>ferent; the genuine one being engine-turned—it is the custom of card manufacturers to send paper to the Stamp Officer for the ace of spades to be stamped—the Commissioners provide a stamp for that purpose—they send plain paper to us in reams—the Commissioners sometimes provide a stamp with the manufacturer's name on it, at his request—there was such a plate provided for a manufacturer named Thomas Creswick—there is a book kept at the Stamp Office with impressions of the plates which are prepared—I have it here—it has impressions of the plates prepared for Creswick—the date is on the impression; "14th of June, 1828"—these aces of spades appear to be a forgery of that plate—the other aces found in the bag are all forgeries of other plates, of other manufacturers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The card you call a forgery, appears in no respect a resemblance of Creswick's plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very bad—it would certainly not deceive any body in the Stamp Office, nor any body else who examined it, I should think—there is a great variation between the lion and unicorn, and the crown; and in the ring encircling the motto—I have reason to believe all the cards produced are forgeries—Creswick is still a card-manufacturer—this old ace of spades is a genuine one—some of these old ones I have not seen before—I am not able to judge whether these are genuine or not, not having seen them before—I believe them to be forged, but I am not positive—this one I am sure is a genuine one—it is a very old ace, which was used previous to my coming into the Office—here is one genuine, and one which I have no knowledge of—the rest are blanks—the one with Creswick on it is genuine—this other pack is also a stamp used before I came into the office, and I cannot speak positively about them—I never saw Thomas Wheeler—there was a person of that name, a licensed card-manufacturer—that was not the prisoner—I do not know whether he is alive or dead—in 1828, when the stamp-duty was altered, the impression of the aces of spades was also altered—I was in the Stamp Office at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time, do you know that the Stamp Office had a great deal of card-paper, with the duties on it, of the time before the alteration took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: I do not know that; nor that they sold it as waste<lb></lb>paper—the genuine paper would be in the custody of the warehouse<lb></lb>keeper of cards and dies—he has no perquisites, that I am aware of, respecting cards and paper—I have no access to the warehouse, and I do not know whether things are sold or not—there is only one warehouse—Lewis</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of forgeries should you call them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are imitation of the plate, no doubt—they resemble it in some measure—they vary considerably on being compared—any card-maker would perceive the variation.</p>

            . I am an oilman. On the 1st of June, between four and five o'clock in the evening, I was going up Mr. Atkinson's yards, and saw a man up in his loft. I asked him what he did there? he said he had been there to sleep, and that he was in liquor. I told him if he had had his sleep out, he had better go off the premises, instead of which he went to the privy. I found the lead cut off the gutter - He made the best of his way out of the yard, I followed and secured him. I asked him why he cut the lead off? he said because he was a fool, and hoped I would forgive him, as he was in distress.</p>

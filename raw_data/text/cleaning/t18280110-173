            . I am single. On the 11th or 12th of December I owed Mr. Vernon 4s. 10 1/2d. for beer, which I paid to the prisoner for him, and he gave me this bill, and receipted it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was that all you owed his master? A. No. I had paid the prisoner a great many times; I have sometimes paid him a part of my account, to give his master; he never told me he was liable for the whole account.</p>

            . The prisoner never paid me this bill from Miss Brockwill; it was his duty to pay my wife every day, when he came home, after the dinner, and after the supper beer; he may have received 9s. or 10s. in a day.</p>
               <p>JURY to CHARLOTTE VERNON. Q. How did you know this money had been received? A. I told a person that when their bill was paid I would give them a Christmas-box; they said they owed me nothing; I then made inquiries, and found this out.</p>

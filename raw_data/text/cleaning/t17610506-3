I went directly among the pawnbrokers, and found all my things again, some in Green-street, the corner of Leicester-fields, and the others at the corner of Coventry-court; and my husband took the prisoner in the street, the day that the man was executed for killing the woman in Leicester fields; she was carried before the justice, and I heard her confess she took the things away, and said she owed money, and the people dunn'd her for it, and she took the things to satisfy them, as she had been out of place, and had no money. I believe it is the first fact she ever committed.</p>

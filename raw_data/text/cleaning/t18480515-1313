                  </hi> I lodge in the first-floor front room at 10, Cale<lb></lb>donian-crescent, King's-cross. On Thursday morning I got up about six and saw the prisoner Kenerley leaning from the inside of the parlour window of Mr. Webb's house, nearly opposite me—the window was quite up, and one curtain rather crumpled and drawn out—he was looking towards the left; towards the crescent avenue—in a minute or two I saw the other prisoners standing in the crescent, outside the house, within fifty yards of each other—Kenerley got out of the window, dropped on to the cill of the next window, and came up the area steps and through the gate; they then went round the crescent, two of them together, and the other met them—they all then went together up to the window, as if they were going in again—Williams looked through the key-hole; the other two were on the pavement opposite the window, only the width of the pavement off—I then rapped loudly at the window—they all ran away, two one way and one the other—I informed the police about a minute afterwards.</p>

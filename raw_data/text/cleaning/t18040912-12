               <p>Q. When had you last known that you had the money in your pocket? - A. In Holborn I examined, and I never got down from my horses till I came to the inn; the moment I felt the money gone, I taxed her with it; she denied it; I said if she did not produce it, I would call the watchman; the watchman heard me, and he said, what is the matter, Joe; after that the watchman came over, and asked me what she had robbed me off; I told him nine guineas; and she, after some hesitation, produced six guineas of it to me; I then wanted her to give me the rest of my money, and she would not; she was taken to the watch-house, and it was found upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether she accosted you first, or you her? - A. She me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a very good-natured fellow, I am told; what did you give her - instead of giving her three shillings, you gave her three guineas? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep your silver and gold together? - A. No, I do not.</p>

            . I am a partner with Richard Ballad. On Thursday the 2nd of June, I happened to go into the neighbourhood to take a pint of beer. A young man come in, and said, there is a light in your accompting-house. We are <rs id="t18140706-100-viclabel558" type="occupation">paper manufacturers for paper-hangers</rs>

I went opposite of my window; I did not see any light, but on looking in between the joints of the shutters I saw a light, and heard some persons talking. I then went and knocked at the door. They asked, who's there from within. I said, here is one. The door was immediately opened to me. I then saw three persons; they were all strangers to me. I am sure the prisoner is one of them. One of them asked me what I wanted; I said, I want you. I rushed upon them, and seized the prisoner; the other two ran away. I called out, watch; the watchman came up to my assistance, and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any of your paper hangings were gone - A. Yes, one hundred and twenty pieces were moved out of the racks, and twelve pieces tied up in bundles. They were tied up with one string in the middle. We always tie them up at both ends.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the value of the one hundred and twenty pieces - 
               <persName id="t18140706-100-person833">A. </persName>
            Forty or fifty pounds. They first forced the door by a crow. There were the marks of two different crows upon the door. The lock of the accompting-house was broken also. The paper had been taken from the accompting-house, and there were nine shillingsworth of copper taken out of the desk belonging to my partner, which he had left there. The prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>JAMES SPEAR. I live in New-street, Dorset-square. On Wednesday morning, the 11th of May, about two o'clock, I was returning from a public-house on the other side of Westminster-bridge, and found I had drank too much - some person came to me, and in a kind manner offered me his assistance, which I was glad to accept. I suppose I must have told him where I lived - when we got near my own door I pulled out my watch to see the time; he immediately snatched it from me, and ran off; I gave an alarm, and be was taken in a minute or two.</p>

He said, "What am I stopped for?" the prosecutor came up, and said, "You have got my watch, give it me;" the prisoner said, "I have not got it;" we went back to Davis-street, and there saw the watch laying in an area, at the place where I first collared him, about a quarter of a mile from the place where Mr. Spear lives.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. On the 11th of May, at four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner running round Davis-street; I pursued him, and saw him in the custody of Winnett; I assisted to take him back to York-place, where we found the prosecutor, who asked him for his watch; he said he had got none: the serjeant of the night came, and we searched him, but found nothing. In going down Baker-street the prosecutor again said, "Take counsel, and give me my watch;" the prisoner said he was never in a watch-house in his life. I then asked him where it was, and he said he had thrown it down the area in the street where we came from; I went back, and saw it down an area, and a person who lodges in the house gave it me up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Chapel-court, Jewry-street, Aldgate. On the 20th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Aldgate, and saw the prisoner near Mr. Brown's shop—I saw him go to a block which stood inside the door, take off two pieces of kerseymere from it, and go along Aldgate with them—I walked several yards by the side of him, looked at him very hard, and he looked at me—I then <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him, saying, "You villain, you did not come by these honestly"—he instantly dropped them, and said, "Pray sir, pray sir, let me go"—a young man came up at the time, and picked them up—the prisoner broke my hold, and ran into Duke-street—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief!"—a young man stopped him—I <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him, and took him into Mr. Brown's—a policeman was sent for, and the prisoner given into custody—the pieces of cloth were brought to the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said in the shop that he did not see the person take the cloth. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not say so—I am quite sure he is the person—he ran up Duke-street, and a young man stopped him, in my sight—I did not fall down.</p>

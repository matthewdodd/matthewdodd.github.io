In December last, I lost a narrow striped silk gown, and a counterpane, out of this lodging. I had some goods in another house, in Somerset-street, which I was desired to take care of. I left my own lodging in Chandlers-street, with these things in it. I kept the two prisoners for some in Somerset-street, at their desire, and the request of my wife, who had known them. They were in great distress. One of them I put into work. I was about to return to my own house in Chandlers-street. I sent them to clean the lodgings, and get them ready. They went about the 20th of December. Upon the 22d, they desired to take their dinner in Chandlers-street. They took a dinner with them. They promised to be at home about four o'clock. When I came home between six and seven, I found they were not returned. This alarmed me. I enquired about it, and discovered that I had been robbed. I could not hear of them, till the 17th of July last, when Susanah Clarke surrendered herself up, and told where the other prisoner was, and where these things were to be found, in consequence of her information I did find them.</p>

They desired me to pawn this gown, and let them have one of mine out of pawn, which was cheaper. They declared it was their own gown. I pawned it for them at Careless's for nine shillings, and brought them the duplicate and the money.</p>
               <p>Susanah Devis. I missed these things just before Christmas, about three days before I saw the two prisoners; for the last time I saw these things, there was no one else in the house, but these two girls. Within these six weeks, Susanah Clarke came, and surrendered herself, begged for money, and said, she would tell me where to find all my things, and where the other prisoner was. She did discover the other prisoner, who was taken up accordingly, and these things were found. When she was taken up she behaved saucy. I have known them two or three years. I had taken them out of the Magdalen house.

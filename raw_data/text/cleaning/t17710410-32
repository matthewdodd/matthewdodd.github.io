On the twenty-second of February, a woman told me the dust people had been there to take away the dust, and the maid had missed a silver spoon out of the fore kitchen. I went to the fore shop, and there the maid was accusing the prisoner of having taken the spoon.</p>

            . The prisoner and the woman were protesting their innocency: I saw two other dust men in the shop; I asked them if they knew any thing of a spoon; they said if there had been any thing taken out of the kitchen, it must be by that man. While I was talking to them, a woman that was supposed to be concerned, called one of my apprentices away to a passage, and shewed him the spoon behind a door; so I took the prisoner and the woman before Justice Sherwood. The prisoner confessed to his taking the spoon, and hiding it in that place; he said that he took the spoon out of the kitchen, and hid it behind the door; and said it was because he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. When your apprentice found the spoon in the passage, what became of it?</p>
               <p>Dimes. He took it to the justice: I cannot swear to it; my wife can.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the spoon that was behind the door?</p>
               <p>Dimes. I make no doubt of it; I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Dimes. Yes; the twenty-second of February: it was on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when the spoon was found?</p>

               <p>Frogley. He went down to light a candle; I saw him coming up. I was in the kitchen about a quarter of an hour before that; I saw the spoon then: I left it on the dresser; and, as soon as I went, I missed it. I went to my master, and said I missed the spoon, and then went and took hold of the prisoner. He said, before the justice, that he was in the kitchen, and took the spoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that passage lead down to the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Field. This is a passage two or three doors off; it is a passage next door but one to the house, in another house.</p>
               <p>Q. But the prisoner was not out of the house when you seized him; was he?</p>
               <p>Field. The spoon was found in the house of one Tiggin, a baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of your people see the prisoner go into that house?</p>
               <p>Field. No; it was a woman that follows the cart?</p>

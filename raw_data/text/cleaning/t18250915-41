On the 9th of July, at half-past twelve o'clock, I went out with my husband's dinner; I locked the room door and had the key in my pocket; I returned in an hour, found the door still locked, but the property gone. On the 14th I was going out and met the prisoner (who is a stranger) with another person, they passed my door, and went into a barber's shop; the prisoner had my shawl on, but I was not then quite certain, of it being mine, and did not like to stop them. I followed them to Smithfield, then stopped and asked her to let me look at the shawl, which she did; it was mine, and I gave her in charge; she said she bought it on the afternoon I lost it, of a woman in the street, who was in distress: the young person who was with her, had my bundle handkerchief in her hand, she threw it down and ran away - the bundle contained bacon.</p>
               <p>MARY MARIA BROMFIT. I lodge on the ground floor of this house. On the 9th of July, about one o'clock, I was in the passage, and saw two women come out of a gateway, which leads to the back part of the house; the prisoner was one of them, she had a bundle in her hand - an elderly woman was with her; when they got three doors off, the other woman took the bundle and they went up the street together. I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>

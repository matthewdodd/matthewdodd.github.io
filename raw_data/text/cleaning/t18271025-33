            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in the Park on the 7th of October, noticing the persons following the soldiers. I saw the prisoner Miles press close against Took, and Wilson pressed close to him; I saw Miles take a handkerchief out of Took's pocket, and hand it to Wilson, who put it into his breeches pocket; I seized him, took it out of his pocket, and Morgan secured Miles, without his getting out of my sight.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MILES' Defence. I was following the band - a parcel of boys were running; they said some boys were taken for picking pockets. I went to look at them, and the officer said it was me - I never saw the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILSON'S Defence. I went to see the band, and picked a handkerchief up off the ground.</p>
               <p>PHILIP PARISH. I had been watching them for five minutes, suspecting them - I cannot be mistaken.</p>

            . I deal in rabbits and all sorts of poultry - I live in Willow-walk. On the 12th of March these rabbits were brought to me, about nine o'clock in the morning, by the prisoner: he asked me to buy them - I offered him 5s. for them: he refused to take it, and went away - in about an hour he returned, and asked if I would give another 1s.; I said No - he then said I should stand a pot of beer, but I refused; the prosecutrix then came in, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Church-street, and bought the rabbits of a man who I met - I had a spaniel dog with me; he asked if that was for sale - I said "Yes, for 15s.;" he said if I would take a crown and these three rabbits, I might have them.</p>

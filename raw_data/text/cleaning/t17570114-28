She wanted to get me into a house. She knock'd, but they would not let her in. Then we went up into the yard, and while - she pick'd my pocket of my watch. This was about half an hour after twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of December. It was very light, so that I could see her face plainly. I came out of the alley, and she close after me. In about ten minutes after I missed my watch, so went back, to see if I could find her; but could not. This was on the Saturday night. On the Monday following I found her, and charged a constable with her. The next morning I took her before Sir

She said, she knew where the watch was, and if I would come the day following she would help me to it, with proviso I would not appear against her. I went accordingly. Then she would not say anything to me about it.</p>

On the 8th of May, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I left my chambers in company with Mr. Rudall; the outer door was closed - it had a patent Bramah lock; I returned at nine o'clock, and was about to put the key into the lock when I heard somebody within ransacking the chamber - the noise continued about two minutes; I then heard the bolt withdrawn, and saw the prisoner open the door - he was a perfect stranger; I asked what he did there - he said he was waiting for the gentleman; I said I was the gentleman, I supposed, and immediately collared him; he made no resistance - I led him down stairs with the greatest ease; nobody was passing, and I called for Mr. Hill, the law-stationer, who stood at his door opposite, and at that moment the prisoner made a sudden effort, and escaped from me -I saw Mr. Fish stop him about twenty paces off, without my losing sight of him for an instant - he brought him up to me; I took him up to the chambers, and found a candle burning in the cupboard in a water jug - it had been taken out of a candlestick on my writing-table, and lighted in my absence; I said the prisoner ought to be searched - he immediately took out of his pocket three snuff-boxes, two of which are mine, and in his hat was a silk handkerchief and towel, neither of which are mine - he said that was the only property he had taken; he was immediately conveyed to St. Dunstan's watch-house, and was searched there - in his hat was found a steel, matches, tinder, flint, and two crooked wires; I returned to my chambers, and found a large law bag close to the outer door - I opened it, and at the top were four bottles of whiskey, which had been taken from a cupboard where I had thirty or forty; the bag was not mine - it also contained two coats, which I had left on two chairs, a waistcoat and trousers which I had left in a drawer of my writing-table, and two towels which were taken from another drawer; Mr. Rudall and I have the set of chambers between us - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270016"></xptr>went into his room, and found one of his drawers wrenched open - his papers laying about, and three pocket-books; another drawer was taken out of a desk, and put on the table - I returned to my own room, and found a tea-caddy and a cash-box on a chair close to the outer door, ready to be taken away - they are Mr. Rudall's; in the water-jug I found an awl, which is not mine - I examined the outer door, and found about an inch from the brass plate of the lock, that the oak door had been perforated by this awl - it matched it exactly; the wires would reach through the holes to pull back the bolt of the lock with the greatest ease.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Dunstan's. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house, and found in his hat a bag, containing a piece of flint, a steel, and tinder - I found a handkerchief in his pocket with three wires wrapped in the corner of it; I found on him this direction, " C. F. Williams, No. 1, Stone-buildings" - he said that was a gentleman where he worked, or was going to work; I found the awl in the chambers, and tried it to the hole in the door - it exactly fitted; here are the snuff-boxes which he produced.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. Two of these snuff-boxes are mine - I have had one about twenty years; the lock opens very easily inside - it is impossible to get at it outside except by the key; the coats are worth about 1l.</p>

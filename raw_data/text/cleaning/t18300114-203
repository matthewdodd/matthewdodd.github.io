On the evening of the 9th of December I was taking care of the shop - there was no one at home but me; I saw the two prisoners walking up and down about the door for about a quarter of an hour; Duff then came to me, and said, "Is your master out;" I said Yes - he then came and wanted to play with me, and to tickle me; Morris was walking up and down by the wine-vaults next door - Morris then said,"I should like a mutton-chop for my supper;" I said he should have it if he paid for it - he laughed at that; they walked up and down, and wanted me to play with them - they had made a mess before the door, and I took the broom to sweep it away; the handle came out - Duff took the broom, threw it through the window, and broke it; he then put his hand into the window, and I thought he wanted to steal something - they then came into the shop, and Duff held me down and put saw-dust into my mouth, while Morris took a rump of beef and ran off with it, and in a few minutes Duff ran away; they were taken in about a quarter of an hour - my master never got his rump of beef; I am sure they are the men - I had seen them about before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Then you knew Duff? A. I had seen him about, and knew his name - I do not know whether it was what they call larking - Duff staid in the shop a minute or two; I saw Morris reach his hand up, take the beef, and put it on his right shoulder; Duff was with me till Morris was gone; a man came to the shop and asked me if I had lost any thing, but I did not think of this at that minute - I thought he meant something off the block; that was about five minutes after: I know the consequences of an oath, and swear I saw the beef taken, but when the man came I thought he meant something off the block - I did not think of this at that time; this happened between eight and nine o'clock - I saw the prisoners again in a coffee-shop in Bedfordbury, a little before nine; I said they were the men - I looked round the shop to see if I had lost any thing when the person came to ask me, and I began to cry; I thought my master would be very angry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There was a rump of beef hanging up, and it was gone? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS YOUNG. I sell hardware in the market. On the night of the 9th of December I saw the two prisoners running about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - Duff was running first: he called out, "Charley, you make haste on;" Morris said, "D-n you, I am making haste;" Morris had a rump of beef on his shoulder, and the hook fell out of it - I took up the book, and went to the prosecutor's shop; this boy was standing outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Between eight and nine o'clock; it was dark, but I know both the prisoners - they lived in the neighbourhood; I went to the shop, and saw the boy - I asked if he had lost any thing, and at first he said No; I said, "Has there not been two men here?" he then burst out into very heavy tears, and said, "I have lost a rump of beef;" he was crying at the door when I first went - he said his mouth had been crammed with saw-dust.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop in Bedfordbury. The prisoners came to my shop on the night in question, and brought in some ragged pieces of beef, not much like a rump - I should think there were 3lbs. or 4lbs. of it; I did not see any bone - they filled the fryingpan with it twice; it was about a quarter-past nine o'clock- my shop is about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's; the Police-man came and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they brought no more steak than would serve two men? A. I do not know; the Police-men took it away, and eat it the next day.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRANSGROVE. It is my shop - I returned home at a quarter after nine o'clock, and missed a rump of beef, with a bone in it, weighing about 16 lbs.</p>
               <p>Duff's Defence. I left work a little after eight o'clock, and met Morris at the corner of New-street, Covent-garden - he had some steaks, which he said he bought in Clare-market, his father was not at home, and he was going to cook them at a public-house; I said, "I am going to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140093"></xptr>coffee-shop, if you like to go there you may;" we went there, and I had a bit on a bit of bread - I had no plate; the officer came and took me - I was earning 5s., or 6s. a day: if I stood on a scaffold instead of here I should say I was innocent - the boy says he saw Morris take the meat, and if I held his head down how could he see it; I declare before God, my maker, I had no act in it.</p>
               <p>Morris' Defence. I bought the steaks in Clare-market- I met Duff, who said he was going to a coffee-shop; I said, "I am going to have some steaks, if you like to have any you may;" they were just turned out of the pan when the officer came and took us.</p>

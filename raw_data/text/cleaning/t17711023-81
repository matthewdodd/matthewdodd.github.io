               <p>Hore. No; my wife told me so; about ten days after, the prisoner informed a young woman where the gown was pawned, that made me suspect her; the day after I went in search of her, and about eight o'clock at night, I met with her, and took her to the watch house; and the next day, to Sir

               <p>This gown Mr. Hore gave to me out of the box, on Tuesday night; he had no money, so he gave it me to be concerned with me; he went out into St. James's park, and under the fourth tree, by the gravel, he brought the gown there under his coat and gave it me; there was nobody there but ourselves. He spoke to me several times; I told him he had a wife; he came home drunk on Sunday night, and played his fun with me before his wife, and he put his thigh over mine. I am twenty one years old.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hore. Whether on Sunday, you played your fun with her, by putting your knee on hers; did you make any of these overtures to her?</p>
               <p>Hore. No; I never did in the world; I was quite the reverse of that; she would not take with me; it is very false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the gown out of the box?</p>
               <p>Hore. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the gown was out of the box before your wife told you?</p>

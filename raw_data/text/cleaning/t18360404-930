                  </hi>. I am a steward of a vessel. On the evening of the 8th of March I met Yates in Holborn—she invited me to her home—I went home with her—I was not exactly drunk, but mellow—we went into Gray's Inn-lane—I cannot tell the name of the court—I was very unwell in the house in consequence of having a little too much, and I called for a little something to drink there—I was very unwell in the room—in a short time Holiday came in—I laid down on the bed—I was too unwell to</p>

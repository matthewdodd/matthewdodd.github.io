            . On the 21st of May, I was a watchman in the Polygon, Mr. Essex's house was in my beat; in consequence of the lead being stolen I was suspended. Wishing to discover the thieves, I watched the next night, with Butler and Jefferson, in Clarendon-street, and between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw three men in Mr. Johnston's field, which is about 150 yards from the place, they were running backwards and forwards about a hole of muddy water; I went over into another field, and got within forty yards of them - They made off, I suppose they saw me; I followed the prisoner, who was one of them, and never lost sight of him - I secured him; he struck me. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the ditch, and there found three pieces of lead; there was more found.</p>

            . I was on the watch, and saw three men by the ditch; one took the lead out and handed it to the prisoner, another man carried it away. I saw the prisoner carry four pieces-they were disturbed, and ran away. I saw the prisoner taken, and am sure he is the man, I never lost sight of him. I found four pieces of lead in the ditch.</p>

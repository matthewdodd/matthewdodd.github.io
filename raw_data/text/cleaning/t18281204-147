I found part of the gutter taken away on Sunday, the 4th of November; I went and told the Governors, and they set me and Brown to watch that night - and about eleven o'clock, we thought it not right to stop any longer; we went, and told the watchman to watch: he went off at six - at five we went again, and waited till near half-past six, when Brown said it was not worth while to wait any longer; soon afterwards, Lea came, and made a jump on the wall, and jumped on the parapet; I let him alone for about a quarter of an hour, then I thought he had been there long enough; I jumped on the wall, and he jumped down - I saw no more of him till he was taken; I did not see Pearce at all; Lea was cutting a sheet of lead with this knife - when he jumped down, the knife fell from his hand; some lead had been carried away on the Saturday night.</p>

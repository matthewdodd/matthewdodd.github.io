            . I am coachman to Lord Duncannon. I have known Guinar for two years, by seeing him work near the stable, as a bricklayer's labourer - on the 8th of March he told me he had some pieces of iron lying about, which he wished to take out without the two carpenters knowing it; I understood he worked at Sir Claude Scott's house - he said the trifle he should get for the iron would be so little among them all;" I gave him leave to get it out, and went away directly - the following night I was out with his Lordship, and when I came home, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners - they spoke to me, and said they had been on the premises, and got the iron, out - it was dark and I could not see what it was, but they took it away at three different times - it was bars of iron, they carried it on their shoulders through my stables - they went out each of them loaded first, and then one returned and carried the rest away - they came back in a short time with some liquor, which they pressed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060063"></xptr>me to drink, and I drank with them - there is a low roof adjoining our wall, over which they got the iron; on the following night Hinsby came, and saw some bars and some sash weights were lying there, ready for them to take.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought all this an innocent transaction? A. Yes; I went by what Guinar said; two servants besides myself saw them take the iron - they are now in Court. I considered the iron was their own, and the reason they were afraid to take it out, in sight of the two carpenters was, because they should get so little for it; they brought iron twice over the wall out of the premises - there were eleven or twelve bars, and ten sash weights; some of them were sold; I did not see the money, but I had some of the gin; I did not think they were stolen till the second time. I did not tell Lord Duncannon of it, but I sent word to him by the valet the next day. I opened the gates of the stable yard for them - it was between ten minutes after seven o'clock and half-past seven - the men were then gone from Sir Claude Scott's. It did not occur to me that they might have carried it through Sir Claude Scott's without the men seeing them. I did not keep watch, and tell them to be careful, as the watchman was passing by, but as Guinar was going out the first time, there were three watchmen going by, and he stepped back, but I did not give that a thought. I went before Mr. Dwyer. the Magistrate - I did not hear him say it was of no use asking me any more questions, as I had made a liar of myself. I related the transaction as I have here - I did not say I had nothing to say or do in the transaction, nor anything of that kind; I told him I took part of the gin - there had been a person living on the premises of Sir Claude Scott, but I have since heard they had gone away before this transaction. When the prisoners returned the second time, I suspected it was a dishonest transaction, by the time they were gone. The gin was only given once, and we were about ten minutes drinking it; there were the two prisoners, my two fellow-servants, and myself. Upon my oath I did not tell Guinar to step back for fear of the watchmen. I sat up till a little before eleven o'clock - we were four hours there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you help them with any of it into the stable? A. Yes, the second time, because Guinar sat down, and refused to help.</p>

            . I am second coachman to Lord Duncannon. On the evening of the 9th of March some iron was brought into the stable yard by Guinar and the other prisoner - Guinar had spoken to me about it, on the Tuesday before; he asked me where the coachman was; I said he was gone to Rochampton, with the carriage; he said he had a bit of old iron in the stable, which he wished to get away; I had been present the evening before, about seven o'clock, when the two prisoners brought it - I did not help them. I had some of the gin which they brought in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the stable all the time? A. Yes, from seven o'clock till nearly eight - it was all over by that time; I stopped till I had done work - I cannot tell what time it was then, but the prisoners were then gone; they had taken out two lots before I left. I left the stable, and went with Sharp to the public-house, but I did not have above one or two glasses of ale - the two prisoners were there, and paid the money - Sharp drank with them; I was not near the gate when they went out. I do not know how much money they got, nor how much was drank - the prisoners and my two fellow-servants were drinking; I did not ask whose iron it was - I came to the stable door while they were taking the iron over the wall. I asked if they were taking any thing wrong, and they said No. Sharp was not there then. - Lord Duncannon received information of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How high is this wall? A. It is twelve or fourteen feet, and requires a ladder to get over it- they went out with the iron, and brought in the gin; I drank some of it - I only saw them take the iron once. I had been with a note from my master, and when I returned I saw the steward, but I did not tell him of it. I had seen one of them before - I went to the public-house, and they were there; we staid there till about half-past ten o'clock- I never suspected it was a dishonest transaction; I was at the office. I did not hear Sharp say he knew nothing about the transaction. Mr. Dwyer said it was no use to ask him any questions, as he had made a liar of himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that in consequence of his saying he had nothing to do with the transaction, and afterwards acknowledging he had? A. Yes.</p>

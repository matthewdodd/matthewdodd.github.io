            . I am acquainted with the prosecutor, I met him that night, he was drunk, there was a mob of forty or fifty people in Tabernacle-square, he was obstinate and would go into the mob - the two prisoners were there close to each other; they endeavoured to pick a quarrel with the prosecutor - I got him out of the mob, and on towards Old-street - he had his watch at that time, the two prisoners followed us, and Patten ran against the prosecutor's shoulder, and pulled the watch out of his pocket - the other prisoner was close to him - I took Patten by the collar - the policeman came up and I gave them both in charge - the watch has not been found, there was still some persons about - I positively swear I saw Patten take the watch.</p>
               <p>Patten. How do you know the prosecutor had a watch? Witness. I saw it, and saw you draw it from him; I cannot tell what you did with it.</p>

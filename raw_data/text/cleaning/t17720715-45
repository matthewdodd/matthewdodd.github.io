The prisoner was recommended to me as a sober woman, to nurse me in my lying-in; she was hired for a fortnight; after the fortnight, as I could not go out, she came to go of some errands for me; she came to light my fire; she borrowed the flat iron of me for her mother, and she pawned it for 6 d. after breakfast I asked her to wash me some things; she said she would, and I said I would give her some tea and three-pence; instead of washing them she took a book and went to reading. My husband is a <rs id="t17720715-45-viclabel232" type="occupation">shoe-maker</rs>

About six in the evening I was going out with some work, and missed my shoes; I then turned about, and missed my ban box; I called out Betty; but there was no answer; in the ban box there was a child's laced cap, a white cloth apron, a woman's laced cap, and 14 d. in money. My shoes I left by the fire with the buckles in them; they were pinchbeck buckles; my hat and cloak were taken out of a hat box; I saw them when I left her in the kitchen, about four o'clock the same day. My gown was in the cradle, that was gone, and the few rags thrown out; the silk and cotton handkerchief I gave her to wask; she left all the things I gave her to wash, except the silk and cotton handkerchief; there were some in the tub and some on the floor. When I found my things were missing, I went to her mother's lodgings, and her mother said, O Polly, I did not think my child would have used you so. I enquired after, but could hear nothing of her, till last Thursday my brother came and told me he saw her in the Back Lane; near Rosemary Lane; I went to the place and saw her sitting at the door; I took no notice till I got a constable to take her, then I said Betty how could you serve me so; she said it was cruel, but she would make any recompense; she said the things were wore out and destroyed, but the hat she had lost. On Tuesday I went to Hicks's Hall, and afterwards called on her, and asked her if she had any of my things; she said she had nothing to bring forth, but wanted me to come to some terms, and gave this raper to my mother; I can't read it ( producing it.)</p>

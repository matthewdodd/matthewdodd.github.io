                  </hi>. I live in Pollard's-row, Bethnal-green-road, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green, in the house of Thomas Eustace, the prisoner's father. The prisoner lodged in the same house—I occupied the first floor—on Tuesday, the 9th of August, I left my lodging, at about three o'clock in the afternoon—I locked my room door, and put the key behind a chest on the landing-place—I came home at about ten o'clock in the evening—I found the door shut, and the key safe—I went into the room, and missed my ring, a pin off a glass work-box on the table, and eight yards of calico—next morning I went to my chest for a pair of trow<lb></lb>sers, and found they were gone—on the Friday morning I missed a great-coat from the chest—I did not look for it when I went to the chest on Wednesday.</p>

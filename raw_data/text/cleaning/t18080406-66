               <p>MARY WARD. Q. Are you a widow lady. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of March, did you lose half a dozen tea spoons. - A. Yes, on that day I missed them towards the evening; I had seen them on the night of the 30th. I live at the Saracen's head, Snow-hill. The prisoner was <rs id="t18080406-66-deflabel353" type="occupation">kitchen maid</rs>

               <p>Q. She was sufficiently within the reach of taking these things if she was dishonestly disposed. - A. Yes; the waiter took them into the kitchen where she attended about her business; after missing of them I told the servants they must all take their oath, they all said they would,; I sent a servant to the pawnbrokers; she went to Mr. Hillier's and they were produced.</p>
               <p>MR. HILLIER. I am a pawnbroker, No. 12, Smithfield bars. On the 31st of March, between four and five, in the afternoon; I took in half a dozen silver spoons of the prisoner. I am sure as to her person; I advanced her eight shillings on them, she said they were her own she lived in Gray's Inn home: she pledged them in the name of Stewart. Mrs. Ward has the spoons.</p>
               <p>MRS. WARD. These are the spoons; I valued them at eighteen shillings; she confessed to me that she had taken them; when I asked her first if she know any thing of the spoons she said she did not, she would take her oath of it. I said I can tell you this, I have the spoons in my possession, it is in vain for you to deny it; she then told me that she did it to buy a gown; she lived with me about a fortnight last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have got nothing to say, I leave it all with you.</p>

               <p>Q. You were quite sober - A. No, I was not; I was as solid as I would wish to be; I was not half drunk; I had been drinking a glass or so; I was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you to go up there - what did you do - A. I took liberties with her, and she with me; after that I missed the money out of my pocket; she said the watchman is coming.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bag - A. I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>Q. How are the jury to say, are you sure you lost any money - A, Yes; to the amount of fifteen pounds, and odd silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the money found afterwards - A. Three guineas, and a half, she dropped going up Snow hill.</p>

               <p>Q. She was drunk too - A. I cannot say that, when the watchman was taking her along, by brother picked it up; they searched her at the watchhouse, they found four one pound notes, and a five pound note; all the money that she had belonged to me, she took bag and all.</p>
               <p>MR. COPE.

The prosecutor's brother picked up three guineas and half in gold; the prosecutor begged that she might be searched; we searched her, and found one pound fifteen and sixpence in her pockets and a broach, she was willing to give up the other money; the one pound fifteen shillings, and sixpence and the broach was hers; I gave the money to Mr. Fox. the other constable.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX. Q. You were constable of the night - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was given up to you, did you examine her - A. I did. I took her in the back place; I searched her there. Mr. Cope and I found upon her one pound fifteen shillings; she said it was her own.</p>

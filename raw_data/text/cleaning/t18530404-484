                  </hi>. I am a single woman. On Tuesday, 15th March, Mary Greville slept in the same room with me—we retired to rest as nearly as possible about 12 o'clock—Miss Greville went to bed last—about 2 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by the growling of my dog, who sleeps outside of the door of my bedroom—we both heard a violent skiffle with the dog—he seemed to seize something and pursue something down stairs, and I heard something fall, and afterwards found something which had been placed to keep him up stairs had fallen—Miss Greville got up, took a candle, lighted it by the night light, and went into the dressing-room adjoining, which does not open into the bedroom—I heard her scream out in a very terrified manner, "A man! a man!"—she then came back into my room, and closed the door—I opened the window of the house, gave an alarm, and the police came—I refused to go down stairs then, but I did afterwards, and found a constable at the back door—it was then very nearly half past 2 o'clock, not quite half an hour after I was first alarmed—since that some difficulty had been found in opening the door, and this morning I tried it myself, and after much difficulty did lock it, and this piece of iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dropped out of the lock—I found a small press ransacked, and the floor strewed with burning of papers which appeared to have been lighted for some purpose—a candle was turned down on the bed—things were distributed all over the kitchen—a barometer had been taken from the staircase where it had been hanging up, and placed in the kitchen—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was soon afterwards brought to the house by a constable—this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—it was kept in a press in the dressing-room—I am confident it was there up to the time the man came into the house—I had seen it constantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is my handkerchief; I was taken half a mile from the house, and taken back. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not miss the handkerchief till it was found, but its peculiar history makes it impossible for me to have the least doubt about it—I sewed the border on to it for the purposes of my profession, and I have worn it on my head upwards of two hundred times for a particular purpose; for thirty-five years.</p>

                  </hi>. I was residing with Miss Kelly. Early in the morning of the 16th I was aroused by the dog barking, and distinctly heard something fall down stairs—I got out of bed, took a candle, went into the dressing-room, and saw a man who resembles the prisoner standing facing me—I feel convinced he is the person—I called out, "A man!" and, having</p>

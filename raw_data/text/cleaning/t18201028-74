            , the prisoner was in my service up to the 15th of August. It was his duty to receive pledges, and enter them on the book. On the 6th of October a lady applied to me to redeem a gold watch, which had been pledged for 5 l. I found the counterpart of her duplicate on a watch in my hand-writing. I had put it on a gold watch. On opening the paper I found this silver watch, which I had seen in the prisoners bed-room as a wearing watch. Before he left I had missed other articles when persons came to redeem them, and he knew I obtained great discredit and injury by not having them to produce.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you take the gold watch in yourself - A. Yes; on the 20th of April.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Aldous to the prisoner, shewed him the silver watch, and asked if he knew it? he appeared at first not to know it. I said I was aware he knew it, he then said he did, that it had been his, and he had substituted it for a watch which he then had in his pocket. I said, No, he substituted it for a gold watch, which he denied. I found some keys on him, which he said belonged to his writing desk, and the bureau at his father's house, I said I was going to search his father's house for the gold watch, he then asked to speak to Mr. Aldous alone, Mr. Aldous refused. He then said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use denying it, you will find the gold watch in my desk at my father's." I did so. He then threw himself on the prosecutor's mercy, and said he had robbed him.</p>

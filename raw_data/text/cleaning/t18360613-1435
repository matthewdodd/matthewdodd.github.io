On the 25th of April I remember a female coming into our shop—I believe the prisoner to be the person—she purchased some trifling articles—I cannot tell to what amount—she then spoke to my young man—she asked me if I would accommodate her with a cheque for eight sovereign to send into the country to a friend—we kept a bank<lb></lb>ing account wish Messrs. Hankey at that time (<hi rend="italic">looking at the cheque</hi>)—this is the cheque I gave her for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I see the letter "y" here—that was not put there by me, nor the "0" in the margin—I drew it for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only—she gave me eight sovereigns for it—I received an account of this cheque, it may be three or four days afterwards, from Messrs Hankey; in consequence of which I requested to see it—when I gave her the cheque, she gave me her address, "Mrs. Hutchinson, No, 1 Connaught-terrace, Edgeware-road, Paddington"—this is the memorandum I made at the time—I have not been to ascertain whether any such person lived there.</p>

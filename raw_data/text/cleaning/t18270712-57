I placed implicit confidence in him, and treated him like a brother. On Monday, the 25th of June, in consequence of information, I went and searched his house. Mr. Glover and two officers were with me; I there found a quantity of my property. I had never given him authority to take it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MITCHELL. Q. Had you missed any of these things? A. I missed property at times, but had not the least suspicion of him, and when I have mentioned that things were missing, he has said, it was most likely I had sold it and forgotten it; he did piecework, but never took any thing home except a few wheels. I never allowed him to take any thing else home; he had no tools at home to finish any thing else. I have other workmen, but nobody but him attended in the shop. I thought him incapable of robbing me - I considered him as one of my family.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Look at this letter, is it his hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120036"></xptr>writing? A. It is; he had 3l. a week. When he first came he had but 1l. a week; the value of the property is 40l. or 50l.</p>
               <p>The following extract from the letter was here read: "It is my first fault: I am truly repentant; you will sooner be pleased by saving a man to his family, who truly repents; it is a greater exertion of virtue to save a repentant sinner than a thousand acts of justice."</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Elliott to the prisoner's house; I found all this property in his bed-room, on the second floor. I apprehended him before I went there; he asked what it was for, I told him his master had lost a considerable deal of property - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any articles of this sort, except what the prosecutor claimed? A. There were a few trifling things, which he said he would not swear to.</p>
               <p>MR. MITCHELL to MR. ELLIOTT. Q. What promise did you make to the prisoner's sister, before he wrote you this letter? A. I told her I did not wish to press the capital charge, as I thought he would be hung if I did; I do not know whether that was before or after he wrote the letter. I desired the attorney not to press the capital charge, as these articles must have been taken at different times.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

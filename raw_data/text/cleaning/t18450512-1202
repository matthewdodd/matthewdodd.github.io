On Sunday, the 20th of April, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoners Blundell and Jemima Wilson at the station-house, and, while there, I saw Blundell put something into his mouth, which he appeared to swallow with great diffi<lb></lb>culty—I said they should be searched—the female prisoner was taken to the back of the station-house by the female searcher, who after<lb></lb>wards returned, and said Jemima Wilson had two keys which she refused to give up—I said they would be taken from her if she did not—she then produced them—I went to No. 10, Eaton-street, New-cut, Black-friars-road, with Romain, a constable, and there found the prisoner Ann lying on the floor between the bedstead and cupboard—as we went into the room Romain turned his light on—she looked up, and said, "I thought it was my sister come," and asked where she was—I said, "She is locked up at the station, you had better get up and dress your<lb></lb>self"—Romain took a candle off the bedstead, and lighted it—I saw something white in the cupboard, and found a mould there, which I produce—I found a file on the same shelf, five counterfeit penny pieces, and this bag, with "Robson, plaster-of-Paris manufacturer, Mount-pleasant," on it—I found some pieces of metal in the cupboard called <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>, which fit the mould, and some pieces of run metal among the cinders under the fire-place—I found some more pieces of plaster-of-Paris between the stove and the wall—there were small splashes of white metal in the front of the stove, and about the bars—I said to Ann Wilson, "I have found a mould and several counterfeit coins here, you must go to the station"—she said,</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280034"></xptr>Larkin. It was on a Thursday; she ask'd me if her husband had been there? I told her no: there were some company in the house; she sat in and drank with them; after they had had four full pots they went away and left her there; there was a man that lets people blood, she said she would be blooded; he blooded her; she call'd for a full pot for him; my wife bid the maid take the things in, which I suppose she heard.</p>
               <p>Q. What things ?</p>
               <p>Larkin. We have a little yard, and they were things hanging out that had been washed that day; the prisoner went out and never paid for the pot of beer, and the things mentioned in the indictment, which were hanging in the yard, were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she was gone was it, that you missed them ?</p>
               <p>Larkin. In about five minutes time after; I went to see for her, but could not find her; she came in again about 9 o'clock that same night all over bloody. She had been fighting, and had got a great bump on her face; I asked her about the things that we missed? she said she never saw them; I charg'd the watch with her and sent her to the round-house on suspicion, and the next morning took her before Justice Manley; she confessed where she had pawn'd the things, and we went and found them accordingly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them ?</p>
               <p>Larkin. The bed-gown was pawn'd at Mrs Aery's, and the linnen sheet at Mrs Dodd's. (Both produc'd in court.)</p>
               <p>I can swear to the gown, but not to the sheet.</p>

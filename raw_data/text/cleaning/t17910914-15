I was not at home, I did not sleep at home; nobody was in the house but my furniture; I frequently went on a visit; I had left it for a whole month, and no servant. I left the keys with a neighbour; I set no time for coming back; I used to come back frequently; I came home about eleven o'clock on the 9th, and found the street door had been attempted in five places, which appeared to be wrenched; then the bed-room window was broke, and forced in the brick work; I left all safe when I went out; they had taken out the brick work and the window frames, and got in that way; I missed all the articles in the indictment; they were all in that bed-room. I have seen them since at the rotation-office, the day I came home, at Mr. Staples's office. My bedding and bolster were ordered me back; the pillow is here. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of August, about eleven at night, I was called out of my own house by a watchman, who is not here, and Mr. Story and me found another house broken open. We went across the fields, and between two and three in the morning we met the prisoner and another man with the goods in the indictment; the other man made his escape; they were close together; we met them by the halfway house in Stepney-fields; he was going from Mrs. Banbury's house quite a different way; I suppose he was a quarter of a mile from the house; Mr. Story and Mr. Whitfield were with me. This is the property we found on the prisoner; it was inside the bed, wrapped up in the blankets and sheets. This property dropped from the man who made his escape. I left the prisoner in custody of Mr. Story, who was with me, while I and Whitfield went after the other. The man that escaped had this long chisel, which matched with the place where the door was wrenched. I went to the house the Wednesday following; I did not hear of it before; the door of the house was wrenched in two or three different places, and the window broke open. It was between two and three in the morning when we met him; it was very dark that morning, I could not see the man that escaped; he got into a potatoe field.</p>

               <p>Was there not light enough to distinguish the features of a man? - Yes, when we laid hold of him. I have had the care of the things till now.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler. I was out with Riley; we met the prisoner at the halfway-house in Stepney-fields, opposite the door. I do not know Mrs. Banbury's house. Another man was with him; they were walking close together, and talking; we took all these things from them, and the chisel from the other man. It was very dark indeed.</p>

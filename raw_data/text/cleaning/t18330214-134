            , (Police-constable N 100). On the 29th January I met the prisoner at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, in Upper Holloway, carrying this copper on his shoulder - as I was coming down the road he saw me, and tried to get round a hay-cart; I asked him what he had got, and where he was going - he said he had got a copper, and he was going to get some pin-holes made in it, but he did not care where, as he was going to pay for it; these candlesticks he said he meant to get exchanged for steel ones - I then asked him what was in the bundle under his arm; he said some things he was going to get mangled for his wife; I found these pinchers on him, which he said he had used to take out nails - he said he lived at Finchley, and had done so for eight years, but there was no mangler there, and he was going to take the things to Islington, to get them done.</p>

The other boy asked me for four inches of pinion wire.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an article you dealt in? - A. No. The first boy I was speaking to, who is the boy that is not here, and this boy came in.</p>
               <p>Q. The other boy that asked for the pinion wire, he came first in the shop? - A Yes, and while I was speaking to him, the prisoner came in, I told him he might get the pinion wire in St. John-street, at a tool shop; I went to direct him, and I found he knew the place as well as I did; the prisoner at the bar was by him; I was standing at my board, and the watch was hanging behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was by you, what did he do? - A. He went by me in the shop, and came back again; I can only say, that I saw the prisoner when he went out of the shop on the step, he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in any direction to any place in the shop where the watch was banging up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back again, what did he do? - A. He came swiftly by me, and when he was on the step of the door, I had a full view of him, and in the street, I had a full view of him.</p>

               <persName id="t18051030-54-person620">A. </persName>
            I saw him go out, but I did not see him after he had got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that moment missed any thing before you followed the prisoner? - A. Yes, a watch off a hook in the shop, and seeing him run so violently, I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that the watch was in the shop, when the boys came in? - A. Yes, I had hung it up there, and had seen it a few minutes before; it was a silver watch that I had repaired. The prisoner ran up White Lion-street, and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that the boy that ran up White Lion-street, was the same boy that was in the shop? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in White Lion-street? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose sight of him? - A. No, never at all. I pursued him, and a man stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him till a man stopped him? - A. I saw him running up the street, and a man in the street bid him run hard, he cried out, run, run. I was spent in following him, and the witness in Court pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did loose sight of him for a moment? - A. No. I followed him close.</p>

               <p>Q. I see in your deposition that you soon lost sight of him? - A. He turned the corner of White Lion-street; and the boy that saw him turn the corner of White Lion-street, said, that he had a watch in his hand; I believe I lost sight of him for about half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say you never lost sight of him? - A. It was so short a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did loose sight of him for a short time, what happened after that? - I pursued him, crying out stop thief; this other man bid him run, and the witness in Court ran after him, and brought him back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the boy that was brought back to you, was the boy that ran away from you, as you thought, with your watch? - A. He was the same boy.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the watch? - A. A woman in White Lion-street, gave it me, she said, she picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. That you do not know, was that before the boy was stopped? - A. The boy was absent from me then, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that woman here? - A. No, the watch is here.</p>

             sworn. - I am a baker, I was serving customers in White Lion-street with bread; the prosecutor came running out of wind, and halloaed out stop thief; I saw the prisoner at the bar running up White Lion-street from Sewell's house.</p>

               <p>Q. But in that direction, as though he was coming from the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near did the prisoner run by you? - A. He run within ten yards of me, I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing in your pursuing him? - A. I saw him stoop at some place, whether the watch was put there by him, I do not know. I pursued him as far as the Spa Fields, and there I caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you, when you stopped him? - A. His shoe came off, and he begged me to stop, while he put it on. I asked him where the watch was (the prosecutor had told me that he had stole his watch.) He said first, that he had not got the watch; I told him then he must go to prison; he told me if I would liberate him, he would give me the watch, he would shew me where it was where he had laid it down, that is all he said; I took him back to Sewell, and he took him to Lack, a constable, in Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you the place where he had laid the watch down? - A. Yes, he shewed me the place, in White Lion-street; it was near the place where I had seen him stoop; I did not find the watch there.</p>

             sworn. - On the morning mentioned by the witnesses, I was crossing White Lion-street; I perceived the old gentleman in pursuit of this boy, some person on the opposite side of the street to where I was, bid the boy run fast. I could have stopped the boy, but I thought he had only been playing some trick to the old man; I went to the door of my lodgings; I saw some woman pick up a watch, and the very instant, the old man arrived, and said, the boy had stole the watch. I am sure the prisoner is the boy the prosecutor was pursuing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITE sworn. - I know nothing more than the boy being given into my care, and the watch. I produce the watch</p>

            (To prosecutor.) Look at that watch? - A. This is the watch that I lost out of my shop; I had cleaned and repaired it; it belonged to a gentleman who lodged next door to me; I lent him another while that was being cleaned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My father is a jeweller, he went to take home his work; I asked him to let me go to the Great Wheel, (a pond at Islington, near the spot); my father gave me leave, and I was to make haste back; I was running back to go home, and a gentleman run after me, and stopped me, by and by this old gentleman run up, and said, give me the watch, and I will let you go; I asked him what watch, I said, I have got no watch, Sir, I told him I was going home, and as we were coming along, a gentlewoman had the watch, and she gave it to the owner of the watch, and the gentleman said, he supposed I dropped it; he gave charge of me to a constable, and I was taken to Hatton-garden Office; I told him I never had the watch. He asked me where the other boy was, I told him there was no boy along with me.</p>

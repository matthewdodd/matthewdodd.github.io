On the evening of Sunday, the 1st of October, between seven and eight, the prisoner was running along with a hat on his head, and another in his hand. As soon as he saw me, he shyed me, and ran into a corner, where there are some pillars, in <placeName id="t18151025-41-crimeloc235">Wellclose square</placeName>

I went up to him, and he was jammed up in the corner, as close as he could get. The prisoner hit me, and I hit him again in the left eye, and down he went; I fell with him, I was uppermost; and I kept him down. Whilst he was down, I felt a tug at my watch, but did not give it a thought at that moment. I called for assistance but the watch was not then set. Nobody would assist me, for the people said, he had a knife in his hand. I saw something in his hand, but whether it was a knife or not, I do not know. He vowed all manner of things he would do to me. He said he would cut my b - y guts out, if I did not let him go. A young man that I knew said Lille, let him go, he is a complete out and outer; that means, the worst description of theives, and a fellow who would as soon run a knife in you as lock at you. I then let him up; and when he got up, I missed my seal, and told a witness, who is here. He then put himself in an attitude for boxing; and backed, and backed, until he got to the corner, and then he turned about, and was off, as quick as an arrow from a bow. My waistcoat was cut through and through. I suppose my seal was worth two pounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the printing-office of Balne, brothers, Gracechurch-street. I was in Smithfield on the afternoon of the 4th of September—I was passing through from my dinner—I saw the prisoner and three other young men, and the prosecutrix—the other three came close to the prosecutrix, and seemed to take particular notice of her—when she stood still they all closed round her—the prisoner was on the right side of her, and in less than a minute I saw him draw his hand from her right pocket, and he went away with the others towards the pens—I saw the prisoner hold up his hand as if showing something to the others—I told a policeman—he went after him, but the prisoner had gone away—I told another policeman, and he took the prisoner—I then returned, found the prosecutrix on the spot—I told her—she put her hand into her pocket, and missed the purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Wells, who is a watch and clock-maker, and lives in Percival-street, Clerkenwell. Dawson came and said I had had my pocket picked—I missed a bead purse with a brass snap, containing one sovereign, which was my husband's money—I had it safe when I left home—I went straight to the fair—there was a hole in the bottom of the purse, and I had rolled it up, and pinned it, and put it in my right pocket.</p>

On the 15th of January, in the afternoon, the prisoner came and produced this paper; I cannot say whether he said he brought it from Mr. or Mrs. Collingridge - there is a Mr. Collingridge, who is my nephew, who lives in Wilderness-row - he is a watch-case gilder; I sent my son up stairs for some watches, and asked the prisoner if he was to take any-hunting watches; I sent some watches by him, worth about 15l. at the selling prices, I told him so, and he went away with them; I had offered to make a parcel of them, but he said there was no necessity as the distance was so short - this is the paper he brought - I saw the prisoner in about ten days afterwards, at the Half Moon, in Portpool-lane; upon having a full view of him, I was quite sure he was the persen.</p>

I was very much like him. Witness. I could not speak positively to him at first, but when I saw him in the light I was positive of him.</p>

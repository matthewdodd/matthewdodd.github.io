I looked at my watch at eleven o'clock, and staid about a quarter of an hour after. There was a woman drank with me. I pushed her away. She wanted to take my handkerchief; I strove to get it from her, and a man came and struck me. I got it, and tyed it about my neck. After that I missed my watch; I charged her with it, and wanted to search her. They said, I should not see her searched; it was not decent. Then Mr. Quick, the landlord, said he would search her. He came out, and said he had searched her naked, and could not find it. Then they said, I had no watch, and called me a good-for-nothing fellow. Then the landlord said, I had dropped it in the necessary. I insisted upon all being searched; but they would not stand search. I went to look in the necessary; when I returned, the landlord said, it was safe enough. I went home and enquired after it, on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Then I went to the sign of the Sun on that same hill, for a pennyworth of purl; the landlady there said, I should find it out by-and-by. The next day I was sent for, and told, a person pretended to have found it. He directed me to a pawnbroker where the prisoner had pawned it. I went to the pawnbroker and asked for it; he told me, I should not see it. I got a warrant, and took the prisoner up, and had her there; then my watch was produced. I know she was at the alehouse that night.</p>

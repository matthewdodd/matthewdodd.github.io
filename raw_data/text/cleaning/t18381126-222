                  </hi>. I am a stone-mason, and live at Parson's-hill, Wool<lb></lb>wich. I lost a sling-chain, which was safe on my premises on the 8th of November—the prisoner was in my employ as a labourer—I did not miss it till I received information, and found it at the constable's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. On the 10th of November I went to an alley at the back of Mr. Yewan's premises, and saw the prisoner come into the alley, stop there about a minute, and then break into Mr. Yewan's premises by getting through a hole in the railing—soon after I heard the rattling of a chain, and he crept out with the chain—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him to another street, where he offered it for sale, but the man would not buy it—I went and inquired for a constable, and while I went to the constable's house he threw the chain down—I ran after him, but lost him—this was on Saturday—I saw him again on Monday, working on the road—I did not know him before, but I am sure he is the person.</p>

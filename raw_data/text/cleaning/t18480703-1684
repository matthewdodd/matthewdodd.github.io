                  </hi>. On 20th June, about three o'clock, I was walking with a friend, in Hall-place, St. John's-wood; I was suddenly struck in the breast, and immediately my watch and glass were snatched from me—the person ran off—mv friend, who was just before me, heard me scream, and turned, and prevented my falling—I saw the prisoner crossing the road, and by the time I got to him he was in custody of two men—I said, "If you will give me my watch and glass I will let you off"—he said, "If you will let me go I will never do it again"—a person said, "Here is a man who has found your watch"—a lady came up, and found my glass—these are them—the prisoner threw one on each side as he ran.</p>

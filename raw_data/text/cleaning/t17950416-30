               <p>Q. How do you know that the money was in your purse before? - I know it by having it in my hand, and when I gave out the half crown. And I gave charge of them, and they were taken to the watch-house, and they were there all night.</p>

               <p>I believe it was Thursday night, this gentleman was going down the Hay-market, and the prisoner picked him up and took him into a house in James's street; and he went along with her, and gave her half a crown, he gave her the half crown to have connection, and she did not lay on the sopha, she sat across him some how, and the mean while she picked the purse out of this man's pocket, and took the two guineas out, and wanted to give them into my hand, and I would not take them, I thought it was a sin to take it from him, and he had made a bargain with her that he was to have some drink out of the half crown; and when he came to the public house, he wanted to change the half crown, and he put his hand into his pocket to take out his money to change it, and he missed his two guineas, and a man advised her to give the man back his two guineas, and she said, d-mn his eyes and limbs, she would swallow it before he should have his money again, and she put it in her mouth and swallowed it, I see her, and told them so in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask her whether the gentleman did not give her the two guineas between the half crown piece and the shilling? - No, no such thing, I see her pick it out, and it was out of the man's right hand pocket that she took it, and she wanted me to have it, and I put it back, and gave her the money into her hand again; and she said, you black b-tch, say nothing, you shall not come to any harm; says I, you know you have got the money in your guts, give it the man; and she said he should not have the money any more.</p>


               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you hear Mary Hollwell say that she saw the prisoner take the money out of your pocket? - Yes, I heard her say so at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Prisoner at the bar, you have been convicted on very satisfactory evidence, of stealing the articles mentioned in the indictment; and under circumstances the most aggravating. One should conceive, that the tenderness of your sex would have prevented you from committing a crime of so horrid and atrocious a nature. I do not know whether you have ever been the mother of children; but if you have, your offence is aggravated beyond measure: for, if you have ever had the feelings of a mother yourself, your mind must be depraved beyond the possibility of conception, to induce you for so trifling an article as this, to have put parents into a situation which might have made them miserable to the end of their lives. For, the death of a child in a natural way, is not so dreadful as losing them thus. It is necessary, therefore, to inflict an exemplary punishment on persons of your description, by way of example to others more than of punishment to you: for I conceive your mind to be so depraved, that no sentence of the Court can make any impression on you. The severest sentence I can pass on you, is to send you abroad, where you will be at such a distance, (although I am not enabled, which I sincerely lament, to transport you for life,) that you will not be able, in all probability, to return; but if you should, I hope you will come back with a tenderer heart, and a mind of some feeling and sensibility. The sentence of the Court upon you, is that you be</p>

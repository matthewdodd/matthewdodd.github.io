            . On the 14th of last November, I saw the prisoner and Michael Paterson contesting at a warehouse door on <placeName id="t17551204-19-crimeloc107">Ralph's key</placeName>

I asked him what he had been doing in the warehouse; he said a cooper had given him some sugar. I sent Paterson up stairs, and he returned and said there was no cooper there; I searched him, and his trowsers had a large pocket on each side full of sugar; I made him pull them off, and the trowsers, sugar and all, weighed 30 pounds. He was carried before my lord mayor the next day, and there he said as before.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there sugar in that warehouse where you found him at the door?</p>
               <p>Coats. There were then 6 or 700 hogsheads in the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work in that warehouse ?</p>
               <p>Coats. I believe he had before this, but he did not at that time.</p>

            . I belong to the warehouses. I took the prisoner coming down stairs from the warehouse; I called Mr. Coats, he came; the prisoner told him a cooper had given him the sugar, Then I and two or three others went up stairs with a light, but there was no cooper there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for coopers to give away sugar in these warehouses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Morgan, a printer, in Cobourg-street, Clerkenwell. He has been acquainted with the prisoner several years—I had only seen him once myself; that is two years ago—on the 18th of May, he called on me: my husband was out—I was in the parlour, lying on the sofa, very ill—he said he came to see me out of pure respect to Mr. Morgan, as he respected him more than any other man in the office; and he had been more kind to him than any other man—I said I had no recollection of him—he told me his name—I then recognised him—I told him my husband would not be home until half-past one o'clock to dinner—I think this was about ten o'clock—he said he was not in a hurry, he would wait, as he wished to see my husband out of re<lb></lb>spect—I asked him to take a seat, which he did—there was no one else in the room at the time—the prisoner remained there till a little after twelve o'clock—my mother came at twelve o'clock—she came and sat close to me and never moved from her chair—I never left the room—at twelve o'clock I saw the watch hanging up safe—the prisoner sat under it—he said to me, "Shall I empty the composing-stick for you?"—he afterwards got up, and walked into the passage with his hat in his hand—I said, "Edward, are you going?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "When will you call to see Mr. Morgan?"—he said, "To-morrow, at one o'clock;" but he never came at all—he had not left the house two minutes, before I missed the watch—there had not been a creature in the room except my mother and myself—the composing-stick which he had been using was also gone.</p>

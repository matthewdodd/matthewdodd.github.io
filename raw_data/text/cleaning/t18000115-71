             sworn. - On the 24th of December, about half-past five in the morning, I and my husband were going in a cart to Chertsey-market, from Hounslow; there was some snow on the ground, which gave a great light; just as we got to <placeName id="t18000115-71-crimeloc423">Feltham-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he stop you for? - A. That I cannot say, whether it was to rob us or nor; he was as close at the side of the cart, as close could be; I then struck violently with the whip at the horse, and immediately a voice said, b - t your eyes, shoot the horse, and I saw a pistol immediately pointed at the flank of the horse; a pistol was fired, the horse gave a spring, and we got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the person that stopped you? - A. Yes, by the flash of his pistol; I had a full view of him, I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know him before? - A. No; I saw him again at Bow-street, a few days after; I believe, the Wednesday following; I recollected him again as soon as I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you saw the prisoner at Bow-street, he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, at Bow-street, that you knew he was the man? - A. Yes, I say, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate at Bow-street, did you say that was the man? - A. I said, I believed he was the man, and now I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. The light that you had came from the reflection of the snow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole transaction did not take up half a moment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that from the shortness of the time, and the extreme alarm you were in, you could not say whether he was the man or not, and I tell you, I have your examination in my hand? - A. I know that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But you did not say so at that time? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went out about half-past five, with my wife; as we were riding between Feltham and Feltham-hill, in a trot, all of a sudden, an alarm from the man's voice came, b-t your eyes; I turned round and saw a man pointing a pistol against the side of my wife's head; my wife then struck the horse, and there was a voice, but whether from the same or not, I cannot tell; b-t your eyes, shoot the horse; then the pistol was pointed right for the flank of the horse, and off it went; and when the pistol went off, by the light of the flash I saw the man's face.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of observing the man's face, so as to speak to him? - A. Yes; I had seen him many times as I was going backwards and forwards to Chertsey-market, he lived just before you come to Chertsey-bridge; I knew him at the time when I saw him at Bow-street, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How far is it from Feltham-hill, to Chertsey-bridge? - A. Four or five miles.</p>
               <p>Q.You were very much alarmed, were you not? - A. I cannot say I was much alarmed, because I rather expected it; the moment the pistol was fired, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before any Magistrate? - A. Yes, Mr. Anderson, at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. But he was not taken by any officer belonging to Mr. Anderson, but by some officer belonging to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. As this man lived at Chertsey-bridge, why did you not seek after the man that day, at Chertsey? - A. I was busy about the market, and wanted to get home to my family.</p>

               <p>Q. How many rooms have you in the house? - A. Three, all on one floor; I go through his room to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the doors of all the three rooms communicate with the passage that leads to the outer door? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You are forced to go through his room to your own? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Your bed-room is the furthest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if he wished to go out, he could, without going through your room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore he might go out of the house without alarming you when you were asleep? - A. I get very little sleep, that I do not think he could get out without my hearing him.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing particular to six you to the day? - A. No; I always found him in bed when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was so early as half-past six? - A. I was called up by a bargeman that employs me to carry lime through the bridge.</p>

               <p>Q. You said you were, just now; do you mean to say you were called up, or not? - A. I cannot say whether I was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only mean to say that you generally found him in bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear when he was taken up? - A. Yes; I was by when he was taken up, not a hundred yards from my own house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Where was he taken to? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you mean to say, that you saw him in bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What, at half-past six o'clock? - A. Yes; because his head lies close against the window, and I saw his clothes lying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to swear that there was sufficient light for you to discover his cloaths from the bed cloaths? - A. I cannot say, but I saw the breeches upon the floor; my house is on the Middlesex side of the river, and the windows to the south.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you helped to draw a barge with lime through the bridge? - A. Yes.</p>

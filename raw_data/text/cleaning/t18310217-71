            . On the 11th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at my own door, and saw the prisoner come from the prosecutor's door with a pair of boots in his hand, which he put under his coat - he went on the the corner of the New North-road, turned up there, and another boy then joined him; I ran to the prosecutor, and asked if he had sold a pair of boots - he said he had lost a pair; I took him, and showed him the prisoner - he ran faster than I could, and just before he got up to the prisoner, I saw him drop the boots; the prosecutor took them up - he took the prisoner, and brought him back to me; I collared him - he put his hand into his pocket, took out a large goblet, and before I could get hold of his hand, he threw it down and broke it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was a strange boy who threw them down. Witness. No, the strange boy was ahead of you.</p>

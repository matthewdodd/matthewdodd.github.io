            . I am a silversmith; on Wednesday the 19th of September, between three and four in the afternoon, a young man came into Mr. Gordon's shop, he informed me that there were two suspicious people walking about our window, whom he said he knew very well belonged to a gang in Drury-lane; he desired me to come to the door and he shewed me them; they were in the church yard near our house, and they were both talking together; I mentioned it to my master, he desired me to watch them; I had not been out long before they came out of the church yard, and went down St. Martin's-lane, they turned up St. Martin's lane into the Strand. When they came to Church-court, they both went up together; after they had gone half way up the court they separated; Jones came down first and Walter's followed. They went about a dozen doors along the Strand, they went up Hewitt's-court, and turned round at the top of the court. I thinking they were going to my master's house again, I turned up Church Court; between these two courts, at the top, there is Mrs. Gardley's, a broker's shop; I went and informed my master. When I came back to the top of Church-court, I met Walter's with the carpet under his arm; Walter's passed me with the carpet and Jones followed after him into the Strand. I watched then into a court that goes into Hungerford-street, and there Walter's gave the carpet to Jones, and Jones put it on his shoulder. I went to Mrs. Gardleys and asked her whether she had missed any such thing; she said, she had. I came across the church yard; I met Watson, he came with me down St. Martin's-lane to Charing-cross; when we got there I met the two prisoners, Jones had got the carpet on his shoulder; I saw Brooker, he seized Jones, and Watson, Walters; I took the carpet.</p>

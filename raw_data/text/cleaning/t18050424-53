             sworn. - On Sunday, the 17th of March, near one o'clock at noon, I had been to St. Patrick's chapel, at <placeName id="t18050424-53-crimeloc305">St. Pancras</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did you lose? - A. Two half-guineas and a seven-shilling piece; Major 
               <persName id="t18050424-53-person573">Bird</persName>
            , my acquaintance, being with me; he was younger and stronger and more athletic than me; the boy shewed him the man; he took hold of him by the collar and seized him; a woman cried out, whoever has lost a purse, I have it; she gave me the purse, and I knew it to be my purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were a great concourse of people? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. It was impossible for you to tell who might have taken your purse or who might not? - A. I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman that had got the purse is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- VAUGHAN sworn. - I live with my brother; he is a shoemaker at Charing-cross: On that day I was standing at the chapel door; I took notice of the transaction; the prisoner was walking quite close to Mr. Reddington; I did not see him exactly put his hand into his pocket, I saw him as he 
               <persName id="t18050424-53-person574">drew</persName>
             the purse out, and snatched it; I said to Mr. Reddington, you have got your pocket picked; I said, that is him; he was trying to make off. (The purse produced.)</p>

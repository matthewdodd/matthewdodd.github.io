               <p>EDWARD CALVAN. I am a Police-constable. On the 9th of April I was on duty at a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, at Limehouse, near half a mile from Mr. Guest's - I saw the prisoners in company, and each of them had a bundle; I went up, and asked what they had there - they made no answer, but went on; I followed them, and asked them again - they said it was nothing to me; I said I insisted upon seeing - Hazel said,"You shall not," and he said what he had got was his own - I said I would insist upon seeing what they had, and Parker said, "Oh, show him;" they then put the things down against a brick wall, and Hazel began to speak to Parker - I went to the river-ride, and sprang my rattle; I came back, and saw in the bundle some saws and cooper's tools - I went back to the river, and sprang my rattle again lustily; they then each of them ran at me with a cooper's adze in their hands - they struck me on the head several times, and broke my hat down; I cried Murder! a woman opened a window, and she cried Murder! the prisoners ran off; I pursued them, they returned, struck me again, and Parker struck me with a long pole; they then got over a high bank - Hazel stood under the bank, and Parker went across the field; I followed him some distance, and pointed to a man to take him - the man came up, but was afraid to take him; I went up to Hazel; he turned with the adze in his hand, and held it up to me - I told him he had better submit, it would be all the better for him; he cast his eyes down for a moment - I sprang forward, and took hold of him; I took him back to where the tools were; the inspector afterwards went to the prisoner's house with me - we there found eight rabbits, but no fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Who did you find at home? A. Nobody; the people told me the house belonged to Hazel.</p>

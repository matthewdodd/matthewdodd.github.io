On the 31st of January I was taking down the shutters, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the morning; I had taken them down on one side, and passing the shop-door to go to the other side, I saw the prisoner in the shop, with a medicine-chest under his right arm, which had stood on the counter; he asked me if there was any body in the shop he could speak to - I said, Yes, I could speak to him; he was then turning round, as if to go out - I asked what he was going to do with the chest; he said, only to look at it; he never saw such a thing before; I called my master, who took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ALGERNON SMITH. I was called down, and took the prisoner to the watch-house - this is my chest - it cost me 5l., but there are a pair of scales and weights belonging to it; it is now worth about 4l. 10s. - the prisoner's father lives just behind our house.</p>

            . I have for a considerable time suspected that the prisoner robbed me. On Sunday last, from the appearance of the prisoner's dress, I perceived that he had a great quantity of clothes on; I requested that he would walk up stairs with me, and open his box; which he did, very reluctantly. I then perceived by his legs, that he had more stockings on than belonged to him. I put him down on the bed, and took the stockings off his legs; he had five pair of stockings on his legs, three pair in his bosom, a waistcoat on belonging to Sparks, and shirts belonging to a gentleman that is dead, who lodged in my house when he was alive.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in the indictment - A. In his pocket we found a silk handkerchief, belonging to me; he had other property in his box.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. I am an officer. I produce the property. All these things were found upon him, and some in his box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all under my care.</p>

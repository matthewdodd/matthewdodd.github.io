            . I keep the Bell. The prisoner came to the house on Saturday, the 10th of February, with Mrs. Skinner; they got there about two o'clock in the afternoon - the prisoner engaged a room; they slept there on the night of the 10th - it was No. 9, not No. 11; they brought two bundles and a basket as their luggage - I saw Skinner next day, about half-past nine o'clock; he sent for an officer, and charged the prisoner with robbing him; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it - there was a bonnet on the table, and the prosecutor said it was his wife's bonnet - the wife refused to go down to the prosecutor; I went up with him and assisted him in taking thirty-nine sovereigns from her, and half a guinea, which she had taken with her.</p>

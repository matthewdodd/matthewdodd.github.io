On the 22d of October, I went to bed between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. I got up at six, and found my box locked as before, but the property was gone-the key was in my pocket, and so were the two 1l. notes. I have known the prisoner ten years, but do not know that he was in the room that night. Next morning, about eleven o'clock, I found him in custody at the George, public-house, in Brick-lane, with my property.</p>

            . I lodge in the same room with the prosecutor. On Wednesday night, the 22d of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I came home, opened the door, and found the prisoner in the room. I asked him who and what he was? he made me no answer. I collared him, said he was a thief, and insisted on knowing what he was. He said he knew Ryan, who lived there, and sat down on Ryan's box - A woman brought a light. As soon as he saw the light he started off, leaving his hat behind him. He returned between four and five o'clock for his hat-one of the lodgers gave it out to him-we did not then know that anything had been stolen. When Ryan got up the theft was discovered, We went to look for the prisoner, and found him at the George, public-house, in Chick-lane. He rushed out of the house, I laid hold of him - He resisted very much, the constable secured him. He said, "Let me go, and I will give you every thing, except a waistcoat, which I have sold."</p>

            . I keep the George, in Chick-lane. The prisoner came into my house on the 23d of October, about seven o'clock in the morning, with a bundle. I asked him where he had lodged the night before? he said he had just come from Canterbury. Ryan and Henley came in and took him-Ryan claimed the bundle, which the prisoner had given into my care.</p>

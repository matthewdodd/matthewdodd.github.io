                  </hi> I left my house at intervals, from 7th Aug. till my return on 7th Sept.—when I left on 7th Aug. there was a gold watch, made by Pitt, in an open drawer—I did not miss it till 7th Sept., when I missed the other things—when I came house from time to time, I noticed the state of my bed and night-shirt, and felt certain that a man and woman had been sleeping there—I told West of it—I left her in the house on all the occasions of my absence—I left no man in the house—there were young men in the offices—there is a connection between the offices and the house.</p>

                  </hi> My master went out of town on the 7th Aug., and left me in charge of the house—the prisoner came on the Friday evening, I think—I do not know whether that was the same evening my master left, I think it was—it was shortly after—I had not known him before—he came round that night after Dignam, about some papers, or something—Dignam first intro<lb></lb>duced me to him—he did not come to see me after that—I do not say never—he came once or twice, but not often—I slept next to the nursery—that is not my master's bedroom—my master never spoke to me about the sheets of his bed, or his night-gown, or anything of sort.</p>

               <p>ANN POPE. I keep the house; I let lodgings by the week. The prisoner came to my lodging on the 3d of October. She slept in Lee's room that night. Lee kept his things in the closet. Lee was out that night. The prisoner went away at half after six in the morning. After that I went into the room to take the bed, and missed Lee's things. The linen was there when the prisoner went to sleep. I am certain of that.</p>

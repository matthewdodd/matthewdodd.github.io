On the morning of the 17th of June I fell in with the two prisoners in Drury-lane, near Long-acre, a little before four o'clock - we went into a house in Drury-lane, and had something to drink; I had 15l. in 5l. notes, thirteen sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns - I am confident I had all this money when I met them; I at length went with them to <placeName id="t18310630-339-crimeloc1785">No. 4, Phoenix-alley Hart-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you drunk? A. I had taken a little refreshment, but was perfectly sober; I only went to one public-house - a friend was with me; he went with Harrington to another room, and they kicked him down stairs - I paid money away, and received some in the course of the day; I know what I had when I went into the house.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of June, this day three weeks, I was out cleaning my lamps - I saw the two prisoners and another shorter person coming from Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, towards Gate-street, at a quarter-past five o'clock; I saw Booth take something, put it in her left hand, and with her right hand she threw it over the wall of a garden - I had seen the prisoners before; I told the Policeman, and by his permission I went over the wall, and found this green purse, which I have had ever since - the prosecutor claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know both the women? A. Yes; I have seen them - I saw her put something in a bulk into her left hand, and then into her pocket.</p>

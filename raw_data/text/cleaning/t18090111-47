            . I am a seller of fish. On the 5th of December, between twelve and one, I was coming up Church fields, Walthamstow, I met Mr. Rawlins; he asked me whether I saw three men; I told him no; he told me they had robbed him; he gave me a description of them. When I came to Clapton, in the Back lane, I saw three men that answered the description; one of them had a bag under his arm, and a bit of bed sacking hanging out of the bag; I catched hold of him by the collar, I asked him what he had got there; he said nothing that belonged to me, and chucked the bag down to Smith; he said to him, that is not my bag, it is your's; he hit me on the breast and wrenched himself out of my hands; when I found he was gone up the Back lane I went to Smith and said if he is gone you shall not go. Russell went on, a gentleman on horseback went after him and stopped him; they got a constable and took them in custody, and I went to Walthamstow to let the prosecutor know.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Finsbury-street. On the 5th of June I was in <placeName id="t18330704-112-crimeloc569">Moorfields</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who knocked the prisoner down and broke his head? A. I did not see it done; I had lost sight of the prisoner - there was a lad at the station-house, but I did not see him produce any handkerchief; he did not produce this of mine, for I had picked this up - I think the lad gave his evidence; I really forget his name; I know where he resides, but I have not brought him here; I thought my own evidence was sufficient - the policeman saw nothing of the transaction; when I first suspected some person intended to rob me, the prisoner was behind me - there was one other person behind me, but lower down, but that was not the lad who brought this other handkerchief; I was at that time opposite Mr. Bennet's, the coach-maker's, in Moorfields - I missed the handkerchief just at the corner of White-street, which I think was half a minute after I found it safe; the prisoner was then about five yards before me, he was stopped at the corner of Moor-lane - I am certain I saw the prisoner throw my handkerchief down.</p>

             (police-constable G 72). I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief which the prosecutor gave me - here is a handkerchief which a lad came up and gave me when I had the prisoner in custody; he said,"Here is a handkerchief which I saw him throw away - I picked it up."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not allow the lad to be examined? A. I did not hinder it; he went to the station-house; his name was taken down at the time, but I don't know what it was; I don't know that I heard it - I know the street that the lad lives in - I did not break the prisoner's head; I did not knock him down; if he broke his head at all it must have been in his falling down - when I went to catch him, he went against the wall, and then he fell down and I fell at the same time - I can solemnly swear I did not take out my staff at all till after the prisoner was in custody; and I never struck him with it - I took the lad to the Mansion-house; I did not tell him not to go before the Grand Jury; I said he might please himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was proceeding from my work in the Minories; I was going up Ropemaker-street; there was a cry of Stop thief - the police-officer came up and knocked me down; I said it was not me, but they would not let me go; a lad came up and said he had seen me throw away a handkerchief; I was then taken.</p>

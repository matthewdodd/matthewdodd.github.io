             thus depos'd. The Prisoner had been my Lodger about a Month. When one Night while I was a Bed I heard a Noise below Stairs where my Chest stood. So I call'd out who's there! The Prisoner answer'd, 'Tis I Landlady I am only looking for a Pot to warm some Beer. By and by he comes up into my Room, and takes all the Money out of my Pocket; then he went into the Closer, cut a Slice of Mutton, and went down Stairs again; next Morning I found my Chest broke open and my Money gone. The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I never had any Thing of what I am charged with, but the Rings, and I came by them honestly. For when I came to lodge with this old Women, she fell in Love with me; she has got a Husband indeed, but he's at Carolina. One Day she invited me to go with her to Stepney to take a Treat of Cakes and Ale, and I went; and while we were drinking together, I had Occasion to go to the Necessary House, which was at the farther End of the Yard; I was no sooner got thither, but she came in after me - and we were very merry together, and the gave me the Rings for my Pains, and so we came home again. At Night I went up Stairs, and she follow'd me. We had several hot Pots together, I went to Bed while she was in the Room, and she undrest herself, came into Bed to me; and because I did not satisfied her, she swore this Robbery against me, tho' I never did an ill Thing in my Life.

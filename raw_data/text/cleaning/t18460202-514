                  </hi>. I am a distiller, and live in Albany-street, St. Pan<lb></lb>cras—part of my premises are occupied as a distillery, and another part as a private house—this plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is a perfectly correct representation of the premises—there is a doorway in the centre of the building leading to the kitchen, a door leading to the distillery, and another leading to the private house—the pantry in which the plate was kept is at the end of the dwelling-house, and over that the servant's bed-room—there is a water-closet at the bottom of the stairs, and above the covered way is a passage leading to a door which is usually open—a person going along the passage could go through that door, and get to the other side of the house—the prisoner Edward Plowman was my butler—his bed-room was on the distillery side of the house—there is a flight of stairs leading from his bed-room, and a water-closet at the bottom of those stairs—the centre gate is always kept locked at night, and the porter keeps the keys—the door on the right hand side, leading to the private house, is usually kept locked at night—it is the butler's duty to lock that every night, and to hand the key to the porter, or put it in the porter's room—there is plate kept in the butler's pantry—Edward Plowman would have no business whatever in my private dwelling-house after the house was shut up—there is nothing to bring him there except for private purposes of his own—on the</p>

               <p>24th of Dec. I left town, with Mrs. Grimble—before doing so, while the pri<lb></lb>soner was clearing the breakfast things away, I took a gold watch and stand, in his presence, off the mantel-shelf, and put it in the left hand sideboard drawer—there are other drawers to the sideboard, but they contained nothing of value, and were not locked—I locked the one I put the watch in—there was a desk in the room—I did not see anything done to that before leaving town—our housekeeping money was usually kept in that desk—Edward knew that well—he had fetched 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning from the counting-house for housekeeping, by an order from Mrs. Grimble—I did not see him fetch it, or give it to her—I returned to town on Friday, 26th of Dec, and remained in town two or three hours—the house was then as I had left it—I was in the dining-room, and I think I went to the sideboard drawer, but I am not cer<lb></lb>tain—I went out of town again, and returned on the 29th—I found the side<lb></lb>board drawer broken open, and missed a gold watch, a gold chain, a breast<lb></lb>pin, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—the writing-desk was broken open—I went to the pantry, and found the articles stated in the indictment all gone—there is a private entrance to the dwelling-house, which has no outer key-hole—the key is always kept in the lock inside the door—there is a stove in the pantry, but there would be no occasion for a fire there during the night—there if a pipe from that stove, which goes through the servant's room, up to the ceiling—the rooms are twelve feet high—this plan is only the ground-plan, but the up-stair plan is exactly the same, and there is the same corresponding passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid in Mr. Grimble's service—there is also a cook, two nursery-maids, a footman, and groom. On Sunday the 28th of Dec, at ten minutes after ten o'clock, I let the groom out of the kitchen—he went to his cottage where he sleeps—the porter, the cook, the prisoner, and myself, were then in the kitchen until half-past—we then all left the kitchen together to go to bed—the porter went to his lodge, and the prisoner went to his pantry—I and the cook bid him good night as he went to his room, and we went to bed—I did not see him go to his room—we passed the pantry where he was, and bid him good night—he was not in the pantry, but against the stairs, when we went to bed—he went towards the pantry—after being up stairs some time, I heard a small knocking—I afterwards went to sleep, and was awoke by the cook—the first noise I heard was a kind of whispering after we awoke up—I got up and opened the room door, and heard somebody come from the hall to the pantry—that was just upon twelve o'clock—I then locked the door again—I afterwards went down stairs, and when I entered the hall I heard the pantry-door open, but did not stop to see who came out—I went to the porter—I afterwards went to the prisoner Edward's room, and found his bed had not been touched—I had made the bed in the morning, and it was as I had left it in the morning—I then went along the private passage to the other side of the house where the family reside, but still on the ground<lb></lb>floor—I there saw the prisoner Edward, three or four stairs from the ground<lb></lb>floor—I mean the stairs opposite the private front door—he was coming down—I asked him what he did there—he said that he had heard somebody in the house—I said, "What do you do here?"—he then said he had come to the water-closet—I asked why he did not go to the one which was nearer his bed-room—there is one very near his room—he made no answer—the porter proposed that I should go and call the clerks—the prisoner said he would go—I went to Edward's room afterwards—I then found the bolster had been pulled out of its proper place, but the bed did not appear to have been slept in—it was different to what I had seen it just before—he said several times that he had been to bed—I said he had not—I had seen the silver cups and castors on the Saturday—Edward was cleaning them.</p>

I have known William Plowman about eighteen months—I received a letter from him about the 12th of Dec. at the corner of Albany-street, to take to Mr. Grimble's—he told me to ring the bell and leave it for his brother—I was not to wait an answer—I rang the bell and gave it to a young woman—I went away and waited with William at the corner of the street for some time—I cannot say how long—the prisoner Edward then joined us—they walked on four or five yards ahead of me, round the market to the corner of the street, and then Edward left him—William said, "We will go and have a pint of beer"—we went to a public-house on the left hand side of the distillery, remained there about a quarter of an hour, and about two o'clock William said he was to call for a parcel—at two o'clock we went to the beer-shop at the corner, had another pint of beer, stopped at the corner till just after the clock struck two, and Edward brought the parcel out in a piece of newspaper, he delivered it to William, and went in again—I saw it opened by William—there was a work-box with a top tray to it, and underneath was a piece of yellow soap—on the Saturday before Christmas-day I saw William again—he asked if I would get him a key made to a pattern on a piece of yellow soap which he gave me—I think it was the same description of soap as I had seen in the box—the box now produced is the one—these figures were on it at the time—William and I went that evening to a shop near Clare-market, and he obtained a key there which was fitted to the pattern on the soap, it was given to the man to fit it—Bywater was with us—we went to the White Horse, had a quartern of gin, and returned to the Three Compasses, in White Hart-street,</p>

FRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he asked a policeman to direct him to a night-house to have coffee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and he showed us the Fitzroy coffee-house—it was a quarter or twenty minutes before twelve o'clock when William left me—he did not come back into the coffee-house, but I saw him outside—he did not appear to have been running or flurried, and was not carrying anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I kept the Three Compasses. The prisoner William lodged at my house in Dec.—on the Sunday night before Christmas he went out with Butler—I believe it was about half-past eleven o'clock when they left—they got back about a quarter or half-past twelve, as near as I can recollect, about half-past—I do not think they had anything to drink when they returned—I do not keep the house now—the prisoner paid for a pint of brandy when they came back, but it was supplied that night before they went out—the prisoner owed me about three months' rent, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he has not paid me—it was about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week board and lodging—I did not know his box before the waiter or servant brought it into my bed-room—I had the charge of it, it was left in my bed-room—Butler told me it belonged to the prisoner—I pointed out that box to the police—my wife handed this work-box to the police in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard White—we live in Great Chapel-street, Broadway, Westminster.

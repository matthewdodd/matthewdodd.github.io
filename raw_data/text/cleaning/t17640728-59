            . On the 29th of June, the prisoner came to pledge two hats with me: I live at the bottom of Wood-street, near Cripplegate. I examined the hats, and said I did not like them; he took them from the counter. Some few minutes after, a woman on the opposite side the street came and told me a man had stole a hat that was near my door, and ran up Wood-street; I ran up to him and laid hold of him, and desired him to walk back: as I was coming back, a woman told me she saw him put a hat down a cellar window; which we found in the cellar; it was my property, and was in my shop before he came in.</p>

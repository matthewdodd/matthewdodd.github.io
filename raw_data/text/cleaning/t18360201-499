                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials. On the 21st of January, at a quarter before one o'clock, I had been to a small party, and was sober—I was coming out of St. Andrew-street—I felt myself unwell, and leaned against a post—the prisoner came and put her arms round my waist, and wanted me to go home with her—I never opened my mouth to her—the policeman came up and asked what she wanted with me—she said I was her brother—I went home, only just over the way—I went up stairs, took of my jacket, and missed my watch—I went down again, and by that time the same policeman had returned round his heat—I told him of it, and he apprehended the prisoner the next even<lb></lb>ing—I had no conversation whatever with her—this is the watch, seals, chain, and key—the ribbon does not belong to me.</p>

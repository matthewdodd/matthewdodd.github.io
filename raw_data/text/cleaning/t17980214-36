               <p>Q. It is valued at thirty shillings, it is not worth more is it? - A. I do not think it is worth so much; it has a base-metal chain and key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.There is no particular mark about the watch, or the key, or chain, except a parcel of letters put round the dial-plate? - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, if any other letters answering to your name, were put round another watch, you would not know that from this? - A. I cannot say; I know I had such a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the number of it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. If any body else had these spoons, which have no mark, and which have nothing by which you can distinguish the one from the other, would you be able to distinguish my spoons, if I had such sort of spoons, from these? - A. I do not know how that might be; they are certainly the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these silver salt spoons? - A. I will not swear that they are silver, but they are the spoons; there is no mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There is no mark upon them, by which you are able to swear to them, whether they are silver or not? - A. There is no mark that I have fixed upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear they are silver? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear they are plated? - A. No, I mean to swear they are the spoons.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now look at the silver funnel? - A. That is Mr. William Jolliffe's property; it is a very remarkable one, there are several bruises in it that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you been using a funnel this afternoon? - A. No, I have not drank any wine.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been pretty much used in Mr. Jolliffe's house? - A.It has been badly used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live in service before you lived with Mr. Jolliffe? - A. Yes; in some of the first families in London; I never lived less than four or five years in a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never had the misfortune, in any of your services, of a funnel dropping, and getting bruised before? - A. Yes, that has dropped several times out of my hand; I believe all servants have that misfortune at times.</p>
               <p>Q. So it is from these kind of bruises, that you mean to swear to this funnel? - A. Exactly so, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q.These things, I take it for granted, were not all taken at one time? - A. I look upon it they were all taken at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen these things before they were missed? - A. I believe it was three or four days,</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know enough of the value of the plate to fix a value upon any of these things? - A. I am no judge; but I think I would not lay the value of them at more than thirty-seven or thirty-eight shillings.</p>

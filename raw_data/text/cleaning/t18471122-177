                  </hi> I live at Hawkhurst, Kent.—in Aug. last I was keeping the Ship public-house, in the parish of Stepney; I lived there. On Sunday morning, 22nd Aug., about eight o'clock, I was called by my wife—I looked out of the first-floor window, and found fourteen or sixteen tiles had been moved from the scullery, which adjoins the bar—there is a communication without going into the air—I went into the scullery, and found some one had cut the laths, and got through the roof—a knife was left there—a person could get from there to the lower part of the house—I found the bar all in confusion, missed 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, and a check for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which had been on the mantel-shelf, in a mug—the money had been there too—this is the check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen the prisoner before, but not to be well acquainted with him—I went to bed the night before about half-past twelve, everything was quite safe then—I had cashed the check the same evening.</p>

                  </hi> I am cashier to Martin and Co.'s, bankers. On 5th Nov, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner presented this check—I am sure it was him—payment had been stopped—I asked how he came by it—he said he found it—I asked if he did not know he was committing a fraud—he did not answer—he was detained, and given in charge.</p>

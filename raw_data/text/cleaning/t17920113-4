               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Where is your shop situated? - In Bishopsgate-street Without.</p>
               <p>Have you any partner? - No.</p>
               <p>How many persons might there be in the shop? - None, except myself.</p>
               <p>Is it a large shop? - No.</p>
               <p>You have shopmen, I presume? - I have a man and a boy; but at this time the man was getting his hair dressed, and the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130006"></xptr>was doing his ordinary work, cleaning knives and shoes.</p>
               <p>Had not the man or boy been in the shop before you that morning? - No, I was the first in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing when you turned your head? - The first thing I observed was the prisoner at the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>You said you heard something drawing across the counter, I want to know whether you saw any thing? - I saw nothing but the prisoner on the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>I think, if you heard somebody drawing something off the counter, you would naturally look round? - That caused me to look round.</p>
               <p>And what did you see? - I saw the prisoner at the threshold of the door.</p>
               <p>At the same instant you saw the prisoner at the door you saw linen on the threshold? - No, I did not see the linen till I came out.</p>
               <p>Had there been any body in the shop in the course of the morning before? - No one, because I had opened every door myself.</p>
               <p>Had you opened any Irish? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Then it was packed up? - It was; it was not left open, it was bound up with paper on the outside of it.</p>
               <p>Probably you bought a greater quantity than that? - The day before I bought two pieces.</p>
               <p>Had it been opened at all since it was bought? - It was opened the day before, to see what it contained.</p>
               <p>It had not been opened that morning? - No.</p>
               <p>Then what it might contain in the morning you only suppose from measuring the night before; was there any mark on it how many yards it contained? - There is the mark on it now.</p>
               <p>And you put the mark there? - I marked my own private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Did you mark how many yards it contained? - This piece of Irish, which was stolen, is one that had been dyed, and afterwards calendered, and it is the business of the calenderer to mark the quantity of the yards on it which it contains.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mean to say that you yourself the night before had observed any mark upon it; you cannot swear to it? - Yes, there is my own private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first that you saw of it, after you came out of the shop, was on the pavement? - It was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, never saw him before, as I know of.</p>
               <p>You said you should not know the piece of goods again? - I should know the same piece I saw before the Lord-Mayor, but whether it was the same as was dropped I cannot take upon me to say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Do you not know jobbers to buy and sell the same day; is it a singular thing; if so, how came it not to be noticed in the year 1790? - I have not inspected accounts, so I do not know; but ten years ago, when I inspected accounts, I remember that to have been done; when the books shut the 1st of December, and were opened the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>For what purpose are the clerks put? - To assist paying the dividends.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Shaw has bought and sold? - I have seen an account in the 5 per Cents.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What happened ten years ago was the selling some stock that had been bought the same day? - It was; it is not against all general orders; it is in cases of legacies, and on some particular occasions, when a person will not be in town the next day.</p>

               <p>I am one of the chief clerks in the Bank: on Mr. Sladden's coming to the office, I looked into the state of the ledger, and found 650 l. to his credit.</p>
               <p>In what manner is the preparation for the dividend-warrants? - The books are shut at a certain time, when no transfers can be made, or paid, then of course the several stock-holders stocks had to the ledger; balances are taken on those stock-accounts, and dividend-warrants prepared on those balances, from the balance-sheet; the clerks in general do that; one takes the ledger, the other the slip; Mr. Shaw appears on the ledger to have over credit for 400 l., a false credit, which if taken from that improper place, Mr. Shaw's, and put in its proper place, Mr. Sladden's, it would have made Mr. Sladden's just 650 l. on the balance-sheet; the 400 l. being, in addition to his 250 l. which he had there, 650 l. and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150031"></xptr>then Sladden would have his whole dividend on the 650 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Vicary. Was there a person of the name of Hands in the 3 per Cents.? - There was.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Mr. Shaw and Mr. Hands after Mr. Sladden came to the Bank on the 19th? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after Mr. Shaw was apprized that he must be examined by the Directors? - Before: in that instance it appears that 250 l. was called out to the name of Sladden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shaw had nothing to do in making out that bill? - None in the least.</p>
               <p>Had any thing passed between you and Mr. Shaw? - I went and asked Mr. Shaw what mistakes had happened in the office, and what occasioned him to go to Kensington on the Tuesday; he muttered something, and attempted to speak to Mr. Hands, and did speak, as it appeared from what passed; I am not positive, because I was at a distance; soon after that, Mr. Shaw was sent for; I don't know that any intimacy has subsisted between Mr. Shaw and Mr. Hands; he has absconded, and is advertised for that and other offences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I believe no clerk in the Transfer-office does business in his own letter? - No, except he is in the place.</p>
               <p>Are they never placed in the letter where they have stock? - It is not particularly attended to; I believe he was not placed in letter S.</p>
               <p>The ticket that is put into a box a clerk takes it out, and compares it with the stock in the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this balance taken by Mr. Shaw? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that often mistakes have happened by people who job? - Certainly there have.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it frequently happens that a man buys and sells stock in the same day? - I cannot say; I don't know, except in cases of necessity.</p>
               <p>Is it not frequently done by a gratuity to the clerk? - It may be, but I don't allow it.</p>
               <p>Mr. WALSH sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce the ticket of the transfer in this particular instance, passed by Mr. Hands, whose duty it was in this particular instance to pass it.</p>

               <p>The department in which Mr. Shaw was engaged, was clerk in the Transfer-office? - It was no part of his business to deal in the payment of the dividends; it was the first or second day, and I believe the last is dated on that day.</p>
               <p>Was it his ordinary business to pay dividends? - No, his regular business was to transfer, except for the first day or two of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179202150032"></xptr>paying dividends, when we send the clerks in to assist, and I believe Mr. Shaw went in.</p>

The prisoner came to my wife on the 20th of October, to nurse her: my wife was brought to bed the day after. On the 14th of November my wife missed a gown, a hat, and two coloured aprons; she asked the prisoner what she had done with them; she said she had pawned them; she was very sorry for what she had done, and believed she was bewitched. I said, if you will go with me, I'll go and take them out, and you shall hear no more of it. I went to the pawn-broker, and took as many things out as came to 7 s. 8 d. she said they were all. I sent her home with them. I staid a little with the pawnbroker. When I came home, she was absconded. After that I missed my prayer book. I met the woman that recommended her, and she together: she ran away, I ran and brought her to my house; then I went to the pawn broker, and said I insisted he should bring her to justice: then he said he had two pair of breeches, my prayer book, a gown, a napkin, and two coloured aprons. I took her before Justice Wright, there she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you ever leave your wife so destitute, so as to be obliged to pawn her things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Only once: she sent out a gown for 4 s. on the 21st of October, and she pawned it for 5 s. The prisoner never mentioned any thing of this sort before the Justice.</p>

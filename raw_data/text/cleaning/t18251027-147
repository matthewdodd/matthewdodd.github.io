About eleven o'clock on the morning of the 28th of September, Mr. Taylor, a neighbour of mine, gave me some information, and I looked and missed a pair of boots, which I am certain I had seen safe at half-past ten o'clock - I overtook the prisoner, with the boots in his custody, in Vine-street, Saffron-hill - I did not see him till I got there - he was not running.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. Owen. On the morning of the 28th of September, I saw the prisoner in Gray's-inn-lane - he said "Do you want to buy a pair of boots?" I said "Let me look at them," and I knew them to be John Owen's, as I had seen them a few days before. I said "If you will go into the Olive Branch public-house and have a pint of beer, and stay a few minutes, I will buy them of you." I went on to Owen's, and told him what I had seen. We went to the Olive Branch, but the prisoner had not been there; we traced him to Saffron-hill, and he had the boots on his arm.</p>

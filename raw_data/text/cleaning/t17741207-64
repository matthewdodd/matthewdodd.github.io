About six in the evening: I don't know where I was, but I was somewhere about Covent-Garden: I met with M'Cullogh, as I believe: I enquired of her, for a lodging; she carried me to a lodging; I undressed and went to bed immediately; I waked in about two hours and missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and about ten pounds in money out of my breeches pocket, and my buckles out of my shoes; I dressed myself and called out I was robbed. Graham brought up a candle, and I immediately secured her, and insisted she should shew me the person that had brought me into the room. When we came down stairs, I laid hold of another at the door, but she got away; I got to a constable and afterward, some of my things were found: I cannot say I was sober, but I think I was sober enough to know that M'Cullogh is the person that called me up.</p>

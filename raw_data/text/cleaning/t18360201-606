                  </hi>. On the 23rd of January, I was called to Mr. Crush's shop, and the prisoner given into my custody—I told him this was stolen property, and asked him if it was his own—he said it was his own, and he had brought them to pledge—he was searched, and seventeen duplicates found on him at the station-house—we went through Thornaugh-street on our way, on the right hand side—Culliford delivered me seventeen more duplicates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was sent for to the station-house, on the 23rd of January, when the prisoner was there—a Prayer book and hymn-book were produced—I asked the prisoner how he came by them—he said he bought them when he was well off, that he had been well off in his time, and in the habit of having a good quantity of books—I asked how long he had had them—he said for years—I said he had kept them very clean, and asked him if he had got any more books—he said he had been obliged to pawn his books and cloths, being very much reduced, and that he had been living at the Antelope, at Wandsworth—that is about a mile and a half from the chapel</p>

I was down at the Greenwich rail-road, looking for work—a man came and asked if I could read—I said I could—he said, "I have just picked up a parcel of tickets, I don't know what they are"—he showed them to me—I said, "It is tickets of books"—he said if I gave him a shilling I might have them as they were no use to him—I said, "They are no use to me"—he said, "You may have some of them, if you will stand</p>

I was taken into custody—I knew nothing of their being stolen, or I should not have taken them out of pawn to get 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and run the risk of being detected—it is false my pawning any on the 7th—I was never in the shop till I went to take them out—another says I had a fustian jacket on—I have never had such a things for years.</p>

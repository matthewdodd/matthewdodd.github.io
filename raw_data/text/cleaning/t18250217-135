            . I live in Hosier-lane, West Smithfield. The prisoner took my first floor two days before the officers came, but he did not sleep there. I gave the prisoner the key of the apartment. I was next door when Stone came to my house: he fetched me.</p>
               <p>Q. You showed him all over your house, except one room? A. Yes; that room belonged to the prisoner. The officer opened it with a key, and found some hats, which were not there when I let him the room. I saw him there the day before, and on that day, (Wednesday.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know of any body being in treaty for a house near you? A. I had two to let; the prisoner had been in treaty for one of them some days; I did not let it to him, because it was not finished. I was apprehended on this charge, and detained from Wednesday night till Monday.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you know any thing of him? A. Only from seeing him at the public-house next door. I was bound over to prosecute, and subpoened before I attended the Grand Jury.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 9th of February, I went to the Ship and Star public-house, Rosemary-lane: it is frequented by persons who deal in wearing apparel and other things. I saw the prisoner there: he passed by the bar. I observed him go and lock the kitchen door: I had no opportunity of getting to the door. I waited a few minutes: he returned and unlocked the door. I followed him, and saw him take hold of a black bag, behind the kitchen door - he lifted it up. I said, I must take him and the bag. He said, he knew nothing of what was in it, and begged to be let go, which I refused. I left the bag, sealed up, at the house, and took him to the watch-house, and then to the Compter, and gave information to Mr. Oakey, having had previous information of the robbery. I found eleven hats in the bag, some with paper round them. I went to No. 30, Hosier-lane, in consequence of information; I opened the door of the first-floor front room with a key which I found in the prisoner's pocket, and found five dozen hats, and a basket, with T. O. C. on it - the hats are unfinished. The prisoner denied all knowledge of the hats found at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you went to the kitchen, did you tell him why you apprehended him? A. I said, he must go with me, in consequence of the property there, and in consequence of information which I had received. This was about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>JOHN OAKEY, JUN. re-examined. I saw the hats found in the bag - they were our manufacture - part are finished and part not. We have a few customers who buy them partly unfinished; but some are in a state in which we never sell them: those were in the basket. I went with Stone to Hosier-lane. The basket is my father's - it is marked T. O. I saw our man mark it two years ago: we had never parted with it. I went to the warehouse on the morning of Saturday, the 5th, and observed about four dozen unfinished hats laying in the premises. No violence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170063"></xptr>had been used to the door. The stock was not kept there; it is where the men work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You know nothing of the state of the premises, on the previous night? A. No: I will not swear that there are above three of the bats in a state in which we never sell them. I think I might safely swear, that there are three; they are in a particular state of finishing, in which they never are sold by any house in the trade that I know. They are branded with the letters T. O., my father's initials.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Oakey. On the morning of Friday, the 4th of February, when I came to the warehouse, I found the warehouse door, and the outer door which encloses the yard, open, and supported by an iron to keep it open. I missed about one hundred hats; several were in an unfinished state; we call them hoods: they are only dyed; about twenty of the hundred were hoods; we sometimes sell hoods to people, who finish them to particular sizes, but had sent none out for a month before. I afterwards saw some in a basket, at Guildhall, sealed up, and they are sealed now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you miss them on Friday morning or Saturday? A. Saturday morning I missed the new work, which had been brought in a basket. I was there at half-past eight o'clock in the morning. The men left work at eight or nine the night before - I was not there then. One or two hoods may occasionally be sold. I was not the first person at the warehouse on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>MR. OAKEY. I went to the warehouse about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, being informed by my brother of the robbery. The iron had then been moved from the door.</p>

            . I am a porter. I saw the prisoner, last Wednesday week, about three o'clock in the afternoon, at the Ship and Star public-house, Sparrow-corner. He said, he had a job for me, and asked if I had a case: I said, no. He asked if I could get one: I said, no. He went out himself, came in, and said he had got one, and gave me 5 s. to leave, as security for it. He took me to a house in Hosier-lane, with it, to the first floor - he sent me down, I went to the public-house next door - he brought the case down himself to me; it was an egg chest, about a foot and a half deep. He called me out of the public-house; I helped him into a truck with the case - I took it to the Ship and Star public-house, and do not know what was in it. I saw forty or fifty hats in his lodging; some in front of the room, and some on the other side - it was about half-past four o'clock when I was at his lodging. He sent me down stairs - I did not see what he put in the case - I put it into the back kitchen, at the Ship and Star.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 5th of February, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I went to the warehouse - I was the first person there and had the keys - I was sliding opposite the yard - another boy ran by and shoved the door open - I found the warehouse door open - I had left the night before when the shop was shut, and fastened the door myself - about six dozen hats were gone - I went in with Mr. Tomlinson, and missed them: they were safe the night before. The doors had an iron against them, to keep them open. I believe some of the hats were unfinished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many? A. I cannot say - there might be a dozen and a half, or more - they were black hats. I had the keys in my hand, and met the other errand-boy; he scolded me for leaving the doors open, but I had not been there.</p>

            . These are called finished bats by the manufacturers, but not by the retailers. There are no hoods in the basket - they have Mr. Oakey's mark. Here is one in the first process: after the hood; we never sell them in that state.</p>

            . I have been a clerk in the East India House, and know the prisoner, and was with him in the parlour of a public-house in Hosier-lane; I think it was about a fortnight ago. Two men came in and asked for him; I saw them whispering a few questions to him, about raising some money for a bill, and heard him say, "Well, bring a sample." I did not hear what, but in half or three quarters of an hour, they brought in a hat; it seemed to be unlined. I heard no conversation after that. The man who brought the hat went away with it; he did not leave it with the prisoner. I stopped there for an hour or two; nothing passed till between three and four o'clock, when the man came in again; I saw him whispering to Mr. Dyer, and saw Dyer pay some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it one of the same men? A. I believe it was. I saw Dyer pay him some sovereigns - I should think about forty, or more, for what I know - but I went home to tea immediately after.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. What department of the East India-house are you in? A. I was a clerk - I have an independence arising from my wife's money - I was in the naval department, as clerk, with Captain Thomas, in 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. You were Captain's clerk in an East India ship? A. Yes. I have married since that, and have an independence - I have no employment - I live at No. 15, Thomas-street, Stamford-street, Blackfriar's-road. This happened about a fortnight ago - I think it was on a Tuesday, and I think on the 8th of February - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What, that the sample was produced to the prisoner on Tuesday, the 8th of February? A. Yes. I think I should know the persons who brought it. I heard the prisoner was in custody a few days after - I read it in the newspaper, and heard it mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go away after the sample was produced? A. No - he went into the passage, but did not leave the house to my knowledge. There were four or five persons in the room; it was at the Horse and Groom public-house. - I have seen one person here to-night who was there - I cannot tell his name rightly, for I do not know him intimately, and have not asked his name - I have talked to him here, but not a word on this subject. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170064"></xptr>asked him how business goes on, and about the weather, and a hundred things; and if this trial was likely to come on to-night, as I did not like to wait; nothing more passed between us. I do not know how the people who brought the hats were dressed. I should think them from thirty to thirty-six years old; they wore black hats; I do not know the colour of their coats - one was rather stout, and the other about my size. The prisoner drank some porter with me - the other person who is here did not drink with us; he was not in the room at first. I went there about twelve o'clock with the prisoner - I had met him in Black-friar's-road; the other man came in in three or four hours. I left between four and five o'clock - the two men came in about two. The person who is here was not there then; he could see nothing but paying the money. The landlord and landlady came in and out - we had two or three pints of beer, and a glass of brandy and water - I had some bread and cheese there with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Were you in the habit of going to that house? A. No - I had been there once or twice.</p>

I have known Dyer some time - he was there when I went in - I went to ask for Mr. Coleman, a builder. I had a glass of wine and water, and was there about an hour, or thirty-five minutes. I saw Mr. Dyer in conversation with a man - what attracted my notice was hearing money pass on the table; I looked towards them. I saw money being transferred from Dyer to the man - I heard him say, "Here is forty," and saw sovereigns on the table: there were three or four men round the table - I cannot say which he was paying it to.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see that gentleman there? (Campbell?) A. He was sitting at the opposite table to me; I think he was nearer to Dyer than me. I heard somebody say, "Here is 40 l." I heard no more, for I went away almost directly. I saw no hat there; there were three or four men round the table. I got there at a quarter past three o'clock, and left at four, to go to Charing-cross. I am sure I heard the words, "Here is forty pounds."</p>
               <p>Q. When was your recollection called to this circumstance? A. When I returned from Tunbridge Wells, four or five days ago - I happened to read it in the paper. I went to Mr. Prentice's office, on business, and asked Mr. Lee if it was the Mr. Dyer whom I knew. I have known him seven or eight years, or more. I have been a coach proprietor; I drove on the Brighton road four years ago; I was a coach driver for three or four months. I now live on what my father left me; it was about 7000 l. - he died in 1816. I was a bankrupt in 1812.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Where did Dyer live? A. By the Elephant and Castle. I always knew him to be a respectable man.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to Horsemonger-lane when he was there? A. I never heard of his being there.</p>

            . I have been a hatter. I sold my stock in trade to the prisoner two years and half ago; some were perfect, and some damaged - they were all finished. I sold him several dozens, and received between 20 l. and 30 l. from him. A man recommended him to me, as a dealer in hats.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did he live then? A. I do not know; he came to my house, looked my stock over, took an inventory, and bought it. I lived in Shoreditch.</p>

            . I was clerk to Mr. M'Lane, of Lombard-street - I left him three months ago, and expect to go to a plantation in the East Indies, but have not settled who I am going with; I live at No. 31, Green-walk, Blackfriars. I was at the Rockingham Arms, public-house, by the Elephant and Castle, last Friday week, from half-past six o'clock, till half-past eleven at night. The prisoner came in about half-past eight o'clock, or later - I merely knew him by sight; I was not acquainted with him; he was there all the evening, till half-past eleven, when the house was shut up; he went out just before me. I heard he was taken up on the Wednesday or Thursday, in the following week - it was mentioned at the Rockingham Arms. I heard last Wednesday or Thursday that he was taken up - I had seen him at the Rockingham Arms on the Friday before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Ten days ago? A. Yes, about that; it was the Friday before last - I am sure of that. I had seen him there several nights; he might be there two or three times a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there on any other Friday night? A. Very likely. Edward Smith was there on the Friday night that I saw him there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure the time you are speaking of was last Friday week? A. Yes, ten days ago - I cannot be mistaken. I never mentioned it to any one. I was subpoened here - I do not know how I came to be subpoened. Dixon, a corn-chandler, and Mr. Peak, a master bricklayer were there - we were in the parlour. - The landlord was in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Now consider - are you mistaken in the Friday you are speaking of? A. No, I think I am right.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Chapel-street, Stockwell. I have seen the prisoner and the last witness at the Rockingham Arms - I saw them both there on the same night - as near as I can recollect it was last Friday fortnight; I am almost positive it was on a Friday - I went there at half-past six o'clock, or seven; the prisoner was then there, or came in soon after. I staid till about eleven, and believe he was there all the time; I did not miss him: I was smoking my pipe.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you remember that it was on Friday? A. Because on Friday I came to town, and called at the Rockingham Arms; I sat there with Mr. Peake. Mr. Dyer, and two or three more were there, and there was a countryman there, who came to see one Allen, about some business, and he had a little bottle of Hollands, and gave it to Peake, who tasted it, and I tasted it, and gave it to Dyer to taste, but he swallowed it - I said if I had known what he was going about I should have taken a little more myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this was no Friday fortnight? A. As near as I can positively say. I do not swear that it was on that night. I am almost certain that it was on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent for you to come here? A. I called at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170065"></xptr>the Rockingham Arms a week ago, or more, and they were talking about the countryman's Hollands, and I said I gave Dyer some of it. I think the landlord's name is Magnus - I do not know whether he is here. I slept at a friend's, in Thomas-street, about half a mile from the Rockingham Arms, that night.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you come from Stockwell on any other night that week? A. No. I returned next morning, Saturday. I am almost positive it was Saturday.</p>

            . I am a master bricklayer, and live in Meadow-row, New Kent-road, and frequent the Rockingham Arms. I know Dyer - I heard of his being in custody six or seven days ago. I have been in his company nearly every evening for the last six months. I heard that what he was charged with happened on Friday evening, the 4th of February; and about seven o'clock, or half-past six that night, he came into the Rockingham Arms, and stopped in the parlour till half-past ten; I left him there; Smith was there, and sat by my side - he lives somewhere close by: Bakewell, and Dixon, a corn-chandler, of Camberwell, were there. A countryman came in with one Allen, who belongs to the Court of Request; he wrote a letter for the countryman to take to Waterloo-road; the countryman sat by me, and said he had a drop of good stuff, and produced one of Daffy's Elixer bottles; he asked me to taste it, which I did, and it was Hollands: I handed it to Smith, who tasted, and handed it to Dyer, who poured some into his hand, tried it, and said it was very good, and drank the rest.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You go there every night - what fixes your memory to Friday night? A. I reckon it was Friday night more than any other, because it was the 4th of February, and I have not seen Dyer since - he came there four nights out of the six, at least - I went as usual, but did not see him. Smith lives somewhere close by me, I understand; I live in Newington parish; I understood so from him. I employed him one day to do a job for me; he went out for his tools, and was gone a very short time. Several people were there on the Thursday, the night before: that young man was there (Bakewell,) I think, but am not positive. Smith was there on Thursday. What makes Friday so remarkable was the gin bottle. Allen left as soon as he wrote the letter.</p>

            . I am a corn-chandler, and live at Walworth. I was in the prisoner's company last Friday fortnight, at the Rockingham Arms; Peak and Smith were there. I went in at three o'clock in the afternoon, and remained till the house was shut up. Dyer was there; I remember his passing me: I struck him as he passed, in a jocular way; but he sat down, and felt much hurt - that was between eight and nine o'clock; he remained there till the house was shut up: I did not go out with him, but I went straight to Mr. Purcel's, the Surry chop-house, and met Dyer there - I wondered to see him there, as he did not go with me; it was between twelve and half-past - he was very tipsy indeed. I staid there till between two and three o'clock, and left him there - I did not speak to him, as he felt rather offended at me. I saw him sitting in the corner when I went out. I did not see the countryman at the Rockingham Arms - I was out occasionally.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was the longest time you were out? A. Never more than a quarter of an hour. He felt offended at me, and mentioned it to Bakewell, and to Smith as well. I saw the man from the Court of Request, but did not see him write a letter. I saw no gin bottle handed round. I am sure it was Friday night.</p>

            . I am constable of the Surry New-road watch-house. I go to the Surry chop-house every morning, about one o'clock, to turn the company out; it is opposite to the Surry Theatre. I went there on the morning of the 5th of February, about two o'clock, and saw the prisoner there - I turned him, and all the rest out of the house. Shergold was there. I came out of the house in about ten minutes, and saw the prisoner walking away towards the London-road, with two persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That road would be very handy to go over the iron bridge into the City? A. I think not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How are you able to say it was the 5th of February? A. Because I went out later than usual that morning - I altered the time that morning, which made my patrols come later to the watch-house; it was only on that morning that I altered the time. I heard of the prisoner being in custody on the Sunday or Monday following, I think, and recollected seeing him there; it was the Sunday or Monday after the Saturday morning, not the Sunday week. It was mentioned to me the very next day, or the day after, that Dyer was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you call to mind whether it was the day before you heard he was in custody; or that day week? A. It came to my recollection that I had turned him out of the chop-house the day before, for I said at the watch-house, "Why, it was only yesterday morning that we turned him out" - I said so at the time; and another circumstance which makes me more certain, is, there was a black horse at the door, and a man went away with a woman on that horse, and the turnpike-man on duty that night was Lloyd - that happened on the night I turned them out of the chop-house. I have no doubt of having turned him out of the chop-house, and the day before I heard of his being in trouble.</p>

            . I keep the Surry chop-house, opposite the Circus. I heard on the 6th of February, of the prisoner being in custody; I know it was on the 6th, on Sunday. Keys comes into my house every night; Dyer was there several nights; I heard he was charged with having committed an offence on Friday, the 4th of February, and that night Keys was at my house, about two o'clock, and turned Dyer out, who was very much intoxicated. - Shergold, the officer, was there - he is not here. I went out with Dyer, to a street behind the Fishmongers' alms-houses, to see him home - I saw him into a house there, on the right hand side as you turn down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time did Keys come to your house? A. It was past two o'clock - it was not three.</p>
               <p>Q. The very next day but one after that, you heard of his being in trouble? A. Yes, on the next day, Sunday - I am certain of that.</p>

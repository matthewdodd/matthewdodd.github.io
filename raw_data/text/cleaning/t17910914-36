             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Acorn-alley, Bishopsgate-street. I know the young man by sight nigh on two years; I heard the alarm of fire, and begged the prisoner at the bar to go to Taylor's house, and save what he could. Taylor's lodges up two pair of stairs in the same house; I told him. I told him, Bet Taylor's father, Colley's wife, who worked in the same shop with the prisoner at the time; I knew him; and by my mentioning her name, he knew whom I meant. I never heard any any harm by him, nor received any harm from him; he comes from the country; he has worked with my brother-in-law twice, who lives in Angel-alley, Smith's-buildings, No. 4.</p>
               <p>Court. You said, you knew the young man by sight? - Only by working at my brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>You are sure you told him Taylor lived up two pair of stairs; you did not say the ground, nor the one-pair of stairs? - Neither.</p>
               <p>What time of day was this? - Between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that this was the time you saw him first, between four and five o'clock? - It was.</p>
               <p>But the constable saw him with the bed at three; how long have you known this man? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Then you know him more than by sight? - Yes; he used to come to my room to warp his ribbons.</p>
               <p>Are you particularly acquainted with him, then? - Yes, Sir, so far as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140056"></xptr>Court to Price. Do you know when the fire began? - About three o'clock, but it did not break out at Taylor's till between four and five.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that you saw him with the bed between three and four? - As near as I can tell, it was.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was before Taylor's house was on fire? - I cannot say positively, I was so much confused.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, to his character, who gave him a very good one.</p>
               <p>The jury went out of Court for seventeen minutes, and returned with a verdict,</p>

            . I am a warehouseman, and live next door. On Friday the 12th of October, between six o'clock and half-past, I saw an empty small taxed cart between our door and Green's, a few minutes after I went to the door, and saw the cart turning round, two men were behind it, and one driving - the bale was then in it; I suspected something - they went down the street - I informed Stanton, and went with him, we found the cart in St. Paul's churchyard, the two persons left the head of the cart; the prisoner was driving it, we made him drive back.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. The bale is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Smithfield with a horse of my father's for sale, and about half-past five o'clock my father came with two gentlemen, who said, they wanted a horse and cart to go in the City. I got a cart, they got in, and drove to Bread-street, got down at the end of the street, and told me to drive up to the door, they brought the bale out of the warehouse, put it in the cart, and told me to drive on.</p>

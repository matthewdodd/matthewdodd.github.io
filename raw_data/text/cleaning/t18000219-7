No; on the 1st of February, about six o'clock, I went up stairs to my own lodging, I found my room door broke open, that was between six and seven; I had not been in the apartment since the morning; I missed six shirts, four pair of stockings, four pocket-handkerchiefs, sixteen neck-handkerchiefs, a counterpane, and one pound nine shillings and nine-pence in halfpence; I had seen them the same morning; I immediately went to Bow-street for a warrant; when I returned, I saw the prisoner in the cellar, with a candle lighted; I saw him put the candle out, and saw him bring the goods out at the door, I was not a rod off him; I took him into custody going into his own house, with the property in his hands, (produces the articles mentioned in the indictment;) they have been in my custody ever since; I am confident they were all taken out of my house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Before you say he confessed, let us know what you had said to him? - A. I wanted the bag of halfpence, and he said, if he let me know where the halfpence were, would I let him go, and I told him I would not; he told me where the halfpence were in the cellar, my man went down into the cellar, and brought them up to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. Does not the prisoner lodge in the same house with you? - A. No, he lives in the next house.</p>

             from the fifth of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the date?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I am sure of it: if I get a patient, I always book it; it was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you, or you go to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went to him in Petticoat-lane, some court or other, I believe they call it Bull Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever attended him before?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live off?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In Plough-street, Whitechapel, not far from the church.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning did you send to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It might be between eleven and twelve in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came for you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe a young fellow; I cannot justly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Lyons?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was he in?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In his room, I believe; two pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>Benjamin. In bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. He had a pleurisy; I bled him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay with him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Best part of half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he before he got better of this?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went to see him the evening. following. I attended him ten or eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had bled him in the morning, when did you first see him again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In the evening, about eight, or half after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in bed, or up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The usual time next morning; I go out about eleven or twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Very bad in bed; I ordered him medicines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Thursday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, in the evening; I always attended him twice a day.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon Friday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, then I attended him between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find him on Friday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The same condition, rather worse; he was sick in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to get up, in your judgement?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not as I know; to my thinking, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Benjamine. It was after the Sabbath was begun, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Pretty near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not past eight?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It might be past eight; I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am sure it was light.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. In the same place I left him in all the times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him in bed on Friday evening?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe he was in bed; to the best or my memory he was: I attended him in the morning, and desired him not to go out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030088"></xptr>Q. In what situation was his on Friday evening; how did he appear</p>
               <p>Benjamin. As a sick man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did his appear?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A stitch in his side, with a pledrify: I bled him.</p>
               <p>Q. Again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not bled between Wednesday and Sunday?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was able to get up or o out?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not to go out, as I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again on Saturday morning?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes. He appeared much the same as usual, rather better. Sick people are generally better in a morning than an evening.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known this man?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Five or six years.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life was he in?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know how he gets his living?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him five or six years, and not know how he gets his living?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. It is not my business; I don't enquire about such things.</p>
               <p>Q. But your own patients, I should think, among your own people, you would know?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I understood he worked in the jewellery business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any family?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A brother and sister, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever before at his house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, when any of the family were ailing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I attended him nine or ten days.</p>

               <p>Q. How many days did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Four, or five, or six days, I will not say; I bled him on Sunday; he was not well then.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would not have bled him if he had been well?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I thought him ill.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you attended him nine or ten days; he did not keep his bed all the time, did he?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I will not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how long he did keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I will not say he kept his bed any time, because I was not with him the time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can tell how often you found him it bed when you attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was more than two days?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure more than three?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. That I am sure too.</p>
               <p>Q. What will you say to four days?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I will not say to that. I am sure he was in bed on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. That may be, that is an idle day. Are you sure of the day of the week when you first attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was that?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The fifth of June, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear first of this misfortune that had happened to him, that he was accused of this crime?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I was ordered to come here to attend this court.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when you first heard of his being accused of this crime?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. About a week or ten days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear of it till a week or ten days ago?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you entered the date in your book when patients commenced?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You set down what you prescribe for them too?</p>

               <p>Benjamin. Yes, in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that book here?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What, is it in English or Hebrew?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Neither, it is in Latin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he send to you as soon as he was taken up, to let you know he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what justice they had been before?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never applied to before to attend here?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house to take care of him when he was so ill?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030089"></xptr>Benjamin. I believe a young fellow that was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Only a young fellow?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say who attended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any nurse?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you had brought us that book of yours;</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long should you be in fetching that book, we should have it here; I suppose there is entered in that book all you prescribed for him from time to time and his name?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I did not prescribe a great deal for him. I repeated the same medicine over and over again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. For a pleurisy, what I thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell us what you thought proper to prescribe for him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Only boluses.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the composition?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The composition in plain English, is Venice treakle and spermaceti, and this I prescribed for him.</p>
               <p>Q. And any thing else?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. And powders thrice a day, powders of crabs eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you put down on your book all those prescriptions?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In a regular day-book?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not keep a regular day-book, my business is not so great.</p>
               <p>Q. But you must keep some book to make out your bills?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have a small pocket book I keep it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you may have that book about you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not that book, I have another book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that book, you keep it in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I must be at home at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have you at home any body that can give it if we send for it?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not think they can.</p>
               <p>Court. It is of meat consequence to have your evidence established, (he takes out a little pocket book, and looks over it.)</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have not got it here.</p>
               <p>Court. I should not think it likely you should have it there because you told me you entered down the time you first attended this man, entered the name and what you prescribed for him in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, I entered it in my book.</p>
               <p>Q. In Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I entered it down on such a day.</p>
               <p>Q. But in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I prescribed it in Latin to my druggist. I do not keep a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Well then, who is your druggist?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Mr. - what's his name; (there he appeared much confused, and made a long pause. I never was in a court in my life, nor nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Take time to consider of it, I asked you who that druggist was?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot remember the name now.</p>
               <p>Court. Not remember the name now, where does he live, surely you may know where he lives; I can forgive you for not remembering his name, but you must know where he lives?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. He lives by Aldgate, the corner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rogers. There are two druggists there, one is Humphryes, and the other Crowther.</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I believe it is Humphryes.</p>
               <p>Q. You prescribe your medicines, and they are made up at a druggists, you must know who is your druggist you deal with?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this man you deal with?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Humphryes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The corner of Little Duke's place, facing the pump, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know your own druggist, tell me exactly where he lives?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Plow-street?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Between three and four years.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible you can be a stranger; you must know the spot exactly; where does he live, does he live opposite the pump, or where?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not far from the pump, there are two or three live thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Which do you mean?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Only this one lives on the right-hand side of the way as you go towards the 'Change from Aldgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030090"></xptr>Q. Are you sure of that, that it is the right side of the way as you go towards the 'Change?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, is it the left-hand or the right-hand side of the way?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. The right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you show the house?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you dealt with Mr. Humphreys?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he has got upon his file all your prescriptions?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I gave no prescriptions, because I am no physician.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your medicines made up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I tell them what to take, and how they are to be mixed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember you told me before, not having the medicines in your own house, you prescribed them in Latin for your druggist to make up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in writing?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I go there and tell him how to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you go and tell them in Latin how to make it up?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if Mr. Humphreys was here, do you think that he would tell us that when you come to have your medicines made up, you prescribe them in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. You dealt with this man three or four years, has he made up all your medicines during that time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way, for ready money, or was there an account between you?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Always for ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would know you again?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you deal for ready money, how is it that you keep the account between yourself and patients?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I do not bring great bills in, I must have so much for the cure.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you for this young man's cure?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am not paid yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the account?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many times you attended him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I do not go this way, if I bring a bill, I must be paid according to what I say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of medicines you sent to him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the medicines sent in to this young man, made up at Humphryes's?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I made up a great many at home, some drops that I keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect which of the medicines were made up at Humphryes's, when the young man was ill, that he had, and which you made up yourself?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot justly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him repeated boluse's made of Venice treakle and spermaceti; you had not got these things yourself?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I bought sometimes a trifle and mixed them up afterwards myself at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do that in this instance, or send your prescriptions to Humphry's?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I went there the first time, I bought the things and mixed them up myself at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what quantity of Venice treakle or spermaceti you bought at the time this young man was taken ill?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You only bought the quantity once at Mr. Humphryes's, and that was all?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you prescribed the medicines in Latin to your druggist; now I find there was no such prescription, for you only went and ordered so much spermeacti and Venice treakle?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you seem to have been a little confused, and sometimes to have spoke not quite consistent with yourself in some part of your evidence; recollect yourself and tell us whether you are sure you ever attended this young man at all?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I am sure I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030091"></xptr>Q. And are you sure when you first began to attend him?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what makes you sure as to the time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Because I am positive: there was a fire-work on Tower-hill the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect it by any other circumstances, except remembering a fire-work the day before; is there any thing else occasion your remembering it to be the next day after the fire-work?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I have got it down, it is the 5th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. As you told me before you had entered it in your book, and the medicines in Latin you gave from time to time?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Not the medicines, I never do that, that is good for a druggist or apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me you did do it; you know I asked you if it was in English or Hebrew, you told me in neither, it was in Latin; you understand Latin, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. A little.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you turn Venice treakle and spermaceti into Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Venice treakle in Latin? (here he pauses.)</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps you may have forgot. Can you tell me what is spermaceti.</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Dreock is Venice treakle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the powder of crabs eyes?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Oculus concororam.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know where these entries are that you told me you made in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I did not make any entry in Latin.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, do you now stand by it or not that when you go to your druggist you describe these drugs in Latin?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No; I only tell him what the drugs are I want, and then make them up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there are none of these prescriptions or descriptions in Latin, of your medicines? you have none?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. No.</p>
               <p>Council for Lyons</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man, Lyons, any family?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his wife?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. I saw a woman there, and there was a man there. I gave orders to the man in the room, to give him the medicines as I ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, if there had been a wife there to take care of him you would have taken notice of that; you would have given the directions to her, to be sure?</p>
               <p>Benjamin. Yes, to be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his being ill at any time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; the fourth of June, the king's birth-day; he went to see the merry-making at Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; sometime in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him come home?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. In the evening, between nine and ten, almost ten; he was very ill, and obliged to go to bed; he complained he was very ill, crushed with the mob. He could not stand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Jacob. About nine or ten days; he got up about the room, but was not fit to go about.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, being ill, he was pretty much at home?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Always at home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after Tuesday night? Was you in the room then?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jacob. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time the Doctor came?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I believe, in the afternoon of the fifth, on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he came in the morning, or not?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I am pretty sure he came in the afternoon; what hour, I am not certain; he bled him, and gave him some medicines; some stuffs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what sort of medicines? In what form?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Something to rub his sides, and some stuff to take inwardly; I cannot tell what; some was like ointment, to rub his sides.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to have to swallow? was it liquid or pills?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Pills and liquids too.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in phials or boxes?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The ointment in boxes; some in little bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull them out ready, or mix any thing at the house?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any powders?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot recollect whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any medicines given at the time he bled him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot say; I was in the room when he bled him, not when he gave him the medicines.</p>
               <p>Q. How, then, do you know what medicines he gave him?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I said, I did not take particular notice.</p>

               <p>Q. That was on Wednesday. Did you see him every day?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the doctor the next time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. On Sunday morning, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him between Wednesday and Thursday, any time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him give any medicines? Did you see him when he brought the medicines?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did he give them?</p>
               <p>Jacob. I cannot tell. I was at work; he went to give the medicines in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. What room do you work in?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The two pair of stairs fore room; the man lay in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the back room at all?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Yes; when the doctor bled him, I went in for that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Jacob. Nothing at all, I only saw the doctor bleed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold the bason, or do any thing?</p>

               <p>Jacob. I held the bason for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the room, after the doctor bled him? Did you stay in the back room till the doctor went away, or did you leave the doctor there?</p>
               <p>Jacob. When the doctor shut him up, after the blood was done running, I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first; you, or the doctor?</p>
               <p>Jacob. The doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the room, after you came out?</p>
               <p>Jacob. About half an hour; I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>Q. From Wednesday to Sunday, did you work in that room?</p>

             in the three pair of stairs back room: I am a bookbinder. Lyons lodged in the two pair of stairs back room. I have lived there three months. Lyons went out on the king's birth-night; when he came home, he said he was not well, his head ached.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; he sent a boy the same night to Mr. Benjamin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was a boy?</p>
               <p>Harris. Jacobs told me the same night, that it was a boy. I saw Mr. Benjamin in Lyon's room the next day, but don't know the day of the week, nor the time of day; and Israel Jacob was there. The doctor said, he must bleed him in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bleed him then, in the morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, only in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do in the morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know, I did not stay in the room. I saw the doctor in the afternoon go up to Mr. Lyons, but did not go up myself. I saw the doctor the next day go up to Mr. Lyons; I was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was that?</p>
               <p>Harris. I can't remember; it was the next day after the fire-works.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Lyons keep his bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. Eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030095"></xptr>Q. Do you mean that he kept his bed, or did not come out of his room?</p>

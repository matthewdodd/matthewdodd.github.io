On the 25th of June the prisoner came to my shop, just before eight o'clock in the evening; she asked to see some ear-rings, which I showed her - from her strange behaviour I began to suspect that she did not mean to do right; I noticed that she shuffled them towards the edge of the counter, and in a minute or two, one pair went from the counter to a cushion which was there - I took further notice, and then they were gone altogether; I felt confident she must have them, as there was no other person in the shop but a friend, who was sitting down - I came round, took hold of her arm, and said, "You are a very pretty article to come here to rob me;" she called me a liar, and used some very desperate language - I took aside her shawl and saw these ear-rings under her ann; they then fell down - she had denied taking them, and at the time they fell she said she had not got them; she was very abusive, or I believe I should have been inclined to let her go.</p>

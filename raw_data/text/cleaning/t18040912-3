               <p>Hill's defence. I was in town the morning before, I was out of work, I went along with a young man to seek after work; we went to Brentford, and we were told there was a nigher way to town across the fields; that was a bundle of mine I had, it contained three dirty shirts; as for being in his house to transact any robbery I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Connelly's defence. I am a bricklayer, and being out of work I was seeking after a job, and coming across the fields we saw these men running; I asked a man what they were running after, he said he believed it was a press-gang; as to the property that has been sworn to, I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Lacey's defence. I had been at Brentford after the election, I saw some men running as I went across the fields, I heard it was a press-gang; I had been at sea about seven years before, so I run; I had a bundle with me of my own.</p>

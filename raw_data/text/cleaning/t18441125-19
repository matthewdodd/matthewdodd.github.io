                  </hi>. I live at Cambridge<lb></lb>heath, in the parish of St. John, Hackney—there is a wall and wooden fence, about six feet high, to my garden. On Thursday morning, the 24th of Oct., about half-past one o'clock, I heard a noise, and proceeded to the back window—I saw a po<lb></lb>liceman in the yard—I asked what was amiss—he said there were thieves in the house, and sprang his rattle—I came down stairs as soon as possible, and found the front door open, and the policeman in the shop—I found the parlour door open, and a large double chest of drawers in the parlour all ransacked—they were all empty—I lost a coat, waistcoat, trowsers, a gown, shawl, and watch—we then proceeded down to search the cellar, and found the waistcoat and gown in the cellar, wrapped up in the handker<lb></lb>chief—I found the area grating broken and forced up—somebody had got in that way, and by that means up into the parlour—there is a door open<lb></lb>ing into the parlour—I had fastened the doors overnight myself—the value of the property lost is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know the prisoner—he has lived with my lodgers—he has been in the house for a twelvemonth or more—I found a hat in the cellar, and a shirt in it—they are not mine.</p>

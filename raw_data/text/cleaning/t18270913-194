               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Elm-street, I believe, is not a very light street? A. There are gas-lights in it. I am positive he is the person who made the two attempts - it was my handkerchief he was secreting; he turned several corners, but I did not lose sight of him till I secured him, in Laystall-street.</p>

            . On Friday the 26th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, I came out of a parlour next the street, to go into the kitchen to rinse my hands; the door was not shut: on turning my head about I saw the street door wide open; I ran into the street, frightened; I saw a man slip off the pavement; I cried out, I had been robbed! a neighbour said, if I had, that was the man; I pursued him, and cried, stop thief! on going about twenty or thirty yards from the door, he dropped the things mentioned in the indictment from under his arm, in the kennel, wrapped up in a green gown; I was within a yard of it when he dropped it; the lad is in court that took up the bundle. The prisoner was stopped about five yards from where he dropped the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that dropped the bundle?</p>
               <p>Blakesley. Yes. (The goods produced and deposed to) They were taken from a pair of drawers behind the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked on the drawers they were not there?</p>
               <p>Blakesley. No, they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Did you not swear before my Lord Mayor, you saw me in the house?</p>

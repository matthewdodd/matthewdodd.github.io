            . I live in Playhouse-yard. I knew the prisoner by sight before this; a girl was sent to tell the prosecutrix she was wanted, and while she was gone I saw the prisoner go inside the door, and put something into her apron - I am quite certain she held her apron up when she went in; I saw her take something white off the ironing-board, and put it into her apron-I went over and told Parry of it; the prisoner was taken in charge at the time for another robbery -I saw her at Worship-street when the shirt was produced.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on the 18th on another charge - I found her in a privy belonging to a court; she ran into the privy on seeing me - I followed her in; this shirt was put into the privy, but would not go down, in consequence of the spont.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>I am thirteen years of age.</p>
               <p>What will become of you if you take a false oath? - To be cast into everlasting burnings. My father keeps a shop in the linen trade; I know the prisoner, I remember her coming to my father's shop; there was my mother, and a person that was in the shop, a woman servant; there was another woman came in with the prisoner at the same time; the prisoner enquired for stockings, we did not serve her with any; then, she asked to look at some shawls, she looked at some, but bought none, nor the other woman did not buy any thing; the other went out first, and this woman followed, and upon her going out, I saw her put the handkerchiefs under her arm, she had not quite enough secured them under her cloak, they were calico handkerchiefs; I immediately ran after her, and secured her; I asked her for the handkerchiefs she had taken, and she denied having taken them: I insisted upon them, upon which she dropped them, she was secured; they are my father's property, I saw them on the counter.</p>

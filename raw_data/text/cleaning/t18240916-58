I immediately felt and missed my handkerchief, and saw the prisoners going down Short-street together, in company. I quickened my pace, and followed them; they saw me and ran up a stable-yard opposite I called Stop thief! - several people followed; they went round a court, and I thought they were gone; but I found they had been secured by the officer, who produced my handkerchief. I am sure they are the men who ran away.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Hogarth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160025"></xptr>and Co. I was on the right hand of Finsbury-place, South, and saw the prisoners attempting to pick the prosecutor's pocket. I crossed, and watched them; they pulled open his right hand pocket, and seeing a handkerchief, they still followed him, and at the corner of Short-street, they pulled the handkerchief out - a gentleman told him of it; he pursued - I followed him; they ran up the stable-yard, and about ten yards up the yard, I saw the handkerchief laying down. I went round a court and met them coming round and took them. I am sure they are the men. Tray is the one who took the handkerchief - the other was close to him.</p>

On the 29th of September, a chest of drawers were left at our house, and they were put into the prisoner's room - in a few days the person to whom they belonged came for them - they had all been opened, and the property was gone - but this property was not in the drawers - it was lent to her as part of the furniture, and I did not miss them till the 22nd of March - she had lived there from June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You do not know when this was committed? A. No - she is married, I believe, and her husband lived with her - she took the lodging; she was not in arrears of rent - her husband paid it; there was something said about selling the things in their room, and they were asked if they would purchase them; they said they could not afford it - that was about a month ago; we wanted to sell them, as we were going to quit the house, and it is all sold now; when the prisoner was taken there were some few articles of their's left in the room.</p>

             sworn. - I am the son of the last witness: On the 4th of February, I met the prisoner in Little Distass-lane, with a piece of floor-cloth; I did not suspect him in the least, I thought it was a piece that had been sold; when I went home, I enquired what floor-cloth had been sold, that I might enter it; I learned there was none; I then had a suspicion immediately; I communicated it to my father, and he taxed the prisoner very closely with it; after that, we went with him, partly at his own request, to search his lodgings, and when we came to Fleet-market, which was very near to his lodgings, he made a halt, and said, he had stole nothing but what I had seen him with, and he promised to bring it me home in the course of an hour; I refused to comply with that offer of his, and said, I wished to see his lodgings, that I might satisfy myself whether he had any more, and then he would not let me go to his lodgings, and said he had carried it to a house near Clare-market; he took me to a house, the corner of Denzell-street, Clare-market; he would not at first shew me the house, unless I stood out of sight of the house; I stood at a little distance, he shewed me the house, and then ran away as fast as he could, the sun being full in my eyes, I lost him immediately; I walked to and fro the house, and saw that piece, and some more of my father's property lying about the house; not knowing what steps to take, I wrote a note to my father, to desire him to attend immediately; my father came, and we went to the broker's shop, to enquire how they came by the goods, and there were five pieces of floor-cloth; the goods were deposited in a friend's house till they were taken before the Lord-Mayor, and the broker wrote his name upon them; they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

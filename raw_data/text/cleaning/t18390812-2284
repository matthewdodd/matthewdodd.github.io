I must be mad drunk, to rob my mistress"—Mrs. Andrews said, "I have some China, and a sheet, I wish to leave them here"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with them"—Andrews said, "Then we will sell them"—Thompson said, while Mrs. Andrews and I were gone out on the Wednes<lb></lb>day, she had a great mind to get up and hang herself—(she was lying in bed when I went to Mrs. Andrews's house)—we all three came down stairs, and went towards Vinegar-yard—Thompson then left us, and went to sell the China—she returned in a very few moments, and told Mrs. An<lb></lb>drews she had sold the China for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we then proceeded to Monmouth-street, where Thompson left us, and said she would go and sell the sheet—Mrs. Andrews held the sheet, while Thompson went to sell the China, and then gave it to her to sell—I walked on with Mrs. Andrews, and then said to her, "How came you to send for me yesterday, to make away with these things, when you knew they were stolen?"—she said, "Oh, don't bother, you shall not be hurt"—I then said to her, "When I was in your place yesterday, I thought I saw some knives and forks, on the end of a bench</p>

I wish I was dead"—Andrews walked on before, and Thompson walked with me, and told me that the evening be<lb></lb>fore she had taken out a pillow, and given it to a girl to sell; that she brought her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, which she had spent herself—I said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose, then, you drank a good drop last night?"—she said, "Yes, I did, for I do not know what time I got home to Andrews's house"—she then exclaimed, "Oh, what shall I do? they are sure to fetch me; I shall make away with myself!"—we went home towards Whitecross-street, where Andrews lives—nothing passed there, but Thompson sent Andrew with a frock of her own to pawn, to get some tea, and we had tea together—I saw no more till they were in custody.</p>

I told him I wanted my property; he immediately flung the handkerchief down, and gave me a violent blow over the head, then immediately my gardener seeing that he collared him; we brought him up to the house, and I brought the bundle under my arm which contained the things in the indictment, they were mine, they are here, the officer has them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bout and shoemaker: I have a shop in Burlington Arcade, Piccadilly. About October, 1835, the prisoner came into my service as shopman, and continued till this time—I missed articles from time to time, and communicated it to the prisoner—he denied it—I said, "It is an extraordinary thing, I cannot find out who is the thief"—he put me on my guard against the workmen, and I have discharged two of them—On the 30th of November a communication was made to me by my apprentice; in consequence of that I had search made at the pawnbrokers' on the 1st of December, and found a pair of Blucher boots and a pair of Wellingtons—I came back, and said to the prisoner, "I have been looking over the stock this morning, and miss a couple of pairs of boots out of the shop; they were here yesterday" (I had seen them the day before)—I said "Where did you go to?"—he said, "I went to such a place"—I said, "Did you take any boots any where else?"—he said, "No"—I then said, "I have got a thief about my concern, I hardly know who to suspect"—he said, "I can assure you, Sir, I never robbed you, whatever fault I may be guilty of"—I said, "Your own conscience is the best mentor; you and the pawnbroker must settle this"—I then said, "Who is this 'Jackson?'"—he said a friend of his—I said, "You and the pawnbroker must settle that," and I called one of my men to go and fetch a porter—I said, at "all events I will fix the offence on you"—he said, "For God's sake, for the sake of my poor mother, don't commit me, it is my first offence"—I had not given him any authority to take these.</p>

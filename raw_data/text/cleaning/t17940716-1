Then she said she wanted some money, to get some liquor; and I gave her another shilling to fetch some; she went out and fetched some, and brought it back, and she wanted me to have some; but I never tasted it; so I don't know what liquor it was. Then I went to sleep, and somewhere about four o'clock I awoke; and she was gone from the room, and I missed the money and bank note, and I found my breeches had been taken from underneath my jacket, and put the other side of the bed, moved from where I left them; then I got up and went to the next door -</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to sleep had she left the room? - No, she was in the room. I went into the next door and asked them if they knew any thing of the woman? they said they knew nothing of her; and then I thought that she had taken my buckles as well as my money, and I went back to see, and I found they were there; she did not take them away. I told the people next door that she had robbed me of five guineas and a half, and a ten pound bank note: I then went and put my clothes on and went in search of her myself, and could not find her, and I set George Forrester to seek after her, and he brought her to me in about an hour, and he found five guineas on her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was she brought to you after you got up? - I was two hours looking for her myself; it might be three hours in the whole, after I got up, before I see the woman again; I found five guineas and a half in gold, and the account with my name on it, and three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160004"></xptr>shillings, and sixteen copper halfpence; the money was found under her right arm pit; I did not see the money on her myself, the tea paper was found on her that the money was in, but not with the money; after she was committed that gentleman found on her nine guineas, and six-pence besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your bank note? - No, but I found the paper that it was wrapped up in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she has the whole of this house? - I asked her whether she was a householder? she said she was.</p>

After that I searched her further, and I found this paper under her arm, that the prosecutor said the bank note was in, I found her at the chandler's shop, opposite the Thistle and Crown, in St. George's-fields, she lives in Elbow-lane, New Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What may the distance be between the two places? - I look upon it, it is better than half a mile, by the way that she went, as I got information.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew that paper to the prosecutor, in the presence of the prisoner? - Yes, and I brought the prisoner to the prosecutor, and he said that was the woman, he knew her immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he first saw the woman? - In my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you was an officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce the things that were taken from her? - Yes; and he told her she was a bad woman; and she said she did it through distress; he said she had taken from him a ten pound bank note, and five guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak to any money at all? - He don't know any money at all; he has not swore to any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more money taken from her except the five guineas and a half? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. See whether this is the paper in which you put your bank note? - Yes, it is, I cannot swear to the money, but I can swear to this bit of paper.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock to my door, it was broke open, and another girl lived along with me, and I went out for a quartern of gin, and before I went out I told that girl that this man had got property about him, and desired her not to go out; and while I was out I stopped to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160005"></xptr>get a pint of beer, and she stole away from my company, and went back into my own room, and when I came into the room, she was laying over the man, and she had his breeches in her hand, and I asked her what she was doing there, and told her that she had a deal of assurance to come into my room, when I desired her not to come, and she shewed me something in her hand, and said to me, did not I tell you that he had some property about him, and I blamed her for coming into my room, and then she gave me the note and money.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you at any time see any other woman in the house? - Not a soul, but the prisoner at the bar.</p>

            . I am porter at the Argyle-rooms. I was at the door of the rooms in Regent-street. I heard a noise, went out, and saw the prosecutor and his friends going to fight, and saw Owen come across the road, I kept my eye on him. He went up to Mott, whose coat was off, and begged him not to fight, then put his elbows against his stomach, drew the watch out of his fob with the other hand, and walked about two yards, when Mott's friends told him his watch was gone. The prisoner immediately ran, a man collared and charged him with it. He strongly denied it. I stood behind him, and saw him throw it away. I picked it up, collared him, and told Mott it was his watch, and that the prisoner robbed him of it. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake forgive me, for the sake of my wife and family." I gave him in charge.</p>

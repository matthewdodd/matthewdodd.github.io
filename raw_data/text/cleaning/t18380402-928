I live at No. 3, Fenwick-court, Holborn On the 19th of March I was in Black Horse-court, Fleet-street—I observed an assault on a gentleman—I went down, and in going to the station-house with the gentleman, when within two steps of the station, I felt something at my pocket—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—this is mine—I know it by the pattern—there is no mark on it—there were two or three officers near me, and I saw the handkerchief drop—I cannot say from whom—as soon as I turned round the two prisoners were at my back. and in custody, and the handkerchief fell at my feet—it was as near to their feet as mine.</p>

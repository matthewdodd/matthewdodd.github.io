               <p>Q. Had he paid for that he bought? - I had not taken his money up, it lay on the counter; I returned it to him again and he returned me the ribbon.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter; I was at my own door; I saw the prisoner in conversation with Mrs. Gaywood, and dealing for some ribbon, and I see he had got his hand into her drawer, and at the same time taking a piece of pink ribbon up into his hand; the words that passed between the two parties I did not know at that time; she was going to take the drawer away, she turned herself about, at the time she turned herself about, he put that piece of pink ribbon in his coat pocket; also a piece of black ribbon; I saw them both; I then crossed over the way, went into the shop, shut to the door, and asked him if he meant to take these ribbons from the person that stood behind the counter? I take the ribbons; says he, what do you mean by it? why says I, I mean what I say; you have two pieces of ribbon, that I say; he then shuffled, and in shuffling got his hand into his pocket, and took out the pink piece of ribbon which he threw into the drawer; immediately after he put his hand into his pocket, and took out the black piece, which it came unrolled in taking of it out, and in throwing of it on the counter Mrs. Gaywood laid hold of it, and said it was her property. The pink ribbon was thrown into the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say it was her's? - She did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was over the way? - I was about twenty feet distant.</p>

               <p>Q. There are two glass doors at the front I believe? - No, there is not; there is one glass door, a shop door and there is a house door, but I see him through the window.</p>

On Sunday I was obliged to make use of some to tie my shoes with: on Tuesday I went in to buy some of that lady, I had a piece that was powdery, and I was wiping it off in this manner at my breeches, and this gentleman came in and accused me with stealing the ribbons, but he never said any thing about the pink ribbon at first, as that constable knows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to How. Did you hear any charge, any more than about the black ribbon? - I heard about a piece of pink, he said there were two pieces at first.</p>

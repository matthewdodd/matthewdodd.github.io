                  <hi rend="italic">Allen's Defence.</hi> I have worked in Covent-garden Market for four years; on Tuesday morning, at half-past eight, my wife brought me my breakfast, and about half-past nine I went into a public-house at the corner of Wild-street; Pim and Ewington were there drinking; I never saw them before; Pim offered me a pipe of tobacco; we got into conversation, and he said, "I have been on the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> all night, drinking wine and gin;" Ewington said the same; they said they had no money, and I <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> a pint of porter; Pim pulled a saw out of a basket, and asked my wife to pawn it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said I would rather do it myself, and I went and pledged it; I forgot the name he told me, and gave my own and my address, No. 28, Portpool-lane, where I have lived two years and nine months; I gave Pim the ticket and money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pim.</hi> What Allen has stated is quite true; he is innocent.</p>

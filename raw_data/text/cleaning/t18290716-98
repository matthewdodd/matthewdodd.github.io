I was in the Three Compasses with some sailors - the prosecutor came and called for a pot of beer - he asked me to drink, and asked where I lived; he said he would go with me - he went home, he then had a half-crown and a shilling, and he gave the shilling to me; but before we left the house we had some gin - he then went away, and came back in half an hour; he took me by the collar into a public-house, and said he had lost his watch in my room; I went to my room with him, and unlocked the door, no watch was found - he then went with me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Marlow's Defence. I went to wash for this woman - I found the watch and pawned it; I went to the watch-house - they let me go, and the next day three of us were taken to Clerkenwell.</p>

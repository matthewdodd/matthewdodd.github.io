On the 12th of November they lost 14lbs. of plums and 14lbs. of currants, which were on a barrel when we went into the little parlour to dinner, at some distance from the door - when we came out they were gone; the officer brought them in again - they were in parcels, and were my masters'.</p>
               <p>EUSEBIUS BEALE. I saw the prisoner four or five hundred yards from the prosecutors' shop on the 12th of November - he had a bundle, with one paper of plums and another of currants in it; I took him - he said they belonged to his master, and mentioned a name, which we could not find; we took him to Hatton-garden, went to several shops, and found the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>JAMES TERRY. I am an officer. I saw the prisoner and another about a hundred yards from the prosecutors' shop; I watched them, and called Beale, but he did not come soon enough, and the other got away - we took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made no resistance. Witness. He said he should not satisfy me about it - he was on his master's business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Coppice-row, and a man asked me to carry the parcel to the Bull and Mouth - I was to have 6d.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN PHILLIPS. I have a copy of the record of the prisoner's former conviction; I took him on that occasion, and attended the trial - he had three months imprisonment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the Earl of Kinnoull. His Christian name is Thomas Robert—he is a Scotch Earl—his English title is Baron Hay. I was in his service fifteen years last July—the pri<lb></lb>soner was under-butler—the plate was counted out by my directions, and part of it was under my examination—after the counting of the plate, in consequence of something that occurred, I went up to Lord Kin<lb></lb>noull to make some communication to him—I left the prisoner below—when I came back I found him gone—he was brought back by a publican named Graham, in the evening about half-past seven—I had called his atten<lb></lb>tion to articles missing in the plate—the prisoner said nothing to me about a saucepan—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is Lord Kinnoull's property—it is upwards of two years since I had seen it—I last saw it at Duplin Castle, Perth<lb></lb>shire—it was used in Lady Kinnoull's room—it came down stairs in a general way to be cleaned—the prisoner was at Duplin Castle, and fol<lb></lb>lowed the family to England two years last April—this is worth under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the natural course of things this would come to England.</p>

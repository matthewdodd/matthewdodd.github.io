               <p>The night of this robbery, Mr. Rabbats was at my house at the time, and about eight there was a message sent to inform him of the robbery; I went with the prosecutor to his house, and found the things gone, the handle of the pump broke off; the leaden nozzle twisted off, and the iron rod taken out of the bucket of the pump; we looked round to see if we could see any body, but in vain; I took him to the watch-house, and asked if he had any accomplices; he said he had none; I made him no promises; he said the nozzle of the pump and the iron work he had sold to Mr. Herbert, one of the witnesses, for seven pence, and he asked him if he would buy a copper, and he said yes; and that he carried it to Mr. Harper, who would not buy it, and that he sold it at another place for three shillings and four pence; I took him to Litchfield street: a search warrant was granted, but I could not find the copper there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The nozzle is like mine, but one may be like another; it is about the size of mine; I never compared it.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I have tried it: it fits, I know the nozzle, for I am the plumber that made the pump.</p>

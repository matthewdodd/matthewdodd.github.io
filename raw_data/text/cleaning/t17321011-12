The 2 Prisoners came and desired to see the Fore-house, I told 'em they might go in, and they went; but soon after they were gone, says I to my Son, I have something comes upon my Mind, that these are not honest Men, is there any thing loose about the House that they can take away? There's nothing, says he, but the Brass Locks that lie in the Window. So I went after them, but they were gone; I saw the Chain was taken off the Street-Door. I presently open'd the Door, and looking out, I saw them both running down the Street. I call'd to my Son, he jump'd down from a Scaffold 12 Foot high, and came running to me. He look'd in the Window, and by God, says he, they have got the Locks! we pursu'd them to Tyburn-Road, crying out, stop Theif! stop Red-Coat and Blue-Coat. They run hard, and at the turning a Corner, they dropt a Bag with the Locks in it, and were soon after taken.</p>

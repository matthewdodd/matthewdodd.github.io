               <p>I am the watchman; I was down Parker's-lane, I heard the cry of murder, and this woman was standing at the door all over blood; and she said, she had been robbed of sixteen shillings and a silk handkerchief; I sprung my rattle, and there was some of the men of Marlborough-street, happened to be out, it was search night, and they came up, and he stood at the top of the stairs and said, he would knock down the first man that came up stairs; he lives on a woman who goes out getting her living how she can; I searched him and found three half crown pieces in his pocket, and two shillings; here is the one half crown which is remarkable, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What was the money you lost? - There were three half crowns amongst the money, and the rest was in six-pences and shillings. (Deposes to one half crown piece.)</p>

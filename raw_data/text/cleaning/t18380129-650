                  </hi>. I am inspector of slaughtering-houses. On the morning of Thursday, the 4th of January, about nine o'clock, I went to Mr. Gidden's slaughtering-house, in Green-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road—I there saw the two prisoners and two geldings at the slaughter-house—they were offering them for sale—Warren appeared as the master, and Hob<lb></lb>den as his servant—I heard Hobden say he had nothing to do with it—that he was employed by his master, Warren—Warren heard him say so—I asked Warren if they were his own property—he said yes, they were—Warren offered one of them for sale for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I considered it worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked him where he brought the horses from, and how long he had had them—he said he had had one eight months, and the other six, and that he came from Hadlow—he said he used them in a fish cart, and for drawing stones and coal to and from Hadlow—Hobden did not seem to interfere in it—he said Warren was his master—I gave them into the custody of Smithers the policeman, and took care of the horses at a livery-stable in Obelisk-yard—one was brown, and the other bay.</p>

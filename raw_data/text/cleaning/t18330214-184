On the night of the 26th of January I went up to a back bed-room on the second floor, and saw the prisoner behind the room door, sitting on a chair - his dress was disordered, and the bedding in the room was disturbed; I saw a sheet in his lap - I ran down stairs to the pot-boy, who came up into the room, and the prisoner was then laying on the floor with the sheet under him; the pot-boy spoke to him, and told him to come down stairs, he said he would not till he had seen Mr. Jones - the pot-boy then said he would get an officer to bring him down; we came down, but had scarcely got to the bottom, before the prisoner was down after us, and he attemped to run out at the side-door, but my mistress would not let him - he then ran into the yard; my master came in, and he was detained - we went up stairs afterwards, and under the bedstead, where the prisoner had laid, was this sheet rolled up, and on the next bedstead, this bolster, this pillow, and this blanket folded in four; they are my master's property - I had made the beds in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. When you first saw him, what did you say to him? A. Nothing; he was sitting on the chair, his trousers were undone, and he had the sheet in his lap - he was sober, though he pretended to be drunk; when we went up the second time, we told him to come down - he was sitting the first time near the foot of the bed; if he had fallen down he would not have been so high up towards the top of the bed as he was when he was laying down - it was about eight o'clock in the evening; I had not been in the room after one o'clock - the room door had been unlocked, but there is a door on the stairs.</p>

             (Police-constable G 117). I took the prisoner - he was not drunk, but pretended to be so; he said he came there to see Mr. Perry - he gave various addresses, but I found he lived in Hertford-street.</p>

I was passing down King-street, about six o'clock, and heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was turning the corner of Macclesfield-street, running - nobody was before him, I collared him, and asked why he was running; he said, he knew nothing about it, I said he must have heard the cry - while I was talking to him, Morrison's son came up, and said, he had stolen a coat from a gig in Princes-street; he said,</p>

               <p>Q. How long after the taking up of the ring, did he run out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Reneals. About half a minute; he turned round to go out, he had no money in his pocket; in about half an hour, I found him in a person's closet, he was shut up; a little boy saw him go in, I went to see where he went to; so I enquired for him but he was denied, the boy said, he saw which apartment he went into; while I was examining the woman, the little boy opened the closet door, and there he was stuck up in the closet. I did not find the ring on him, but I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Where is the constable that gave me in charge, he has not brought him here, because he can contradict him?</p>
               <p>Reneals. I look upon it he is at home; Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me if I had his property? I said no; he has brought no witness that will speak in my behalf; the boy and constable could contradict him; therefore he has not brought them here.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Moxam, the prosecutor. On the 16th of October as I was coming out of the gate, going to the bake house, I saw the black man (Lewis) coming out of my master's gate; I met my young master in the yard; I asked him if any body had been up in the shop; he said no. I had taken the two caps off the line, and the sheet a little before; when I came back they were both gone; it then wanted about five minutes of seven o'clock.</p>

            . About seven o'clock I was coming out of our yard along with Mr. Taylor; our servant met us, and asked us if any body had been in our shop; I answered her in the negative; she said she had met a black man coming out of the gate; she went in and missed the several things mentioned in the indictment.

               <p>Q. to Taylor. Was the cap produced in Court these people swore to?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes. He dropped the cap with taking out his handkerchief; he was accused with having it; he denied having it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moxam. This is the cap that was found upon Lewis, clean, and hardly dry when it was taken from him; that was about a quarter after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken?</p>
               <p>Moxam. The other end of Pennington-street, Old Gravel-lane; he was taken up for another robbery, and our people going up the lane, saw him; this is the cap that was produced on the trial of Lewis.</p>

            . Mrs. Moxam desired me to go to the pawnbrokers, to enquire if they were pledged any where; I saw a mob in Pennington-street; they said a black man was there for stealing women's apparel; by the description I had had, I thought it was the black that had stole our things; I asked him what he had in his waistcoat pocke t; he said nothing but his handkerchief; he pulled it out, and this nightcap dropped out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see the black taken up?</p>
               <p>Goging. A little after seven; he said his master gave him the cap then: but before Justice Sherwood he said he bought it in Rag Fair.</p>

               <p>I saw him buy it. It is very hard for me to suffer two months imprisonment after he has been transported for seven years.</p>

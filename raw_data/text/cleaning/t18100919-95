            . I am an officer. On the first of August I went to Charing-cross for the purpose of apprehending pickpockets; I saw the two prisoners in company with another, I followed them into the crowd, they were following Mr. Jackson; after he had been in the crowd five minutes, the three persons surrounded him, they were all standing as close at they could behind him; I saw Lee make several attempts to take his pocketbook out; I saw Mr. Jackson put his hand to his pocket; after some time he took his hand away to move his hat, at the same time a coach came alongside of the pillory, to take the men out, Lee took hold of the pocketbook, I laid hold of him by the collar, and with the other hand I took hold of the book; the next witness was in company with me at the time, I desired him to lay hold of Chinnery;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190048"></xptr>the other made off, before Lee drawed the pocketbook out of his pocket, Chinnery looked round at me, then I looked off; he then gave the other a touch of the arm, as much as to say, take it now.

            . I was in company with Humphreys, I saw Chinnery and Lee in company, close to Mr. Jackson; Chinnery spoke to Lee, and Lee pointed down to Mr. Jackson's pocket; what he said, I cannot say; he had got his hand in his left pocket; just after that, a coach came up, Mr. Jackson moved rather to the right, Lee took the pocketbook at the time, Humphreys took hold of Lee, I took hold of Chinnery immediately; there was a third person in company with them. Humphreys picked up the pocketbook.</p>

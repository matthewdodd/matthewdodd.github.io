On the 28th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was in Drury-lane, perfectly sober - I had just come from home; I had my watch in my fob - I was standing in a mob at the corner of <placeName id="t18301028-208-crimeloc1167">Russel-court</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see my hand under your arm? A. I felt it and seized it, and at the same time seized him by the collar - I caught hold of both his hands; I seized the watch, pressed his arm down, and held it till the officer took him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was attending the theatre, and heard the prosecutor cry out Police - I was about two yards from him; I came up, and saw him holding the prisoner - he charged him with taking his watch; he had the prisoner by one hand and the watch in the other.</p>

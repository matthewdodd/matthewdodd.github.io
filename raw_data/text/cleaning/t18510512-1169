                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Patman, of 43, Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; he was master of the house, but we have since removed. On 13th Jan., I was alone in the house, about 8 o'clock—there were then twelve towels, seventeen handkerchiefs, some petticoats, and other articles, safe in the kitchen—I went to bed at a quarter to ten, leaving the doors and windows fastened—I got up next morning about eight, missed the linen, and found a quantity of matches on the hearth—I went up-stairs, and found the front window half open—I know this shirt and pair of socks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were in my care, to wash.</p>

I took the prisoner on another charge—he was wearing this shirt; I spoke to him about it—he said his sister made it a long time before—these socks were in a tobacco-box in his pocket—he said he bought them two or three days before—I also found this whistle on him; a knife was found on one of his four companions, and he said that if he had known it had come to this, he would have put it into my guts.</p>

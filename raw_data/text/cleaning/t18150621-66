               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I am an officer, belonging to the public office at Bow-street. I was watching the prisoners about four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 16th of June. Just before they came to Temple Bar, there was a gentleman going through, and went up to him, and puffed his handkerchief a little cut of the pocket; when he got a little through the Bar, She pulled it right out, and clapped it underneath his coat. They then turned up a court, made a circuit round Chancery-lane, and that way, and returned down into Pickett-street. I then saw Wilson go into a pawnbroker's shop in Pickett-street; I went in when he came out, and found he had just pawned a handkerchief for three shillings. I had looked for the gentleman whom they had robbed, but missed him in going through the Bar, and could not find him.

We then followed the prisoners into Fleet-market, and there we took Thackery and Cross; we took them into a linen-draper's shop, and searched them. Smith assisted me in taking them to Bow-street; when we got there, and had them in the

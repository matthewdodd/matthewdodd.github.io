                  </hi>. I live in the parish of Kempsey, in Worcestershire—I deal in fruit and garden-stuff. On the 4th of May, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I saw my horse safe on the pasturage, near my house—I missed it between nine and ten next morning—in consequence of in—formation, I came to town on the 3rd of Nov. last, with Mr. Betteridge, a neighbour, and next day accompanied the policeman to the Paddington station, and found the horse in possession of a man named Larkin, at a stable at Bayswater—it was the horse I lost, and was a gelding, an iron<lb></lb>grey—I have known the prisoner some time, but have not seen him for fifteen years—he was bred and born at Kempsey.</p>

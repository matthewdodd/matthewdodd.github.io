                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the John Bull at Old Ford. On the 18th of January the prisoner whom I had never seen before to my knowledge, came about three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon with another person—they staid till nearly ten o'clock—I had my supper, and then came into my bar parlour—the prisoner and the other person had some gin and water, some bread and cheese and half-and-half—I was sitting by the side of the prisoner—I cannot say he was drunk—I felt my pocket-book go from me—the prisoner got up—I followed him—I said, "You d-d rouge. you have got my pocket book"-and I im<lb></lb>mediately collared him—he drew it from his person and dropped it on the seat in the pocket of the tail of my coat—I gave him and his companion both inner custody—they were both fully committed but the Grand Jury have thrown out the bill against the other this is the pocket-book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary. I was at the prosecutor's house that evening reading the paper, by the fire—I all at once heard a bustle, and an exclamation from Mitchell, "You d----d rogue," or something, "you have got my pocket-book"—I took about two strides and saw them struggling and Mitchell with his fist up—I said, "Take care what you are about; you are in a country where jus<lb></lb>tice is to be administered; don't take the law into your own hands; allow me to interfere"—I saw the prisoner put his hand behind him, and the book fell from his hips on the benches him—the other witness took the book up and gave it to me.</p>

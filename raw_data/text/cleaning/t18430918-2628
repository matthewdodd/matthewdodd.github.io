                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is Ferguson here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there were two or three persons in the house that afternoon; but they were perfect strangers to me, except Williams; the other person I had seen in the house at times; there is a servant, who sometimes serves in the bar, and Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson—none of them are here—I believe the prisoner resides there—I generally go there, from half-past eight till ten, to smoke my pipe—I generally see him there—I cannot say whether the landlord or landlady were there on the afternoon is question; the servant was there—they had no refreshment while they were bargaining about the boots, not any of them, except the prisoner, who had a glass of ale; this occurred in the parlour, which is at the back of the bar—the landlord and landlady could not see who was there; they would know the prisoner was there, of course—they did not come into the room—you have to pass the bar to get to the parlour—I do not know whether Williams was a common customer there—he has come in there occasionally—I have seen him there several times.</p>

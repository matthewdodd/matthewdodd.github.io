I have a lease of the house—I am single—the prisoner is my brother's son—he was in the habit of spending part of his vacation at my house, but I had forbidden him the house latterly—on Sunday, the 15th of May, I left my house to go to church, and when I returned, after the morning service, my servant opened the door—in consequence of what she said I went up<lb></lb>stairs and found mu watch gone from the stand on my bed-room mantel-piece—I went to my closet to look for some money which I had put in the evening before, and found a £10 and a £5 Bank-note, four sovereigns, and some silver gone, and an old purse taken out of a pocket with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed four silver tea-spoons from a closet in the front room, and other things—I went with his father in search of him that evening, and found him at Wright's Coffee-house, Charing-cross—I said, "Henry, you have been and robbed me again"—he said, "I have not been your house"—I said, "Yes, you have, and you have taken a great deal now; you have taken a great deal of money, and you have taken the watch again"—he said, "Ah, I have done it; you have put a halter round my neck"—I had a policeman with me—he said I should have all the things again—he did not say what things—as he went along he wanted to get his arm loose, but he did not—at the police-office they were going to search him, and he said, "Oh, here, I will give up the watch; here is the watch, and that is all you will find"—it is mine—it was not in a case—the case was gone—it had not been in it the stand, but he produced it in the case—the watch and case had not been together when I left them—he said at the station-house that his father could not afford to give him any thing, as he had got a family, and as I would not, he must have it somehow—when the policeman went to search him for the notes, he said, "Oh, you need not trouble yourself to search me, they are in too safe hands for you to get at them"</p>

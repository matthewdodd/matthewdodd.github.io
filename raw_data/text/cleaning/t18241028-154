            . I am a Thames Police Surveyor; about seven o'clock on the evening of the 7th of October, I met the two prisoner on Tower-hill. I stopped Jones with a parcel of worsted yarn wrapped up in his apron. I asked him how he got it - Neal had a bundle likewise; they said they had brought it from over the water, from a person of the name of Watts. I asked if they had a bill of parcels; they said No. 4 said I should take them to the watch-house. I look Jones, and Fogg took Neal; they said they were going to take the yarn to Mr. Sims, Cow-lane, Mile-end. I went over the water, but could find no such person as Watts.</p>

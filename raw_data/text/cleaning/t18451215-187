                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Paper-buildings, Temple. On the 27th of Nov., about half past one in the day, I went to Masterman's banking-house, presented a check for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and received from the cashier, Mr. Brand, I believe, nine 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land notes, which 1 put into my pocket-book, where I had another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two checks for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and two other securities, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an<lb></lb>other for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I placed my pocket-book in the inner pocket of my frock-coat—I had a bundle of letters in my pocket at the time—I returned to the Temple, through Cheapside, St. Paul's Churchyard, Fleet-street, and Bou<lb></lb>verie-street—when near Bucklersbury, I fancied I felt a toueh at my pocket—I put my hand on my pocket, and found, as I thought, the pocket-book and letters safe, all together—I went on, and did not seejmy person—it was quite an instantuneous touch—I did not know whether it was an accidental touch, or whether it might be a fancy of mine—Idid not discover my loss tor nearly an hour after I got to the Temple—I then had occasion to refer to my pocket-book, and it was gone—I went back to Masterman's, got the numbers of the notes, and stopped them at the Bank—this is my pocket-book and all its contents—I cannot myself identify the notes.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss these things which are the subject of your indictment? - A. I was present when the officer took them out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you had occasion to suspect this woman? - A. The bottle of rum I missed about the beginning of last month; the lace was missed by my wife about the 23d of October; Bly came with a search-warrant against the prisoner at my house; she refused to give the key of her box; Bly broke it open; in the box there were three bottles found; the bottle of rum was nighest towards me in the box, with the letter R. upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know by that letter R. that it belonged to somebody? - A. I had reason to suspect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak by any peculiarity of the letter? - A. I compared it to other bottles with the letter R. on them, and they appeared to be the same hand-writing of the wine-merchant; the bottle was filled with rum; there were four knives and eight forks, and a child's cap.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found these things in her box did she say any thing? - A. I told her I suspected her to be the thief who robbed me so largely; she immediately fell on her knees: I told her she should not stop, I had charged other persons with it; she begged to stop till Mrs. Riley came home? on the Tuesday following she begged me to forgive her, and she would go abroad with her husband, who was a soldier and was ordered abroad; I told her I would have nothing to do with it; I was present when all the things in the indictment were found in her box except the lace.</p>
               <p>MRS. RILEY sworn. - I was not at home at the time this search was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come home before this girl was taken away by the constable? - A. No; I searched the box after I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present at the time you searched the box? - A. No, she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time you searched the box? - A. No, no one.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find in that box which is the subject of the present charge? - A. About three-quarters of a yard of lace; I knew it to be mine; I saw the other things taken out of the box at the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you noticed the bottle of rum so as to be able to speak to it with certainty? - A. No, I had only missed it; the child's cap I knew to be mine, I made it myself; and the two tippets are made by myself; there is no mark on them, I knew them by my own work.</p>
               <p>Q. There are four knives and eight forks - do you know these; are you sure they are his own property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty to the child's bed-gown? - A. That is my own work; I can speak to it with certainty; the lace I had some time in wear, I taxed her with it after she had returned into my service the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. She had never owned to you that she had it in her box? - A. No, she said she had not seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other servant? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the bed-gown? - A. Fourpence, four knives and eight forks, 1 s. 6 d. the lace at 1 s. 6 d. two tippets 1 s.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Queen-square: On Wednesday, the 23d of October, I went to Mr. Riley's; I searched the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were there did you find the articles that are now produced? - A. Yes, all but the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at that box? - A. I broke it open; the prisoner said, d - n my eyes if you shall open my box without you shew me the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use that expression? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            (To prosecutrix.) Tell me whether you have any doubt of their being your property? - A. They are all my husband's property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Please you, my Lord, this bottle of rum was not Mr. Riley's; the way I came to have these three bottles in my box, Mrs. Riley had a gentleman and lady that lodged there, she gave my husband a shilling and me two, and a bottle of cyder; she told me she would not carry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300065"></xptr>away empty bottles, I might keep that bottle, and two more that were in the back kitchen; my husband thought he would buy some rum to have a glass of a morning when he mounted guard. I put these three empty bottles in my box; my husband told me he would buy some rum, he did buy one bottle full, and the glass was left by them; their servant told me to take it up stairs till she called for it; I told my husband to keep the glass, if the servant did not call for it. Mr. Riley was going to have a great dinner on the Sunday; I took the things which were laying about, and put them into my work-box; I told my husband to take it up stairs, and put it out of the way, and he put it into my box; the best knives and forks I put into Mr. Riley's desk, and some of my own are among these which Mr. Riley has got here. There was no robbery intended, I never wished to defraud my master and mistress, I knew I had a good place, having my husband there as well as myself; if I had wished to defraud them, I could have defrauded them of other more valuable things.</p>

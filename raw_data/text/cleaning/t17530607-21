She names them over. Some of them were taken out of one room, and some out of another, we advertised them, and in about a week after we found part of them, and part of them were sold to William Reice a falseman in Tothill fields, who upon seeing the advertisement stopp'd her. Here we found the capuchin, and of the six yards of blue sattin which I lost I found about two yards and a quarter; the prisoner went with me to her own lodgings where she delivered to me a gown, a pink silk quilted petticoat, a white quilted petticoat, three tea spoons, tongs, strainer, and the shagreen case, 3 little children's shirts, four or five caps, and the remaining part of the sattin, all which she own'd she had taken from out of the house: then she went with me to the silversmiths where she had sold three tea-spoons and a large one, there I found them.

            . I am constable of the Parish of St. Margaret's, on the 28th of May in the afternoon, a warrant was brought to me to take charge of the prisoner: I took her before justice Lediard, but before we went there, I went with her to her own room, where I found a brown silk gown, three silver tea spoons, a large silver spoon, and a shagreen case; I went also with them to the broker's, and saw the several things mentioned by the prosecutrix, and likewise the plate at the silversmith's shop, which she own'd she took from the prosecutor's house.</p>

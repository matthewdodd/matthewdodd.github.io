                  </hi>. I was in the service of the late Lord Fitzgerald as under-butler—I remained there till after his death—he died on Thursday morning, the 11th of May—I am now in the service of Mr. Williams, of Eden Bustard—on the Friday after Lord Fitzgerald's death I remember a person coming into the pantry with Howse the steward—his back was towards me, but by the prisoner's height, and his fine stout appearance, I believe he is the person—I was in the pantry—I did not like to stand to hear what they had to say, and went out—I returned in about five minutes—they were still there—there were in that pantry ten or eleven chests of his late lordship's plate—the plate closet had been under repair, it opens into the pantry, and the plate chests had been removed there on that account—when I returned into the pantry the man who was there with Howse, was standing by the plate chests—I recollect one chest in particular which stood on the top—that was the chest that was afterwards stolen—it contained a great number of silver dinner plates and silver gilt plates—it was full, and they were Lord Fitz<lb></lb>gerald's—the man was standing with his hand on the chest that was after<lb></lb>wards stolen—it was then about half-past six in the evening—I heard Howse say to him, "I think this pantry is larger than yours"—they then both went into the plate closet, and Howse said, "You see we have had this done up for the old man, but it is of no use now"—next day, about noon, I went out for beer—I shut the area door after me—when I returned I found the area door still fastened—Smith, the butler, opened it for me—West was there at the time—in a few minutes I went up to the dining-room where the servants were to be measured—all the servants were there but Howse—I had been down in the servant's hall when Howse ordered me to go up to be measured—when I had been up in the dining-room two or three minutes I heard an alarm—I went down stairs directly, and when I looked in the pantry I missed the plate chest that was on the top—I had seen it safe in the pantry at twelve o'clock, just before I went for the beer—I had had occasion to take one of the plates out of that chest, and that plate had only been put away out the Friday morning—when I came in with the beer, there was a horse and cart standing at the door, and a man standing at the horse's head at the area gate—there had been workmen engaged in the plate closet on the day before, and Howse had ordered them not to come on the day of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I was housekeeper to the late Lord Fitzgerald—I had a room in the lower part of his house, which adjoined the room from whence the plate chest was taken—I was at home on the Friday evening before the robbery—I noticed a man who came that evening to see Howse, the steward—he resembled the prisoner in every way—he had rather more whiskers about the face than he had under his chin—I heard him in conver<lb></lb>sation with Howse—I heard Howse say there was a quantity of plate, and that the plate closet had been fitted up, and how the chests were to be arranged; and he said, "I suppose your master will be having one fitted up something like it"—he made some answer, but I did not hear what, and then Howse introduced him into my room—he introduced me to him as</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Parker,—Lord Fitzgerald's housekeeper,—my friend"—I turned round and looked at him, and then turned my head again—the prisoner resembles him, and I do think he is the man, but I can't positively swear it—when they went out of my room they went along the passage, and I heard the man say to Howse,"What door is this?" and Howse said, "This is the wine cellar door"—the passage they went along leads from the place where the plate was, to the area door—I cannot tell how long the man was there—he was in the pantry, and I believe he had been in Howse's room—the fol<lb></lb>lowing day, about twelve o'clock, an alarm was given that the plate had been taken—shortly before that Howse had been in my room—after he left my room I think he closed the door, but I can't say that it was fastened—as soon as he closed the door I heard a shuffling of feet, wbicb appealed like two per<lb></lb>sons with a weight—if a person stood at my room door they could not see all down the passage, as there is a projection—they would look down as far as Howse's room—it could not have been more than a minute after I heard the shuffling of the feet, before I heard that something had been carried out—the cook ran from the kitchen, and made a communication to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was kitchen-maid in Lord Fitzgerald's service last May, when he died.

                  </hi>. I am pot-man at the Lowndes Arms. I remember, on the Friday afternoon before the robbery, seeing the prisoner in my master's skittle-ground about six o'clock in the evening—I saw Howse there talking to the prisoner and another gentleman, for about a quarter of an hour—I did not see Smith, the butler there—I saw him when I was called to go out with some porter—when I returned Howse and the prisoner were gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">inspector of the A division.</hi>) I know very little of the prisoner, but I had some knowledge of him before this robbery—I was called on on account of the robbery—I heard the cook and the other servants de<lb></lb>scribe a tall man—I knew where the prisoner lived at that time, and in conse<lb></lb>quence</p>

               <p>of the description I had, I watched the house in which he lived, and used every exertion to find him, for about a week after the robbery—I was not able to find him out, or to trace him in any way, till he was taken—I was present when he was taken into custody at the place where he lived, No. 2, Coburg-place, Lower Kennington-lane, Lambeth—he had no coat on when I went in, but a dirty black handkerchief round his neck, and he appeared to be sun-burnt—he has on a white cravat now—I never saw him with one on before—he bad whiskers when he was taken, as he has now.</p>

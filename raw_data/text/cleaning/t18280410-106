            . I am a watchman to the St. Katharine's Dock Company. I was calling eight o'clock in the evening of the 26th of February, and missed some lead off a wash-house, which I had seen safe an hour before: I heard a noise in an adjoining stable; I waited a few minutes, and saw Smith crawling out on his hands and knees - he said,"There is another boy inside;" Jones then came out, and ran as hard as he could; I overtook him, and brought him back - I found this lead in the corner of the stable; I fitted it on the top of the wash-house - it matched exactly; I gave the prisoners in charge - they said they had just come from on board ship.</p>

            . On the 26th of February the prisoner and Smith were brought to me, charged with stealing this lead off the house which I live in - it belongs to the St. Katharine Dock Company; I found no knife on them, but Jones said there had been a knife thrown away.</p>

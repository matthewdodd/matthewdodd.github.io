                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the audit office of the Great Northern Railway, and have been lately attending to the registrar's de<lb></lb>partment.

B stock, from Stephen George Hammond, to George Sidney, dated 10th Feb., 1855—the signature Stephen George Hammond is in full, and is in Redpath's writing; it is not witnessed at all—the attesting witness to Sidney's signature is Charles Kent—that is in the writing of the prisoner Kent—I produce the stock register No. 22, at folio 133 I find an account of George Sidney's in the writing of a clerk named Corfield—he is described as of No. 20, Edward-street, Hampstead-road, gentleman—his account here is credited with the amount mentioned in the transfer I have spoken of—I have got the stock register No. 119—at folio 153 I find an account of Stephen George Hammond, of Church-street, Chipping Norton; but a line is drawn through the address, and it is altered to Barge-yard, Bucklersbury—that account is debited with the same amount—the entry of the transfer is in Freeman's writing, a clerk in the registry office—I produce the original transfer which came into the office on 10th Feb., 1855—Ham<lb></lb>mond's account was then balanced—there was no dividend coming to him, and Sidney had oversold his account to the extent of 2, 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that re<lb></lb>duced the overplus to 1, 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the total amount of A stock from Sidney is 7, 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and of B stock 5, 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as by the books, but there are other transfers—here is a transfer, No. 19259, purporting to be from Leopold Redpath, of Chester-terrace, to the Rev.

               <p>the two out—they were not in the transfer book this morning—the transfer No. 16774 is the subject of this indictment—No. 16775 is annexed to it—those two papers were taken from the transfer book on the 7th of the present month by me—before the Magistrate the books themselves were produced—the books are here—the two documents were taken out because they were both pasted on one guard, and I could not take the one Without destroying the validity of the other—my attention was not particularly directed to the other document—I will swear that—I did not know what it was—I do not know that Mr. Redpath had a great deal of stock stand<lb></lb>ing in different persons names—I swear that—I knew that he had stock standing in his own name—I did not know that he had stock standing in the name of Sidney—I did not know that there was such a name until I commenced the examination—these documents are cut out of a guard book—they are pasted into that book—I have gone through the transfers up to about No. 19000—there are forty-nine transfers of Sidney's in the books, thirty-three of one sort—all the signatures of Sidney's are in the same handwriting—I believe those signatures are not attested by fifteen or sixteen different persons—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the books</hi>) here is one, No. 16776, attested by S.

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Great Northern Railway Company. Redpath was originally a clerk in the registration department, and on the retirement of Mr. Clark, about three years ago, having been chief clerk and book keeper, he was appointed to succeed him—while he was prin<lb></lb>cipal clerk to Mr. Clark the entry of the transfer of shares was, I believe, chiefly his duty—Kent was in those days second clerk in the office, acting in concert with Redpath—since Redpath has been at the head of the office, Kent has been chief clerk, next to him—during any temporary absence of Redpath, it was Kent's duty to superintend the business of that department.</p>

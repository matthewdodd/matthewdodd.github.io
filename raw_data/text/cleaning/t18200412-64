               <p>JOHN OVER. I am a butcher, and live in Fleet-market. On the 7th of April I turned into Bolt-court, the prosecutor was against the wall. I saw the prisoner take something from the prosecutor's breeches and run off with it. I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and saw him stopped in Gough-square - the watch was picked up, and delivered to the prosecutor. The prisoner behaved very bad, and made use of bad language - he told me to be on my guard, for if he was in confinement there were those who would mark me, and he did not care for himself, for he was as well out of the country as in it and he knew we could not rope him for this.</p>

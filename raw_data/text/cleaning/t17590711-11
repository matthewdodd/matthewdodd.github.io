            . I was going in at the Inn gate, I met the prisoner with a basket of butter on his shoulder. I call'd hollo; he made no answer, but walked as fast as he could. When he came to the gate he threw the basket from his shoulder and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Drain. This was about half an hour after ten at night. I ran after him up Leaden-hall-street. I pursued him, and brought him back to my master's house. He said, are you sure I am the man? I said, I was. He was taken before an Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him examined?</p>
               <p>Drain. I did. He denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you now sure he is the man that had the basket of butter on his shoulder?</p>
               <p>Drain. I am sure he is. But he has altered his dress since I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Drain. No. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to him was you when he went out of the yard?</p>
               <p>Drain. I was close by him, and followed him close to his heels as he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the place where he threw the basket down was it that you took him?</p>
               <p>Drain. It may be 20 or 30 yards. I did not see him take it up, but before he had carried it three yards I saw him.</p>

            . On the 9th of June, after ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner at the bar with a flat of butter on his shoulder coming out of the Saracen's inn-yard, within Aldgate. He threw it from his shoulder and ran away, which made me imagine he had stole it. The chamberlain and I both went after him, and took him. The basket produced, and deposed to.</p>

               <p>I had been at Bow-fair, and was going along the street; they said I had stole a man's basket out of the yard. This woman said she saw me in the yard; but before the Alderman she said the contrary.</p>

               <p>Q. What business had he in your house so often?</p>
               <p>Noteer. He is one of his Majesty's Palace-Court officers, so am I.</p>
               <p>John Downs. I have known him about two or three years. I never heard any ill of him.</p>
               <p>Mr Ward. I have known him five or six years; he once lived with me, and my mother; we kept a Baker's shop in More-fields; I am a Carpenter, by trade; he never was drunk in the time; but he us'd to lay out money, and do the business, with care and industry; he has been trusted with twenty or thirty pounds, at a time.</p>

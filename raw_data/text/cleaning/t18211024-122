On the 25th of October, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise of something falling - I went into the kitchen on the ground floor, it opens into a passage; I ran in and saw the prisoner, he run away - I pursued, and gave an alarm, he was taken by the watchman. I found the tea caddy thrown down - I had seen it safe two minutes before in the kitchen window, it could not be seen from the street, no other person but him had been in the kitchen - it could not have fallen off the shelf; I found it about two yards from the window. There is a gate, and a forecourt, before the house.</p>

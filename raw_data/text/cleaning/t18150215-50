               <p>Q. Had he left the shop then - A. Not at that time; when he said that it gave me suspicion that he had something of mine. The jacket was then on his back, he had been over the counter, and taken it; he went to the street door to get away, I followed him; he pulled the jacket off, threw it down; I secured him. He went from the counter to go into the street; he threw the jacket into the mud; I secured him, and sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought that jacket in the middle of the street. I asked him for a suit of clothes, he said that jacket is mine; I told him I never was in his shop in my life before, I was taken in custody, The ship I belonged to is now gone away, I have lost every thing.</p>

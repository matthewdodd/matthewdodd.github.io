                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Wild and Robinson. I know the prisoner Martin—he was in the employ of Messrs. Wild and Robinson—he was errand boy there, and he likewise used to sell goods and put the sales in the book—we had a customer named Troup—Martin would have the opportunity of knowing that Mr. Troup was a customer, and of seeing his handwriting—we were in the habit of furnishing goods to Mr. Troup on orders similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Martin left in June last—on 28th Sept. I saw the prisoner Graves, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I am not quite sure that that was the first time I had seen him that day—about 11 that day this order was presented to me—I believe by his general appear<lb></lb>ance it was Graves who brought it, but I cannot swear whether it was him or not—I gave the order to Mr. Wild, and he gave the bracelets to the person who brought the order—I am acquainted with Martin's handwriting—both these orders (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are in Martin's handwriting, to my best belief.</p>

Wild and Robinson one year—I kept the day book and approbation book—I wrote in the day book, and Martin wrote in it, and Mr. Wild, and Mr. Robinson also—I do not lock that book up—no one writes in the ledger except me—I keep the approbation book, the ledger, the cash book, and day book—there is only one errand boy there at a time—Martin was there—he and I were very friendly—I never called him clerk, and he never called him-self clerk—I called him by his name—I treated him very friendly—I never had any quarrel with him, that I remember—I had not repeated quarrel with him—in business I sometimes told him not to do this or that, but I did not quarrel—I did not order him about—I can say, on my oath, that Mr. Wild or Mr. Robinson never told me that Martin was to have my place when I left—Martin was once talking about it—I do not know that he was to have my place when I left—he could not, he cannot speak German—I cannot tell whether I was permanently engaged by Messrs. Wild and Robinson when I entered there—I was paid by the week—neither Mr. Wild or Mr. Robinson ever told me that I was engaged there merely to make up the books—I was generally engaged there—I found Martin there when I went—I remained there till he left in June—I was there from Oct. last year—no other person stood between Martin and my employers except myself—there was no other clerk or shopman—before I went there Mr. Robinson kept the ledger—I am a native of Poland; I have been in this country about two years and a half—I had been in various situations before I got to Messrs. Wild and Robinson's</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and importer, and live at 88, Hatton-garden—I received this order on 28th September, about a quarter past 12 o'clock—it was brought by a person similar to the prisoner Graves—I believe be is the person—I could not swear positively—I was at home when the order was brought; I had very shortly before come into my house—just before I came in, I had seen the prisoner Martin standing at the corner of Hatton-garden and Cross-street; I knew him perfectly before—he might be about eighty steps from my door—when I got within about twenty steps of him, he saw me, and turned his back—when I got past, I turned and looked at him—he was looking towards Hatton-wall, in the direction of Wild and Robinson's—it might be about a quarter of an hour after I saw him that this order was presented by Graves.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor, and have been so for three years. I had suspected the prisoner - I saw him make two attempts to pocket shoes, on the 27th of June; and on the 28th, I saw a pair in his left hand pocket - I charged him with it - he first denied it, and then said he had a pair of old ones - the shop then began to fill, and he came to me and said he hoped he might rest happy and safe in my not communicating the circumstance to Mr. Lloyd - he then turned out of the shop; and on the Monday I told Mr. Lloyd - these are the shoes I saw in his pocket - I could read the figures on the toes of them as he walked about.</p>

             (police-constable C 179). I received information, and went to Mr. Lloyd's, on the 30th of June. Mr. Lloyd sent for George Filewood, and said to him,"Have I not heard something unpleasant about you?" - he said, not that he knew of - I took him to the station, and he gave me his address in Lambeth-walk - I went there, and found one pair of Blucher boots, one pair of shoes, one spur, and a duplicate of a pair of shoes - I then made search amongst the pawnbrokers, and found above two hundred pairs in all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Those you found at his house had been worn? A. They appeared to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040063"></xptr>have been worn once.

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You are sure that one pair was pawned by one of the prisoners? A. Yes; I cannot say which pair he left - I always had a suspicion of both the prisoners, that they pawned them with the intention of leaving them, and I was careful not to lend too much on them - I lent 5s. on this pair - they would fetch me about 5s. - we frequently lend 6s. on things which will not fetch more than 5s. to people we know - this pair of boots was pawned on the 30th of December - the prisoners pawned these four pairs of shoes, and James Filewood the boots.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had he often pawned with you? A. Yes; many pairs of shoes - I advanced a fair value on them - we do not usually advance a full value on goods which we do not expect will be redeemed - I believe it is done.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutor - I missed these boots, they are No. 742.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you rub off the mark when you sell them? A. No; we sell a great many - I cannot swear these had not been sold.</p>
               <p>JAMES LLOYD. These are my shoes - they came from Northampton - great part of these are marked in the prisoner's own writing, and part by my apprentice - these boots are not marked - the man who made them is here, but he cannot swear they were made for me - one pair of those produced by Pyatt were marked by the prisoner, the rest I only know from having lost so great a number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know when they were marked? A. I have no earthly conception- I seldom sell in my shop - I think it not very probable that these were sold by my shopman, finding them as I did- I think James Filewood could not have bought them for 5s. a pair - he could have sold them for more than he pawned them - I have missed great quantities of boots and shoes - I have not found the fourth part of what I lost - I do not know that I have complained of my apprentice not entering goods sent to country shops - I have no recollection of persons calling to pay for goods which had not been entered - it may have happened - that may account for a pair or two - some of these cost me 5s. a pair, some as little as 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM BRYMER PYATT. Q. Are you quite sure that these four pair of shoes were pawned by the prisoners? A. Yes; some by one, and some by the other, but I cannot say which - I never saw them both together.</p>
               <p>George Filewood's Defence. I never had any thing to do with any of them - when Mr. Pyatt was before the magistrate, he said he had seen me in his shop, but could not swear to my pawning any of the shoes.</p>
               <p>James Filewood's Defence. I have been in the habit of buying and selling shoes many years - I attend sale-rooms - I bought a great many in King-street, Convent-garden - no man alive can swear to them.</p>

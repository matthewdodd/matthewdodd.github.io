                  </hi>. I am a baker, at 12, Drury-lane. On 19th May, at half-past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was in Great Wyld-street, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soners in front of me, walking arm-in-arm—I was sober, I had just left my work, and had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pocket of my flannel-jacket—Thomas <hi rend="italic">bounced</hi> against me, and knocked me into the road—he appeared to be drunk, and said, "Well, Mr. b—baker"—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said, "If you say anything to me, I will smash you"—Williams said, "Why don't you <hi rend="italic">hit</hi> the b down?"—I turned round with a wooden bowl I had in my hand, to keep them off, and felt one of their hands in my jacket-pocket while they were knocking me about—I cannot say whether they took any money then—some men came and pulled Williams away, and I took my money from my jacket-pocket and put it into my waistcoat-pocket—they must have seen me do that—after that Thomas <hi rend="italic">fenced</hi> against me again, and struck me, and I threw him down—he got up, <hi rend="italic">fenced</hi> towards me again, and Williams came behind me, and got his hand into my waistcoat pocket, where my money was—I seized hold of his hand while it was in my pocket—Thomas rushed in upon me, I threw him down again, and a shilling dropped—Thomas picked it up, and I said, "Give me that shilling, it is mine;"—I called out to the people, "Keep them away from me, they are robbing me!"—Thomas made no answer, but <hi rend="italic">fenced</hi> towards me again; some one called out, "The. police are coming!" and they both ran away—I went into a public-house, counted my money, and missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—about ten minutes after, I gave information to a policeman, and about twenty minutes after went with him to a public-house in Great Wyld-street, where I saw the prisoners, and gave them into custody.</p>

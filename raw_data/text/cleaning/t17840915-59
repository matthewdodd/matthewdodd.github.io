               <p>I stood at my door between nine and ten in the morning, and I heard a cry of stop thief! I looked round and saw the prisoner run, I laid hold of him, he said he had done no harm to anybody, and Mrs. Anderson came and cried out directly, that is the villain I caught in my room: we went up stairs, and there was a box stood at top of the bed, she said the box was moved.</p>
               <p>Court. Were not there other people running on the cry of stop thief? - A good many, but he was a great way before them all: the prisoner told me an acquaintance of his lodged there, and he mentioned that before the Justice, that he went to see for him; he said he did not know how he came into the room, the door was open: I felt his clothes, he had two coats on, and in the inside lining of his under coat I found a false key, which I have in my pocket, that would not open the door, but one more was found upon him at the Justice's, which opened the door the same as the right key did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You spoke of the box being moved, where was it moved to? - As it may be from the corner of the side of the bed; it has stood in a corner of the room for many years.</p>

             passed by me with a basket in his hands, it was about half past seven at night; I asked him what he had got there, he told me he had some iron in the basket, he took it from home, and he was going to his master's in Red Lion alley, Cow Cross, and if I would come that way he would shew me. I found by the way he trembled that the property was stolen; my partner and I got hold of him and took him part of the way; then he resisted and tried to get away; he throwed the basket down; I knocked him down against the rails; at that time he began to empty his breast of the property, which was an iron backband of a cart; then my partner and I took him to the Compter; the officer took six horse shoes from his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the basket - A There were twelve horshoes in the basket, and two pieces of iron bars; after I had delivered the charge, I went back and found the iron backband and took it to the place where the other property was; it is now in the basket.</p>

            . I know Baalam; he met me at a public house; he asked me to recommend him to a customer to assist him in the disposal of stolen goods; I directly mentioned the prisoner at the bar; he enquired after one Fise; there was no conversation about recommending the prisoner, but only about Fise: I knew the prisoner by his selling greens with a jack-ass; the green-stall in Duke's-Place belongs to the mother of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he desire you to recommend him to a customer, and that you should have a guinea or so?</p>
               <p>Thomas. No</p>

On the 18th of December the prisoner came to the shop, and selected the goods stated in the indictment, which came to 2l. 5s. 7d.; he requested me to give my boy the change for 3l. to bring with the goods, and he would return three sovereigns by the boy - he did not give his address; the boy was to take the goods with him - he was an entire stranger to me, and was to pay ready money; I told my boy, in his presence, not to part with them without the money; the boy returned in an hour and a half without goods or money; I have not recovered them, nor received the money.</p>

The prisoner came to the shop; my master gave me these articles to take with him; I was to receive three sovereigns, and not leave them without; the prisoner took me to the Admiral Keppel public-house; I followed him into the parlour; he asked me to give him the change, and he would bring me the three sovereigns; I said I would not; I put the parcel on the table, and was resting my hand on it - he took it up, and said he would go and shew it to the young woman; he went by the bar, out at the back door, and shut it; I went out, opened the door in a minute or two, and saw a young woman; I asked where the young man was; she said she had not seen him. I did not see him again till he was apprehended - I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

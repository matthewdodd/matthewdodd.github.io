                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Edwin Kendall of No, 27, Barbican, a shoe-maker. On Saturday, the 16th of January the prisoner came to the shop, in company with a woman he called his wife—I had to take measure if her for a pair of boots, and he once or twelve called her his wife—it was about seven or eight o'clock—I showed her three or four pairs of boots—they did not buy any thing—but I measured her for a pair—when she put on her own boots, she removed her chair from where it stood, over to a spot were there were some shoes standing, and called the prisoner to lace on her boot—he did so—they then went away—I missed two pairs of shoes from that very spot, on the Monday morning fol<lb></lb>lowing soon after we opened the shop—about eight or nine o'clock on the Saturday night, they were on the floor, near to where her boot was laced—I made a pair of boots for her—she came on the 23rd of January and paid for them—she was in company with the prisoner—I have since seen a pair of shoes, produced by the inspector of police—they are one of the pairs I missed on the 16th of January—they were boots I made fir the woman—I have seen two other pairs of shoes, produced by Fowler, a pawnbroker—one of them I had missed on the 16th of January—so that I have seen both the pairs which were on the floor near where the prisoner came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the G police. The prisoner was brought to the station-house by Peak—he gave his address, No 4, I think. Christopher-square, Long-alley—a tea-caddy was brought by Peak to the station-house—the prisoner gave me the key from his pockets, to open it—we found some duplicated in it—some for the shoes—on the 31st of March I went to his lodging, and found one pair of shoes there, behind the bed—they had been worn—they were shown to the prisoner, he said they were his, and he had bought them in July last—they were women's shoes—I was at Worship-street the day that the witness Yeowill saw the shoes and identified them—they were left there and lost.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 13, Goodge-street, Tottenham-court-road, with my father, a silk-dyer: On Saturday, February the 4th, between seven and eight o'clock, I was in my father's area, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards near our house, I thought they had no good design; I told my father, and he told me to walk on the opposite side of the way, which I did, and I saw a man dodging between the coaches; and I walked backwards and forwards on the other side of the way, and saw the prisoner sitting on a post opposite Mr. Stonnel's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes, I am confident of it; I walked backwards and forwards again, and his eyes were fixed on Mr. Stonnel's shop; then I saw a man go to the shop window, and take a pair of shoes out; I supposed him to be his companion, I had seen the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get the shoes out of the window? - A. I saw him put his arm in and take them out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear any glass break? - A. No, I did not; when he had taken them out, he went immediately to the prisoner, and they both went down John-street together; I directly went into Mr. Stonnel's shop, and told Miss Stonnel a man had taken a pair of shoes out; she rang the bell, and Mr. Stonnel and his son came down, and I told them which way they went, and I went with them down John-street;

             sworn. I am the son of Richard Stonnel, I work with my father: About eight o'clock in the evening I was alarmed with the ringing of the bell, my father and I ran down, and were informed, by a lad in the shop, that we had been robbed, and which way they went; I ran down John-street, and into Windmill street, and saw two men, I went between them, and looked at one, and then at the other, but mostly at the prisoner, as I perceived he had something under his coat; I lifted up his coat and saw the shoes, I seized them both; upon which the prisoner struck me a violent blow in the mouth, on which the other struggled and got away, and cried stop thief; I kept hold of the prisoner, and strove to take the shoes from under his coat; he threw his coat open to throw them down, and I took them from him; Rolfe, the officer, has them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say to him when he took hold of me? - A. He slipped out of my hand, as I took the shoes from under his coat; I followed him, and took him in Percy-street; he stood against the rails; he said, I am no thief, you did not take those shoes from me; I brought him back to my father's shop, and delivered him to Mr. Rolfe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said, I am no thief; if there was any thief, it must be the man in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the state of the window? - A. One evening before an instrument had been drove into the putty, and one of the panes of glass was shivered in many, directions, but there was no piece out; I examined the window that was the pane the shoes were taken out of.</p>
               <p>Q. (To

            .) What did you observe about the pane of glass the shoes were taken from? - A. About a week before an instrument had been put in the putty, and the glass was split in two or three places, but it was all whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop at the time of this robbery? - A. I don't know whether any body was in the shop, my daughter might be in the parlour; I brought the shoes down into the shop that afternoon; they are my apprentice's making.</p>
               <p>ROEERT ROLFE sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; the shoes were delivered to me. (They were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            .) Are those the shoes you took from the prisoner? - A. Yes, I am certain they are.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner said, I am no thief, had you said any thing about shoes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Richard Stonnel.) Q. Had you sold any of that sort of shoes that day? - A. I believe not; they were brought down about two o'clock; I brought four pair down; here is a fellow pair made off the same last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came from Kentish Town, and as I was going down John-street, I saw a man before me in a blue coat; I perceived him drop a pair of shoes; I picked them up; I followed him; he turned down Windmill-street, and this man came and took hold of me; I said, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150028"></xptr>not the man that dropped the shoes, the other man dropped them.</p>

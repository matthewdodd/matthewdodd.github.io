            . I am a watchman of Fox and Knot-court. I received charge of the prisoner from Mr. Ricards, who was holding her by the waist - she said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Fox-court, and met the prosecutor very much intoxicated - he reeled against me, and asked me to take him home; I went on talking with him - he said he was very tipsy; that he had been with a lady, and spent all his money except a 5l. note - as we came along he met a girl who had been with him; she called him by name - he stood talking to her, and told her to come next night at eleven o'clock, and bring another young woman with her; I was going to wish him good night - he buttoned up his coat, and said he had lost his watch; I knew nothing of it - it was not on Snow-hill, but Fox and Knot-court; a boy saw me standing talking to him - the watchman was to have brought him.</p>
               <p>MR. RICARDS. It happened at the corner of the court; I did not go into the court till she ran up it - I did not say I had been with another woman, or any thing of the sort; I did not speak two words to her - there is no truth in her statement.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long before did you know you had the watch in your possession? A. I had it at the Gloucester coffee-house, Oxford-street - I stopped no where after that, and firmly believe I spoke to nobody; I swear I saw my watch drawn out of my pocket plainly.</p>

            . I did not see the prosecutor or prisoner till after the alarm - the prisoner made no defence at the time; the prosecutor might have taken a little, but was perfectly in his senses - he knew well what he was about.</p>

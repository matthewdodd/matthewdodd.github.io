Between three and four last Thursday afternoon, I was going from Gracechurch-street towards Fish-street-hill—I saw the prisoner take Mrs. Wightman's dress up, and put his hand into her pocket—I went up to her and asked if she had lost anything—she said, no—the prisoner was then walking before her—he made rather a start and walked pretty fast till he got to the corner, he then made a run—I hallooed "Stop thief!"and the police, man caught him—I saw him take the purse out of Mrs. Wightman's pocket, and he dropped it when we detained him.</p>

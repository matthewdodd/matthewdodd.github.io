               <p>Q. Did you find your desk locked? - A. I did; I missed the halfpence, but did not miss the waistcoat till after the officer had found it; I then looked at Mr. Turner's desk, and saw that open; I found the lock had been wrenched clear off; I missed a hydrometer from his desk; I did not examine it any further, but sent for Mr. Turner; it was about a week after, that I saw the waistcoat in possession of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How is this accompting-house situated - does it adjoin the house? - A. Yes; the house and accompting-house is all enclosed in one yard, you go out of Mr. Turner's house into the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM-SACKVILLE TURNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys Q. You are a brewer, at Bow? - A.

               <p>Q. How is your house situated? - A. The accompting-house is under a separate roof, but it adjoins the wash-house within two or three yards of the dwelling-house; it is in the brewhouse yard, behind the dwelling-house, it is enclosed in the same yard with the dwelling-house; and the outer gates locked.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are an officer belonging to Lambeth-street? - A. I am: On Friday the 4th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, we went to Pritchard's house; while we were waiting for him, the wife of the prisoner came in, she called herself his wife; she was searched, and in her pocket was found a large key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes: Coomes and I went with her to No. 2, Ponderson's-place, Bethnal-green Road; she unlocked the door and got a light; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, there are but two rooms in the house; in the bed-room I found a waistcoat, (producing it;) lapped up with other things, in the end of the curtain; in the other room, I found these halfpence tied up in a very large bason, like a wash-hand bason; there was a large quantity of bad halfpence, which we left behind, to the amount of about a dozen or fourteen shillingsworth; the prisoner was at that time in custody at the office; on the Tuesday following, we went to the prisoner's house a second time, and searched the necessary; I saw Coomes put his hand underneath the seat, and take out a parcel tied up in a white cloth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. A person stooping down in the necessary to buckle his shoe, might have seen this parcel? - A. No, they could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you see that latch thing there? - A. Yes, this is it; then the prisoner unlocked the accompting-house door with this key; then we got a light by a bottle of phosphorus, which the prisoner had, then we broke open the desks with this (a screwdriver;) we took out of one desk this waistcoat, some paper, and some few halfpence; out of the other desk, we took six guineas in gold, some silver and some bad halfpence in a little bag; we took some halfpence tied up in paper off the desk; then we brought out a little box with something in it that brewers use, like a weather-glass.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Turner.) Q. What is the use of the hydrometer in your business? - A. To ascertain the gravity of the wort.</p>
               <p>Pritchard.

               <p>Q. You have had sufficient experience to know that the evidence of an accomplice requires some additional support? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know it was necessary, in order to corroborate your story, that that waistcoat should be left at the house of the prisoner? - A. I cannot tell what you mean.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Pritchard gave me this waistcoat to go to the Bank in, to get change for a note; I am as innocent as the child unborn; Pritchard has done this to clear himself and his son, and I will take care never to have any thing to do with such a man again; I don't know where the brewhouse is, as God is my Judge; he has brought up his own son in the same way; his son was detected in carrying false keys to him while he was in jail, to let him out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 27th or 28th of October I met the prisoner in Crown-street, St. Giles', after twelve o'clock at night; I was perfectly sober - I was returning from the theatre; she asked me to go with her - I went with her to a court which I do not know the name of; we went to a room on the first floor - I did not like the appearance of the place, as there was only a fire, an old chair, and a table; I wished to go, but she would not let me - I had not made any bargain with her, but I told her I would give her all the money I had to let me go, as she said I should not go without I left something; I gave her a shilling and some halfpence; she then snatched my handkerchief out of my hat - I took up my umbrella, and was coming away, when she snatched my umbrella, and said I should leave that; I did not intend to part with them - I then got out, and gave an alarm to the Policeman; he went, found the handkerchief in her possession, and the umbrella in the room.</p>

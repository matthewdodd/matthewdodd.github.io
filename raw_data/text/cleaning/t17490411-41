            . The prisoner and I lodged together. I found a pair of my stockings in his pocket the day they were taken away; he took them out of my chest .</p>
               <p>Q. Was your chest locked?</p>
               <p>Carter. I do not know whether it was or not, the key was in it. The prisoner staid out all night; and when he came home in the morning , I saw his pockets stick out; I searched him and found the stockings there. He confess'd he stole the other things , and would have me go along with him to the persons where he sold them. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174904110017"></xptr> sold the flannel waistcoat in Spittle-fields, and the shirt in Rag fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them out of your chest?</p>
               <p>Carter. Only the stockings were in the chest, the other things were in my room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I thought the stockings had been my own; I put them into my pocket to go to have them wash'd, and he said they were his.</p>

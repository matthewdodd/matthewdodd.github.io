             sworn. - On the 22d of March, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going into Bow-street to buy some eggs; the prisoner laid hold of me in <placeName id="t17990403-52-crimeloc298">Bow-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long was she with you? - A. Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not speak? - A. Yes; she said something to me, but I did not know what; she seemed to be rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you four guineas in your pocket before you met her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CARPMEAL sworn. - The last witness brought the prisoner into my house, on the 22d, between ten and eleven o'clock; I went to search her, and I observed her putting her hands towards her pocket, and the four guineas dropped upon the floor. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met this man in Bow-street; he asked me if he could go home with me; I asked him what he would make me a present of; he said, four guineas; but whether he gave me the four guineas, or whether I took it, I cannot say, for I was very much intoxicated.</p>

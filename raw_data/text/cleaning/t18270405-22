The prisoner came to lodge with me the beginning of February; she paid me 1s. a week for part of my bed. I went out to nurse the beginning of February, leaving the key with her, as I slept out; I locked my drawers, and am sure every thing was safe; I came home in a fortnight and three days, about eight o'clock in the evening, found the door locked, and the key laying on the floor, by the side of the door - I had been home once in the interval; my drawers were then locked, but I did not look into them. When I came home on this evening the prisoner was not there; I missed some of this property from a box - I did not sleep at home that night; I had lost the keys of my drawers a few days before I went to my place, which was the reason I did not open them; I had them broken open the next morning, and missed the rest of the property. I did not see the prisoner till the 28th of February, when I found her at Hackney work-house, where she received 2s. a week. I had her taken into custody, and she produced several duplicates.</p>

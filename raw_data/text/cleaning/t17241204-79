By the Way they called at another Tavern, where he miss'd his Money, and charged her with it. She ran away. But finding her again 3 days after, she confess'd she had taken it, and bought New Apparel with it. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that about 7 at Night, as she was walking with another Woman, the Prosecutor came by, and the other Woman knowing him, called him by his Name. They went to the Tavern, and from thence home, where she went to Bed alone, and fell asleep, but never was so surprized, either before or since, as when she awaked and found a Man in her Bed, except it was when he afterwards accused her of picking his Pocket, of which she was entirely innocent. <rs id="t17241204-79-verdict449" type="verdictDescription">

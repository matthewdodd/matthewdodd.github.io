            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 7th of this instant, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner go out of the house with something under his coat; I went after him, and asked him what he had got? then I saw it was a tea-chest. He told me he was going to carry it home to a gentleman that had sent it to be mended. I opened it, and saw it was a new one; I brought it in, and shewed it to my master. A short time after he came in again, and wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180007"></xptr> to go up to speak to my master; he went up, and soon returned, and went out; and in about a quarter of an hour after, I missed my capuchin and a shift out of my drawer: he was taken on Monday the 9th, and confessed he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, and had pawned my shift and capuchin in Chandois-street, where we found them.

On the 7th of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in, and desired to look at some prints; I showed her some dresses, and she desired to look at some off the piece - I brought some down to her, but they would not suit, and she desired to look at others; as I was getting another piece off the shelf I turned my face, and saw her put a dress into her basket, which she had brought in with her; I cut her seven yards off one piece which she had chosen; she then looked at some lining muslin, and while I was getting that I named the circumstance to Mr. Driver, one of the partners, and he desired me to follow her out, which I did, for about twenty yards; I then accused her of having a piece of print, and desired her to let me look in her basket; she gave it to me directly, and I saw the print the goods which she had bought were on the top of it; Mr. Cranch followed me out, and brought her back to the shop - she said she was very sorry for it, but she had taken it; and she said, in going to the station, that she would give me a sovereign if I would let her go; she was taken to the station, and given to the officer; I had seen her repeatedly in the shop buying goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do all the three partners take an active part in the business? A. Yes, and all their names are over the door; there were no other customers in the shop; I am quite sure the prisoner took the print - I served her afterwards, because I heard it was a regular plan to let persons go out of the shop with what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060034"></xptr>they had taken; I am sure she took the cotton - there are twenty-eight hands in the shop altogether; I had seen her come in with the basket, here is a mark on this cotton - it is a gown-piece - she did not say it must have got in by mistake; I gave the basket to Cranch.</p>

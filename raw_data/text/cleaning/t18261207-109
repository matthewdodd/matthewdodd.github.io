            . I am eleven years old, and am in the service of Mr. Jacobs. I saw East walking about my master's shop, for half an hour, and he then came and took 2lbs. of sausages and two rolls of butter - he ran off, and I ran after him; I cried Stop thief! and a coal-heaver stopped him in the field. I went to tell my master, and as we were going to where he was, the coalheaver let him go - I saw him, but did not know him; some people said, "There he goes," and a publican stopped him - he was taken to the Lamb, but there was nothing found on him. I had not seen Jordan when I left East with the coal-heaver.</p>

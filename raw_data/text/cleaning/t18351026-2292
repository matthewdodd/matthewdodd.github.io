                  </hi>. I belong to the medical profession, and live at No.8, Grosvenor-street, Camberwell. On Saturday, the 15th of August, I came up from Dudley, beyond Birmingham, by the "Tally Ho" Birmingham coach—I arrived soon after seven o'clock in the evening—we stopped at the Bull and Mouth; but I lost my property in Manor-place, Walworth, at No. 10—I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the Bull and Mouth, to go there—I was lodging there—at the time I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> I had a carpet bag, a travelling cloak, and a large paper parcel, and my cash-box—my cash was in my box, locked, and covered with paper, with my own name on it—they were put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not take particular notice of the driver, it was getting rather dusk—I believe the prisoner was the man—I drove to No. 10, Manor-place—I there got out—I believe the prisoner handed me some of my parcels out, and I partly took them out myself—when every thing was out, I paid him, and he drove away immediately—he flogged his horse and went off very quickly—there was no space of time, scarcely, between the time I paid him and the time he drove off—I missed the box immediately—it contained the property stated—I mentioned to the landlady that I had left the box, and must go after it, and see about it—I went, but he was too far gone, I went to the Elephant and Castle, and took a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and pursued to the stand which I took him from—I knew the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> before I went after it—I found the same <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but not the same driver; he was gone—the box contained the property, besides some loose papers of no value—I cannot tell when the prisoner was taken, but he was taken in Westminster, by the police—I have never seen a shilling of the property.</p>

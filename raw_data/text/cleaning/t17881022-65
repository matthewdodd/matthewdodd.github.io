               <p>Did you know this man before? - The way I came to know him was, on Sunday morning pulling out some goods in the Borough, in an entry, I saw a woman telling her complaints, that a man had been taken up for stealing a gun; and I came over to her, and asked her what sort of a man he was; a young man says she; says I, I saw a young man on Saturday night, the 18th, lifting up a gun; says she, come with me; and I was here yesterday and to day, and I have staid without see or reward.</p>

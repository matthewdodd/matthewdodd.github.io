He asked me if I would prosecute, I said I certainly would, we went into a coach, to go to Bow-street, the prisoner began to cry, I desired him not to cry, to behave like a man, he desired me not to prosecute him.

On the 19th a little past twelve, I was going up Holborn, looking out for such characters, I saw the prisoner in company with an old thief I knew, he put his hand in the gentleman's pocket, and slipped the handkerchief out, I saw him take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, I ran across, took the handkerchief out of his hand, and then I sung out to the gentleman.</p>

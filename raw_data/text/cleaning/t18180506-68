About two o'clock in the day he said he was sleepy. I told him he might go and lay down, and if they began to work I would call him. He went down to the fore-scuttle; he could get to the coffee-bags there - They were all safe before he went down. He staid there about half an hour, then came up, and went over the ship to the Berwick, which laid about five ships off. About six o'clock I saw him again coming ashore. Leckey told him to be sure and return by six o'clock in the morning-Leckey was come to relieve him. I noticed to Leckey that his coat pockets knocked against his legs, as if something was in them-Leckey followed him. I had seen the bags all safe half an hour before he went down. The hatches were all locked-no person went down but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LECKEY. On the 20th of April I was extra excise watchman, and was put on board the Bainbridge, which laid opposite Alderman's Wharf. The prisoner and I were to relieve each other - I watched at night and he by day. I first went on board on the 18th; there were 500 bags of coffee on board, which were stowed fore and aft in the main hold. About a quarter before six o'clock I went to relieve the prisoner. In consequence of what Cole said, I followed him through Ratcliff-highway, and saw some coffee drop out of his hat as he walked. His grent-coat pockets were bulky - I overtook him. We went into a public-house together, and I sent for an officer, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060025"></xptr>found coffee in his hat and coat pockets. He begged forgiveness, and said it was his first offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the parlour the room she was to have? - A. No; she then went away, and returned in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100037"></xptr>about half an hour with a small bundle tied up in a silk handkerchief; she went into the parlour and staid there about two hours, she was alone during that time; she then came out to me in the shop, and said, she was going to the White-house, Fetter-lane, to order her boxes to be brought; she told me she should be back in about half an hour, and ordered me to get the tea-kettle boiling against she came back, that she might go to bed; I told her I would; she said, she was very much fatigued with riding in the coach two nights, and wished to go to bed, she went away and never returned after; when she had been gone about an hour, I began to suspect she was a thief, I went into the parlour and began to search to see what I could miss; I found there was my black cloak missing that hung up in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the cloak was hanging up in the parlour when the prisoner was shown into it? - A. Yes, I had hung it up just before she came; I went to the closet, in the same room, and missed a pair of tea-tongs, I had seen them there that day; we had other plate in the closet, but nothing more was missing; I did not see her again till I saw her at Bow-street, which was about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice enough of the person to be sure to know her again? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find either cloak or sugar-tongs again? - A. Yes, I saw them at Bow-street, and swore to them; the cloak was found in prison, but the lace was taken off, and spoiled.</p>

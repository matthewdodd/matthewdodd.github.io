On the 13th of October, I saw the prisoner stand between his stall and mine, about four o'clock in the afternoon - I saw her take up a reticule, and I then saw her put some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260065"></xptr>thing under her shawl - I suspected she had taken the reticule - I went outside the counter, missed it, and told Miss Garratt of it - she was taken in about half an hour.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is the property you sell your own? A. Yes, it is not Mr. Trotter's - there was a woman at my stall; she did not speak to the prisoner - I do not think there was any other person in the room - I do not think the prisoner was called away; she was not taken in that room - there is an officer attends at the front of the building; but this was in the back lower room, called the Dean-street room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it in the state it was? A. Yes, all but a little ticket under the lock, which is not here now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I went there for the purpose of buying a few articles - I took up the reticule, intending to purchase it, having sufficient silver for that purpose; I had scarcely taken it in my hand when a very old acquaintance passed me, and in the anxiety of the moment I passed on with it in my hand - I had passed only a few yards in conversation before I was taken by the officer.</p>

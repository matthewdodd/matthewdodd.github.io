Sir,—You will please hand over to Mr. Joseph Gurney, of 'Joseph Gurney and Co., their bill of 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Francis Bottin and Co., of Nicaragua, on, and accepted by, Coleman and Bottin, Mark-lane, London, which I handed over to you for the purpose of discount; and this is my authority for your so doing. Henry Birch." <hi rend="italic">On the other side of this letter was written as follows</hi>:—"30th July, 1852. Received, of Mr. Isaacs, the bill in question, for 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., left by Mr. Henry Birch for the purpose of discount. Joseph Gurney.")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you took that memorandum of Birch, and the receipt of Gurney, did you at all intend to deliver up the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; they requested me to do so, and I said, "I shall not give up the bill, and I shall give both of you into custody"—an officer was in my office, and I gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250038"></xptr>
               <p>them both into custody—I afterwards learnt where Coleman was, and sent an officer after him—I had previously sent for Coleman to come to my office to receive his bill, but from the place where Birch stated he was waiting he was gone—I intended to give him in charge—I then sent the officer after him and he took him—I know Coleman's handwriting—he is a connection of mine by marriage—his brother married my daughter, unfortunately—I believe this acceptance to the bill of Coleman and Bottin, Mark-lane, to be Coleman's hand writing—the body of the bill I also believe to be in his writing—I cannot speak as to my belief of the signature of the supposed drawers, Francis Bottin and Co.; that is a disguised hand—I cannot form any opinion or belief upon that—I cannot say whether the endorsement is Coleman's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have seen Coleman write, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; I think I first saw Birch about twelve years ago—he has never brought bills to me before, nor anything of the kind—I have had business transactions with him professionally—I never had any trading trans<lb></lb>actions with him—I am not in trade—he has never brought any bills to me before—he never sold me any bills, nothing of the kind—I simply knew him professionally, about twelve years ago—for the last five or six years I had not seen him or heard of him, until the day he brought this bill—I never in<lb></lb>tended to discount this bill; upon his asking 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, I felt satisfied there was something wrong, and I took these steps for the purpose of detecting the wrongdoer—Coleman and I have not had any quarrel whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say to Birch at the time you gave him into custody, or about that time, that you did not care about him and Gurney, all you wanted was to transport Coleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no recollection of ever saying anything of the kind; to the best of my memory I never said so—I cannot say whether I could have said such a thing and forgotten it—I never remember any such conversation—my belief is, I did not say so—I am upon my oath—my im<lb></lb>pression strongly is, that I never made use of language to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said repeatedly, since the charge was made, that Coleman would be transported, and that at last you should convict him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no feeling about it, except to do my duty—I never said that I would manage to convict him—I have no feeling whatever on the subject, beyond doing my fair duty and giving my evidence as the facts occurred—I could not have said that Coleman would be transported, and I should be glad of it—I never have said so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it ever happened to you to have any other forged bills in your possession, or bills alleged to be forged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my recollection; I swear I never had a forged bill in my possession before—when I say that, I mean, of course, as far as my knowledge went—if a bill was passed and paid, I knew nothing of it—I do not know the names of Messrs. Armitage, of Huddersfield—I never heard of their names before in any way—I have no ill feeling whatever towards Coleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not complained that he gave information about your posses<lb></lb>sion of some brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly complained of the villanous misrepresentations; I have had some brandy warrants in my possession to the value, as far as my memory carries me, of about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold some brandy warrants to Messrs. Hart and Co.—that must have been eight or nine months ago—I never heard that Mr. Sturm and myself were to be indicted for conspiracy for obtaining those brandy warrants—I heard the impudent insinuation indirectly—I did not offer to give a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle the matter. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">proposed to put the witness's deposition into his hand, and then to ask him whether he would venture to swear that he had never made the offer referred to.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is he attorney for Messrs. Hooper, the wine merchants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he was not the attorney, but the personal friend—I was invited there by Mr. Hunter about the brandy warrants, and I went there in consequence of the invite—I went there twice—I swear most positively that during those inter<lb></lb>views with Mr. Brough I never offered money or bills to settle the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you went to Mr. Brough's office, had you heard "the impudent insinuation" that Messrs. Hooper and Son were going to indict you and Mr. Sturm for conspiring to get these brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cer<lb></lb>tainly not; I swear that—the prisoner Coleman did not state, in Mr. Brough's office, that I and Sturm had conspired by fraud to get those warrants; I will swear that—Coleman made no charge at all against me; certainly not of fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your interview with Mr. Brough, will you swear that you never heard at all of any indictment or proceedings against you for fraud of some kind or other, about these brandy warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Brough told me they insinuated it, and he repudiated it most strongly, knowing I could not be guilty of such a thing—that was his statement to me after they were gone—Mr. Brough has known me for forty years, and he made that declaration to me—I have been to Mr. Brough's twenty times—I will explain how I came to go there about these brandy warrants; Mr. Brough requested me to endeavour to get Sturm to remove an attachment that he had lodged against the goods of Hooper and Co.—it had nothing to do with the brandy warrants—I certainly never had any conversation with Mr. Brough about the warrants, or about settling it, or anything of the kind—he applied to me to speak to Sturm to remove the attachment that was lodged against Hooper and Co.'s goods, and stating to me how much he had lost by Coleman, or something to that effect, and I did, in consequence of Mr. Brough's solicitations, do all I could to render service to his friends—I had never sold brandy warrants before, and I should not have had anything to do with those; it was my son-in-law that induced me, unfortunately—no bills alleged to have been stolen have ever been traced into my possession; it is all invention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there is no truth whatever, I suppose, in the suggestion that Louis Napoleon's bills were found in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> How do you mean, found in my possession? my own property, that I gave the money for, and he paid it when due? it is not a fact that two bills alleged to have been stolen from Louis Napoleon were traced to my possession; I swear that most positively; it is all invention—some parties were tried here in reference to those two bills—I was here, and instructed by Louis Napoleon to assist his prosecution—I swear that I was instructed by Louis Napoleon—I was not acting as his attorney; Messrs. Lawford were his attorneys, and Messrs. Bush and Mullens prosecuted for him; but I aided Louis Napoleon, at his request, and was paid for it by his attorney—those two bills had not been negotiated by me—the bill I had of Louis Napoleon's was paid when due—I was a holder of one bill of his for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was regularly paid when due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You unfortunately had a charge made against you some years ago, I believe, but the parties never appeared against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not true; I am not bound to answer whether I was ever charged with any offence, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250040"></xptr>
               <p>I will do so; between forty and fifty years ago I was indicted for perjury; the attempt was to extort money from me; I was tried for it, and, of course acquitted; and I prosecuted the parties, and punished them—no other charge has ever been made against me, without it was behind my back; I do not know what you are talking about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has any other charge been made against you; you seem to answer "No" rather faintly; has any other charge been actually made against you, of fraud, or anything of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have no doubt about it; I mean distinctly to tell you that by "No" I mean no—my Lord, am I to be thus treated; it is really very painful—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CAREWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">thought it would be introducing an inconvenient extension of cross-examination if a general question of this sort were put, without pointing it to something.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides being an attorney, I believe you are a bill-discounter as well; we understand that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, indeed; you understand very wrong, if you have been told that—I have done such a thing occasionally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Niessen and Parker, engravers, at 43, Mark-lane. I know the plate from which this bill of exchange was taken—I received orders for engraving that plate—to the best of my belief, the prisoner Gurney was one of the two who ordered the plate—it was on Thursday, 24th June, I think—they gave the firm of Cole<lb></lb>man and Bottin as the parties from whom the order came—I had not to be printed from the plate—I cannot say whether they were delivered at the counter, or at the offices in Mark-lane, but they were delivered—I know the paper upon which this bill is printed—it has been in our possession—I selected the paper upon which the bills were to be printed, and this is a portion of it—the name of our firm is not on the bill—we generally put our name, unless ordered to the contrary—the gentlemen who gave this order directed that the name of the engraver in the imprint should be left out—our name was engraved upon the plate, and I ordered it to be erased in consequence of the orders I received from the parties—I know Coleman by his being introduced to our shop a day or two afterwards as Mr. Coleman, of the firm of Coleman and Bottin—he was introduced by another man, who I have not seen in custody—he called on the 28th to see a proof of the plate—I cannot say for certain whether I showed him one—here-quested six copies to be sent on immediately, and the rest were forwarded on the Monday evening—I cannot say whether the six first were sent, or delivered over the counter—I have seen Coleman in Mark-lane once or twice since 28th June—I went to the address given me to get paid the balance for the plate—I saw a clerk in the office—I do not recollect seeing either of the prisoners there—I was not paid anything on that occasion—we were paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account a day or two afterwards by a man who is not in custody—when the order was first given I showed them different samples of paper, and the one they chose had the maker's name, Turner, in the water mark, and that they requested to be left out of the bill—when the paper was cut up into the shape of bills, that mark would appear in about one in ten.</p>

On 24th July I saw a person of the name of Birch at our office; he produced a paper to me—I cannot swear positively whether he produced this identical bill, or a copy, I rather think it was a copy—it was of the same amount as this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and precisely in the same terms—I did not entertain it in consequence of the names not standing in the "Directory."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Enfield, and keep a small cottage there. On Monday, the 4th of August, I left Enfield by the morning coach, about a quarter after nine o'clock—I knew the prisoner by sight at that time, and knew his sister was living at a short distance from my house—I saw her in front of the house, carrying some water, when I left my house that rooming—I gave her some directions in case my bell should be rang—I returned about ten minutes or a quarter after eight o'clock—I went into the house by the front door, which was all safe as I had left it—there is a door at the top of the stairs leading to the kitchen—I had left that shut, and found it wide open—I got a light immediately, and examined the premises—I found a cupboard door, which was closed in the morning, wide open—I missed a pair of trowsers from a clothes horse—I went into the bed-room, and found a screw-driver—I know the prisoner's father—he is a carrier from Enfield, and I frequently employ him—when I saw the screw-driver I knew I had seen it within six or seven weeks before—there was a box and portmanteau in the bedroom—I missed from them two dresses, a silk shawl, an apron, four pairs of gloves, six pairs of stockings, two handkerchiefs, and a waistcoat; also a cloak from the parlour, and a fur tippet—I examined the house, and found the kitchen window had been broken—I compared the screw-rdiver with the putty, and found it had been cut with the screw-driver outside, and nearly a whole square of glass taken out—that window was quite whole when I went out—I compared the screw-driver with the impressions, and they corresponded—that would enable a person to unfasten the window, and get in with the greatest ease—I gave information to Mead the constable directly—on Sunday, the 10th of September, I accompanied him and another officer to Harlow Bush Fair in Essex, and to the booth of Thomas Stevens—in consequence of a conversation between Stevens and Watkins, Stevens produced a bundle containing most of my articles, and gave an account of how he became possessed of them—the property lost is decidedly worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the least—the cloak is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the silk dress 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., (it is quite new,) and the fur tippet 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were the articles I lost—I had seen them the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I attend fairs with a drinking booth. My father lives at Barking, and keeps the large booth called the Crown and Anchor—on Tuesday morning, the 5th of September, the prisoner came to my marquee at Southgate, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and wanted to borrow 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—I said, "Not without security for it"—he produced a bundle from under his arm, put it on the ground, and said, "I have got a bundle which belongs to my sister"—he put it down, and I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knew that he had a sister, and that she had some money recently left her—I advanced him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this property—I opened the bundle—he said if he brought the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. again he must have the bundle, and if he did not, I was to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, and keep it—I heard nothing more of him till the prosecutor came to my booth at Harlow Bush Fair, to ask if I had any property belonging to the prisoner—I said I had, and produced it—I delivered it up, and attended before the Magistrate—I had only known the prisoner about a week—I knew he worked at my uncle's before that, but I had not seen him myself, and did not know his person—I have seen him working for my uncle at Epsom races in May—that was the beginning of my acquaintance with him.</p>

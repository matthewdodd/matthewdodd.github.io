               <p>Q. Is that work-shop a part of your dwelling-house? - A. No, it is not under the same roof; there is a little bit of a yard between, of about eight feet, more or less, or it may be ten feet; the dwelling-house fronts Worship-street, and we pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040017"></xptr>through the dwelling-house into this small yard, and then there is a wash-house, and the work-shop is over that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten it the night before? - A. No, my son did, he is not here; the back door of the shop had been opened, and the fastening thrown upon the ground, the window appeared to be just the same as usual. About ten o'clock in the morning, I missed two pair of shoes; I did not miss any thing else till I saw the planes at the office; and seeing a bag on the table, I thought I saw the toes of my shoes through the bag, there were eleven planes, a saw, and two pair of shoes in the bag; they were all mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had this apprentice of your's been the night before? - A. He had left me a year and a half; I cancelled the indentures before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the planes and the saw before? - A. I cannot positively say; I might have used them the day before, or perhaps not for two or three days; I had seen the shoes the day before, I hung them up myself.</p>

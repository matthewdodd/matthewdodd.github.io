            . I was servant to Mr Offare at Chelsea, I drove him in his own coach to the play: as I was in Prince's street with the coach, about ten o'clock at night the two coats mentioned in the indictment were in the coach, and the door shut. I was standing fronting the horses heads, the prisoner had got his body in the coach, on the off-side, and had got the two coats in his arms, but in pulling the coach-door open he moved the coach a little. I went up to him, he did not see me; as he had the coats in his arms, I took him by the collar, and called out for help; he dropped the coats in the dirt, we carried him and the coats to Mr. Fielding, and charged him with taking them.</p>


               <p>Q. What did he say for himself?</p>
               <p>Lavington. He said he knew nothing of the coats; one of them belongs to Mr. Offare, the other is the footman's.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and was near the coach that was robb'd. I saw the coats laying on the ground after Mr. Lavington had taken hold of the prisoner; one coat was the footman's, and the other his master's; they are both the property of the gentleman; had the footman had his coat two years it would have been his own, but he had not had it the time.</p>

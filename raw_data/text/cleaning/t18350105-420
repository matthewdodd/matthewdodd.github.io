                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Queen-street, Seven Dials. I am servant of the landlady of the house—my mistress is unable to attend from illness—she is keeping her bed—I know a woman named Cave—I let a room to her—I never saw Watson there—she has run away now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Watson's father, who lives at No. 41, Broad-street, Golden-square, and is a tailor. I saw the prisoner there all day on Sunday, the 14th of December—he was not absent more than two or three minutes all the morning, which was about one o'clock—he had nothing on but his slippers, and he went to the door for some beer—I saw him come back—he was not absent more than five minutes—he was at home all that day—he never went out of the place—he went out on Mon<lb></lb>day morning, and we did not see him afterwards—I did not go before the magistrate, because we did not know any thing about it.</p>

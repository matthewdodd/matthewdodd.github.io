               <p>19th of April I had three brown-paper parcels on my truck, which I was drawing up the yard of the Greyhound, public-house, in King-street, Smithfield, and in less than two minutes one parcel was taken from the truck—I proceeded down the yard in search of the parcel—I met the wit<lb></lb>ness Ingham and asked him something, and went after the things, but have never found them—the witness pointed out the prisoner to me in about two minutes after I had lost the parcel, and I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a straw-hat manufacturer, and live in Welling<lb></lb>ton-street, Goswell-street. I was walking down King-street, Smithfield, and saw the prisoner coming out of the Greyhound yard with a brown-paper parcel under his arm—I saw him pass it over to another man who was waiting at the corner—he wrapped it up in a blue baize wrapper, and they walked across the road together—they saw that I was noticing them—I crossed the road—Buck came out of the yard—I gave him information—I am positive the prisoner is the person that took the parcel, I noticed him so particularly.</p>

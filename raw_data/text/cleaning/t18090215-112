            . I am a shipwright, I lodged at the Britannia at this time, and the prisoner lodged there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day laid in the indictment any thing attracting your notice respecting the prisoner - A. Yes; when I came down at half past six, before it was light, as I went along the passage to get into the back yard, I found the bar door open, I heard a rumbling noise in the kitchen; I went down as far as the kitchen door, I found that door open; I said to the prisoner, Tom, is that you; he said yes. I went out backward where I wanted to go to, and when I came back the bar door was shut to. That is all I know. I went out to work, when I came home at breakfast time I told the prosecutor of it.</p>
               <p>MR. LITTLEPAGE. I am a headborough. On the same evening I went to the Britannia, I took charge of the prisoner about a quarter past eight at night; Mrs. Foster told me that he had been robbing them for six or seven months, of what she had been working hard for; he said indeed he had not, it was all his own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150056"></xptr>property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's box - A. Yes; after I had taken him to the watchhouse; I found in his box, it was unlocked, twenty five one pound notes, twenty two guineas, twenty seven seven shilling pieces, four shillings, fifty four new halfpence and penny-pieces, and sixty three new farthings; there was a canteen of rum, a broken glass with bitters in it, two twopenny loaves, a shirt marked Foster, the name in full length, a new neckcloth with G F on it, a pair of stockings, and a pair of pantalooons, with a rule in one of the pockets; they are all here in the box.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Is that the box in which you found the things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q In what state did you leave the bar the over night when you went to bed - A. It was fastened in the state that it usually was, I fastened it with two buttons.</p>

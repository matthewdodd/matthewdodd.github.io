                  </hi>. I live in Worcester-street, Southwark. On the 30th of Sept. the prisoner came and told me he was come from Ireland; and that his name was the Rev. Mr. Kavanagh—he asked me for money for building a chapel at Ballycanoe, in the county of Wexford—I told him we had a great many impostors coming from Ireland, I hoped he was not one—he said, "I hope you don't accuse me of being one; I am Catholic priest of Ballycanoe"—believing him to be the priest of Ballycanoe, and that he came from Ireland, I gave him half-a-sovereign, which he entered in his book—he had a man with him—who he said was a guide to show him about—I have since found out that he came from Liverpool.</p>

Mr. Ka<lb></lb>vanagh—I went down, and said, "I cannot speak to you now, you must call another day"—he did come, and represented himself as the Rev. Mr. Ka<lb></lb>vanagh, from Ireland; and that he was making a collection for a Catholic chapel—I gave him this piece of paper, and he wrote, "Ballycanoe, six<lb></lb>teen miles from Wexford," and signed his name, "Henry Kavanagh"—I gave him a half-sovereign—I asked him several questions, where his cre<lb></lb>dentials were—he said ho had none, as his funds were exhausted; he had no credentials from the Catholic Bishop of London, or from the Bishop of Bir<lb></lb>mingham, where he had been.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Roman Catholic clergyman, and am priest of the parish of Ballycanoe.

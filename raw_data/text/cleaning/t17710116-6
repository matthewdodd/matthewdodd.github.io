My master and I took her into a room, and talked to her; then we sent for the justice; at last she owned that she would tell the cook where it was: the justice came:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160019"></xptr> after that she said she would tell the cook presently what she had done with the money: she sent the cook to fetch it; it was behind some dishes in the cellar, the cook went and fetched it: she asked the cook to lend her three pounds three shillings, and then she would tell the cook where it was, and fetch it. She brought three guineas, the other was changed. The pieces I lost were guineas; the justice committed her.</p>

            . I lived at the White Horse as cook, the justice ordered me to strip her. I pressed her to tell me where the money was when I went into the room to her. She said she would tell me presently. She asked me to lend her three pounds three shillings to make it up. I told her I had no money in my pocket, I went to the cellar head, and the justice of peace took it from me: I saw three guineas, but I don't know what there was more; she had lived at our house half a year: she was under me; she always behaved very well before this time.</p>

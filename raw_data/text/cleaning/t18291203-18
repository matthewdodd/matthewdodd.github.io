On the 9th of November I was called into my shop to a customer, and while engaged with him I heard somebody say, "Mr. Swift, you are robbed - if you come out we shall catch the person;" I instantly ran out, and he pointed out the prisoner, who ran a few yards, and then began to walk; the young man laid hold of him - he gave himself a twist, got from him, and ran away; I followed, calling Stop thief! but not overtaking him I returned, having left nobody in the shop - he was brought in in about five minutes; this coat hung inside the shop, near the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOUTLE. I was in the Minories, and saw the prisoner go to Mr. Swift's door, and take a coat, which he gave to two others, who were standing there; I ran, and snatched the coat from the man, and threw it into the shop, then ran after the prisoner, till I caught hold of him. brought him back - I am certain he is the man who took the coat from the shop; since he has been in custody I have been attacked by the other two, and had several severe blows - I should know one of them again; they stood looking in at the window when he took it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent to bring the prisoner from Ireland; I found her there in Bridewell; there was a sovereign found on her, which I exchanged, to redeem a shawl and a ring, which she had pledged. I told her what I took her for, and she said she was quite innocent, and knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) Mrs. Landigan persuaded me to stay there, and have a Sunday's spree - Casey, his wife, and two or three more were there; we drank six pots of beer; Casey brought four of his lodgers in, and four more gallons were fetched; the men began to take liberties with me, and I left the house; my brother persuaded me to return to Ireland before the bad weather set in, and I went.</p>
               <p>COURT to JUDITH CASEY. Q. Is it true that you were all drunk? A. I was never drunk yet; my husband did not bring one man in - the witness' husband was there, with two more men; the prisoner asked me to drink the beer, to suckle my child; I tasted it twice while I was waiting for my husband. Mrs. Landigan was sober - there were three men, and they brought in two half-gallons of beer - when they had drank that, they had a pot a piece; the prisoner drank with us.</p>

            . I live at Stoke Newington. On the 15th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I was passing through the Shepherd and Sheperdess-fields, Islington; a young man in a sailor's dress got into conversation with me about the weather, till I came to the beginning of the fields, and there four or six boys stood by the post, they followed me very close, the sailor kept in my company, and left me at the foot of the bridge, and when I came to the top of the bridge, a young man ran after me, and said my pocket was picked. I immediately missed my handkerchief, turned round, and saw the prisoner, and another of the gang in custody, about fifty yards off. My handkerchief was produced.</p>

            . I am a florist. I was in my garden looking over the fence, and saw the prisoner and three or four boys close behind Mr. Dinn, a sailor was talking to him. I saw one of the four boys take a handkerchief from him. I ran and informed him, and laid hold of the prisoner and another of them, and gave them up to Mr. Dinn, one of the others had thrown the handkerchief over the paling. I got over and returned it to Dinn.</p>

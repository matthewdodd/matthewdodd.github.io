            . I live at Sudbury. On the 21st of February I sent a side of pork to London, weighing more then 30 lbs; it was directed to Mr. Aylwoods, Whitechapel - it was in a cloth; I sent it in Mr. Abbet's waggon.</p>

I recollect the pork coming up directed to Mr. Aylwood's - it was drawn into Irish-court from the shop window, and something taken from it, but we did not know what till we sent for Mr. Golding; I had seen the prisoner loitering about when I delivered the pack at the shop - we went after him, and found him in half an hour; the meat was afterwards found.</p>

I took charge of this package, and am answerable for it; about three o'clock in the morning I sent Seakins to unload for Mr. Aylwood - he then told me one package was missing; we got a light to find it - we found it had been opened, and something taken out; the officer afterwards came and asked if we had lost any meat; the package contained a side of veal, some bacon, and a side of pork - the pork was gone.</p>

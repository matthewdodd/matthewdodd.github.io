On the 18th of June, of a Tuesday, in consequence of an information, I took the prisoner York, into custody in Saunders's gardens, Kingsland-road; I took him in custody, and I took him to the office, the prosecutrix appeared against him, and he was committed for further examination. Some few days afterwards he was brought up and committed again for further examination, the goods not being then found; when he came up for the third examination, I found out where the father of the prisoner Jennings lived, and I found her near Gun-street; and in consequence of her directions I found some property at Mr. Cotton's, a pawnbroker, in Shoreditch, and at Mr. Francis's a pawnbroker in Shoreditch; Armstrong and I went to Mitchell's first with a search-warrant; I saw Armstrong find this pillow, and this glass (produces them); they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>York's defence. I have used the sea the greatest part of my life, and upon my return home last September in the Glatton, I came on shore among my friends, at the Three Neats Tongues, in Shoreditch; a man that draws beer there asked me if I wanted a girl, and he brought me this young woman; she took me to this room, and I staid there with her a day or two, till my money was expended, and I was backwards and forwards with this young woman several times, and then I left her; the prosecutor wanted me to give her three guineas, and Harper said I had better give her the three guineas, or it would be worse for me, and I should be in jail so long.</p>
               <p>Jennings's defence. I have lived with this man above twelve months; I was on board a ship with him and he used me very ill and I left him, and he came back and said, if I would live with him he would not use me so any more, and he used me very ill indeed; he took out a knife and swore he would stab me if I did not take these things away; I told him they were not ours, and he must not, but he wrapped the sheets round his body and took them away with him.</p>
               <p>Harper. As to making up the business with the prosecutor, I deny it upon my oath.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jennings, called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

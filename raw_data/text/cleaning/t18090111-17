On the 15th of December, about seven in the evening, I heard a noise in the apartment that is getting ready for a coffee room, where the carpenters had left work; I went to the side door of the coffee room, I asked whether any body was there in that room; the carpenters had not left the key of that room; I could get no answer; on my speaking I heard somebody fall over some deals. The door is a sash door, not glazed, the carpenter had nailed a board across inside, that nobody should get inside; it is a side door to the coffee room, that communicates to the yard; I saw the board up; it was up for security, to prevent people from getting in through the sash. When I heard the noise of some person falling over the deals I immediately put my back to the door and burst it open, and called for a light; when I came into the room, there is a place erecting for a bar, I found the prisoner lying on his back with all the smaller part of the tools about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the tools left by the workmen - A. Yes, they always left their tools there; the large saw and small saw and large plane, I found lying by the door, laying where the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you observed the board that was on the sash - A. I observed that as soon as I put my hand against the door it laid by the side of the door; there was an oil stone, a gouge, and many other articles that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110017"></xptr>I do not know the name of, as I am not a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these within the bar where the man was lying - A. Close to him, about his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen in what part of the house these tools were left when the men went - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any other of the articles - A. There was a flannel jacket and a two foot rule.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner when you found him - A. Yes; I asked him how he came there; he gave me a good deal of abuse, he pretended to be very much intoxicated in liquor, I could not get a reasonable answer for a long while; there was a pair of folding doors, I found them fast; I noticed it particularly; the sash of the front was not glazed, no more than them at the back; it was nine foot from the pavement to get at them; there were no steps erected.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body have got up to that height - were the sashes large enough to creep through - A. Yes, I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body had got there, was there any thing to interrupt their passage, from where you found the prisoner - A. No; they could come to the side door on coming through the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other place where there was a possibility of any person coming in without breaking - A. No; there were two sashes backwards; they were both fastened, I examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person to whom these tools belonged - A. Yes, to

               <p>Q. In what part of the room did you leave the tools - A. I left the tools in one corner of the room; it is a coffee room, parted off with benches for gentlemen, where we were working; I put some on the seats of the box and some on my work bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of these tools left by the back door - A. No, quite the contrary; I left them twenty seven feet from the back door where I found them in the morning.</p>

Yes, about a quarter after seven; I found this large saw and the planes at the entrance of the back door, the planes of one side and the saws of the other side of the passage; I found the others in the part that is parted off for the bar; the large plane was twenty seven feet removed from where I left it, going the nighest way, and the smaller tools twelve feet off; the key of the back door I gave to my partner

Coming along there the cellar is quite open; I happened to stumble; there I lay till one of the labouring men came up and said you had better go and lay among the shavings; I laid there till Mr. Parker came; his wife alarmed him first; they cannot say that I ever removed any of the tools.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You had not observed any thing about the door with the sash in it from between five and six o'clock, and the time you received the alarm - A. No, it was impossible, because it was dark. I generally tried the other door with my hand when the carpenters had done work. I dare say I had that night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am a labouring man, and all the summer I had very good employment; I had a good situation while the fleets were in; I had one pound, two shillings, and sixpence a week, I worked but eight hours in a day, at the West India Docks. I had it in my power to save half a guinea a week, and sometimes seven shillings. When I could not get no more employ in the docks, I applied to the board of ordinance. I wanted to save a few pounds to go to my mother's, and on my being informed I could not work above another week at the ordinance, I applied to Mr. Piper. On the Friday morning I came to his yard; I was not in his house, only when I came to ask for employment. On the beginning of the week I did call, and was sent down to the yard; it is two streets beyond Mr. Pipe's dwelling house; I came in my shirt sleeves from the Tower. Mr. Piper told me I might go to work immediately; I went back to the Tower and worked till dinner time; I told my foreman I had got work of my former master; he told me I might go and he would pay me; after dinner time I went to Mr. Piper's and was set to work, and in unloading of stones I hurt my back, and worked no more that day. - I was not near the premises since. On the Saturday I went to the Tower to my old shopmates; I had a little porter with them. I went home to my old lodgings, to one of Mr. Piper's men; I came to the Seven Stars, Pepper alley: Sculley came, I said I should like to have some beer as it is Saturday night; I called for a pot of beer and did not pay for it; I went to the chandler's shop at the corner for some bread and cheese, and when I came back Sculley was gone. Coming up Fenchurch street on Sunday I found a five pounds note: I changed it, and had three one pound notes part in change. I saw Mr. Piper's man, he told me Mr. Piper had been enquiring for me; I was going to Bear Quay. The rest of the money was my own.</p>

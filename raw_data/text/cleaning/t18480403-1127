                  </hi> I am an ironmonger, in partnership with Mr. Bur<lb></lb>bidge, at 130, Fleet-street. On 26th Feb. I went to the station, and saw a quantity of goods, part of which were mine—the first thing I took hold of had "Slack and Son, Cheapside," on it—I had articles from the on my premises—we had a porter named Cantrill in our employ—he was taken, and has been convicted to-day in the Third Court—I went to the prisoner's shop, and saw a quantity of property—here are eighty-seven metal cocks, three tea<lb></lb>pots, two coffee-pots, and other things—they are new—they are mine—the cost price would be 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

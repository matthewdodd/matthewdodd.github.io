             sworn. Examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. You are a constable of the parish of St. Clements. - A. Yes; on Wednesday the 17th of September, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar going up Clement's-lane, towards Clare Market; he had a hod on his shoulder, covered over with a brown jacket; it had a suspicious appearance, I followed him to an old iron shop in the same lane, I saw him go in, and he shut the door, I found the door was fast, I had suspicion of the house, and knowing the way of the house, I went to the back window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps it. - A. That I do not know; I there saw him take the hod off his shoulder, and shot the jacket and the lead out, the lead now produced in court is the lead that he shot out of the hod from his shoulder; I took the man and the lead too.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the shop. - A. Yes, I asked the man what he had got there, he told me that he had nothing, I told him that I had suspicion of that house a long while, and that was the lead that he had on his shoulder, and I remarked it; he said he wished me to hush it up, or else he should be transported, and he would give me his weeks wages; I told him it was of no use offering me any thing, he must go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this lead afterwards fitted to any part of the New Inn. - A. I fitted it myself to the ridge of the roof of No. <placeName id="t18060917-146-crimeloc801">5, New Inn</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it was cut from there - A. It was the whole that was cut from there.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you gave notice to the porter. - A. Yes, there is five nail holes on the ridge of the roof, he had got the nails out first, and then he tore it away; the nail holes in the lead matched the nail holes in the timber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the man was in the employ there. - A. I am sure he was not in employ there, he was a bricklayer's labourer in that neighbourhood.</p>

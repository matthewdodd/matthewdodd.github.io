On Thursday morning, the 20th of December, I missed some lead from the gutters, which I had seen safe two days before; part of it was afterwards produced - I could not match it, as the rest was gone; I know it by my own dressing, as I am my own plumber - here are marks which I put on it about six months ago, when I put it down on the gutter of Nos. 5 and 7, in the street - I lost lead from other gutters before, but it was older than this - I am certain this belongs to No. 5 or 7, and I saw it safe two days before; the mark on the lead of the other houses is quite different.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this the lead of a whole gutter? A. No, only part of it - it has been cut in pieces; I marked the other in a different place.</p>

            . I was selling fruit at the corner of Haggerston-lane - the back of these houses come down to this lane. On the 20th of December, Mr.Lynn asked if I had seen any body with lead - I said No; but about half past six o'clock, I saw a young man loaded with lead - I ran over to the public-house; but he had got down a back street; I should know him by his clothes - In about an hour, I saw the prisoner come with some lead - I ran to the public-house, and the witnesses came and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you were a witness here? A. I never was a witness; I was here, but did not do the misdemeanor; I was brought here about some beef, and imprisoned six months - I was tipsy.</p>

            . I am an officer, and received the lead from the witnesses, and I told the witnesses if they saw the prisoner to take him, and a night or two after, I went with them and took him - I went to the houses, and could not match the lead except by the width of the gutters which seemed to match.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you see footsteps on the ground? A. Yes; I took the prisoner's shoes off, but did not match them, as I was informed he had got a new pair; the marks were of a shoe with part of the heel worn off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutor speak to you? A. He did, outside the office; he told me to be confident to the lead, and not swear to the wrong lead, as there was other lead about; the magistrate reprimanded him for speaking to me - Beasley was present, but he had sworn to it before he spoke to me - I told the magistrate I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

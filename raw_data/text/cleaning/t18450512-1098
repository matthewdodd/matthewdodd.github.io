                  </hi>. I am assistant to an ironmonger. On the 1st of May, I was in Crown-court, Seething-lane, and had my handkerchief ex<lb></lb>tracted from my pocket—I received a violent push behind—I turned and saw my handkerchief on the ground, and the policeman struggling with the prisoner—this is it.</p>

I saw the prisoner, with two others, following a mob of sweeps, and trying several pockets—I followed them to this Court—I then saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Duf<lb></lb>field, and one who has escaped drew Mr. Duffield's handkerchief half out of his pocket—the prisoner then took hold of it and drew it quite out—I seized them both.</p>

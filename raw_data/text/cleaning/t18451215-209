                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Leigh-street, Red Lion-square; I am a newsvender, and am also employed as a workman at the Mint. I know Mr. Rentoul; he is a moneyer of the Mint—he called on me on Sunday, the 24th of Aug., at my house, and requested me to look out for a lodging for a foreigner, who wanted them; in consequence of which I saw Mrs. Naylor, of No. 34, Gloucester-street, Queen-square—I afterwards saw the prisoner Bull at Anderton's Hotel—I took him to Mrs. Naylor's house, and arranged for him to lodge there—I think he was to pay 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I saw him there on the Sunday following, the 31st of Aug.—he spoke broken English—I managed to understand him with great difficulty—he said he wanted a frame or some paper made, about 2000 sheets, and asked me to get it for him, and gave me a pattern for the colour—it was red—it was like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at part of a genuine Norwegian note, marked No.</hi> 1)—he at the same time showed me the piece of white paper produced (No. 15)—he wanted me to get this sort of paper with the word "Lottery" on it—it was to be this colour and these marks—I understood him it was to be a frame formed to produce this water-mark—the water-mark was to be like this, but it was to be the colour of the other paper—I cannot swear this is the very paper he showed me, but it is like it—it is a drawing of the water-mark lines, not having a water-mark on it—I will not swear it is the identical paper, but it closely resembles it—when he gave mo the order about it I did not exactly under<lb></lb>stand him, and asked whether all these lines were to be in the water-mark, as was in the paper—he said it was to be very exact—I pointed to the wordsin German text, and he said, "Exactly"—I did not under<lb></lb>stand the words—they are "Norges' Bank"—he said that was his name—there is the word "Lottery" here—it is high up, and might be cut off, if ne<lb></lb>cessary, leaving "Norges' Bank" in this little square—I was to get the paper if I could—I took the drawing of the water-mark, and the coloured paper, to assist me in inquiring about it—at the time I had this conversation with hitn there were drawing materials on his table, and several papers—this was at No. 34, Gloucester-street—I noticed a piece of coloured paper like this</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a situation in the Mint. I was at Stockholm last Aug.—I left there on Thursday, the 14th of Aug., for Lubeck, by a steam boat—the prisoner Bull was a passenger on board—I had some con<lb></lb>versation with him, not much—we talked about painting generally—he said he was going to London to paint a large picture for some gentleman there—he said he had painted a picture for king Oscar—we arrived at Lubeck on Sunday, the 17th—I stopped at Lubeck six or seven hours, and then went on to Hamburgh, where I arrived the same night—I saw Bull at Hamburgh several times—I observed that he had about him some English money and a Norwegian note—the colour of the note was pink—I believe the pink colour ia confined to notes of certain value—in consequence of something that passed between me and a gentleman, I asked Bull if he would like to change his Norwegian money for English money, knowing this gentleman, who waa going to Norway, would change with him—he said no, he would keep it till it returned to his own country—I do not know whether he had only one note—it appeared a small pile—I only saw it in his pocket-book—we left Hamburgh for London by the <hi rend="italic">John Bull</hi> steamer on the Tuesday—Bull was a passenger—we had some conversation on the way on different subject—we talked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184512150038"></xptr>
               <p>about painting—nothing was said about the price of pain ting on that voyage, but between Stockholm and Lubeck we had conversation about bis beings artist—he asked about English manufactures in general, and about paper manufacturing in particular—he said he wanted some paper—he asked if there were any paper-manufacturers in London, that he wanted to get some made for a friend, a young man at Stockholm—I asked him what kind of paper, because he could buy any paper in London without having it made, but lie said he wanted it of a particular colour, with what I understood him to meta a particular water-mark—he asked me if I could recommend him to an hotel—we had a very stormy passage indeed—we were obliged to put back to Cuxhaven once—it was at night, and I only know of once—I saw Bull at hi lodging in Gloucester-street after he came to London—he asked me abotf! getting paper made, if I could tell him where to get it—I had sent the witness Smith to him—he said he had seen Smith, but be could not under<lb></lb>stand what he wished to have done—he said he wanted to have paper made with a particular water-mark—he spoke English—he showed me a piece of white paper with the word "Lottery" on it—it was not either of these (looking at two)—I said I would call on him next day, and take him to some stationers—I did not call, for I was ill, and have not seen him since.</p>

               <p>not keep the lower room still—that was given up—the prisoner Smith was there but two days before he was taken into custody—I remem<lb></lb>ber Mr. Rentoul calling on Bull once or twice—Bull named to me, one morning when he rang his bell, that the witness Smith had not attended on him at his desire, to go about some paper—I knew Smith before—Bull asked me, when I went out, if I would make inquiry where I could get him the paper which he had engaged Smith to get for him, as he did not come to hint, and he seemed to be very fidgetty about the paper—I said I would endeavour to do so—he told me what sort of paper he wanted, and gave me a piece of paper to take with me—it was such a piece as this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it was to be pink—he produced a piece of this colour—I think he produced a piece of pink paper on another piece of paper—I believe it was not fixed on the paper—I took it down to Mr. Newell, and produced it to him—it was like this—(No. 15); knowing the house of Smith, of Long-acre, to be respectable, I went there to make inquiry—they referred me to Saunders, of Cloak-lane, and Wilson of St. Martin's-court—Bull went with me to St. Martin't-court, and to Smith's, of Long-acre—as we went along to Saunders', we saw an iron-wire worker's, named Cato, on Holborn-hill—before I went to Saundens' I returned, and gave the prisoner the card of Wilson, of St. Martin's-court—Smith referred me to Wilson's, and Wilson referred me to Cloak-lane—that was the same day I went to Wilson's—I returned to Bull, and he went with me—when we got to Wilson's, Bull produced this pattern for the water-mark which I have just seen, (No. 15) and the piece of red paper—after putting this into the hands of the gentleman in the shop, who went back to consult his employer, he returned it to Bull, and said they did not make such things, but gave us a reference to Saunders and Co., of Cloak-lane, who, he said, had paper-mills—we then went home, and After dinner, by Bull's request, I accompanied him to Saunders'—on our way we called at Cato's—Bull produced the paper for the water-mark to Cato's man; but he did not seem to understand what Bull said—he said he could not do what was wanted—when we got to Saunders' we saw a gentleman—Bull pro<lb></lb>duced the piece of pink paper to him, and also the other, and said he wanted a paper manufactured in pink like that, and with these lines, showing this piece fdr the colour—I think the word "water-mark" was used—Bull asked what it would come to—the gentleman said he must call again, he could not tell him what it would come to—we left the shop together—I did not go any more—Bull left the two papers with the gentleman—about the lattet end of Sept.' Bull said he expected his friend in England—he afterwards told me he had arrived—I think that was two or three days before the prisoner Smith came—he said he had come from abroad, he did not say where from, and he would be at my lodging in a day or two—I believe Smith called at my house one day before he came to sleep in my house, but I was not at home at the time—he came on Thursday, the 2nd of Oct., and slept that night in the up-stairs room, in the same room with Bull—he came about the middle of the day—Bull came with him—they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Smith had ft portmanteau, a carpet bag, and a hat-box—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the things found hy Forrester at the lodging</hi>)—this black portmanteau is Bull's, and this it his carpet bag and blue hat-box—this other portmanteau, carpet bag, and leather hat-box, are Smith's—soon after Smith's arrival I saw this green dressing-case—one morning after Smith came, Bull came down stairs, and asked me to dry a piece of pink paper by the fire—he brought it from his room—I believe I was in the kitchen when I was called—I went up stairs into the passage—three stairs lead from the passage towards the kitchen—Bull was on the first floor stairs when he called me, but he came down to the ground floor, and I met him at the foot of the stairs, in the passage—I do not think</p>

               <p>High Holborn. On the 15th Sept. last, I received an order from the prisoner Bull to make a block—he gave me a pattern from which I was to make it—the first time he gave it me in pencil—the second time he gave me this pat<lb></lb>tern (No, 16)—that was two or three days after be gave me the first—I did not attempt to make anything till he brought that—the second time he came was on the 15th—he did not care what it was made upon, anything that would make an impression would do—I proposed to him that it should be made on copper—that is the ordinary way—I told him it would be the cheapest way—it would present a difficulty to anybody not acquainted with the print<lb></lb>ing trade to take an impression from it—I explained to him if it was done on copper it would be necessary to have a press, but it would be about half the price—he said he wanted it so that he could press it down himself, and it was agreed to be engraved on brass—I showed him a block of brass something similar to this, and asked him if that was what he meant—it had an Oriental pattern on it—he said that would do very well—the price agreed on was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—he threw down 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted it directly—I told him he could not have it under three weeks—I gave him a receipt for the deposit on one of ray master's cards—this is it (No. 17)—I also wrote on this card the price for which the work was to be done, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when this pat<lb></lb>tern was put into my hand, I was told to be very particular about the number of lines that were to be put—there were to be thirteen lines on the left-hand corner of the note, that is, the right-hand corner of the block—he brought this piece of paper with him (No. 18), and he wrote upon it his name and address in my presence—I did not exactly know whether he said thirteen or thirty lines—I got him to write it down, and he wrote the figures "13"—I did not exactly understand the shading of the border in one particular part, and he made a sketch of it on the paper to make me understand it—it was by means of the sketch that I was able to understand what the border was to be—he made that in my presence—I took particular notice of his writing when he wrote his name and address—I believe the address on this letter, (No. 22) "34, <hi rend="italic">Gloucester-street, Queen-square, Blumsbrey</hi>," to be his hand<lb></lb>writing—he was to call in eight days to see how far we got on with the block—he waited ten days, and then called—that was the 25th Sept.—I showed him the state in which it was—on Tuesday, the 30th Sept., he called again to see the block—he was alone—I showed it him—it was then in a more forward state—he said he must go to Germany, and pressed me to get on with it—I promised it in a day or two—he did not call again until the Fri<lb></lb>day, the 3rd Oct., between two and three in the afternoon—I showed him the block—he seemed to approve of it very much—while he was looking at it I saw him beckoning to a person at the door, which person was looking in at the side window—I did not take particular notice of that person till Bull called him in—it was the prisoner Smith—he came and took the block in his band and looked at it—this is the block, and it was in this state on that occasion—Bull put it into Smith's hands—they both together moved to the door, each of them looked at it very minutely, and Smith nodded his head as if he approved of it, and spoke something in their language—Bull was showing it to him—I promised Bull he should have the block in two or three days.</p>

               <p>"London, Aug. 28, 1845.</p>
               <p>No. 22. "My dear Friend,—At last I have the pleasure to be able to inform thee of my safe arrival at this place, which took place on Sunday evening, by the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">John Bull.</hi> My stay at Hamburgh was only two days, very pleasant. I got thy bill immediately paid. The same man inquired if thou wast, or soon wouldst go to Norway; which I answered; and further there was no more said about it. The voyage from Hamburgh to this place was very stormy. Twice we put to sea, and twice we were compelled to put back to Cuxhaven. We in consequence arrived fifty-two hours later than we should have done. It was only a couple of days after which I really could recover myself, and begin to think upon matters and things, of which I have as yet not much to communi<lb></lb>cate to thee. Nevertheless, I am sure of the result of the case. The drawing for the frame I have worked at for two days. Yesterday I took it to an iron worker, who promised to make it closely after the drawing.</p>
               <p>"It is so precisely measured off that not a hair is wanting thereon. Now I am at work with the drawing for the letters: so soon as it is ready, as well as the stamps, they shall be ordered. Here are plenty of those who make such things when one has only money to pay with; but money must not be spared, then every thing goes. With respect to the paper, I shall no doubt be compelled to go to one of the small manufacturers in one of the minor towns: however, I have found a kind of red paper which is very nearly like. We require only to dissolve it, and put it in the mould. Nevertheless, there is much trouble attending it: at the manufactories they do it immediately. In the meantime I long for and rejoice at, as well as it will be necessary for the progress of the case, that thou without fail comest here as soon as thou canst. Thou must absolutely come, dost thou hear? I have now a private lodging, where my address is No. 34, Gloucester-street, Queen-sq., Blumsbrey.</p>
               <p>"If thou goest to Hull, and thence travellest by the steam-boat, (which is much cheaper than by the steam-carriage,) I will be there to receive thee: thou canst have here a lodging at my landlady's, (a very nice woman,) by the side of me. Thou needest not put up at any hotel, which is so cursedly ex<lb></lb>pensive; only drive immediately here. I have already spoken of it to my landlady. This part of the town is very quiet; no plays, as in the other part of the town. Thou needest no passport, no one will ask thee about it. As yet I have seen nothing here; everything, however, is dear enough, although I live as economically as I can. When thou arrivest, and everything is in order, then first shall I derive pleasure from it. Here it is very dull; and God knows what the Englishmen, in fact, amuse themselves with. They play seldom at cards, billi? as, or any kind of game. I find it terribly dull. I will now hasten to execute what I have in hand, and then leave here again.</p>
               <p>"A young Englishman who was on board the steam-boat has requested me that I would paint him for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If I can get time I will; but, however, not before everything is brought in order. Further I have not to communicate to thee, but request of thee to come hither as soon as possible after the receipt of this. Write when and by what opportunity I may expect thee.</p>
               <p>"Be assured that everything shall go well—that nothing is in the way. Live well in the meantime. Write soon, and be heartily greeted by thy friend,</p>

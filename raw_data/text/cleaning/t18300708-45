The prisoner came to the shop on the 31st of May, and asked the price of a four gallon cast iron tea-boiler - he staid some time, and then went out without buying any thing; I missed some locks from a shelf near which I was working - he had not quitted the shop two minutes; I went and found him with two other men; he had three parcels of locks in his possession -I seized him and another, and said, "Gentlemen, have I caught you?" they struggled and got away, leaving their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080031"></xptr>hats; I pursued, and gave charge of the prisoner - these are the locks; the other man had not been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Are your masters in a large way of business? A. Yes; they both serve in the shop - the prisoner was taken into the back wareroom; I returned to work - he could have taken the locks when my back was towards him, taking the steps to show him the boilers - I was not above four feet from him; there were one hundred bundles of this description - I had seen these three minutes before on a small square shelf by themselves; I know it was full as we went into the wareroom, and as soon as he was gone it was empty; there was no other person in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness came to the door with me; I went to May-fair and he came up - there were two or three men at the corner - one of them had a basket of strawberries; I know no more about them.</p>

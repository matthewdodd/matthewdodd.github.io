            . On the first of December I had been at a merry-making at the sign of St. Andrew's Cross, facing St. Andrew's Church, Holbourn; and coming home I overtook two women at the Royal Bed, the corner of <placeName id="t17531205-22-crimeloc106">Fleet Market</placeName>

I pass'd them about fifty yards, and stopping to make water the prisoner came up to me, and asked me whether I would give her any thing to drink. I asked her for what? she said it was very cold. I put my hand into my pocket; I had but three pence, and gave her three halfpence. She then went up to a publick house in Poplin's Alley, and asked me to go in with her; I did not go in. She came out again and went from me a little while, a minute or thereabouts. I was then going about my business, but presently after heard somebody cry halloo. I stopt and the prisoner came up to me again, and said. What have you got to say to me? Have you a mind to have a touch or no? I said I had got no more than three pence. She said, D - n you, what is that! I said I had got no more. Well come, says she, I'll give you a toss off for that; so I gave it to her; she came fumbling up against me, and with that I directly miss'd my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the watch at that time ?</p>
               <p>Cross. I am sure I had; for just as I came out of the publick house in Holbourn, I look'd to see what it was o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the prisoner put her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Cross. No, I did not feel her take it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Cross. I miss'd it before I parted with her, and charged her with having it. I search'd her and rumbled her about as much as I could, but did not find it; here is a witness that found it. She said she was big with child, and desired I would let her alone. I was going to leave the watch with her, thinking not to be exposed; but the next witness came up and said, Young man, what is the matter? I told him I had lost my watch, and desir'd he would search her. I saw him search her, and saw the watch drop from between her legs, and the glass was broke in the fall.</p>

            . The prosecutor and the two last witnesses came into our watch-house on Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050008"></xptr> night last; he said he had been robb'd of his watch. He produces the watch.</p>

               <p>I was going down the side of Fleet Market, having been drinking, and got a little more in my head than one should have. The prosecutor was standing up making water; he turn'd round, and took he'd on me by the skirt of my gown; he ask'd me to drink a dram. I went and got one, and coming out again he said, Where are you going? He offered me a shilling to be concerned with me, and when all came to all he had not got one; but he said he would give me his watch to hold till he was concern'd with me.</p>

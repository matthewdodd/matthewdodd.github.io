                  </hi>. I am an officer of Southampton. On Tuesday last Mr. Allison came to me—we went on board the steam-boat and found the prisoner—I found on him four sovereigns and a half, a silver watch in a bag, and a new suit of clothes—I asked him how he became possessed of the money—he said, "I took it out of my master's drawer" I asked how much he took—he said, "Eight sovereigns, five half-sove<lb></lb>reigns, and about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver"—I said, "How did you get the money?"—he said, the key was left in the drawer, and he left one sovereign behind—he took me' to a little bazaar at the end of the pier, and said he gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there for the watch—he took me to where he bought the clothes; they were given up and the money returned—Solomon Solomons is the man who sold him the watch, but he refused to give it up—I believe the watch is not worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Atalanta was about to sail for Guernsey—he gave every assistance to try to get the property back, by telling me where he laid out the money.</p>

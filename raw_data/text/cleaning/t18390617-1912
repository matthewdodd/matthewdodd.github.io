                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Went<lb></lb>worth-place, in the hamlet of Mile-end Old town. I locked up my house on Thursday night, the 6th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock—it was quite safe then—I was awoke at four o'clock the next morning by a po<lb></lb>liceman, and found a gimlet on the parlour table—I found the back kitchen shutter had been bored with a gimlet, and a hole made sufficient to enable a person to draw the bolt from the shutter—it was quite open, and the win<lb></lb>dow was open—I found the parlour strewed with goods of various descrip<lb></lb>tion, spoons and forks broken to pieces—I went to the stop, and under the counter found all the drawers emptied—about 160 handkerchiefs were gone entirely, and all the articles stated in the indictment, amounting altogether to between 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have recovered nothing but two handkerchiefs—there were marks of two or three persons having been in the garden—I discovered them that morning at four o'clock, and they were covered over within two hours, not only in my own garden, but the third from us—</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">looking at two handkerchiefs</hi>)—one of these has a particular mark, which I can positively swear to, besides the pattern—the mark is a damage mark—we had all the piece laid by on purpose to have an allowance made on it—the piece is cut in two, one piece has three, and the other four—the piece of four was taken, and there is a corresponding damage mark—I have not a doubt this handkerchief is one of those taken that night—I will swear to it—I was present when some shoes were compared with the footmarks, and they corresponded exactly, heel and every thing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 18.) I met the two prisoners at a quarter to twelve o'clock, on the eight of the 10th of June, in Cock-lane, Shoreditch, in company with two females—on seeing us the women sepa<lb></lb>rated from them—I went over and searched both the prisoners, and said to George, "I will take you to the station-house"—his brother followed us to the station-house, using very abusive language, and obstructing me in taking George—he followed us to the station-house door, and insisted on coming in, and finding we could not get him away, I said, "You must come in, and I will charge you"—I took them for being in the streets for round their necks, apparently new, I said to George, "Where did you get this handkerchief?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Your brother has got one of the same handkerchiefs"—he said, "Yes, I gave it to him, I bought them in Petticoat-lane"—I said, "What did you give for them?"—he said, "7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Did any body see you buy them?"—he said, "No," and that he had bought them about a fortnight ago—I said, "You did not wear these handkerchiefs last week"—he said, "No, I put them in pawn about a fortnight ago, and took them out about nine days ago"—he said he had pawned them at Castle's, in Church-street, Bethnal-green—I made inquiry there, and found he had never pawned a handkerchief of that description—I took the rightshoe off George's foot, and Joseph left, and com<lb></lb>pared George's right shoe with the footmarks in Mr. Norbury's garden-one</p>

               <p>in particular was covered over—I saw my brother officer make an impression close by the side of that, and it corresponded with the mark—I compared both marks with George's shoe, and they corresponded—I did not find any mark to correspond with Joseph's left shoe, but in an adjoining garden I found a mark corresponding with George's left shoe—I could not positively swear to that one, as a portion of it was broken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You first took George into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stopped them both together—I knew George well—I did not know Joseph—I cannot be mistaken in Joseph's person—his shoe did not fit any mark in the garden—there had been a slight rain, but the mark was covered over with oil-cloth and board—I had seen George in a different hat and hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and I noticed this being new, it was unusual—the prisoners were the only persons taken by Teakle and myself—several others were taken and brought to different police offices—there was a person who was originally in Mr. Norbury's employ, taken up—he was discharged after being remanded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 8.)

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

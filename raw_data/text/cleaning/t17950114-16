               <p>Q. Not the prisoner? - I believe not. I told him the second turning would take him into Cheapside; he asked me twice, I repeated to him the same.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to you? - I went to take up my load from the pitching block and I found the bag gone. I was very uneasy about it, but I thought it proper to take the chest to the Spur inn, and so I did.</p>

               <p>I am constable and patrol of Dowgate ward. On the 24th of December, a little before six o'clock at night, I was in Thames-street, I saw the prisoner at the bar with this package on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that been in your custody ever since? - It has; it is in exact the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140031"></xptr>state as when I took it from him. I see him go along Thames-street, there was another man along with him in company, they walked on by the side of each other, I stepped to him, says I, my friend, what have you got here? says he, what do you want to know for? or, what is that to you? I said, I should be glad to know what is was; he said, he believed it was grocery. Says I, you must know what it is; says he, it is grocery, I tell you; says I, where are you going with it? says he, to the Borough. I asked him where he had brought it from? he hesitated a good deal on that: the other man that was in company said to me, what have you got to do with the man? it is my property? says I, pray where had you it from, young man? says the prisoner at the bar, it is not his property, it is mine; I said it was very strange that one should say it was his property, and the other should say it was his property; says I, I insist upon knowing where you brought it from; he said, he brought it from a grocer's in Newgate-street, opposite St. Martin's-le-grand, I cannot recollect the name he mentioned, I told him I was not satisfied, I should be glad if he would go back with me to his master's, where he said he had it from. I then took him to our watch-house, now says I, you shall go with me to your master's in Newgate-street; he said it was no use going there, for he found it in Cheapside; I told him it did not appear that if it had been dropped in the street, as the bag was quite clean and it was a dirty night; then he said he saw it pitched up against a door way, and he took it up; he thought he had as much right to it as another.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he used the word pitched? - He said it stuck up against the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you say whether he used the word pitched or stuck up? - I cannot possibly recollect, he said it was at a door; I then told him I should detain the goods and take him to the compter. I left the goods at the watch-house, and a young man in care of the goods, while I went to the compter, with other assistance, as there were some men came to the watch-house and said they knew something of him; one man that came back to the watch-house was the man that was with him, that said it was his property first, and afterwards denied it; and so I left a young man with the property, left they should take it away while I was gone. When I came back the young man said, I have found a bill of parcels and permit at the top of of the bag, which led to a discovery of the master it belonged to. I knew nothing of that till I came back from the compter. I then went to Mr. Bateman, and informed him of the matter; Mr. Bateman saw the goods the day after Christmas Day, before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Bateman's man saw the goods the same night he lost them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Christmas Eve I was going to see a friend over in the Borough, I was asked to come over and sup with them; I was coming through Bow church-yard, there was another strange young man coming along; I see something laying against the church wall, and he and I goes and looks at it, it was a parcel just by the pump; so says I, here is a parcel here, and he took it up on his back, and carried it a considerable way past Garlick-hill, when I took and carried it till that gentleman stopped me with it. I knew nothing of it till I see it lay up against the church wall in Bow church-yard; that is all I know of it.</p>

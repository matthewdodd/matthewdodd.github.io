            . I am a City Policeman. On the 30th of March, between two and three o'clock, I was near St. Dunstan's church, and saw the prisoners, in company with another, following Mr. Prideaux and a gentleman who was with him; I saw Smith draw the handkerchief from Mr. Prideaux's pocket, and hand it to Waddilove - I immediately crossed over, and seized both of them; Waddilove immediately dropped the handkerchief by his side - I stooped and picked it up; I told a person to call Mr. Prideaux, which he did, and he claimed the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>GEORGE PARTRIDGE. I am an officer. On the 13th of March Mrs. Foster came to me. I went to her house, and took the prisoner in custody. I found the duplicate of a flat iron upon her. There was a boot jack and other things sold at the old iron shop. The people at the iron shop said, they had got nothing; afterwards they came before the Magistrate, and gave them up.</p>

               <p>Q. Of whom did you buy that boot jack and the other things - A. Mrs. Foster came to me; she said, she had lost a candlestick; she said, good God, that is my boot jack out at your door. I said, is that your candlestick; she said, no. She came on the next day, and the same candlestick was on the mantle-piece: dear me, she said, I think that is my candlestick. I said, yesterday you said it was not. I bought it of a man: I believe him to be an honest man. She took the candlestick; she said, she did not mind any thing so much as the cocoa nut-shell. I said, as you are going before the magistrate take it, do not mention my name, it makes such a bother.</p>

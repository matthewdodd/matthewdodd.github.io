               <p>Clerk . Are you guilty or not guilty? - Why can't you Plead?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what you say.</p>
               <p>Court. Let some Body near him tell him his Charge.</p>
               <p>Whitesides (bauling in his Ear) So ho! you are indicted for stealing Stockings! are you guilty or not guilty ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What do you say?</p>
               <p>Court. Show him the Charge in writing, [Then a Paper was shewn him.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can't read.</p>
               <p>Court. Prosecutor, could you make him hear when he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He pretended to be deaf then.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there no Body belonging to Newgate, that knows whether he can hear or not ?</p>
               <p>Whitesides. He could hear sometimes when they baul'd to him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must make him hear now.</p>
               <p>Whitesides, bauling, the Court will make you hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Indeed I am quite deaf.</p>
               <p>Court. If he remains obslinate he must be press'd.</p>
               <p>Whitesides, bauling. The Court says, you must be press'd to Death if you won't hear!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ha!</p>
               <p>Court. Read the Law - Batlet the Executioner first tye his Thumbs.</p>
               <p>[Then the Executioner ty'd his Thumbs together with Whipcord, and with the Assistance of an Officer drew the Knot very hard.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My dear Lord, I am deaf as the Ground.</p>
               <p>Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My sweet, sugar, precious Lord, I am deaf indeed, and have been so these ten Years.</p>
               <p>Executioner. Guilty or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Court. Hold him there a little - Now loosen the Cord, and give him a little Time to consider of it; but let him know what he must expect if he continues obstinate, for the Court will not be trifled with.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Bromfield, at the Woolpack, on the Bridge. The Prisoner and another came into my Master's-Shop, between 8 and 9 in the Morning, and cheapen'd some Stockings; I shew'd them 2 or 3 pair; they bid me Money, but I could not take it, and so they both went out again. I presently heard some Body in the Street say, Friend, you have dropt your Stockings; upon which I went out and seiz'd the Prisoner, and saw the Stockings drop from under his Great-coat; but his Companion got away.</p>

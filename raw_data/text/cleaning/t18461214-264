                  </hi> I am the son of Richard Hampson, who keeps a shop at No. 9, Holborn-hill. On the 27th of Nov. the prisoner came to the shop—he asked to be shown some coloured silk handkerchief for the neck—I looked out some—I cut one off, and he paid for it—he spoke to me as a German—he spoke very little English—I put those handkerchiefs away, and he asked to be shown some black ones—I opened a paper con<lb></lb>taining a number of black ones, but as they were not what I thought would suit, I laid them on one side, and opened another paper—he went away, and soon after he was gone I missed two pieces of black handkerchiefs, one piece contained seven handkerchiefs, and the other five—they have not been found since—no one else had been in the shop after I saw them safe—I opened them before the prisoner—there was one lady came to the door, but not near the counters—no one could have taken them but the prisoner.</p>

I received information from one of our constables—I went after the prisoner—I found him in the Hat and Plough, in Whitechapel—he is a German, and does not speak good English—I took him—he asked me what it was for—I said for stealing two pieces of silk handkerchiefs from a house in Holborn—when he came out he said he could not blame me for doing my duty, but he should like to see the man that saw him take them—I found on him a half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—he said he had no more, but on further search I found a sovereign and a half-sovereign in his fob—I have known him ever since he has been in England.</p>

I found upon Clark a linen cloth and a handkerchief, my property. When she heard Slaughter was taken up she absconded, and went to her mother at Battle Bridge. When I took her up she grumbled, and said, Duncomb had had, at several times, more pieces than she had, and confessed she had received pork and other things of Slaughter at several times after I had made my complaint to Mr. Creech.</p>

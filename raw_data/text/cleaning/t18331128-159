               <p>Dorman's Defence (written). On Friday, the 22nd instant, I left home with 6l. 4s. 6d. in my pocket, and met the prosecutor and some prostitutes at the Golden Ball, Cow-cross or lane. We all drank freely there, and continued drinking together at different houses all day; at length we came to the Hog in Armour, Saffron-hill, all drunk. The prosecutor had been exposing his box all day, and the prisoner fell asleep. The prosecutor was boasting how many men he had sent out of the country, when David Reece said, "We'll, send him out of the country;" and the prisoner was given in charge. The prosecutor said he would not charge the prisoner; he appeared an honest man. The girls of the town were with them all day. The purse was picked up in the street by the boy, and taken into the house. David Rees and the hackney-coachman offered to the prisoner's wife, in the presence of Mr. Parkinson, a baker, if they were paid 5s. a-piece for their time, they would get out of the way; and asked her to keep the boy back.</p>

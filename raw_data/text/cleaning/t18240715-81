On the 29th of June, about half-past five o'clock, in the evening, she went out with me for a walk; she had a pinafore and frock on. I did not see the prisoner till I saw her, with the child in her hand, at the corner of Russel-court. I was looking in at a shop window, and missed the child, and found her again. at Bow-street office about two hours after. About three quarters of an hour after I lost the child, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane with my child's clothes in her hand. I took hold of her and took the clothes away, and asked what she had done with the child? she said she knew nothing about the child. In a few minutes an officer came, and took her by the direction of Mr. Lawrence. I am sure the clothes are what my child had on; she gave no account of how she came by them.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Blackman-street. The prisoner came to my shop about six o'clock, and offered a parcel to my young man in my presence, as soon as he opened it a woman spoke to him, and he jumped over the counter and went to speak to the woman. The prisoner said she wished I would serve her as she had been there some time; I took the frock and pinafore and looked at them, she asked 2 s. for them, I offered her 1 s.; she would not take it - she said she had bought them but a fortnight, and they cost her 4 s. I then gave her the parcel back, and as she went out at the back door, my young man came in at the front door with Mrs. Winch, and told me of this circumstance, I ran out and took her at the corner of Clare-market. Mrs. Winch asked her what she had done with the child? she said she had not seen it.</p>

A man put his hand over my right shoulder and took my watch and seal; the chain was round my neck, and the watch was in the bosom of my pelisse - it was a small gold watch. After he took it, he came before me and I had an opportunity of seeing his features. I am sure it was the prisoner - he was stopped in about twenty minutes in some street in Clerkenwell. He had got out of my sight, I followed him some distance, and he was taken. The watch and seal were produced, and I knew them.</p>

            . I was walking with Mrs. Snook, and I saw the prisoner in the act of taking the watch over Mrs. Snook's shoulder - I saw the chain in his hand. I accompanied Mrs. Snook to Worship-street, and I am sure he is the person that snatched the watch; I did not observe any other person with him.</p>

            . I am a cork-cutter, and live in Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane. I was on the opposite side of the City-road, and saw a person run from the ladies, they called out Stop him! I ran after him, and lost sight of him in his going round a corner. He was stopped in Compton-street, Clerkenwell. I have no doubt he is the person I first saw - the watch was found in the breast of his jacket which he threw to some of his companions - they struck me several times.</p>

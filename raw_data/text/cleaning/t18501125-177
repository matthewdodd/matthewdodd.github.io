                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-place, Brixton-road. On 6th Nov., about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was walking in the Kennington-road, and the prisoner and another boy came running round me two or three times—the third time, I felt something at my coat behind —the witness Craig, who was riding in a cart with my wife, called out to me, and I missed my handkerchief from my right-hand coat-pocket—I had had it in my hand not five minutes before, and had put it into that pocket—my coat-lap was torn or cut nearly through—I ran after the prisoner, and saw him in Frederick's-place, about ten yards from where I had seen him first—he had my handkerchief in his hand—I caught hold of him just as he was going into a house in Frederick's-place, and struck him on the side of the head, and he threw the handkerchief down at my feet, and ran into the house—I called, "Police!"—a policeman came directly, and after some time we got admission—I gave him into custody, with the handkerchief—we found him just inside the door, with another boy.</p>

On the 5th of April, at half-past eight o'clock, I was going up Shoreditch—I had my handkerchief safe—I felt it going out of my pocket—I put my hand in, and felt the prisoner Jones' hand is it—he took it in its full length across the road—I went after him—he went quicker than me, and round the other two prisoners, or 1 would have taken him, hut I thought three would be too much for one—the handkerchief was passed from one to the other; I saw it in all three of their hands I waited in the road, not above ten yards from them—omnibuses were running by, but I kept on the right side where they were—I saw two policeman, and they took the three—they had a little boy with them, who ran off, and it has not been found.</p>

On Saturday night, the 5th of August, I left the vessel at half-past eight o'clock, and met the prisoners at a public-house in Ratcliff-highway; they were there when I went in; they came to me - Manning asked me to give her a glass of gin; I gave her 1s. to get half-a-pint for the prisoners and two old women, who were there - they had a glass a piece - I had nothing but a single pint of porter; I left the house with the prisoner about eleven o'clock; I went with them to a house I never was in before, in <placeName id="t18260914-396-crimeloc2223">Blue Anchor-court</placeName>

            . I am the watchman. I was on my beat near Blue Anchor-court; I saw this sailor come out of the house with two girls, about two o'clock in the morning; I was not near enough to hear what they said - he came out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140152"></xptr>of the public-house afterwards, and then complained to me; I asked if he should know the girls again - he said Yes; I had seen the two prisoners go down a yard; and I went and called them - they came, and I asked him if these were the girls - he said Yes; I took them to the watchhouse; I then searched them and their room, but found nothing; the sailor appeared a little in liquor, but he knew what he was about - he pointed out the house to me, and I knew they lived there.</p>

On the 13th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, my little girl missed these articles; I then looked, and they were gone; on the evening of the 12th, while I was in the bar, the prisoner went up stairs, and I told my servant to ask who he wanted; she asked him if he wanted Mr. Mack, who was a lodger: he said, "I am going to call on Mr. Mack;" he staid some time, and came down, but we did not see that he had any thing with him; the next morning we missed these things, which had been kept in the servant's bed-room, on the second floor.</p>

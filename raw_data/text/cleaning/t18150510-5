            . I am an officer of Bow Street. On Wednesday the 19th of April, about half past nine in the morning, I saw the prisoner in company with another lad, I knew both their persons, I saw them running up Queen-street as if they were coming from Long Acre towards Holborn, Cole was first, they ran into Queen-street, and they took into Holborn, up Dean-street, into Eagle-street, in turning the corner of Dean street, Cole turned about as he turned the corner he saw me, and hastened his pace, and went up a gate-way; the other lad went up the other street from the gate way, as soon as I got to the gate-way, I saw something behind Cole's coat, as I turned into the gate-way, Cole was in the act of taking this veil from under his coat, he threw it down to his feet, the other prisoner run away, I secured the veil and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any shop mark on the veil - A. Yes, I afterwards shewed the veil to Mr. Torrett.</p>
               <p>(The veil produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That officer wants to swear my life away, I went up the gate-way to make water.</p>

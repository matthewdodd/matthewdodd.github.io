                  </hi>. I live at 111, Chancery-lane, in the parish of St. Dunstan; my son, John George, is a boot and shoemaker. On 28th Aug. I saw the place safe at night—I found it broken open, by a shutter under the window, soon after eight in the morning—I found a stud under the shutter, which I had seen the prisoner wear in the shop for six months—this bag is mine—I missed it that night.</p>

I examined the premises 111, Chancery-lane—there is a small shutter under the window, large enough to admit a man—this shirt-stud was found outside—I compared it with one in the prisoner's shirt, and it corresponded exactly—the middle hole was vacant—I said, "Why you have lost a stud"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Is that yours?"—he said it was, and gave me his mother's address, Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road—I went there—I afterwards went to a stable in Roe-street, Soho, and found these boots and shoes in a bag behind a truss of hay—the Alberts were not there—one boot has a spur on it, and the other spur was left in the shop.</p>

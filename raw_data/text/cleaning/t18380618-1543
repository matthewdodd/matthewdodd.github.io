                  </hi>. I am a watch-case secret springer, and live in Iron-monger-row, St. Luke's. I keep the house—the prisoner was my appen<lb></lb>tice, and is nineteen years old—on the 5th of June I left him at work, and went out—when I came back I missed twelve gold watch-cases and a watch—I did not see him again till the Wednesday week following, when I found him in custody, and ten of the watch cases were found in his pocket—the value of the property found on him is about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my loss about 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not miss them till I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the work-box next morning to go to work—all the gold work was gone, and a box with a watch in it besides.</p>

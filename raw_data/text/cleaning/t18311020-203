I took the prisoner in York-street, Commercial-road - he was not at home; I waited till he returned; there was a woman there, who clung round him, and said, "Oh, Sam, what have you brought me to?" she called him her husband; he said the next morning that he had been married five years next January, and that he had been led into the second marriage, there were some disagreeables about his first marriage.</p>

               <p>JAMES LEE. He told me that he had told the second wife's mother that he was single, but that he had said it out of a joke.</p>

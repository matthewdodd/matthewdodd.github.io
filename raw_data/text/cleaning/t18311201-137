On the 29th of October I had five calves; they were safe that night in a shed - three were loose and two tied up; the next morning I heard something and went to the shed; I found the door open and the calves gone, and two of their tails were left in the shed - they were the tails of the two which had been tied up; I found four of my calves at the foot of Harrow-hill, and one of them about one mile and a half another way - I have known the prisoner ever since he was a child; he has occasionally worked in the neighbourhood; I do not think he was in regular work -I had no quarrel with him.</p>

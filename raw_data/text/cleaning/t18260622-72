            . I am an officer. On the 25th of May, about nine o'clock, I saw the two prisoners - each had a quantity of this lead in a bag - they were near together: I stopped Row and asked what he had got in the bag - he said he was following his father; I called a man to take hold of him, while I pursued and took Willing - he had about half a hundred weight; he said they were going to sell it, and they had found it in a ditch - this was rather more than half a mile from Mr. Allen's - they were going up the back streets, by Whitechapel; they lodged with a man named Wright, who is a tenant of Mr. Allen's.</p>

            . I am a night officer. The prisoners were brought to the watch-house by Norris, and we took Willing to shew us where he found the lead - he pointed out a ditch in a field, and I desired him to go down and shew me exactly where it was - the moment he got down his shoes sunk in the mud, and it was evident there was no mark there before - it had been raining the day or two before, which had made the ground soft - there was no dirt upon the lead or the boys. I brought Willing back, and then went with Row to shew us where he had found it, and he shewed another place, about 400 yards from where the other had shewn; I desired him to go down, and he made similar marks - there had been none there before: I saw him look over his shoulder towards Mr. Allen's; I then went there to inquire, and found this lead had been taken from the gutter - it is cut in a very ragged manner, and stained very curiously - it exactly corresponded with what was left. I found a key in Willing's pocket which opened the padlock on the door of the house.</p>

On the 1st of November, I observed her to put a quart pewter pot in her pocket; she took it from the fire where was about a dozen and a half. I let her go out, followed her, and brought her in again, and took the pot out of her pocket: there was a carpenter in the house, I called him to take notice that I took it out of her pocket, and that my name was upon it. I asked her where she was going to carry it: she would not tell me. I took her to Justice Welch, who committed her to New Prison: as I was going by my own house, I called and treated her with a pot of beer; she confess'd she had sold 14 pots to Holloway. The justice desired me to get a search warrant, which I did. Holloway keeps an old iron shop; we found a quantity of pewter melted down, and a quart pot of mine with my name on it: there were several bags hung up against the wall; the three bags we searched, had melted pewter in them: when we took the pot out of the bag, Holloway ran away: this is the pot I found at Holloway's; (a quart pewter pot produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor): it has my name upon it; Fell was at that time in New Prison.</p>

               <p>Q. When Fell told you she had sold 14 pots to Holloway, did she tell you in how long time?</p>
               <p>Whiat. I have in 2 months lost fourteen pots; in about which time, she said she sold Holloway the 14 pots; I missed 18. We found Mrs. Holloway at Maypole-alley, near the New Church in the Strand, at an acquaintances.</p>

I told her I had got a warrant to search her house for pewter pots, belonging to Mr. Whiat: she said she would have us go down in the cellar and search there, and that she had none; she pretended to be calling somebody down stairs, and made her escape out at a back door while we found the pot.</p>

            . I lived with Mrs. Holloway about four months; she married a brewer's servant: she keeps an old iron and rag shop, and buys brass and pewter. I see Mrs. Holloway give Fell 6 d. for a pot the last day of October. I was gone on an errand when she first came in, and only heard her say to Mrs. Fell, there's the Sixpence: it was about 11 o'clock at noon. I did not see the pot, but was told afterwards by Mrs. Fell, that the six-pence was for the quart pot that was found when the house was searched. I asked her how she could rob the people? she said if it had not been put into her head, she should never have thought of such a thing. I asked her by whom? she said Mrs. Holloway. I have seen Holloway melt pewter pots many times, but never saw the name upon them. I heard her say to her husband on the next morning (Tuesday) that Fell was a base woman to rob the people that were her support.</p>

               <p>I never took any thing from any body in my life: I only took the pot to get a draught of water.</p>
               <p>Holloway's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never received a pot of Mrs. Fell, or ever suspected her to be a thief; she had 20 l. a year during her life: her husband is dead, she is superannuated. She brought a pot in her hand: I asked her where she was going? she said she was coming to wash her things. I asked her what she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070042"></xptr> brought the pot for? she said she could not tell. A customer came in, my husband went down to weigh some iron, and she tossed the pot in the bag; I never saw, or handled it, if I was to die this moment. She asked me to lend her sixpence; I said, Mrs. Fell, you owe me a great deal of money (she owed me 18 s.) I will lend you no more: my husband and Mr. Whiat are bail for her now, and because my husband would not join with Mr. Whiat in a note of hand to pay the money at Christmas, he has invented this: he said if we would pay money to his attorney, he would prefer a bill of Ignoramus against Fell.</p>

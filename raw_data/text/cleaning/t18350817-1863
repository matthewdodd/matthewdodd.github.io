                  </hi>. I am a marble-polisher, and lodge in the house of Matthew Hamilton, in Charlton-street, Somers-town. On the 1st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went out to fetch something for supper—I was perfectly sobre—I had a glass or two, but had my senses about me—I met the prisoner with a woman—I did not know them before—we fell into conversation, and I asked them to have something to drink—the prisoner said they were hungry, and would be glad if I could give them something to eat—I took them into my room, which is the back parlour, and gave them some supper—while I was there a man and woman came in who owed me some money—the woman paid me a sovereign and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I had 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket before that; I put the money into my pocket; the woman who paid it to me said, "Mind you don't pay the sovereign away for silver"—I then put it into a looking-glass drawer, which I locked up, and put the key into the tea-caddy, close by; all this happened in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence—soon afterwards the man and woman went away—I fetched a drop of gin while they were all four there, and after I had put the money away—they were all there when I went out—I returned and found them all four there—the man and woman were strangers to the prisoner—the man worked for me—they went away—the prisoner and the other woman remained, and cat my supper—the other woman then went away, leav<lb></lb>ing the prisoner with me, and said she would come again—that was at near 11o'clock—I fell asleep shortly after, and awoke at a little after two o'clock in the morning—the prisoner was then gone—she had given me no notice of her going, and left the door ajar—I jumped up, and the key of the looking-glass-drawer was taken out, and laid on the table, and all the money gone—I went and gave information—the prisoner was taken on the Wednesday morning following—it happened on the Saturday night—I lost five sovereigns and a half, two half-crowns, and twenty-one shill<lb></lb>ings, and a sixpence.</p>

On the Saturday night in question, the prisoner's husband had left her, and she came to my place to find him—I went out with her to meet my husband, and at the corner of Chapel-street the prosecutor came up—he seemed tipsy—he asked us to have some<lb></lb>thing to drink—we refused at first, but went and had some gin at last—he asked her to go home to supper—she went home with him, and I stopped for a minute or two—I was then going towards home, and met them at the cook-shop door—then both of us went home him—somebody came and paid lim some money, as he has stated—I did not see where he put</p>

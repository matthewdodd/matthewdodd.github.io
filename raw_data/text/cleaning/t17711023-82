            ; I keep a chandler's shop. The prisoner lodged with her father and mother at our house about eight weeks ago. The things mentioned in the indictment were stolen out of a sore kitchen; they were in bags, they were just come into the house, and had not been there four hours. The kitchen door was locked; it had been locked all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had nothing to do in this kitchen?</p>
               <p>Wright. No; I missed a great quantity of silk, seven Holland shirts, a gown, twenty yards of thread-lace, and eight or ten yards of linen cloth. The things were taken out of the bags, and the bags left behind: I found the kitchen door locked as I left it on Friday morning. My husband went to the justice, and he granted him a warrant: we searched her room, we found some cloth, some pieces of silk, and part of the thread-lace, about eight or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that is your's?</p>
               <p>Wright. I have some at home to match it; I am very sure it is mine; the cloth was cut into shift-sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the silk?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; I have a gown at home of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when you found these things?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; she confessed she brought them out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I saw them in the fore kitchen, and took them into my room; they were put out of the way till somebody should own them.</p>
               <p>"She called a witness to her character, who deposed, that she takes in gentlemen's linen to wash. She said the prisoner had ironed for her; that she entrusted her with a great many things, and always found her very honest.</p>

               <p>Court.

            , to do with the prisoner, how came that to lead you to suspect the prisoner? - From the evidence of one Whitebread an accomplice, who was concerned with the prisoner. Whitebread is here, the prisoner confessed it before the justice, I was present, and my father, when he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Now let me hear what passed in your hearing at the Justice's? - It was made mention by Whitebread in what manner they got in; the prisoner owned to the taking the wheat, and conveying it away in wheel barrows, he said, he held open the sacks, while Whitebread put the meal in the sacks, and they then conveyed them away in wheel barrows.</p>
               <p>Court. He confessed taking the wheat? - I don't recollect that he said that altogether.</p>

               <p>What did you hear the prisoner say about this matter? - The prisoner said nothing more than this, that he owned to be concerned in taking the wheat.</p>
               <p>Was any promises made him, or any threats to induce him to confess? - None at all.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he say he took it? - After Whitebread had given his evidence, which he heard, they were face to face.</p>

               <p>What became of the sacks? - They are at the mill, there is G. for George and Berner at the end.</p>
               <p>When had you seen these sacks at your own mill? - The day before I missed them, they lay in the wheat shop, the sacks lay empty, and the wheat lay loose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Had you no more sacks than these that contained this wheat, how many sacks had you so marked? - A pretty many.</p>
               <p>Do you think all the sacks marked in that manner you have described, are in your possession at this time? - They are never all in my possession, they are in the hands of bakers, and people that I deal with.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you saw these sacks the day before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you saw these very sacks in which you found corn? - Yes, these very sacks, because there are particular rags and patches.</p>

               <p>What were those particular marks besides the letters? - M. G. I saw that among the rest.</p>
               <p>Did they lay one upon another? - No, they all tumbled loose, that lay among the rest.</p>
               <p>Did you give Whitebread the evidence any money? - Never.</p>

               <p>Court. Why do you unsay, now you have heard the evidence, what you said before, you said that you had not heard that any sacks had been stolen or missed. - No, I heard that the mill had been robbed on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Court. When I asked you so repeatedly that question, why did not you tell me? - I thought you asked me about the sacks.</p>

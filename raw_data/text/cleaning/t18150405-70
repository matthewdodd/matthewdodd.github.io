               <p>MRS. BEAUFORT. I missed the diamond ring, on the 11th of March; I took it off my finger and laid it on the table on the 6th and missed it on the 11th, I communicated it to Mr. Beaufort, I was present when Powell was called up, he at first denied knowing any thing of it, he afterwards confessed he had found it, I have seen the ring since.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Beaufort. In consequence of information, from Mrs. Beaufort, did you inform your servants of your loss - A. I did, Bara Domingo denied any knowledge of the ring; I said, if the ring was not found by Monday morning I would go to Bow-street. On Monday morning I went to the office and got Westbrook, he came to my house, and searched Powell, in his pocket he found this receipt, this receipt was put into my hands, and in Powell's chest he found some duplicates, nothing was found upon the woman.</p>

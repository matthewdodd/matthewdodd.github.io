            . I live at No. 4, St. Vincent's-row, City Road. On the 27th of June, about six o'clock at night, I was at the <placeName id="t18070701-54-crimeloc333">Holborn corner of Fleet market</placeName>

As I was standing at the corner of Fleet market, a woman asked me if I had lost any thing, I felt in my pocket, I told her I had lost my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive your handkerchief go from you. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive yourself hustled or pushed. - A. I did not. She immediately pointed out the prisoner to me, and in the space of a minute after she gave me the alarm; I saw the prisoner; I went with her directly to him, he was about two or three yards off, and the officer laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief. - A. I saw it fall from his person; I picked it off the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the handkerchief to be yours when you picked it up. - A. Yes, it was worth five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner When he first accosted me, I told him I had no handkerchief but what was mine, as I knew of; when I was laid hold of there was a great mob; the handkerchief was found upon the ground.</p>

            . I am a constable of the city.

            . I was going up Fleet market, a woman said to me that the prisoner at the bar ought to be taken up, because he had his hand in the man's pocket. I watched the prisoner, he stood behind the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing. - A. I did not, he was close to me; the woman asked Mr. Lewis if he had lost any thing, he said his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing drop from him. - A. Yes, the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when he was laid hold of. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the handkerchief to him when you saw it on the ground. - A. As near to him as my hand is to my side.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, from agitation which every man must feel, being in this awful situation, together with the confinement of a prison, so overcomes me that I am not able to give my defence, without the indulgence of this honourable court in permitting this to be read. My lord and gentlemen, in the first place I am a sworn broker and appraiser; I am now in the fifty ninth year of my age; my conduct hitherto has been irreproachable. I have an ailing wife and four children, two of which are solely dependent on me for support. On the afternoon mentioned, I had been to Tottenham Court Road, to destrain goods for some rent for Mr. Dixon in the Old Bailey. After I left Mr. Dixon, I went into Fleet market, and was asking the price of some peas; and before I could turn round, the prosecutor or some person got hold of me, and said I had got their handkerchief; my answer was candid and honest, I said I had never seen him or his handkerchief. The market at this time was crowded, and no doubt with people of various descriptions; I was immediately laid hold of, and was informed the handkerchief was taken from off the ground. The prosecutor before the alderman said that I dropped the handkerchief on the ground, but from the crowd that were about at the time, I think it impossible for him or any man to distinguish from whom it fell. I solemnly declare that I never had the handkerchief in my possession. - Gentlemen, so far from the prosecutor knowing me to be the person that robbed him, he was not even aware that he had lost his property, till a woman pointed out me to him; whether she did it through ill will or malice, I cannot state; I think the latter from the best information; I learned that I did destrain the goods of this very woman, which so pointed me out. This is the manner she has chosen to be revenged of me, for the distress I brought upon her as she thought; whereas I did only the part of a broker. Gentlemen, if ever the case of innocence deserved the protection of a British jury, this does; I was dragged to a prison, and put to a great expence, entirely through a foolish woman, who would sacrifice the miserable life of an old man, to gratify her revenge. I trust you have already received the impressions of truth in my favour; and that by your generous verdict, I shall be restored to my family.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) I want to know whether you can say you saw the handkerchief drop from the hand of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010048"></xptr> prisoner. - A. I saw it drop by the side of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any person so near the side of him, that it could have fell from them. - A. There were other people before him; I saw it drop, I supposed it came from him; I did not see it in his hand, it is possible it may fall from one behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty whether it fell from him or any other person. - A. I saw it drop from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do very right to speak what is true, whatever may be the consequence of that truth; you are bound to speak the truth if you are conscious, and if you firmly believe it dropped from him, say so. - A. I am certain it dropped from him.</p>

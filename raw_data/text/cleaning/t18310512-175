On the 7th of May I was in King John-court, which is about one hundred yards from Holywell-lane; I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, with a pair of boots under his arm - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and pursued him; he threw down the boots - I took them up, and gave them to this gentleman.</p>

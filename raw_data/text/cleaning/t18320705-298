On Wednesday afternoon, the 4th of July I was having my tea in my back room at my house in King-street, Commercial-road; I heard a lumbering noise in front of my shop - I ran, and found these four shoes on the lasts, about one yard in the shop; I stood two or three minutes, and saw a mob - the officer and Mr. Lee came- I gave up the shoes to them.</p>

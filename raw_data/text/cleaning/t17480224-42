               <p>Q. What did you do more?</p>
               <p>Everett. About a fortnight after that we went and got seven more sacks full, and carried them in the same cart to the same house, and sold them for fourteen shillings a tod, and about a fortnight afterwards we had the same quantity again.</p>
               <p>Q. What, seven sacks?</p>
               <p>Everett . I do not know whether there were five or seven sacks, and we sold them for fourteen shillings a tod to the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money was divided between you, the Prisoner, and Miller?</p>
               <p>Everett. Yes. We went once more, and had five sacks, and sold them to the same Person. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Goring. My Lord, I desire the accomplice may be asked, whether he did not hear Collins say, that he took more wool, and carried it to Brentford, and sold it?</p>
               <p>Everett . Yes, I heard him say he had been once at Brentford with wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the wool he took out of the lost?</p>
               <p>Everett. I do not know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Goring. What sort of a lost is this?</p>
               <p>Goring. It is a strong lost, and boarded on the sides, and I keep it generally locked with a padlock. I constantly kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What use do you make of that lost?</p>
               <p>Goring . It is to keep wool in, and no other use.</p>

I was in the Hackney-road on the night of the 10th of November—about eleven o'clock Collings passed me, down King-street, I followed him and Taylor to the house—on the next day, about half past nine o'clock, I went to Collings's house—I searched, and found these things in the back room down stairs, and this small parcel in a room up stairs—some of this is in entire skeins—I found some very damp—I asked Collings in the house if he had any objection to go with me to the station-house—he said, "Yes, to-night; but I will go with you in the morning"—I said, "You must go with me now"—he said, "Very well, if I must, I must" and I took him—that is all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was fourteen years old on the 12th of September, and live at No. 16, King-street, Hackney-road, with my father. I was in the service of Collings the first week or fortnight of November—I was there more than a week—I used to turn a wheel, and sometimes cut up worsted, or worsted fringes—Collings was a rug-maker, I believe—I have seen Taylor at Collings's very often, talking to him, about a week before I left—he</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence to the following purport:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. It is, with the deepest sense of shame and concern, that I find myself under the necessity of answering a charge I never expected to be brought against me; I looked upon the articles to be a free gift from the prosecutrix, who consented I should have them for her sake; the morning I left her, I asked them of her, and she consented to my request; when I left her lodgings, I desired her servant to follow me home, and I would send her mistress something for having staid with her all night; I was surprised she did not follow me, but intended to return again, and went home without an idea of what would be the consequence; being but a short time in London, and unacquainted with the town, I could not find out her lodgings, which I wished to do; when I met her afterwards, my satisfaction was much damped, by the charge of having robbed her; I might easily have avoided her, but I offered to go home with her, and might have quitted her in our walk to Half-moon-street, where she said she lived, if I had been so inclined; it happened that I had been disappointed of some money from my friend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270046"></xptr>which subjected me to the inconvenience of pledging my apparel, and inadvertently those ear-rings; having been a short time in London, and my friends and relations being abroad, I have no friends here to speak for me; I hope, if my single asseveration can be taken, it will be believed, I had no intention to rob her, and that my conduct will be looked upon more as levity than an intention to injure; I humbly beg leave to say, that as this is the first time, so it shall be the last of my appearing at the bar of this or any other tribunal.</p>

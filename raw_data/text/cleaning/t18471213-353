                  </hi> I live in Wardour-street—in March last I ad<lb></lb>rertised for a situation—I offered 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one who would procure me one—in consequence of a letter I received, I went to Cannon-street and saw the prisoner—he represented that he had to engage a traveller for the firm of Zillah and Co., of Bush-lane, and that he was a relative of the firm—he said he had it in his power to procure me a situation as town-traveller—we parted, and I had some correspondence with him afterwards—on 25th March, I again met him—he told me he thought of going into business for himself—he said that Zillah and C. had offered him two or three agencies, as he had been in the firm some time—he offered to engage me as town-traveller and collector to him in chicory and chemical matters—I was to deposit 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security—he took a counting-house at No. 20, Beer-lane—the name of Rust was put up afterwards—I deposited 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him by instalments—on the 4th April I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 14th, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 30th another 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 21st May 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all—I travelled for him, and produced a few orders—I believe one of them was executed—I got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one week's salary, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—I found it was desirable to get my money back, and I spoke to him several times—he made excuses every week and said he had money in several parts, but it had not come in and he could not pay me—I never saw anything but samples in his shop—I received perhaps a dozen orders, only one was executed—I parted with the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the situation—I believe there was a firm of Zillah and Co.—he said they were going to give the agencies up to him—"Rust and Co." was up in Beer Lane—I never saw anybody there but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Russell, of 8, Bush-lane—he keeps the whole house—the prisoner had occupied the ground-floor-office in the name of Zillah—"Zillah and Co." was on the outside, and "J. W. Zillah" on the inside door—I never knew the prisoner by any other name than Zillah—I never saw any one in the office at all connected with the business but him—letters come occasionally—some in the name of Zillah, and some in the name of Prudence—I laid them on the table till he or his wife came—there were packages of little parcels, but I never saw any business carried on at all.</p>

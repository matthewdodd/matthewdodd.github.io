               <p>Q. When did you see the note again? - A. On Monday, after the prisoner was examined at Marlborough-street, I made an inquiry, and traced the note to Mr. Watts's, Berwick-street, New-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was this? - A. The robbery was on Sunday, and on Monday I traced the note and received it of Mr. Watts, in change of another; I produce the note; I always take the number and date of the notes, and when I part with any I scratch them off; the number is 12,480, on the 9th of April; I have them all in parcels; the notes came from the Bank, I am a Treasurer in the East-India House; that note was in the secretary, and the only one that was left; when I get change I have a quantity of notes of following numbers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not disposed of this note? - A. Yes; I went to my drawer, and took three notes away - two two's and a one; I know I had not disposed of this, by its being the last of the parcel of my own list; I have the list now in my pocket, I mark them off when I pay them away; the mourning ring is a ring of a near relation of mine, it was in a drawer adjoining where the door was broken open.</p>

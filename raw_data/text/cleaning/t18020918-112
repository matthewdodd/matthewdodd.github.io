               <p>Q.Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. I think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt about it; are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face when he took the things out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- MACKENZIE sworn. - I live next door to the prosecutor: On the 29th of August, about a quarter after four in the morning, I heard a cry of stop thief; I got up, and saw the prisoner run past the door, I was in my shirt; I ran after him, and turning down Winslow-street, in Oxford-road, I called stop thief, and a coachman was getting down off his box to lay hold of the prisoner, when he stopped, and I took him, he might have gone away if he would; we took him to the watch-house, and found upon him two shillings and sixpence, a hook, such as they use at sea for fishing, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose fight of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Budgell.) Where did you find these things? - A. He chucked them down in the area.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I was the person you saw at the window? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been from sea but three weeks; I heard the alarm of stop thief, several people were running, and I run with them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mackenzie.) Was there any body else running when he passed your door? - A. No, not at that time.</p>

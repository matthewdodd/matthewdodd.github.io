            , gave me information there was some beef gone; I had seen the beef altogether a very little time before in the tray, I think not more than five minutes; I sent my young man to see if he could make any discovery; he returned in about ten minutes, saying that he had taken two pieces of beef from the prisoner; I know them to be mine by the cut, and the fellow pieces corresponding with it; I did not see any thing of the prisoner for more than a month afterwards, I saw him at the office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do'nt you know that the prisoner came of himself to Worship-street to answer this charge, without being apprehended or taken there by an officer? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you cut your beef different from all other butchers? - A. I cut off the fore rib different from any other butcher, I think, except one.</p>
               <p>Q. That one butcher, perhaps, lives in Lezdenhall-market? - A. His stand is next to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then will you venture to swear that that cut is different from his? - A. I know it by the cut and the corresponding pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that if your neighbour has beef of the same cut and the same quality, that you can distinguish one from the other? - A. I have no doubt it is my beef; I admit it is a possible case; but my neighhour did not lose any that morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are beasts so much alike that a piece of one beast will correspond with a piede of another beast, though cut alike? - A. They will not in every particular.</p>
               <p>DANIEL THOMAS sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Barnard: On Saturday, the 24th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I missed two pieces of beef from a tray; I went into the hide-market to look after it, and saw the prisoner and Sparrowhawk very busy just by a truck; I saw the prisoner help Sparrowhawk up with the beef in a tray; I stopped him and asked him where he was going with it, and he said it was Mizzered's; I desired him to carry it back; and the prisoner said, d-n my eyes, is it your master's; says I, yes it is; he said, oh, I thought it belonged to that sat b-r over the water, or else I would not have taken it; I took it back and gave it to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. 
               <persName id="t18011202-57-person496">Q. </persName>
            Sparrowhawk was taken before the Magistrate, was not he? - A. No; he came to our house, and when she prisoner was found he went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped Sparrowhawk the prisoner did not run away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SPARROWHAWK sworn. - I am a butcher's porter in Leadenhall-market: On the 24th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing in the Hide-market behind a truck; he asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes; he said here are two bits of beef, leave them for me at Mr. Draper's; I took them up, and just as I turned the corner of the Hide-market Mr. Barnard's lad stopped me, and I brought the beef back; I said, Mr. Muzzered you have brought me into a nice predicament, I shall acquaint Mr. Barnard how I came by them; he said to the boy, d-n my eyes, do they belong to your master, I did not know that, or else I would not have took them, I thought they belonged to that fat b-r over the water; I then went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020044"></xptr>by the story you have now told you save yourself from being prosecuted? - A. That is more than I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, do you expect to be prosecuted now; - A. No.</p>

            If you had not found some person to have laid it upon you would have been liable to answer for this charge? - A. If had done the fact I must have abided by it; I am not a person of that description if you enquire my character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was ill in bed at the time, and as soon as I was able to get out I went to the office and surrendered myself; I wish to call Mr. Neville.</p>

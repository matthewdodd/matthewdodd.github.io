               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, 'tis above three Months since: 'Tis a very bad Time of the Year; I paid Half a Crown 2 Week, and they teaz'd me for the Money; I said I must be obliged to make away with the Things, if they must have the Money. After that, my Lord, I told him, that the Rent of the Room was too dear for me; as soon as ever I could make it good I would quit his Lodgings; but I never quitted my Lodgings, 'till he obliged me to it. I could bring a Gentleman, my Friend, that would have laid down the Money: He made an Agreement with me, not above a Fortnight ago, if I would pay him five Shillings a Week, that he would be easy with me and bring the Things out by little and little as I could; but there is something that vexed him that made him do it. I had no design to wrong him.</p>

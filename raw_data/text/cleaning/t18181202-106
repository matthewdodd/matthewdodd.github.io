On the 19th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, I met the two prisoners in Cranbourne-alley. They took hold of me, and took me into a passage, and made signs that they wanted something to drink. They then took me into a house, in <placeName id="t18181202-106-crimeloc586">Porto-Bello-passage, Lisle-street</placeName>

They came out with me, and threw me against a wall; Mash put her hand into my pocket, took out my pocket-book, and put it behind her. I wanted to take it from her, but she threw it away. I went to pick it up; they knocked me down. Whilst I was down, I lost my hat. They ran off, one one way, and the other another. I pursued Price, and took her. I called for assistance; the watchman came and took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain they are the women - A. I am certain of Price; she took it out of my pocket. I never lost sight of her. I have not found my property.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise in Ryder's-court, and found Lutz holding Price. He gave the account he has now given. He had stopped her there, and gave her in charge. I can speak German, and understood what he said. I know both the prisoners; they are always about there together, at every hour in the night. Mash was afterwards taken.</p>

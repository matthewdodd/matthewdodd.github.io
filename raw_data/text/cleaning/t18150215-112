               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. I am a son-in-law to the last witness. On the 19th of January, I went to the house in consequence of information; when I went into the house, I saw the kitchen range had been misplaced, it had been removed merely from the brick work. In consequence of what I then saw, I went again in the evening to the house; I went the back way, across the garden, there was a wheelbarrow standing at the back door, and the room door wide open; that door was fastened when I left it. I put my head, and one foot in the house, and then I saw the prisoner drawing the kitchen range along the passage; I am positive to the prisoner's person; I saw him quite plain, it was a beautiful moon light night; I went down the garden to get assistance. I returned, I saw the prisoner with the barrow; I catched hold of the prisoner; he struck me, but the next witness coming up, he gave over. I am sure the prisoner is the same man I saw with the barrow, and the same man I saw in the house, I swear positively to his person; the stove and the range were both standing down by the barrow.</p>

            . I assisted Mr. Smith in apprehending the prisoner; the prisoner might be about twenty five yards from the premises when he was taken; I saw the man go out of the garden gate with the wheelbarrow; I saw the prisoner was the man; when I overtook Mr. Phillips, he had got hold of him by the collar with the wheelbarrow.</p>

            . I keep a public house at Wilsdon. On the 18th of January, I saw the prisoner at my house, he put his hand upon my shoulder, he said he wanted to speak to me, he stood at the wash-house, he said the people had run away, and there was a parcel of people ransacking the house, and there was a nice little stove he would bring down to my house; I refused to let him, I said, I would not let him. I pursuaded him to go away, and if other people were rogues, I did not wish him to become one.</p>

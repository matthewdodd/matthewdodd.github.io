                  </hi>. I live at No. 114, Drury-lane. On the 21st of April I left my shop for a few minutes, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening—I left about forty pounds of roasted coffee in a bag in the shop—I returned in about ten minutes—it was then gone—I went to the station in about a quarter of an hour, and saw it—it was worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor; I was left in charge of his shop during his absence. The prisoner Percell came into the shop for some low-priced figs—I stooped under the counter to get them—when I got them up he said he would not have them, he would have some better—I looked out some of the best we had—after some words, he refused them, and said he would have some better—I said we had not any better—he then leaned over the counter, laughed, and asked how much those were which I had showed him first—I said 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would have them—he then went away—my master came, and missed the coffee.</p>

Between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 21st of April I was on duty, in plain clothes, in Drury-lane—I saw the prisoners, and a person who is not in custody, out-side Mr. Butler's door—I saw Percell leave them and go into the shop—the one not in custody then took a bag of coffee from the door, and carried it to a coffee-shop door a little higher up—Jones was with him at the time, and went with him when he carried the bag—the other put it down at the coffee-shop door—Jones then took it up, and carried it a few doors down Princes-street, where he was followed by another constable, and dropped it—a crowd of persons assembled round where the coffee was, and I laid hold of a man whom I thought was the man that had escaped, but it ap<lb></lb>peared I was mistaken—I then saw Percell come into the crowd—I told I person to hold the bag, and I pursued Percell, who ran away for about five minutes, and ran 400 or 500 yards—while he was running he kept saying several times,"What do you want me for?"—I took him—I had frequently seen him, but I did not know his name—I know him by sight, so as to know that he was with the other two at the prosecutor's door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a florist, and live at Vale House, Commer<lb></lb>cial-lane, Old Brompton—I knew the prisoner as living with Mr. Coles, a customer of mine. On the 27th of July he came to my house—I was ill in bed at the time—he was shown up into my room—I inquired after Mr. Coles and the family, under the impression that he was still in the service—he said they were all quite well, and were down in Hampshire—he did not say he had left Mr. Coles—he said Mr. Coles had left him without suffi<lb></lb>cient money to send glass and things down into Hampshire, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was quite willing to do so—he said, "You may as well make it 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for I shall have more things comn in that I shall want to send down directly"—I let him have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came again on the 30th, and said he had so many things to send down to the railway-station that he had not suffi<lb></lb>cient money to do it, and begged me to let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, which I did—I said, "I should like to have some acknowledgment," and he gave me an I 0 U—I should not have lent him the money if I had not believed he was residing with Mr. Coles—it was for Mr. Coles's purposes entirely—he came again on the 3rd of August, and said, "Mr. Tebbutt, I am sorry to trouble you again, but I have got more things, and Mr. Coles has not been up to settle with me, you must positively let me have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more," which, after some hesitation, I did—I afterwards went to Mr. Coles's house, in Piccadilly, and found the prisoner had left the service—I gave informa<lb></lb>tion, and he was taken into custody.</p>

I bor<lb></lb>rowed was to pay my rent with, and the other 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for moving my furniture—I asked him if he had been to Mr. Coles, to fetch away the plant-pots—he said, "No"—I said there were about fifty empty pots in the area when I was there.</p>

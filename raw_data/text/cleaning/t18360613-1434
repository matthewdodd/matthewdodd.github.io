                  </hi>. I am carter to Massey Gillett, at Puckeridge. On Tuesday, the 10th of May, I brought a load and a half of straw to town—I came over Battle-bridge, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">lit</hi> on me—I had seen him before, but did not know his name, nor had any dealings with him—he asked if I had that straw to sell—I said, "Yes"—he asked the price—I told him 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load, and that I had a load and a half—he said that was too much, he would give me 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—then he asked what I was going to load back with—I said, "Soot"—he agreed to give me 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him where I was to go with it—he said, "Near Oxford-street"—he went into a corn-dealer's shop—I stood at the other side of the way—he came out and told me to draw up, and I delivered thirty-six trusses there—the prisoner said they could not take any more—he helped the corn-chandler's man to carry it in—when I had unloaded the prisoner was to pay me, but he never did—we had a pot of beer, and then went thirteen or fourteen poles fourteen—he asked me to go, and said he would unload the half-load there—he was to buy the load and a half—we went and had two pennyworth of rum—he said, "I will unload you in five minutes"—he went towards where I thought he was going to unload and I thought he was gone into a shop, but I never saw any thing more of him—I waited there an hour and a half—I had sold it to him for ready money—he was to pay me directly—I sold the half-load myself afterwards, as he never came back—I never saw him again till he was at Hatton-garden, on Friday, the 20th—my master had given information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live at No. 26, Little Earl-street. On this Tuesday morning I bought the load of straw of the prisoner—he called on me on the Thursday before, and asked if I was a buyer of straw—I said, no, not to-day; I should be next marker-day—he said, "I shall be up with some next market-day, and will give you a call, "he called on the Tuesday following, and said, "Master, I did not bring any straw up on Saturday last, but I have brought some to-day"—I said, "What is your price?"—he said, "Thirty-five shillings"—said, "That is more than I gave the last day, "—he said, "What is your price?—I said, "I gave 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. last time; I will give you 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "Well you shall have it;" and he and my man unloaded it at my place—I gave him the money and did not know but he was the owner of the straw.</p>

               <p>we got to the corn-dealer's. I sold the straw, and said to the carter, "Come about two hundred yards farther, and I think I know a gentleman who will take the other half load"—I went to Short's Gardens, and found a customer in about an hour and a quarter; and when I came back for him, he was gone.</p>

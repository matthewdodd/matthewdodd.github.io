                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live at No. 128, Lambeth-walk, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—I keep the house. On the 10th of May I missed several things—the prisoner lodged in the house, up stairs—I had a wooden partition, which fenced off my shop and parlour from the passage, and on coming down, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 11th, I noticed that the partition had been moved and altered, and the screws drawn out, which would admit anybody into the shop—I found the prisoner under the counter in the shop—I had locked up that shop overnight, so that the partition would exclude anybody, unless by drawing the screws—I missed a best beaver hat, a silver caddy spoon, a large brass brewing kettle, a silver thimble, a pepper top, and several other articles—I had missed several things the day before, but those I am now speaking of were safe the overnight, when I went to bed—I asked the prisoner what he did there—he said he got there to protect the shop—the policeman afterwards found a silver thimble of mine in his possession at the station—I searched his room in the house, and found a saw, and the top of a pepper castor, which had been safe overnight in the par<lb></lb>lour, which is inclosed in the same partition as the shop—I cannot say how long the saw had been there—I also lost spades, pick-axes, trivets, and other things—the parlour and shop communicate by a door—the partition is a moving one—one part of it is moved every day, and stands against the wall, and the other part goes back on hinges, to throw part of the passage into the shop—it is closed and bolted at night, so that no one can get in without breaking it open, or drawing the screws—I missed property both from the par<lb></lb>lour and shop, which were both fastened up overnight—I found the screws drawn—I occupy the bottom part of the house, and sleep on the first floor, over the shop—I have not found anything but the thimble and this candle-stick—one part of it was concealed under the counter, where the prisoner was, and the other part was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I work in a dust-yard, and I picked up the thimble and pepper-top in the dust; he had no such thing as a pepper-top; I gave him a glass pepper-box myself; there is the dirt on the top now as I picked it up; my father gave me the saw when I was first married; he has taken that and other things since I have been here for trial. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The pepper-top is</p>

               <p>just the same as it was on my mantel-piece, in one of my mugs, in the parlour—I have had it by me for years—the kettle was kept in a cupboard underneath the stairs, in the back parlour, and the handle of it was left behind in the wash-house—I generally came down about seven o'clock, or half-past—I know the saw by a crack in it, which was made years ago—I never went into the prisoner's room without the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I made that crack in the saw myself, by cutting a piece of wood. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was done at Egham, in sawing off the limb of a damson tree.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 88.) I searched the prisoner—I found this silver thimble in his pocket—I afterwards went to his room, and found this saw and this top of a pepper-castor—I found this part of the candlestick under the counter, where he was concealed—the prosecutor had allowed him to go to the privy—I found him there—the privy was afterwards emptied, and this other part of the candlestick was found there.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this information and going after her, did you find her? - Yes, on the Sunday night following she came in my way, I met her between Execution Dock and Gun Dock, in Wapping, but the woman I could not swear to, but only by the appearance of her dress, I thought she was the same person, I stopped her, and she owned to the child directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the woman that you stopped? - Yes, that is the same woman that I stopped, and she owned to the child; I passed her for about twenty yards; Mrs. Redman was with me, and I said to Mrs. Redman, do you turn back and ask that woman whether her name is not Jodith Taylor? and she did, and when I came up to her she told me the child was at home; I brought her into Ratcliffe-highway, then she said she gave it to a woman in a brown camblet gown in the Blue Coat-fields; now, says I, tell me the truth, whether my child is at home or no; and she said she left it in Ratcliffe-highway; so she did, she left it at Mr. Dawson's cellar window, near Old Gravel-lane, and the child knew the maid of the public house, and asked her to carry her to her mother; and when I went home I found the child was taken home to my mother's.</p>

               <p>I went out with Mrs. Martin, and we went into a public house, Mr. Nuttall's, in Ratcliffe-highway, the Bull's Head, and had a pint of beer, and the child was running about.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Blue Coatfields, Shadwell? - Not a great way; I see the child in a woman's arms, and the child was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Mrs. Martin on Sunday, when the child was found? - Yes; and I laid hold of the prisoner, between Execution Dock and Gun Dock; I did not know the woman, but the mother said, from the appearance, that was the woman, and I followed her, and took hold of her, and asked her if her name was not Judith Taylor? then I looked at the man that was with her, and I knew him to be the man that was her husband; and I said to Mrs. Martin, this is the woman, for this is the man that is her husband; and Mrs. Martin directly runs up to the woman, and says, where is my child; she bid us let her go; we would not let her go; and when we got home, the child was a bed at Mrs. Martin's mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Martin charge an officer with the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I never spoke to her about it, it is false; this woman's sister came to my place, and went down on her knees, and asked whether I would make it up for half a guinea? and I did agree to it with the sister, but not with the prisoner, if they would shew me the things.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. Your crime is so distinguishable from the other larcenies, that are brought before us, from the attocity of it, that I think it proper particularly to mark it, that all persons hearing you tried, may know the punishment attendant upon the conviction of a crime under such circumstances as your's has been; I cannot conceive an offence more painful to society, than that you have committed. I don't know whether you have been the mother of children, but I found by one of the evidences who has spoken to your character, that you have had the care of children; I am very sorry to find that any one of your sex should be found so very devoid of feeling, for the purpose of getting plunder, as to rob a poor infant; under these circumstances I think it right to punish you with as much severity as the law will permit; therefore I now pass this sentence on you, that you be <rs id="t17950701-10-punish61" type="punishmentDescription">

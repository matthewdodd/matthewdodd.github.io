               <p>Q. On the 22d of June had the prisoner been there as watchman. - A. Yes, I had let him in on Saturday evening, and I had locked him in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend early in the morning of Sunday close to the gates with two officers. - A. Yes, I did not see him come out of the gate exactly, we stopped him, and desired him to come back when he was just out of the gate, he returned readily; when we all came together to Mr. Yellop's dwelling house the carman, whose business it was to let him out, was standing at the door; he was taken into the house, I told him he was suspected of being dishonest,

             the constable immediately searched him, in each coat pocket he found a parcel of yellow colour, called king's yellow, the two parcels together weighed two pounds and a half, and within his waistcoat and breeches were laid flat and round his body. fourteen pounds weight of verdigrease, it was tied up in a long paper bag.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the clerk, was there such a commodity as yellow colour and verdigrease there. - A. There positively was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say he came back very readily. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose from the nature of your trade it was impossible to prove any loss. - A. No, he might have taken twenty pounds, we could not miss any, the quantity is too large.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Henry Marsh, a watch-maker, in Down-street, Piccadilly. The prisoner came on the 17th of September—I did not know him before—he said he came for a watch that had been left there in the name of Smith, and pointed to one in the win<lb></lb>dow, and said that was it—he said that before I said any thing to him—I took the watch, and said it was left by one of Lord Dacre's servants—he said, "Oh yes, that is my brother-in-law"—I said it was not done, my master was out of town, if he would leave it a few days we would get it done—he said he was going out of town till Monday, and he would take</p>

               <p>- BAILEY. I am a constable. On this day fortnight I was stationed at Paul's wharf, at Mr. Maberley's, just as the men were coming out; they came out at seven o'clock, as the clock was striking. As the men were coming to the outside gate I rushed upon the prisoner Asquith: he resisted as much as a man could possibly do. After I seized him I never let him go, and inside of his waistcoat I saw Trustey (the patrol) take the cloth from him. This is the cloth. I think there is nigh a yard and a half.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. How many men were there in the place when you seized this man - A. A great number of them. This piece of cloth was taken from behind the man. I saw this piece of cloth taken as he was getting rid of it from behind him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner endeavouring to get away from Bailey. I saw the prisoner squatting down and pulling the cloth from him. I took the cloth from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. There was a general seizure among these journeyman that caused a general row - A. Yes; we were ordered for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of making confusion - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What other tailor was near this man - A. Mr. Bailey was nearest him. He was getting the better of Mr. Bailey; I had to take care he should not. I drove the prisoner up against the wall. I saw the rest of the men; nobody was near him but Mr. Bailey.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

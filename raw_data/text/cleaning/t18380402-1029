                  </hi>. I am an assistant to William Nedby and others, who are auctioneers. There was a sale on the 22nd of March in Surrey-street, Strand—they were employed as auctioneers by the executor, John Budd—I was there as their agent—there was a time-piece, which I removed to the back parlour the night before the sale—it was safe when the sale began, about half-past twelve o'clock, and about half-past one o'clock I missed it</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I fell in with the prisoner, and saw him talking to Davies, near Crown-street, Westminster—he had something in a black handkerchief—I asked him what he had got—he said "A time-piece"—I took him to the station—I asked to look at what he had got, and he refused at first to let me look, and then I told him I should take him to the watch-house, and he showed me the time-piece—I asked where he got it—he said I had no right to ask him that question, and he should not tell me—when I got him to the station, he said he bought it at Brixton, that day fortnight, at a sale—I found on him a catalogue of a sale, but not the sale where this time-piece was stolen—I made inquiry, and found out this sale.</p>

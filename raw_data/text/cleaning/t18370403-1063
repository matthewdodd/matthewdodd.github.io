                  </hi>. I am owner of the house in Grove-street, Hollows. It was unoccupied at this time—I went there, in consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation from a police-officer, on the 17th of March, and found the front door open, and the lock off—it had been screwed to the door—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the plate was partly broken off before—it is now quite so—I am certain it is my lock—I have the key which fits it—there were only three screws in the lock—I had put it on a few days before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On Friday afternoon, the 17th of March, I took charge of the prisoner, and searched him in the parlour of the house, No. 25, South-street—I found a lock on the sideboard there, and three screws on the prisoner, with six skeleton keys—I matched the screws with the lock, and they fitted it—the prisoner told me he had taken the glass down from over the mantel-piece of that room, but said be knew nothing about the lock—I took it away with me, and afterwards found Mr. Rooks, who had a key belonging to it.</p>

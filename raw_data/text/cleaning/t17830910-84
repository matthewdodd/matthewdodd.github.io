               <p>I missed the breeches on the 7th of August last, at half past five in the afternoon, I saw the breeches in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he live in the same house? - No, I never saw him before in my life, I overtook him by Mr. Dickinson's brewhouse.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect him? - I saw them in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take them? - No, I said he had more in his pocket than was his own, he said, damn you, you old bitch, what is that to you, he run away, and I cried stop thief, he was taken in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he in your sight all the time? - Yes, he took them from under his arm, and threw them into a ditch, and stamped upon them, about two minutes before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was you present when the breeches were thrown into the ditch? - No.</p>
               <p>Who does the breeches belong to? - Me, I had just washed them, they were hanging out to dry.</p>
               <p>Who did you wash them for? - A young boy in the country.</p>
               <p>Where were they hanging? - On the pales before my door.</p>
               <p>Did you see them taken away? - I saw them in his pocket as he was going out of the Crown and Woolpack yard, I am satisfied these are the breeches I washed, there is the hole behind.</p>

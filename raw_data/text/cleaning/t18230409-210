On the 11th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I received five sovereigns and eleven shillings at Chelsea Hospital. I spent some of it in drink, and was rather fresh. I was going home, and lost it between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. I do not remember meeting any woman - I was going to look for a woman, whom I had promised to go home with, but could not find her. I either fell down or was knocked down, and the officer picked me up. I cannot say whether I had been in company with any woman or not.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Pimlico.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090085"></xptr>I was passing Buckingham-gate, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prosecutor coming out of a public-house, very drunk, and coming down the steps he fell, and cut his head very much - the prisoner followed him out of the house, and endeavoured to raise him up. I asked if she knew any thing of him; she said, No, and seeing him in that state I proposed to search his pockets to see if we could find where he belonged to, which I did, and his pockets were empty. A person who came out of the public-house, said they had seen him with sovereigns; I then suspected the prisoner must have robbed him, searched her, and found a bag concealed under her arm, containing three sovereigns, a crown, and four half crown pieces. I delivered it to the landlord, gave her in charge, and sent the prosecutor to the Infirmary. The bag and money was delivered to me.</p>

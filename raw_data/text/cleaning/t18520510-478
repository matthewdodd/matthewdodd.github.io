                  </hi>. I live at 130, Aldersgate-street—my nephew is a baker there. On 17th March the prisoner came to my house with a check between 6 and a quarter before 7 o'clock—he said he came from Mr. Ruther<lb></lb>ford, a baker in Barbican, and he wanted change for the check—he said it was for a very particular customer, and Mr. Rutherford would be very much obliged to me if I would change it—this is the check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated 17th March, 1852, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Thomas Cureton on Messrs. Praed and Co.—my housekeeper was in my shop at the time—I saw her take the check out of the prisoner's band, and she handed it to me—I took it in the parlour, looked at it, and brought it in the shop, and told him Mr. Rutherford ought to put his name to it—he said Mr. Rutherford would have put his name, but he was not certain that I had the cash—I went up stairs, and brought down nine sovereigns, two halt sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and gave him the ten guineas for it—I sent it to the bankers'—the prisoner was dressed as a baker, with a flannel jacket, and a white night cap, such as bakers generally wear, and his face was <hi rend="italic">dabbed</hi> with flour, as if he had left work without washing himself—I took particular notice of him, because I thought I might know him, being a baker—I had not seen him before—I saw him afterwards, when I went with the officer to his lodging—he came down in his shirt sleeves—I identified him—the 17th was on a Wednesday, and I think it was on the Thursday week following that I saw him again—I had given a description of him before I saw him again—the officer called on me, and I gave him a description of him.</p>

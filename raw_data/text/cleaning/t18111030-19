               <p>DAVID HARRIS. I am the brother of John Harris, I serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your brother any partner. - A. No. On the morning that the last witness has mentioned, I observed the prisoner shuffling something on the counter, I could not tell what it was. When she was going to pay for what she had bought she dropped a dollar or some silver, she was going to pick the silver up, she stooped down and put something under her petticoats. In her way to the door I laid hold of her, she stood some time, and from under her petticoats the silk handkerchiefs dropped, I picked them up and kept them till the constable came.</p>

             I am an apprentice to the prosecutors. On the afternoon of Wednesday last the last witness shewed me where a bundle of hair was, I found it under the manger under the stable, I took it to the accompting-house and shewed it to Mr Wells. It was in separate lots, I put a dark piece of twine round each bundle, I gave it to Luckett and desired him to place it where he took it from, this was between seven and eight o'clock. Mr. Wells brought the prisoner to the accompting-house about a quarter before eight o'clock, he desired a porter to search him, the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and afterwards pulled the hair out of his breeches. It had the dark thread on it, I knew it to be my master's property</p>

             Collom After I had been informed of this hair being found and replaced I went to the stable, Luckett gave me a signal, the prisoner came out of the table, I took him over to the accompting-house and called the porter to search him, he took off his coat and waistcoat, I told him he had it about his person, he then took it out of his small clothes. This is the parcel, it is the kind of hair that we use in our manufactory, I believe it is our property, it is worth upwards of four shillings. The prisoner earned thirty-four shillings a week, and his wife ten shillings and six pence, he had been with us two years</p>

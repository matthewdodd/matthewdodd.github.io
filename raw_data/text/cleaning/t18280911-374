               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you tipsy? A. I was sober enough to know what I was doing - I was as conscious of it as I am now; she took me to Providence-row - I have heard she was married.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the rat was her husband who came and took your trousers to punish you? A. My opinion is, that he was in the room under the bed at the time - Ann Carey went to the pawnbroker's to get me a pair of breeches to put on; the pawnbroker lent them to me, as I had no money.</p>

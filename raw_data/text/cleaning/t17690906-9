            . I am journeyman to Mr. Mould. On Thursday was se'nnight the prisoner came under pretence to buy some handkerchiefs. I shewed her variety. After she had been some time in the shop, I saw something under her arm. I could not directly say what it was till some time after, when I saw the end of one handkerchief hang under her cloak. I still shewed her more. I ask'd her 4 s. for one, she bid me 3 s. and was going out. I then said, You have stolen some handkerchiefs. I took hold of her, and took them from her. She ran away, but I pursued her, and brought her back again. (The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to.) She had them close up under her arm.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to buy me a handkerchief. I bid him 3 s. but he ask'd 3 s. 6 d. for one. He took it from me, and said, This good woman wanted to steal a handkerchief.

            . I have known her the eight weeks since she came to town. She comes from Nottinghamshire. I also knew her there. She was at my house the day of this unhappy affair. She went out, and said she was going to a place. I saw no more of her till I saw her in custody. I never knew any thing of this kind of her before. She had been in a place but three days, and came away sick to my house.</p>

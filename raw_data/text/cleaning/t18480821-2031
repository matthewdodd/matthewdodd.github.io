                  </hi>. I live in Mill-lane, Deptford, and am a labouring man. The prisoner was a lodger in that house—on 17th July he came home in the afternoon—I was sitting in the kitchen with my wife—the prisoner began to use ill words, and said he had a little thing that would settle some one in the house—I did not answer him—he went out, and came back again be<lb></lb>tween nine and ten in the evening—he was not the worse for liquor—I believe he had taken something—I saw him strike a child who was there—I got up, and said, "If you hit him again, I shall hit you"—he said, "I am quite ready for you"—I struck him, he fell—he put the knife into me twice, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> I have done it <hi rend="italic">for</hi> you"—I found I was wounded in my right shoulder and breast, and my shirt was all blood—I was under the doctor for five weeks—the places are no: well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Deptford. I saw the prosecutor on the evening of 17th July—I found a wound on the arm about three inches long, and two inches deep along the bone—he had been bleeding profusely—I suppose he had lost nearly three pints of blood—he was also bleeding from the right breast, where there was a wound about two inches and a half long, and half an inch deep—they appeared to me to be inflicted with a clasp-knife—I do not think this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) could have inflicted them—the wound on the arm was very dangerous—he was under my care some time, and is not yet recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mill-lane, Deptford. I am landlord of the prosecutor and the prisoner—on 17th July I recollect the prisoner being in the kitchen—he asked me to have some beer—he then offered it to my wife, and then to the prosecutor—the prosecutor said, "No, I want no beer from you, if I want beer I can pay for it"—I went out, and as I came in I met the prosecutor—he said, "I will stand it no longer to please anybody "—I said, "It is not worth while to strike a drunken man, you may as well strike a child "—we then went in—I said to the prisoner, "Let me sit down "—he got up, and the prosecutor directly knocked him down without the least pro<lb></lb>vocation—the prosecutor said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed!

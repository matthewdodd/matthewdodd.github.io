               <p>Q. On the 14th of June did you pay into the house of Messrs. Scott and co. a bankers draft of two hundred and eighteen pounds one shilling and six-pence - A. I did, the check I have in my hand. (The draft read.)</p>
               <p>Q. That was on account of leather sold by Mr. Dyson to that house - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Dyson had drawn the check and given it you did you take it to the house of Scott, Garnet and Palmer - A. I did; I gave it into the hands of the prisoner, and I requested him to write their bankers name across the check, which he did in my presence; I then withdrew. This is the check, there is Hankey and Co. across it.</p>

I acted by the directions of the person that gave me the draft, and in consequence of the mark at the back of it; Messrs.

            , we are cornfactors in Aldermanbury. The prisoner, I should think, has been our clerk twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ Mr. Dyson to sell some leather that you had from the country - A. We did, but as the transaction had passed some time we were not aware that Mr. Dyson had the selling of them. We employed more brokers than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner on the 14th of June account to you for two hundred and eighteen pounds one shilling and sixpence, having received it of Mr. Dyson - A. Not in the account of June. On the 2d of July, in looking over the ledger I observed that there was a quantity of leather that appeared not to be accounted for; I asked the prisoner who had sold it; he stated at the time that he was ignorant who had sold it, it was either Scott and Clark, or Mr. Dyson, or Mr.

            , but he would go and enquire; I desired him not to go out, there were notes in the house that would ascertain it, and desired him to ascertain it. In about the course of an hour from this time he said he had been out, he had ascertained that Mr. Dyson had sold it, and he had received the money. On the 6th of July I asked him what he had done with Mr. Dyson's draft; he stated that he had paid it to Messrs. Hankey and Co. I remarked that he had not debitted it to them; he said it was his omission; I desired him to do it; he took the cash book and debited it to them. In the cash book you will see cash, two hundred and eighteen pounds one shilling and sixpence; upon the third, and under the second, as if it was an omission this entry was made, on the 6th of July.</p>

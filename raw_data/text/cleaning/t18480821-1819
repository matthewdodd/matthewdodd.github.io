On 10th July, about nine or ten o'clock in the evening, I went to the Crown public-house, Crown-court, Fleet-street—Cremer lives two or three doors past there—I found the prisoner there—there were a great many people in the room—I should think he would know me—I crossed the room to speak to a person, turned round, and the prisoner was gone—I searched for him for several days—bills were printed, offering a reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—on the morning of 27th I went to the Money Order-office at Liverpool with one of the Liverpool Police, and saw the prisoner—I said to a gentleman, who had a money order in his hand, "This is John Prenderville, whom I am seeking"—he said, "That is not my name, you do not know me"—he gave his name "Thomas Connor—I do not think he gave any name at the Money Order-office—I accom<lb></lb>panied him to the station, and said, "Prenderville, <hi rend="italic">we received" or</hi> "Mr. <hi rend="italic">Edwards</hi> received your last letter"—I think I said <hi rend="italic">we</hi> first—he said, "What is in that letter is quite true"—I said I took him for stealing a letter con<lb></lb>taining a check for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not say anything—I took four letters from his pocket, addressed "Thomas Connor, 18, Rupert-street, Liverpool"—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducted</hi>)—he was afterwards searched by a policeman, who handed me nine sovereigns—next day I took him to the railway to bring him to London—</p>

               <p>at the station he said, "I did not steal the letter, on the Tuesday that I went to Moses', I met a man near Temple-bar, who I knew very well, he asked me to go and have something to drink; I went with him to a public-house, and after having some brandy-and-water, he said, 'I have a check, but I cannot get. it cashed, it must go through a bankers', I have been to the bankers', and they will not cash it;' that he told him he found the check, and said, 'If you <hi rend="italic">are amind</hi> to go with me to Moses', and order some clothes, we can get it cashed there;' we went to Moses', and were measured for the clothes, and finding a delay there, I had suspicions that all was not right, but as I had gone on so far with it, I would not leave it; in a minute after<lb></lb>wards I turned round, and missed the man, and was then quite certain that it was not right; the balance of the check was brought to me; I went down stairs, met the same man in the street, and shared the money with him; on the Friday afterwards I saw him again, but I caught a glimpse of a sorter at the chief office, I cannot recollect who; I then said to this man, 'I can see where this check came from, it came out of a letter; he said, 'Yes, and you had better say nothing about it, or else it will be the worse for you' "—I brought him to London—he said he gave the name of Marshall, as that was the first name that came into his head—I got this letter from Cork (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), after I had been to Liverpool, but 1 had seen it before, on the 18th—it was shown him at the Post-office, and he said it was his writing.</p>

Paddington are delivered at the North-road Branch office—the prisoner was employed there, and was on duty there on 1st July—it was his duty to assist in sorting the letters of that division—this letter would go to that district—it should go to an office at Paddington, where the letter-carriers meet, and not to the office where the pri<lb></lb>soner was, but letters are sometimes missorted—sometimes we have 60 mis<lb></lb>sorted—letters addressed to Mr. Ponsford have come to the office since this—Mr. Ponsford is in the Paddington district—the prisoner was last on duty on 10th July—he came on 11th, but Peak came to see him, and he went out saying he was indisposed—on 1st July, he was a supernumary letter-carrier, on the Edgware-road, in the vicinity of South Wharf-road—he continued there till the 4th, doing duty for a sick man—if a letter addressed to Mr. ponsford accidentally got into his possession, it would be his duty to give it up for me to return it to St. Martin's-le-graud—this letter, addressed to me, is in the prisoner's writing—I first saw it at Bow-street, after Peak had been to Liverpool—the letter to Messrs.

But this I declare to you and to the God who knows it well, and before whom I must at some future day appear, and I hope before I appear in Newgate, that I had no knowledge of how the cheque was obtained until the Friday night following the fatal 4th July; and up to that melancholy day, my character and integrity was as pure and unstained as it was at the age of seven. But lo! there was a fatal hour, and that was the hour of two o'clock; the bargain was con<lb></lb>cluded, and I have sold that which I thought the wealth of Peru could not purchase—my character. My colleague in iniquity, who was a person totally unconnected with the office, but who was concerned in some same way with a mercantile house, deluded me into the belief that chance threw it in his own way; first taking good care to use those stimulants necessary on such occa<lb></lb>sions—brandy and water. The fact was, as I have subsequently discovered, and when too late, that it came from head quarters, the sorting office. Finding I was made a complete tool of, and that I could scarcely escape de<lb></lb>tection, I considered it more advisable to inhale the breeze of my native mountains, than the air of Bermuda, having by mere accident met this woful acquaintance of mine; and I believe when every other remedy was tried by himself, induced me to accompany him to the Minories.—I am, Sir, &amp;c, J.

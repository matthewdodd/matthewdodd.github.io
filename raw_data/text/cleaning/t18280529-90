On the 22d of April I was on duty near the Bluecoat Boy public-house, at ten o'clock at night: I saw the prisoner going along very fast in the road, with something under his arm; I went and stopped him, and found he had a bit of beef, which he said the turnpike man gave him; I said I did not believe it- he said, "Well, I will tell you the truth; a boy was carrying it in a tray along the lower road, and I snatched it and ran away."</p>

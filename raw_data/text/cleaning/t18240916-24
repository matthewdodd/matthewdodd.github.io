On leaving town for France about the end of June I left these articles in a trunk, to be carried to my uncle's house. I returned on the 1st of August, and missed them - my writing desk had been broken open, which was in the box, containing the linen; that box had been locked when I went away, and the lock had not been injured. I saw the prisoner on the 2d of August; I suspected him, and enquired when the trunk had been brought to my uncle's house, and found it had not been brought for three weeks after I left it. When I saw him I told him I suspected he had robbed me; he said he had not done me any injury; I then delivered him into custody. I have seen the property since, and know it to be mine. There were other things in the box, which he did not take. I cannot tell exactly how many articles I saw, but I am sure they were all mine, they were worth 4 l. or 5 l. I accompanied the officers to Fair-street, where the prisoner was in service, and in the pocket of a coat which he said was his was found a crystal box, which is mine.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the male prisoner at Lord Hutchinson's, in Bulstrode-street. I went with the Colonel and the prisoner to his lodgings in Fair-street. On searching his coat which hung in the room I found this box, which was immediately claimed by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160011"></xptr>Colonel - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I found it on your table Colonel." I then questioned the people of the house, in the hearing of the prisoner, and they said they had seen this box in the hands of a woman, called, the cook, but they did not know her name. I then went to a place where the male prisoner said she lived, but that was not true. I afterwards went to North-street, Manchester-square, and found the female prisoner; I told her James was in custody, showed her the box, and said, I was come for the rest of the things - she hesitated for a moment, and then put her hand into her pocket, and gave me two combs, a necklace, a pair of silver buckles, and two seals - they were claimed by Colonel Hutchinson. I went down to the kitchen, and in her box I found six shirts, eleven handkerchiefs, a compass, two other boxes, a silver pen, and a knife, which were claimed by Colonel Hutchinson. Most of the linen is marked H. H. H.; she said,</p>
               <p>"All these James brought to me this morning, and has brought me into this trouble."</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner FLATTERY. Some of this property is not Colonel Hutchinson's; some of it is my own - is this shirt the Colonel's? -</p>
               <p>COLONEL HUTCHINSON. Yes, it is to the best of my belief; there is the remains of H. on it.</p>
               <p>FLATTERY'S Defence. I lived with the Colonel about a month, and was discharged in consequence of his going to France - he took all his things except a portmanteau and a little writing case. He said,</p>
               <p>"James, will you take this writing case to my Lord's," and I did so - the portmanteau was left in his bed-room; I suppose it was locked. There was afterwards some dispute about the rent, and I said it was right that the portmanteau should be fetched away - there were several other persons in the house. One night when I came home I found a bundle of these things in a corner - I tied them up in a handkerchief, but I did not like to say anything about it; it passed on for two months - I never opened the bundle, and did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT'S Defence. These things were brought to me about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day I was taken, by James - he said they were foul clothes. I had called on the female servant who lived in the house where James lived, and saw this little box, and she asked me if I would have it - I said I would not.</p>
               <p>COLONEL HUTCHINSON re-examined. I am certain the writing-desk was locked in the portmanteau, and that all the articles were in it when I left. There were some rings and money in the writing-desk.</p>

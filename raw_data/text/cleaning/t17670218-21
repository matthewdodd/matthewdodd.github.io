We opened the bundle; there were four shifts, two petticoats, a pair of ruffles, three caps, a gown, and three table-cloths in it; my master sent for a constable, and secured her; the things mentioned in the indictment were found upon the prisoner, they are my property; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176702180012"></xptr> up into my room, which is three pair of stairs high, and missed the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Stephen. I am a constable; Mr. Hunt sent for me; she lay a great bundle: I asked the prisoner how that came there; she said she did not know; I asked her how she came there; she said, the gentlewoman said she would give he. I have I went to search her; she said she was a woman and would not be search I still search things mentioned) the and deposed to) they were under her that, there was a pair of shoes brought down stairs; I asked her who they belonged to; she said they did not belong to her; she had no shoes on; she said she walked without shoes; I felt on her feet, and they were clean; had she came without shoes, her feet must have been wet and dirty; I took her to the Compter that night, and the next day before Mr. Alderman Alsop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Radgate. Where were the shoes found?</p>

               <p>Goodson. Her excuse to me was, that some boys had pinned these things to her; she had them tied under her apron string.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on the 27th of December, I was near the station-house, at Hackney - I heard a talking and noise; I proceeded to the spot; I knew the prisoner's voice, and as soon as I got there, the prosecutrix said she had lost her pattens and umbrella - I stood there some minutes; she was talking with the prisoner; my inspector was there - he searched the prisoner's jacket, but seemed satisfied, and went away; I began to talk to the prosecutrix - I asked her where she lived - the prisoner insisted on her going with him, saying he would see her home; I told him to go away, and I would see her home - he would not, and we had a scuffle - one of my brother officers came and we took him to the station-house; one of my brother officers saw the bottle drop from him - the prosecutrix did not appear to be in liquor.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Police. On the evening in question, I was going on particular business, and found the prosecutrix and the prisoner in the street; she said she had lost her pattens and umbrella; I stood for a moment; the prisoner knew me very well, and I knew him; and as his short jacket pocket was rather bulky, I came round to him and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "The pattens" - and took out this bottle; I searched for the pattens, but could not find them - he began to be rather abusive, and being particularly engaged at that moment, I left him, and the other officers came up.</p>

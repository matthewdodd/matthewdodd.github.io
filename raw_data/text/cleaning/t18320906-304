On Wednesday, the 25th of July, about ten minutes to eight o'clock, I was opening his shop, and as I took the shutters round into the court - I did not see the prisoner go into our shop, but he came out with four pairs of trousers, three coats, and two yards and a quarter of blue cloth under his right arm; he walked out; but when he saw me running after him he ran up New Exchange-court, and threw them down - I still followed him, laid hold of his coat, and kept him till a gentleman came; he lifted his hand, and attempted to strike me, but never got away - the things are worth more than 8l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I throw the things down before you came up to me? A. Yes; he dropped them, and ran up the court - I caught him in Heathcock-court, about a dozen yards from the Strand - it is a throughfare.</p>

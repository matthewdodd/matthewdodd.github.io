                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Judgment-office of the Court of Queen's Bench. I produce the book in which judgments are signed in the Court of Queen's Bench—I have an entry of a judgment signed in an action of Watts against Wittenbury, on the 27th of August, 1842.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make the entry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Barlow, the first clerk, did—I can swear to his handwriting—I am the second clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you always present at the signing of judgments in the judgment-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am in no other office—I am in the habit of signing judgments—I am always in the habit of being in the office when they are signed, unless I might be called out—Mr. Barlow is now in attendance at the office—I can fetch him—this judgment has since been set aside on a Judge's order, dated 16th of September—this is the order—I did not sign the reversal of the judgment—it was struck out by Mr. Barlow—I will not undertake to say that I was present when it was struck out—it is very likely the judgment-paper might be signed by me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing I want to sign judgment at your office, I bring with me a piece of paper called a judgment-paper, do I not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in this case it would be necessary, and we copy from the judgment-paper into the book—the book is a copy of the judgment-paper—we make the entry from the judgment-paper—a judgment-roll is also brought—we merely require an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on that—we stamp the judgment-roll—the contents of the judgment-paper, and the judgment-roll are identical—an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on the judgment-paper, and an <hi rend="italic">incipitor</hi> on the judgment-roll is all that is required—we sign judgment on that—we always ask for the judgment-paper—that is our authority, because we write on that—we stamp the judgment-paper—we mark the day of the month—we stamp the judgment-roll with the same stamp that we stamp the judgment-paper with—the impression is "Queen's Bench Judgment-office"—it is the stamp of our office—we make the entry in the book from that paper, we take care to have it correct from the judg-ment-paper—they do not always go to far as the amount on the judgment-roll</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301300008"></xptr>
               <p>—the judgment-paper contains all that there is in this entry—I do not think it contains more, generally speaking—the entry would be a copy of the judgment-paper—it is copied from it—in the body of the judgment-paper they do not always have the name of the town attorney, therefore we take the name of the attorney who signs the judgment—when final judgment issues we should give a number—we want that on the judgment-paper—we do not care about its being on the roll—the number-roll is asked for, and the num<lb></lb>ber is placed on the judgment-paper—we have a docket-roll, and the attorney would ask for a number-roll, I write his name over the number, and he takes the judgment-paper—every term we have a docket commencing with No. 1, and going up as high as 5000, that enables me to get at these records afterwards—to the best of my knowledge executions are issued in ten cases out of twelve without the judgment-roll being filed—I believe, in order to procure execution, it is requisite to produce the judgment-paper, but I do not belong to that office—it is not necessary to produce my book to get exe<lb></lb>cution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Because you have already stamped the judgment-paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The judgment-roll, in the first place, has the seal of the Court of Queen's Bench on it before it is written on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, before it is completed—judgment-rolls are sold by a particular stationer named Dun-combe—I believe he is appointed to sell them, in order that they may be all of one size—he sells them to different stationers—I should not stamp them unless I saw his mark on them at the time, which is, "Delivered by Dun-combe," or something to that effect—I do not recollect exactly, but I know it so well, seeing the name of the gentleman, it is so constantly under my eye—the Exchequer-rolls are very much larger, and have "Exchequer-office" on the top.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you produce this book the other day in the Queen's Bench? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—here was an objection made to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the name of the office in which you are concerned! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Judgment-office, and this book is called the Judgment-book—we are appointed under the masters of the Court of Queen's Bench.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the act done which is called the signing judgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The production of the judgment-paper and the judgment-roll, our entry is that book, the writing on the judgment-paper, the stamping, and taking it away, and that is considered "judgment signed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are asked what is the act of signing judgment! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, the entering in this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the production of the judgment-roll and paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, which are severally stamped by the office seal of the judgment-office—this judgment was signed on the 27th of August, I think—the entry is, "London, John Watts, against James Wittenbury, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—set aside by J. O.," which means "Judge's order," "dated the 16th of September"—then there is the number of the roll, the attorney's name, and the fee, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you present when it was signed by Lord Denman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it appears that Mr. Justice Cresswell heard the summons, because he has made an order on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and there is a previous endorsement "adjourned for a month"—the last on which I acted was this "Order, Judg<lb></lb>ment set aside with costs, C.C."—it was on that the order to impound was made—this is the original order of Mr. Justice Cresswell—it is the order that followed the hearing of the summons—it is my own handwriting—[<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi>, 16<hi rend="italic">th of Sept.</hi>, 1842, <hi rend="italic">on hearing the counsel for the plaintiff, and the attorney or agent for the defendant, and on reading the affidavits of Witten<lb></lb>bury, Egan, Watts, Williams, Simmers and James, ordering the judgment to be set aside with costs; also, the writ of ca. sa., issued upon the said judg<lb></lb>ment, and directing that the Sheriff of Kent should pay back to the defen<lb></lb>dant the sum of</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">levied by virtue of the said writ.</hi>]</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does this bear the impression of my Lord's stamp, kept at chambers for the purpose of stamping orders of this description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it has been duly issued out of his chambers by me.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the striking out of the words "taxed and," do you believe that to be your striking out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I inserted the figures "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I should have struck those words out—it would then have stood "with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. costs to be paid" instead of "taxed, and to be paid"—I rather think the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is my writing, but the word "agreed" has been introduced by somebody else—I draw up per<lb></lb>haps forty or fifty orders by consent at chambers in the course of a week—they are all drawn up in the same way, stamped in the same form, quite ir<lb></lb>respective of the fact, whether my lord happened to be in chambers or not—I am authorized to swear affidavits—I am a commissioner, and administer an oath.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you issue any order except an order that purports to proceed on consent of the parties, without consulting the Lord Chief Justice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on affidavit of service and non-attendance—they are orders which are deemed matters of course, on certain forms being complied with—we keep printed forms for such purposes, with Lord Denman's signature attached, by a stamp, which is a fac-simile of his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The chambers of the Lord Chief Justice are considered as an office, and on complying with certain forms, such orders would be issued? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have known orders of this description to be issued from his lordship's cham<lb></lb>bers, as a matter of course, for five or six years, and orders generally for ten years, within my own knowledge—I cannot say how long we have issued these orders—I have always understood that the signature was stamped upon them by his lordship's approbation, and that I was acting under his autho<lb></lb>rity in issuing them, or I should not have given them—I think this form of order has been placed in my control about five or six years—Mr. Thorn<lb></lb>ton, his lordship's private clerk, gave me the orders for the purpose of being issued from time to time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am first clerk in the Judgment-office—the act of signing judgment consists of copying the venue, the plaintiff's and defendant's names, the sum judgment is signed for, the costs, if there are any, at the time, and the attorney's name who signs the judgment, who is the plaintiff's attorney—it is copied into this book, which is called the day-book of the office of the judgments, and other entries—it is generally called the judg<lb></lb>ment-book—I signed the judgment in the cause of Watts against Wittenbury—I afterwards struck it out, by virtue of a Judge's order—this is as it origi<lb></lb>nally stood, "London. John Watts against James Wittenbury, for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debt, and 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs. Judgment on promises pursuant to order"—London is the venue—Watts and Wittenbury are the plaintiff's and defendant's names—it is signed by S. H. Williams, on the 27th August, 1842—I struck out the words, "pursuant to order"—that was entered by authority of a Judge's order—we do not copy the Judge's name—the words I wrote before I struck them out, are "J. T. a.," that is for "assumpsit," either on promises or the case; "p.," for "pursuant;" "t. o.," for "to order"—that imports that the plaintiff's attorney brought a Judge's order at the time—the judgment was signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff's attorney—all judgments are signed on the responsibility of the plaintiff's attorney—I have since then struck out the whole of that with my own hands, because they gave me the order to look at, and the order said it should be struck out—I have no doubt this is the order on which I struck out that judgment—we took possession of the order, and filed it in the office—I did not put any mark on it when I exe<lb></lb>cuted</p>

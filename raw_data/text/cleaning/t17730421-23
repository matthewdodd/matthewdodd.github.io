The prisoner's wife came to us at Mrs. Payne's, and wanted to speak to us; Mr. and Mrs. Payne and I went; I took up some pieces of the gowns; and the men said the linen gown was sold, and a pair of stays to one person; and the rest were in pawn for a very thrifle, a guinea and a half: the prisoner clapped his hands and said, Lord! what must I do for a guinea and a half, to fetch these things out of pawn. I asked them to tell me where they were pawned; and I would fetch them out; they would not, but said I must follow the law; I have as far as I could; but I have not recovered one of the things.

Laurence took some pieces of her gowns with her that were left in the box; the prisoner and the other man took the pieces of gowns in their hands, and said, the one was sold and the other was pawned with the rest of the things for a guinea and a half; I asked them where they were pawned; they said they would not tell me; for if they did the pawnbroker would prosecute them; I asked who they had sold the gown and stays to; and they said they would not tell me; they said it was no business of mine.

            . I assisted in the taking the prisoner and Wallace: I took the prisoner on the 24th of March, at his lodgings; he desired me not to make a noise; for the man of the house to hear of it; but bid me come up stairs and he would do what he could to make it up; he took hold of my hand and said do all you can for me; and ask Mr. Payne not to prosecute me; do not let me go to goal, for I can get the things out for a meer trifle, about a guinea and a half.

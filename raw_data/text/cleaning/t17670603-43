            , there they were examined; upon their examination, I went and took Peak on the Monday morning, either in Cross-lane, or Newtoner's-lane, in bed with a girl; he seemed to deny all; he said he happened to be in Petticoat-lane, and saw some of them, but he knew nothing of the affair; Sir John gave me an order to take Israel Cowen and Lazarus Abraham to Newgate; then I went to the Black Raven in Chick-lane, and there I took Williams; he had a coat on his back that belongs to the gentleman who has an indictment against him; (a bell with a spring to it produced;) this bell was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030035"></xptr> nailed up against a window in Cowen's room, and a pane of glass broke, and on nights they used to put a rope down into the alley, and on the daytime draw it up; this the evidence told me, so I took it down to produce here; the two rooms joined together where Hyam Jacob and the prisoner lived.</p>

             I am Williams's mother; I live at Islington, and sell greens; my boy has been at sea since he was ten or eleven years old; he came home the latter end of August or September last; he was at my house almost three weeks; about a fortnight ago he hurt his finger, and had a lame arm; he was never out, only going to Shadwell or Ratcliff-highway among his shipmates; he was generally in by nine at night; he was never out later as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he lie in at your house?</p>
               <p>E. Williams. He lay up one pair of stairs; my house is between the White Swan and the Blakeney's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house a double house?</p>
               <p>E. Williams. I have nothing to do with the house but three rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did he lie in?</p>
               <p>E. Williams. He lay in a one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>E. Williams. There is only one room upon a floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he last Saturday fortnight?</p>
               <p>E. Williams. He was then at my house, and went down to Rotherhithe; I never heard any body give him a bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he lay in your house last Wednesday se'nnight?</p>
               <p>E. Williams. Yes, I am sure he did.</p>

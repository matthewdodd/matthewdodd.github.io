On the 19th October, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was looking in at a shop window in Long<lb></lb>acre—the prisoner was standing at my left-hand side—I thought I felt something at my pocket, and missed my pocket handkerchief—I turned round, and saw it in his hand—I gave him in charge immediately—he dropped it—there were several persons behind him—I am quite sure it dropped from his hand—this is it.</p>

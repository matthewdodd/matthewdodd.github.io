             brought these breeches to me to sell. I knowing there had been other things brought before, I said she must stay till I sent for a person to see if they knew the things, saying, I believed they were not her property. She said, they were not her own, and if I would give her leave, she would go and fetch the woman that sent her, she was near at hand. I suspected them to be Mr. Lloyd's. She sent a little girl for the prisoner, who came before Mr. Lloyd did. I asked her if these were her property? She said, they were. I said, I am afraid not; do you know Mr. Lloyd? She said, Yes. - Do you work for him? - Yes - Are they not his goods? She made no answer. I bid her sit down; Mr. Lloyd came in, and asked her how she came to offer his goods to sale? He told them both he would transport them. The prisoner said the other was ignorant of their being stolen. Then she owned to the taking of them after she had been paid for making them; that she took them off the counter, and brought them away.</p>

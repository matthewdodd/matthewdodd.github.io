After delivering that paper to the prisoner, I allowed himself to go to his parent's house—Mr. Nuseey gave him some money when he left me—he was told to go horns and collect his ideas, and write out all he knew of the matter—he was soon after taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. When did yon give that paper? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It was given to him en the 12th of December, when it is dated—he was taken into custody about the 15th—this is the placard be refers to in the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking of it)—(The placard stated, that on the night of the</hi>13<hi rend="italic">th of November cer✗✗ superfine black cloths, of the value of</hi>150<hi rend="italic">l., had been stolen from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's premises, and offering a reward of twenty guiness for the disme✗y of the offenders, and the recovery of the property</hi>.)—The paper was written about eight o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner was allowed to go home, but one of the policeman in Dorset-place, Charing-cross, where his brother lodges, had been informed of the robbery, and they took him that night, and the policeman came down to me—he did not bring me the paper—he asked if I had given one—I told him I had, and the prisoner was allowed to go at liberty—he came back to me the following day, to make the confession—he was about to make a statement to me, and I said, "You appear too much excited to do it now; go home and write it down"—Mr. Nussey went that afternoon and took him—I was not present—I was shown a paper containing information about this property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I received a copy of this from the prisoner after he was in custody—I think it is in the hands of my solicitor—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>.)—"I, George Daly, on my oath do now declare, before my master, Mr. W. J. Anson, to tell all I know concerning the robbery, at No. 106, Wood-street, Cheapside:—Mr. Bartram's, of Princes-street, Soho, in the name of Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin; Mr. Young's, of Princes-street, Soho, two or three of cloth, in the names of Davis, or Freer, four or five cuts buck<lb></lb>skin, and one or two cloth; Mr. Stevens, of Wardour-street, Soho, in the names of Davis, or Freer, four or five cuts buckskin, and one or two of cloth; Mr. Harrison, of Wardour-street, Soho, in the names of Davis, or Freer, five or six cuts of buckskin, and three or four cloth; Mr. Clunes, of Brydges-street, Covent-garden, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin; Mr. Sayers, of Drury-lane, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin; Mr. Newby, of Drury-lane, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin; Mr. Walmsley, of Drury-lane, in the names of Davis, or Freer, one cut of buckskin; Mr.——, of Drury-lane, in the names of Davis, or Freer, two or three cuts of buckskin and cloth; Mr. Aldous, of Berwick-street, Soho, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin, and one or two cloth; Mr.——, of Green-street, Leicester-square, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four cuts of buckskin, and one or two cloth; Mr. Flemings, of Brewer-street, Golden-square, in the names of Davis, or Freer, one or two buckskin; Mr. Archbutt, of Westminster<lb></lb>bridge-road, in the names of Davis, or Freer, one cut of buckskin; Mr. Ashby, of Long-acre, in the names of Davis, or Freer, three or four outs of buckskin; Mr. Burgess, of Long-acre, in the names of Davis, or Freer, one or two cuts of buckskin, and one cloth."—It was on the receipt of this paper I was led to discover my property—it was written prior to his being taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE.</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. When you first mentioned to the prisoner the robbery, which took place on the 13th of November, what did he say? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. He seemed very much excited about it, and said he hoped it would be found out, and so on—I did not ask whether he had any participation in it—I had no sus<lb></lb>picion of him—I bad suspicion in the morning after he came to me, for he came to me a few minutes after he had received the keys of the ware<lb></lb>house, and asked if I locked it over night—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, the warehouse-door is open, and half-a-pile of superfine blacks is gone"—I immediately went to the warehouse, and found it was quite dark, the shutters not being down, and 1 could not myself have discovered that the pile was so much reduced—I have not found any of the property lost that night—he has given no information of the property mentioned in the placard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Why have the man taken into custody after he had given you the account of the things, but given you no account of the robbery of the 13th of November? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The reason is, I told him that what he had put on the paper was not what I meant; I wished him to confess about the robbery of the eleven ends of cloth—he said he knew nothing of it—I said, "Well, I am not bound by the promise I gave you, " and I took him my<lb></lb>self to the station-house—two yards and a half of buckskin would be worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner did not board with me.</p>

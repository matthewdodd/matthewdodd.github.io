                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">linen-draper, High-street, Southwark.</hi> On the morning of the 23rd of Feb., about a quarter past seven o'clock, I was in the cashier's desk, in my shop, where I could see what happened, but could not be seen—I saw the prisoner come into the shop, go up to the counter, and the young man who usually served put a box of ribbons on the counter—after the pri<lb></lb>soner had looked at the ribbons, in the young man's absence, he put some ribbon into his right-hand great coat pocket—the young man had not gone away, but turned to get something—I directly went round the counter, and said, "Good morning, sir; how do you do?"—I spoke to him familiarly, and after talking to him a little while, he tendered a shilling to the young man who served him, to pay for what he bought, which came to 51/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent the shilling up stairs by the cashier for change, and while he was gone the prisoner walked out into the street, and spit—as soon as he sat his foot on the pavement I collared him, and said, "You have stolen my ribbons"—he said he had not—I said he had—I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge—he had come back himself—I saw him searched, and a piece of blue ribbon taken out of his coat pocket, and out of his other pocket I distinctly saw him take a piece of pink ribbon, and lay it on the counter.</p>

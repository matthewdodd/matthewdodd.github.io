He was to have workmen come to repair it; he desired me to go to Mr. Denton's, in Grey's-Inn-lane, where he had a lodging, to lie with his wife: he said he would take care of my goods; I thought my goods were very safe; I carried them to the Crown Tavern: this was about March, 1762.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you carry?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. I carried a clock and case, a bureau chest of drawers, a bed and bedding, and the things mentioned in the indictment: I put them into two rooms, that I was to have, when they were repaired; then I went to his lodging at Mr. Denton's, by his directions, and he lay in my room: he came home on the sabbath-day, before I missed my goods, and dined with his family; and told me every thing was safe; and on the Tuesday after I went there, and Mr. Crook's servant set a ladder and got over, and opened the great door; I went in, and found the padlock that fastened the door lying in the window, and the key in it; my door was open; I had trusted that key with Mr. Crook; the other keys of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280029"></xptr> drawers and places I had in my pocket, all but two; I let him have a key of one drawer, as he said he wanted that drawer to lay some papers in: I found my drawers open; one of my locks was entirely off; my book-case was wide open; the drawers were forced open; there lay two chissels, one was broke, and the other not: all the things were taken out of the drawers. I went into the other room; there I found my locks broke, and all the goods mentioned in the indictment were gone, (mentioning them by name): then I went and got Mrs. Brabiner to go with me again to see the rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. This was in 1762, I can't tell exactly the month; it was about November. I advertised directly, and Mr. Wild, a pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street, where some of my goods were pledged, sent to me; and I took a constable, and went and saw them: the constable took an account of every thing: there was pewter, brass, linen, a gown, and a petticoat, part of the goods mentioned in the indictment: I found no more of the goods than what I found there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with Mr. Crook?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. I had been acquainted with him about half a year before my goods were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you arrested at the suit of one Bigget?</p>
               <p>Adderley. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lent you the money to pay?</p>
               <p>Adderley. There was no money paid at all.</p>

               <p>Q. What money was coming to you?</p>
               <p>Adderley. Mr. Adderley told me there was coming to me 900 l. as near as I can remember and I trusted him with this letter of attorney to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>Adderley. (She takes it in her hand) This name of mine is my own hand writing; I gave it so as to receive it myself: I was against making a letter of attorney; I did not understand the nature of it; Crook is now indebted to me.</p>

Among other things she said, the keys of those drawers that were broke open, she had in her pocket, but the key of her lodging-room door was with Crook. I granted a warrant to apprehend him, but he could not be taken. On the Sunday, she came to me again, and begged I would grant a search-warrant to search his house; I granted her one, as she said she had some grounds to think some of her goods were in his house: the house was searched, but there were no goods of her's, or very little of any goods found in his house.

            , the prisoner, between the 6th of September, and the 9th of October, 1762. (Produced in court). Here is a list of them; (He reads it.) A diamond ring, two table-cloths, two aprons, twenty napkins, a jack, a quilt, a gown, two shifts, a spoon, two sheets, two curtains, a petticoat, a valence, a pair of breeches, eighteen plates, a water plate, seven dishes, a pair of candle-sticks, a brass mortar, two brass arms, a tobacco-box, a seal, two books, and two remnants of silk; they came in sixteen parcels, and were pledged for 6 l. 13 s. in the whole.</p>
               <p>Adderley. These goods are all my property, and were taken out of the rooms; the diamond ring, quilt, gown, shifts, napkins, tablecloths, petticoat, counterpane, and spoon, were the same, and were all under lock and key, and I had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to lie in the lodgings?</p>
               <p>Adderley. Yes, but very little; I did not look into my drawers every time I came there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never denied taking the things in my life: she gave me the keys, and it was with her consent all that I did take; but half the things in the indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280032"></xptr> I never saw: she had part of the money; I gave her a proper security, and kept and supported her for some time.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mason. I have known Mrs. Adderley two years. I remember preparing a letter of attorney from her to Mr. Crook, for him to receive money for her; I am a subscribing witness to it, together with Mr. Winbolt; it was read over and explained to her word by word. She, Mr. Winbolt, and Mr. Crook, came to my chambers on that account: she came to my chambers a second time; I had it read over very distinctly to her; it was duly executed, and she signed her name to it. I am well persuaded she understood every word contained in it; I read it over very distinctly in March 1763. Some time after she lost her things, she came to my chambers, and said she would have her papers containing the accounts with Mr. Cotrell; I said, you have my three guineas, pay me my money, I don't want to be concerned with such people as you: said she, Mr. Crook shall pay you, and takes and sweeps all the papers into her apron, and would take them away; she said she would have them; I said, you shall not have the letter of attorney, and insisted she should not have that, and that she let me have again, and I would particularly exempt that in the receipt which she proposed to give me. At this time, she told me she had lost a great variety of things; he had much more than the value of the three guineas; I think she said, he had pawned the things, and she had part of the money, either then or at another time. A person had arrested her, and thrown her into the Poultry-Compter: Mr. Crook came and told me of it, and I believe he got bail for her, and she was discharged; this was in 1762, about June or July: she admitted to me that he had paid money for her, to obtain her discharge. She came to me on the 18th of March, 1763, and I think that was the time she admitted he had part of the money: she declared to me at the time she had her papers away, that she never had heard this letter of attorney read over.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of her capacity, as to her knowledge of the letter of attorney?</p>
               <p>Mason. I read it over so distinctly, because I thought she might not be so well aware of it; but all things considered, I apprehend she knew what she was about very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Denton. There was one Brown left 650 l. in East-India annuities to Mr. Crook, and there being some contest in the commons about it, he was perplexed, and by that means his pocket was drained of every thing, and I lent him money: after that, he gave a bond to Mr. Adney, and Mr. Adney lent him money to carry on the cause: this was on the 17th of December, 1762. I saw those annuities in the book, in the East-India house, and I was informed of Mr. Crook being taken up by Mr. Girdler: I desired he might be examined again, and Mr. Girdler thought proper to have another magistrate in the affair, which was Sir

               <p>Mrs. Adderley. I let him pawn some spoons once for 6 s. when I wanted money; but I did not give him leave to break open my drawers, or to pawn any of these things.</p>
               <p>Denton. Mr. Crook has behaved exceeding well, and surrendered voluntarily at Mr. Fieldings; if I had not thought him an honest man, I would not have become one of his bail.</p>

Said she, I could be glad to have my goods again that Mr. Crook has pawned: I gave him the key to open the drawers, where he took out some things, and pawned them: there was a gold watch, a gold ring, and a pair of sheets: she did agree to have done with it, if Mr. Crook would let her have her things again, but it was out of his power to fetch them.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 9th of April, 1809, were you at the London coffee-house - A. I was; I arrived there on the morning of the 9th of April; I brought with me a portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the number of the room to which you were shewn - A. I do not exactly remember the number; it was at the top of the house; my portmanteau was put into that room that I engaged; I had in that portmanteau a pocket book, and some articles of linen. I did not sleep in the coffee-house that night. On the 10th, the next day, I called at the London coffee-house, about two o'clock, I found my portmanteau was cut, and missed two shirts, three neckcloths, a waistcoat, two pocket handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, and my pocket book; I mentioned it to the people of the house that I had lost these things out of my portmanteau; a strap that went round the portmanteau was cut at one end, so that it was completely open. This was on Monday the 10th. On Tuesday week the 18th of April, I received that letter by the post.</p>

               <p>"London, 19th of April, 1809.</p>
               <p>SIR, Your pocket book has fell into the hands of a young man whose ungovernable passion, and cursed insatuation for the gaming table has led him into an act the most disgraceful; and the property I took from your trunk at the London coffee-house furnished me with a guinea at a moment I was destitute; again I took to the gaming table and have been fortunate; this morning an opportunity offered for my going abroad with the prospect of doing good. Your linen is gone, and it is out of the question. Is your pocket book of any value to you? I offer it to you on the following terms; I require twenty-five pounds. Twenty-five pounds is a large sum to give away, possibly you will have to return at no distant period. Insert to me in the Morning Chronicle Newspaper the following, should you be disposed to give this sum; - E. P. R. agrees to the propoposition contained in G. B's communication. This I shall look for, and do not delay."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed to prosecutor. This is a long time since this happened - A. It is above a year.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you in point of fact packed up your own clothes yourself, or left it for your servant - A. I am pretty sure I packed them up myself. I am certain I lost my things out of my portmanteau; I saw the pocket book in the portmanteau, and the linen also when I was in London. I arrived by the mail coach at the London coffee-house; I shifted myself at the London coffee-house, and saw them there; I do not know the number of the room I had there, it was between No. 60 and 70. I received that letter at Margate; I marked it.</p>

Yes, he was sleeping at No. 66. Mr. Pilcher told me to take care of his portmanteau; he should not sleep there that night. He left his portmanteau in his chamber, and went away till the next day. He spoke loud enough that any one in No. 66 might hear him. On the next day Mr. Pilcher returned to the house, he complained to me that his portmanteau had been cut.</p>

               <p>Q. You were stationed there and a letter was put in there with twenty-five pound in notes - A. I was stationed there; this pocket book was brought there by a porter, and given to Mr. Pilcher in my presence.</p>

I did, in St. Paul's church-yard; Bishop, the officer, was with me; he went up and and asked him if his name was not Furlonger, he said it was; upon that I accosted him; I told him that I had a question to put to him relative to some business at the London coffee-house, and whether he would have any objection to go there to have some questions put to him; his answer was, certainly not; he was desirous to know what we wanted of him. When he came to that part of St. Paul's church yard where there is a turning into Pater-noster-row, he sprang from us and ran as fast as possible for a man to run; I cried out stop thief; he was stopped. I put him into a house and went to Mr. Leech.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer. While the prisoner was in my custody in St. Paul's churchyard I told him he was charged with a felony at the London coffee house, and for writing a number of letters; he acknowledged writing the letters; he said, distress, and misfortunes of his family drove him to it; I then shewed him a letter, which I have in my hand; he said he wrote a number of letters; I said, did you write this; he said, yes.</p>

               <p>Attorney-General. The Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted for a Crime pretty much of the same Nature of that which you tried but just now, but indicted upon another Act of Parliament, which has not made the Punishment so great; by that Act of Parliament which was in the 9th of his present Majesty, it is provided, That if any Persons to the Number of three or more, assemble with Fire-Arms, in order to be aiding and assisting in the running and landing uncustomed Goods, and Goods liable to pay Duties, upon a Conviction for that Offence they are to be judged guilty of Felony, and to be transported for seven Years.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar is indicted for his being guilty of the Crime mentioned in this Act of Parliament, which is, for his being assembled and armed with these Persons, or upwards, in the manner therein mentioned, in order to be aiding and assisting in running uncustomed Goods. Gentlemen, the Prisoner is one of those Persons we shall prove to you by the Testimony of two Witnesses, both of them who were present at that time, who were aiding and assisting at the same time; if he is found guilty, the consequence of which will be, that he will be transported for seven Years.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Tye. At the Parish of Sheverton the Prisoner was armed with a brace of Pistols; the most of them were on Horseback; he was aiding and assisting in the carrying away Tea and Brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. What Quantities?</p>
               <p>Tye. There might be three Quarters of a Hundred; I saw some of the Tea opened, but I did not see his opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Tea run?</p>
               <p>Tye. They took it from on Board of a Cutter. I saw it run.</p>

               <p>Tye. Yes, Sir, and the Cutter was within a Mile of the Shore.</p>

               <p>Tye. It was by Old Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What did all those People come there for?</p>
               <p>Tye. To receive uncustom'd Goods, Tea and Brandy. They came to wait for that Vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be landed at that Time ?</p>
               <p>Tye. There was fifty Hundred Weight landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that fifty Hundred Weight all carried away?</p>
               <p>Tye. All carried away. It was in Oil-skin Bags first, then put into large Sacks.</p>

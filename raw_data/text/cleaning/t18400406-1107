                  </hi>. I was in the service of Miss Ann Longfellow, No. 11, Berkeley-street west. On the 29th of January the prisoner came, between twelve and four o'clock, and gave his name as Henry—he said he had seen Miss Longfellow get into an omnibus, and she had sent him to clean two front bed-room windows, and that he was to get his dinner with me—I was servant of all work—I said I did not think Miss Longfellow had sent him to clean the windows, because she had a man who constantly cleaned them—he said she did, and I gave him some water and a cloth to go and clean them—I did not know him before—I am quite certain it was the prisoner—he went up and stopped till I got the dinner ready in the kitchen—I then called him—he came down, and went out for a pint of beer—when he had dined he helped me shake the stair carpets—he went up stairs again, and came down while I was cleaning the front parlour—he said he must go out a little while, and would come back and finish—he went out, and I looked after him, but could not see him—he never returned—he had not cleaned the windows—he left between two and three o'clock, as near as I can guess—I went up-stairs about five o'clock, and found a bundle of shoes on the bed which 1 had never seen before—Miss Longfellow came back between nine and ten o'clock—I told her what had occurred—she went up-stairs directly, with me, and discovered that her boxes were broken open—I saw that myself.</p>

On the 29th of January I left home between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I returned about half-past ten o'clock at night—I knew the prisoner about two years and a half ago, or more, he was then employed to drive my phaeton and look after the horses—he was my out-door servant, and was employed occasionally in-doors to clean knives—I did not desire him, on the 29th of January, to come and clean my windows—I did not see him—I did not, at any time, desire him to clean them—I met him in Dorset-square, about two months back—when I returned on the 29th I found three boxes broken open, and the property stated gone—the value, altogether, is fifteen guineas—the gold watch is worth ten guineas.</p>

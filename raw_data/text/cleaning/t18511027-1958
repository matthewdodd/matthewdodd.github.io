                  </hi>. I live at 3, Mordan-place, Lewisham-road. On Sunday evening, 28th Sept., I was in King-street, Greenwich—I bad a handkerchief in my coat-pocket, and missed it at the corner of Nelson-street—I had had it two minutes before—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On 28th Sept., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty with Crouch in King-street, Greenwich, and saw both the prisoners in company—I knew them before—I saw them follow several gentlemen, and Willcox attempted to pick their pockets—I saw them go behind a gentleman, who I believe to be Mr. Beaven, and leave him suddenly—I followed them, and took Wilson into custody—he said he had picked no pocket, and did not intend to do so.</p>

I was with White, and saw the prisoners together in Nelson-street—I saw them go behind three gentlemen, and attempt to pick their pockets—I saw them go into Stockwell street, and there Willcox attempted to pick a gentleman's pocket—I watched them for three-quarters of an hour,, and then saw them go behind a gentle man, whom I believe to be the prosecutor, and leave him all of a sudden—they then separated, one going down King-street, and the other down Nelson-street, through the market—both streets lead in one direction, and the prisoners live together—I went after Willcox, caught him in Church-street, and told him I wanted him—he said, "What for?" I said, "For picking pockets"—he immediately put his hand into his right trowsers pocket; I caught hold of it, and pulled out the handkerchief that has been produced—I took him to the station, and he there said he bought the hand<lb></lb>kerchief in Petticoat-lane.</p>

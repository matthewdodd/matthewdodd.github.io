               <p>I remember very well that a woman attacked me in the street; I believe it was the 7th or 8th of May, in <placeName id="t17890708-43-crimeloc208">Church-lane, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Was you sober? - I was sober enough; we had some beer and some drink, the prisoner is the woman, but she is a great deal thinner than she was that day; she was fierce enough that day.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear to her? - I will go to death, if death and judgment was before me, that that is the very woman; I may well know her.</p>
               <p>I mean to ask you whether you are so sure of it, because you found your duplicates in the same house with her that day? - I observed her very well, and I knew her as soon as ever I see her.</p>

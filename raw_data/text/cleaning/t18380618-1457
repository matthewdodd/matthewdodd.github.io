The prisoner was in their employ, and had been so eight or nine years, as their agent at Branston—it was his duty to return a balance of cash in hand weekly to the town establishment in the City-road, and to enter in his cash-book an account of his receipts and disbursements—his accounts were always squared—I could detect no errors according to the ac<lb></lb>counts he furnished—after the 7th of April I turned over the weekly ac<lb></lb>counts he had furnished—there are no entries of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have since seen his cash-book, and examined it—he never advised us of having received these sums.</p>

In consequence of irregularities my employers had determined to dismiss the prisoner, but did not suspect him of this charge—on the 7th of April I went down to Branston—I found him in the counting-house early in the morning—I said I was extremely sorry to inform him that I had come down on very unpleasant business, and that the concern wished me to</p>

               <p>Q. Did she take any thing besides the two guineas?</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the money?</p>
               <p>Jones. In my breeches-pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Jones. About four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been with her?</p>
               <p>Jones. I was in a house with her; I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before?</p>
               <p>Jones. I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it in?</p>
               <p>Jones. Up one pair of stairs, or two pair of stairs; it was there about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a bed in the room?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, there were two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed with her?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, and I laid my breeches under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. So, though you was in liquor, you was so careful as to lay your breeches under your head.</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the Prisoner go?</p>
               <p>Jones . I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss her?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. But did she take your breeches as well as the money?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, only my money; I had a watch in my breeches, but I got that again by a girl in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you chairmen use to carry so much money about you?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sometimes we do. Three or four days afterwards I went to the same house to speak to her, and I asked her, whether she took my money? and she said, if I would stay till the next morning, and not take her up that night, she would get a lawyer to give me the money again, or a note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess any thing after that?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she in bed with this man?</p>
               <p>Dicey. No; she had been in bed with him for some time, and got up and went away, and we had a quartern of liquor, and then we had some small-beer brought up in a punch-bowl, and she said I will go to bed to my husband again; I saw her pull off all her things but her gown, and go into bed; and I saw her upon her knees in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did she go to bed?</p>
               <p>Dicey. To the chairman; I heard the money chink, and she tossed me a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the woman that was in bed with the chairman?</p>

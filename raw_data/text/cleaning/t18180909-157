I was looking over some papers, some person knocked at the door, I went to open it, leaving the pocket-book on the bench; a little boy asked for a halfpenny worth of shavings - I told him to take them. I went back to the window, Pellett asked me if I had lost any thing? I immediately missed my pocket-book, which had two 5l. and two 1l. notes in it. I had seen the prisoner in the court just before.</p>

            . I live opposite to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner about a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning, with his back against my shutters; while I was opening a shop at the corner of the court, I saw him attempt to reach over the prosecutor's shop window three times; I saw him speak to a little boy, and give him something. I afterwards saw him reach over, and take a black pocket-book out of Evans's shop. I told Evans, and pursued after him, but lost him. I saw him in Charles-street, Drury-lane, two days after, and gave him in charge. I knew him very well before, and am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Stamford. The prisoner came to our shop between two and three in the afternoon, March 20, for some irish stuff, I went and pulled down from a shelf about eight remnants; she said, there were none of them that would suit her, so she said, she would call again on the Monday, and went out of the shop in a hurry: I missed some of the goods; I looked out; she was running up the street. I call'd the maid to take care of the shop, and ran after her and overtook her; but not being willing to accuse her till I was quite sure. I told her I had found a remnant of irish stust that would suit her, and in the mean time I put my hand under her long scarlet cloak which she had on, and felt two pieces, she dropped one of them in the dirt; then I called for assistance and got her into the Cambridge perriwig warehouse, and sent for Master. One of the pieces I had taken down to shew her, another was standing in the window, and the other, which was borrowed, was lying on the counter ready to be carried back again, when she came in.</p>

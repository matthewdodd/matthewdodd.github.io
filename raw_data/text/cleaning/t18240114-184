I allowed him to unpack his goods in my shop, and on the morning of the 24th of December, I missed some hams. He came again that evening, between five and six o'clock. I charged him with stealing a cheese which he denied at first. I said nothing about the hams, but gave him in charge, and they were found in his cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not put a mark on it after you found it - A. No. I cure some of my hams, and mark them before I send them to be smoked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was his cart at your door when he was given in charge - A. Yes, and a ham was found in it - I never sold it to him.</p>
               <p>JAMES PHYBUS. I am servant to the prosecutor. When the prisoner was taken into custody he desired me to take his horse to his stable. I went and looked into his cart, and found a ham, which I knew to be my masters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many shopmen have you - A. Two; I once sold him a knuckle of ham.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BUSH SKILLERN. I am an officer. I took the prisoner on a charge of stealing a cheese, nothing was said about the ham. His cart was at the door, and the ham was brought to me by Phybus.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a malicious thing on the part of the shopmen, who were in the habit of selling me hams, and I suppose they stole them, and so they deny selling them to me. They said if I would give them 1 l. they would make it up.</p>

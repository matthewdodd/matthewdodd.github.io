             sworn. - I am constable of the parish of St. Giles: On Wednesday, the 19th of October, I went to the house of one Foss, the Black Horse, in Queen-street, Seven Dials, with Mr. Chambers, about nine o'clock; Foss pointed to a place, which I opened, and took a bundle out; it was a cupboard under the staircase in the tap-room; I opened the bundle, and it contained three Duffield great-coats, with shop marks on them; Mr. Chambers claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, I have seen him many times, as I used the house; I had seen him that morning, about an hour before, in the tap-room, with a bundle under his arm, which he left in the house; he had something to drink, and as he went out of the back door, he said to the landlord, put it up; I apprehended the prisoner soon after, who immediately said, Lord have mercy upon me! have mercy on me! I had only told him he was my prisoner; I then took him to the Black Horse, and shewed him the bundle; he said it was his first offence, and hoped his master would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not mean, put the reckoning up to him as a score, and not the bundle? - A. I don't know; for my part, I thought he meant, put the bundle up; he went out at the door in a great hurry.</p>

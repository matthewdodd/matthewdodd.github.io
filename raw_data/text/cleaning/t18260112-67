            . I am an officer. On the 2d of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was under the Piazzas of <placeName id="t18260112-67-crimeloc380">Covent-garden</placeName>

I called Stop thief! and he was taken. I had him in charge in about five minutes afterwards; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was I when you first took me? - A. Behind the tail of the cart - you dropped the butter and struck me - you ran up James-street, and I took you into custody in Hart-street, when another witness had got you.</p>

            . I am a tea-dealer, and live in James-street. I was standing in my shop, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running from the cry - I followed, and he was taken in Phoenix-alley; I came up with him, and was immediately surrounded by a gang - one of whom gave me a desperate blow on the head; the constable came up, and took charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the officer run with you to take me? A. No - my brother and myself followed you - you said you were in the King's Head public-house, and heard the cry of Stop thief! you came quietly till we came to the corner of Hart-street, where we were surrounded by a des<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120035"></xptr>perate gang - the officer came up there, and took you.

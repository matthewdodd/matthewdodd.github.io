            . I have no other partner. The prisoner had been in our service for a continuance for the last fourteen or fifteen years; his business was mounting lustres with the drops. He was entrusted with the care of the drops entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. From some information that you had received, did you go to Stepney workhouse to see a girl of the name of

                  </persName>
             - A. Yes; this day fortnight, the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after or before that you went there, that the prisoner spoke to you respecting her - A. It was on the Thursday before. He said he was afraid of the reports that were circulated about the neighbourhood would come to Mr. Bailey, or to me, that he had been stealing drops; he said, the report had arisen from Mr. Grig's daughter. I asked him how such reports could have got in circulation; he said, through Grig's daughter; he said, after he had been so many years in our service we could not suppose him guilty of such an action. I then only asked him where the girl was; he said, she was in some workhouse, but he did not know where; he gave her a very bad character, because she had robbed her father; but he did not know to what workhouse she was sent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time at what workhouse she had been sent - A. No. I believe the next day I learned from some other information.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did the suicide of Mr. Grig occur - A. On the Monday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Grig lived, I believe, in Creed-lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that taking place did the prisoner say any thing more to you respecting this subject - A. Yes. He said, now, things looked very black against him, but he was perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did Mrs. Grig put into your hands any quantity of drops - A. The Monday after that, last Monday; she put a quantity of drops, and made the disclosure.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the daughter, Emma, before this transpired - A. On the Saturday before, I saw the daughter, and on the Monday I went.</p>
               <p>Q. This day fortnight you saw her, and last Monday week you went to Mrs. Grig's - A. Yes; two days after I saw Emma.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the drops that were delivered up to you at Mrs. Grig's house - A. Yes, about twenty-two gross, rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. A gross of one hundred and forty-four to the gross; twenty-two gross, that would be more than three thousand - A. Above twenty-two gross.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. About forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lustre mounted when you saw them - A. Part of them was on the lustre, and part not; a part of them had not been mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this lustre form a lustre of this kind - A. Something of that form. This is the identical lustre; the lustre was entirely formed; there were a considerable number of drops that remained over and above to mount that lustre.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's wages - A. He had twenty-six shillings a week; exclusive of his Christmas-box; his Christmas-box was six or seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your first receiving this information, did you resort to the prisoner's house - A. He was taken up last Monday; I then went to his house, No. 62, Union-street, in the Borough.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember his bringing any parcel or basket there about three months ago - A. Yes, in the evening; he brought the basket, and took some brown paper parcels out of it. He put the brown paper parcels on the back counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lodgers - A. No, not in our house. He came again the next morning; I saw him open the parcels; the parcels contained drops. I saw the prisoner put the pins in for mounting, and I saw the prisoner mount them on the back counter; he hung them round the lustre; they were all used to the lustre. The lustre was completely fitted up. They were all returned to Mr. Bailey; I did not see any left. The lustre was completely fitted up with these drops; there was quite enough for that.</p>

               <p>Q. Before your father sent you to the workhouse had you talked in the neighbourhood of the visits of the prisoner to your father - A. Yes.</p>

             mounted them on the lustre; my husband did not understand mounting of lustres. The prisoner mounted the lustres The prisoner came to our house often three or four times a day. I knew he was in the employ of Neale and Bailey, and that he brought the drops from Neale and Bailey. I have asked him if he was not afraid he would be found out. I asked him because my husband took them of him. He said, no; he was not afraid of taking them. He took a great many drops away from us the week before last, before my husband died. I knew there were reports in the neighbourhood about this transaction; I suspected my daughter telling; my daughter said that she had told the neighbours. I had talked to Hearn about these reports.</p>

Here is one, I know the manufactory of it, by the mould and cutting; this is the mould in which the drops are cast; the cutting is also my own. I have examined the drops carefully before, I can speak to thirty or forty; there was never more than one gross moulded out of it. These are cut by me; I speak to my own cutting as well as the mould. I can speak with more certainty to the cutting than of the mould.</p>

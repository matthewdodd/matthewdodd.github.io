               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This woman's husband and father, on Saturday had been to my pay-table, knowing me to be a boot and shoe maker; he asked me to drink out of the pot with him; he asked me whether I was out of work; I said, I was; he said, if you come up to me on the morrow, I will get you work. I went up to his house to enquire for him, they denied him at first; then, after that, they said, stop, he will be in in a few minutes. I went out and met him in the passage; he asked me to go up to this woman's room, he told me to take the teapot down, he took three shillings out of the tea-pot; he took me out, and made me drunk, he said, he would get me ten guineas of a recruiting serjeant; he would get me to sleep with himself, then I might go where I liked. Then him and I laid down in the bed together, and on my returning down stairs, I found these things which are now there.</p>

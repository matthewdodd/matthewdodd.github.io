               <p>Between one and two, as I was going my round, the prisoner laid again a wall in Catherine-wheel-alley; he had a drawn knife in his hand; I saw some tools on him, and I asked him what tools he had? he said he had a drawing knife and a plane; and lodged at the Star in Wingford-street; he said he was there at eleven that night, and came out after another man; I told him to go home, as that knife was an unlawful weapon; he left a saw behind him, and went off; I suspected him, and took him into custody; he was very much in liquor; he went quiet and easy with me: it is about a mile from the prosecutor's shop, to the place where I took him; the tools are here.</p>

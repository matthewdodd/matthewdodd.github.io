                  </hi>I am a farrier, and live in Union-street, King<lb></lb>land-road. On the 31st of May I went to bathe at Mr. Goddard'g bath, opposite Gloucester Chapel, Hackney—the baths are enclosed with a wall—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go in—it was about ten minutes to four o'clock when I went in, and I put my clothes in a box by the bath—I had a watch, which I put into my hat on the seat—I was in the water about an hour—I think the prisoners are the boys I had seen in the bath, and they had asked me what o'clock it was before I went into the water—I missed my watch when I got out, and the prisoners were then gone.</p>

                  </hi>I am apprentice to a paper-stainer. I was bathing with the prosecutor—I wanted to know what time it was—he went to look at his watch, and missed it—I had seen him pat it into his hat, and when he said it was gone I went to Mr. Goddard—he called the policeman in, and made a search through the bath—I saw the prisoner Hilyard there, talking to another about the size of Ridley.</p>

                  </hi>I am a broker and general salesman, and live-in Brick-lane, Whitechapel. On Monday morning, the 8th of June, about half-past eight o'clock, Ridley came and asked if I bought watches—I said, "Let me look at it"—he said, "I have not got it, I will go and fetch it"—I watched him, and I saw Hilyard about twelve yards off, on the other side, with another little boy—they went round the corner, and Rideley went towards them—Ridley came to me in three or four minutes, and brought me this watch—I took him into my back place and examined the watch—I asked him where he got it—he said he picked it up at Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—I sent for a policeman—Ridley then cried, and said there were two boys outside, that the big one had taken the watch and given it to him to sell—by the big one he meant Hilyard, and be represented the dress he had on.</p>

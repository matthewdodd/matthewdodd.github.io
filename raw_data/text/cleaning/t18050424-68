             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. What are you? - A. I am an assistant to a wholesale grocer, in Lower Thames-street, the corner of Boss-alley: On the 25th of February, in the evening, when I went through the back door, which leads about a yard and a half to where the pipe was cut, I saw the prisoner; he was rising from off his knees quite near to the pipe, he passed me shutting a knife, I believe; I then went round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240057"></xptr>the corner, and looked at the pipe; I found the pipe bent down to the ground about four or five feet, and that was just the spot where I saw the prisoner rise from off his knee. Seeing the pipe in that situation, I followed him, and catched him directly; I brought him back to where the pipe was; I saw his hands were dirty, and the pipe was cut about a yard and a half; I asked him if he knew any thing about it, I could get no answer, he only muttered; the constable said he spoke to him a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these premises? - A. Yes, they belong to the Coal Exchange; the day after I shewed the pipe to Mr.

               <p>I was walking by the side of the hedge; between two fields, where the men were at plow, that is joining the to the prosecutor's field, and I saw a sack lay in the ditch; and I went and turned the sack up, and under it there was a bag; what there was in the bag I did not know; I went and asked the men if they knew any thing; one George Barnes that is here went along with me; and there were nine fowls in the bag; they were dead, I took them to the prosecutor's; and after that I carried them back to the place; I laid them into the same place and watched them; I was desired to do so; when I had been there about ten minutes the prisoner came by the side of the hedge and stooped down; it was marked with a piece of an oystershell; and it glistened; and he removed the oystershell as I sat in the ditch; I did not see the oystershell when I found the bundle; it was there when I carried the bundle; it might be there, but we did not take notice of it when we found the bag; we took notice of it when we carried the bag back.</p>
               <p>Then it was no mark for you in laying the things there again? - No; I laid the things as near as I could in the same place; I went by a mark of a hole in the hedge; the prisoner came about half after six and removed the oystershell.</p>
               <p>Was he alone? - Yes; he came into the ditch directly; it was a dry ditch, and took hold of the black bag and lifted it up, and then caught hold of the white; and threw the black bag on one side, and took up the white bag; he had not gone above two yards before I caught him.</p>
               <p>Had he put it on his shoulders, or what did he do? - I cannot be positive; when I laid hold of him, he cried out, Lord have mercy upon me, what shall I do; I said, we have got him safe enough; he said nothing till we had got to the prosecutor's, then he said there was nobody concerned with him.</p>
               <p>What did he say about himself? - Going over the fields by Mary-le-bone workhouse, he said, it would not touch his neck, on less it belonged to the dwelling-house, or joined to the dwelling-house, but now he was sure of going to Botany-bay.</p>

               <p>I was with the other man; I saw the prisoner stoop into the ditch, and he took off the black bag, and was going off with the white bag; and that man collared him; when we were going to the watch-house I was behind carrying the things; I did not hear what he said.</p>

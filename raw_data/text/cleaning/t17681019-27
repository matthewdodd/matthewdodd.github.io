               <p>This woman brought paper to me, and said she came honestly by it; that she worked at a public office, and it was her perquisite; at first she brought little quantities, seven or eight pounds, I allowed her 2 d. a pound for it; when she brought these large bundles, I much disputed it; she said I might be assured she came honestly by it, for she had worked many years in that house; I asked what it would come to; she said 5 s. 3 d. I gave it her, and when I opened it I would weigh it, and allow her 2 d. a pound; from time to time she repeated it, and always declared she came honestly by it; I never distrusted her, but took her to be an honest woman.</p>

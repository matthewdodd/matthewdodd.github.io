             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Public-office, Hatton-garden; a woman came to the Office on the 12th of July last, saying she wanted an officer to take a man into custody, in Spread Eagle-court, Gray's Inn-lane; when I got there, the prosecutor was standing at the door; he said the man was in the cellar that had robbed him; I called him several times to come out; I went down after him, after waiting about twenty minutes, and found him standing in the chimney-place pulling off those small clothes which the prosecutor said were his; I took him up; there was a waistcoat and trowsers lay in the cellar, which the prosecutor said he knew; they were very filthy, we could not produce them; I then took him to the Office; going along, he confessed to me that he had sent another man to pledge some clothes, but he did not know where; he said he broke the door open very easy with his hands, and likewise the box; I then asked him what he could have done with all the money, as he had no money about him; his answer was, fool like, I got among a parcel of my companions, and spent it all, or lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He has told a parcel of had lies; I bought the clothes of a man in the street.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Are your own breeches there? - A. Yes, I can swear to them now; I have sworn to them before, and the coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons; I had such in my box, they belong to Barry; they were in my box where the money was; Barry left them with me, he is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked in your box, did you observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120058"></xptr>they were gone? - A. I observed they were all gone.</p>

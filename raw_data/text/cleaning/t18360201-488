I recollect the pri<lb></lb>soner coming to out house—I saw my husband put the watches into a rack, and take them up-stairs, a little before nine o'clock on Sunday morning, the 26th—the prisoner was in his bed-room at that time—it joins our bed-room—my husband was speaking on the bottom stair to a first<lb></lb>floor lodger about the watches—the prisoner's door was partly open, and I dare say he might hear it—I was in the kitchen, close to the stair-case—I believe the prisoner could hear what passed—his breakfast things were all ready in the parlour, but he did not take his breakfast—I asked my hus<lb></lb>band if I should take the watches up—he said, "No, you will let them fall; I will take them up myself, and shall be sure they are safe"—I do not think it was more than ten minutes after that, that the prisoner came down stairs and went into the parlour—I remained in the kitchen expecting him to call for his warm water for breakfast, but he did not—I saw him pass the kitchen door and go out and shut the door—I never saw him after till he was at Queen-square—I went into the parlour after that he was gone, and went to his bed-room—he left nothing behind but some wood and other little things in a box, but no clothes.</p>

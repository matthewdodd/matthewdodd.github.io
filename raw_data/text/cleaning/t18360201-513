                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. William John Felton, a coach-maker, in Belgrave-square—I act for him in the management of his business, In December last the prisoner came to purchase a carriage, but did not pur<lb></lb>chase one—he invited me to call on him relative to it; and in pursuance of that I went to No, 4 Westborne-place, Eaton-square, about the 17th or 18th of December—I saw him there in a house elegantly furnished—he invited me up-stairs to see his drawing-room, and pointed to a very ele<lb></lb>gant screen—I forget whether I mentioned it first or he, but the subject arose about the Chinese paintings on it—he said, "It is very handsome, is it not? I bought it a few days ago"—he proposed to give a bill at four months of his own acceptance, for a carriage, which I declined—I saw him again on the 20th—I wanted another name on the bill—he then said he would not purchase, as he expected to receive his money is a short time, and he would have something for a month—he at first stated he would have a headed chaise, but I had not one to lend him—he then said he would have a cabriolet—I said I had one of them, and he selected one, which he hired at five guineas a month—our months consist of twenty-eight days—he came the next day, about twelve o'clock, I think, the 21st, and took away the cabriolet—he had a little boy with him in livery, who acted as his servant—some one had brought a horse which was there before the prisoner came—the boy had come before the prisoner to know where the cabriolet was, and they were trying the horse in it round the square—the prisoner then took the cabriolet away—I had not received any thing of him on account, neither money nor bill—it was on the faith of his being the proprietor of the handsome house and furniture which I had seen, that I allowed him to take the cabriolet on hire—I had not in any respect sold it to him—the purchase went off—he had stated that he wanted the cabriolet for the purpose of waiting on the gentlemen who were going on an excursion—I do not think I saw him again till the 28th of December, when he called again at Mr. Felton's, and said he had lent the cabriolet to the steward, but he did not say where the steward was gone—he had produced this paper to me, or one like it—I have no doubt it was this (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Excursion up the Mediterranean—A party of</p>

               <p>ladies and gentleman are about to proceed upon an excursion of pleasure up the Mediterranean, and parts adjacent; touching first at Gibraltar, and from thence, as may be agreed upon by a majority of the party. The vessel intended for the excursion is a fine frigate-built ship, with accom<lb></lb>modation for thirty passengers: fitted up with every comfort that can be obtained; as warm and cold baths, a piano, harp, a band of music, a ear<lb></lb>riage for inland parties, and a small yacht for shooting and fishing excur<lb></lb>sions—the tables will be covered in every respect and style, not to be ex<lb></lb>celled by a first-rate hotel or club-house, as neither trouble nor expense will be spared in the selection of articles of the finest qualities—the charge for passengers (80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each per month)will include all expenses on board, and allow them to indulge in every luxury—ladies and gentlemen desirous of visiting that delightful part of the globe, with advantages never before offered, will learn further particulars by application to Captain Tadman, 4, Westbourne-place, Eaton-square.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner represent himself as this Captain Tadman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he told me he had people of high respectability to call on relative to this matter—he said, on the 28th of December, when he called, that he had lent the cabriolet to the steward, and he wanted something to drive Mrs. Tadman about in; and he hired a phaeton which he took away—I received come information, and waited on him a few days afterwards—I saw him, and said, I wanted to know where the carriages stood—(the cab<lb></lb>riolet was worth about 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—he said the cabriolet was at Portsmouth, be<lb></lb>ing used by his steward, and the phaeton was at the Ship livery stables at Brighton—that was the reason he gave me why they could not be returned as I requested—they were never returned—I afterwards saw the cabriolet at Mr. Robinson's repository in Little Britain—it was in a coach-house, on the right hand side, and was the one I let to the prisoner.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Robinson, who keeps a repository, in Little Britain, for the sale of horses and carriages, We have sales there weekly, and take in carriages to stand for sale—the prisoner applied to us about the sale of a carriage, on the 14th of December and on the 21st, in the afternoon, about three o'clock, he came with a cabriolet,—I think he stated that he wanted a trifling advance upon it—we advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he proposed to leave the cabriolet with us—a lad came with him, who took away the horse and the harness.</p>

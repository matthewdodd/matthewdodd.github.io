               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have had an accident with your eye, I perceive? - The night after I came from the sessions, two young fellows came behind me, and said, that is she that is against Smallwood; and they knocked me down on one side and on the other.</p>
               <p>Is a chairwoman the only business that you follow? - Why, Sir, I take in washing.</p>
               <p>Nothing else? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Partridge? - Eleven months.</p>
               <p>You have lived on very good terms with her? - Yes, at times</p>

               <p>Were not there some other words between you? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you would do her the first opportunity, or something like that? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Not to Smallwood have you not said so? - Never in my life: I have heard her say to him, she would do him, but I never did say so in my life.</p>
               <p>Every body in the neighbourhood understood them to be man and wife? - Yes, they did, at that time.</p>
               <p>At the time this affair happened, did they live together then? - No, Sir; they had parted man and wifeship before that.</p>
               <p>How long after that did you say any thing of it? - Never till I went to the watch-house-keeper, and stopped the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say any thing to any body about this but to the watch-house-keeper? - I was not sure he had the watch, till I heard him come home, and say he had left the watch there.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I produced a carpet, pawned on the 22nd of August, and a pillow and two blankets, pawned on the 10th of August, and 8th of September, all by Connell.</p>
               <p>Miller. With respect to these curtains, I never said any such thing as she states - there is a witness here who knows that she said she would handle me well, if she could get hold of me; while I was at Mr. Howard's one of the servants told me that this lady was very spiteful against me; and I think she can say that they were not taken by me.</p>

            . I never said such a thing -I do not know whether these curtains were removed from the box before she came or after, but I believe they were not till after she came to the house; I recollect Mr. Savage being there, but there was no intimacy between him and Miller, that I know of - he came one morning, and I asked him if he would have a cup of tea; Mr. Savage left on the 12th of August, and I saw the curtains after that.</p>
               <p>Connell. She came to our house, and said she did not wonder at his going away, for they pretty well starved him - she spoke against her mistress, and said she believed us innocent. Witness. No, I did not; I said I would speak nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Miller. She has come down and told me to be particularly careful, and when she said these curtains were missing, I said, "Does she suspect me?" and she said, "I believe she does;" I was to have been acquitted the first night, and Mrs. Savage was going to get a warrant for her son, but the Magistrate would not grant it - I went to my brother's because I could have a lodging without paying for it - I could take my oath that the sheets are mine; I bought them two years ago; they are marked with cotton, and all this lady's things are marked with ink.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROSS. My things are marked with cotton, but not Mrs. Savage's.</p>
               <p>Miller. My brother knows the sheets were my mother's- I would ask Mrs. Ross when and where I said that I stole the blue merino curtains from the chest.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROSS. In my little back parlour, before Mrs. Savage; I laid a stress upon them - I said, "Where are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180049"></xptr>my blue merino curtains?" and she said, "If you will not hurt me, I will get them again; I took them out of the chest."</p>
               <p>MRS. SAVAGE. I was present, and heard the conversation.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live in West-street, Walworth. I am on the Rolls, but have not taken out my certificate for the last two years. I have no doubt but that these candlesticks are mine, also this bedfurniture, and this caddy; they were stolen from me about this time twelve months, when I was under the necessity of indicting a person here.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROSS. I have had the candlesticks nine or ten years - I bought them in Cromer-street; I bought the teachest of a lodger, who was with me eight or nine years ago - one of the handles of it is loose - I have had this furniture for years, it was taken down for the summer, and we had made a part of it with another pattern, which I have here.</p>
               <p>MRS. SAVAGE re-examined. Q. Have you at any time taken any steps against your son-in-law? A. He took away a gold watch, a chain, and two seals; I spoke to Mr. Laing, to know if there were any means to get them back, and he said No.</p>

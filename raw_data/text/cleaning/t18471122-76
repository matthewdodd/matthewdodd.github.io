                  </hi> I am a hatter, in King-street, Rotherhithe. I was a member and president of a society called "The Silk Hatters' Trade So<lb></lb>ciety," on 11th Oct. last—it was held at the Black Bull, Upper Thames-street—the prisoner was the secretary, and was paid 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for every night that he attended—the society consisted of a great number of persons—we raised contributions among ourselves, and kept the cash in a bag, and the bad in a deal box, which had three different locks and keys to it—myself as president, John Tucker, the vice-president, and the secretary, each had a key—the Society met on 5th Oct.—the box was produced, each of the officers produced his key, and it was opened—there was then 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 0 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the bag consisting of ten sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, half-crowns, fourpences, pence, and halfpence—it was counted, placed in the bag, the bag put into the box, and the box locked, and taken away—each officer had his key, and after the usual routine of business the society broke up—it was always the prac<lb></lb>tice</p>

               <p>to entrust the box to the charge of the landlord until the next meeting—we met again on 11th Oct., which was the pay night, and a night on which the secretary was expected to attend—he did not attend—we had the box down, but the prisoner not being there with his key, of course we could not open it—the next morning, in consequence of information from the landlord, we had the box forced, and found all the money gone.</p>

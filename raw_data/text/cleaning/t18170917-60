               <p>WILLIAM GARRETT. I live in Dock-street, Commercial-road. On the 12th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I had been to market; I was attacked at the end of <placeName id="t18170917-60-crimeloc290">Somerset-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

The prisoner drew my watch out of my fob-one of the others shoved me behind; I called out, and Smith came to my assistance-Johnston and I secured the prisoner, the others ran away. It was done instantaneously; he struck me on the breast before he drew my watch out-the others tried to rescue him; he never got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JOHNSON. I am a stationer, and live in Buckle-street, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel. I saw the prisoner and several others, one of them pushed Garrett behind; he was quite close to him; the prisoner gave him a blow on the breast and then took his watch; he turned round and was going to make his escape, I collared him; he dropped the watch; I caught it before it got to the ground; the others tried to rescue him. I kept my hold.</p>

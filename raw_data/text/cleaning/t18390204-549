                  </hi>. I am single, and live at the Bell Tavern, Fleet-street. I lost this property on the 10th of January, from a box in ray bed<lb></lb>room—the prisoner slept in the house that night, and one night before—my box was locked—I lost the box as well—the prisoner must have taken it about half an hour after he went up stairs to bed—the housemaid dis<lb></lb>covered that he was missing from his room, and the waiter found the property under his bed—his bed-room was on the second floor, and mine was on the third—the property is here—it is all mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When did you see your box safe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three o'clock, and it was missing about a quarter after ten o'clock—Mrs. Baker first found it—most of the doors in the house were unlocked—there is a billiard-room in the house—there were not more than two persons playing—they could not have gone to my room without being seen by Mr. Baker or the marker—they did not leave the room—the box was found in the room next to yours—the cook was in the next room—you might not have been heard if you had gone up stairs and broken open the box—you were not seen to go into the room—the housemaid saw your door open and missed you from the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Bell-tavern, Fleet-street. The prisoner came in about nine o'clock on Thursday, the 10th of January, and called for a pint of stout—he had slept there on the Tuesday night—he asked if he could be accommodated with the same bed he had on the Tuesday night—I said, "Yes"—he sat some time and then went to bed—I was in the billiard-room—I saw him go up stairs at half-past nine or perhaps a quarter to ten o'clock—about half-an-hour after, Mrs. Baker came to me and said he was not in his room—I said, "You had better go and see where he is"—she and the waiter went up stairs—I followed in about a minute, and when they got up the prisoner was gone into his own room again—they searched, and saw on the same floor that the drawers had been opened, but nothing taken out—we then went on the attic-floor, and this box was missing—I and the waiter then went into the prisoner's room—he was in bed—we found nothing there, but as we were coming out a scent bottle fell off the bed—I sent for an officer, and found some of the prosecutrix's things in the bed, and some under the bed, and a pair of scis<lb></lb>sors, with which I suppose he broke the box open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Alexander Cameron, of Beaumont-street, Portland-place, in the parish of Marylebone—it is his dwelling-house. On the 8th of March, about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, there was a knock at the door—I found the prisoner there—I am quite sure of him—he asked if a gentleman named Aspinade lived there—he said he had brought a note for him—I asked where he brought it from—he said, from Clapham-rise, and he would wait for an answer—I took the note up with me, leaving him in the hall—I went up to Colonel Aspinade, who lodges in the house—he opened the note—I did not wait till he had read it, for as I opened the drawing-room door I heard the street door slam—I found it shut, and missed from the rail three cloaks and the skirt of a lady's riding-habit—they were worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have not been found when I tried to open the street door I found a string attached to the railing, which prevented it opening wide—we managed to get through—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">the note purported to come from John Young, of Clapham-rise, making inquiries respecting the character of a servant.</hi>)</p>

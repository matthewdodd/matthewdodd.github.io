               <p>Court. Mention the things you lost? - There are two shirts, two shifts, four pair of stockings, one bed-gown, two tablecloths, one pocket handkerchief, and one night-cap; I am a widow, with three children; these things were entrusted to me to wash; when I found the things were taken, I immediately went into the street, and met Mr. Canby, who is a witness here; he took her, and brought her back; I had told him what I had lost.</p>

               <p>I live near the last witness; on Friday the 20th of February, I was going up Howland-street. I met the last witness; she was crying, and appeared in great agitation; she told me she had lost the things in the indictment, and described the person of the prisoner; I pursued her, and had information from a publick-house boy, which way she went; I pursued her down Charlotte-street, and she was running; when she perceived I had got ground of her, she stopt and began crying; I asked her what could induce her to rob such a poor woman; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250092"></xptr>cried, Oh, Sir! Oh, Sir! I then wanted to take the things out of her lap, which she refused; I took her by the arm, and led her to Mrs. Segary's; I then took some of the things out of her lap and shewed to Mrs. Segary, and she said it was her property; and she told me, that the prisoner was the person that she saw in the kitchen before, she said so in the hearing of the prisoner; the constable took her to the watch-house, and searched her pockets, and there he found two nails, which appeared very bright, one turned up like a pick-lock, it appeared very much used.</p>

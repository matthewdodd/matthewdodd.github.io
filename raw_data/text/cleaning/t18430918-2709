I was in the kitchen under the shop on the 13th of May—I had bolted the shop door—I heard the private door shut, a person walk across the shop, and then the shop door shut—a person could get into the passage, and from there to the shop—I ran up, and saw the door leading to the passage was open—the till was open, and the bowl and coppers gone—I had seen them safe a quarter of an hour before—I saw the shep door had been unbolted—from what Butler told me I went to No. 4, Bird-street, and found Mrs. Joey—she brought me the bowl up stain, which was my aunt's, but had no money in it—I heard the noise about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, and received information from Butler about five.</p>

I saw the prisoner about a quarter before twelve o'clock on the 13th of May—he had something under his coat—he was about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutrix's—he went down Bird-street, went to the area of No. 4, knelt down, and put something into his cap, which sounded like money, which he took out of a small wooden bowl, and threw the bowl down the area—this is the bowl—I told what I had seen as soon as I heard of this.</p>

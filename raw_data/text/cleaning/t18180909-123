            . I keep the toll-gate, Duke-street, Westminster. On the 2d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Britton, drove two pigs through my gate, the prisoner, Newman, stood on the other side of the road; I knew they belonged to the prosecutor, but thought he might have sold them. In about a quarter of an hour I was asked about them, and went in pursuit; I overtook the prisoners in Charles-street, Westminster, and found Britton had got on a smock-frock, which Newman was wearing when I first saw them. I followed them to Whitehall chapel, Newman left Britton, and then joined him again. I took Newman in St. Martin's lane, and gave him in charge. I followed Britton, with the pigs, to Golden-square, asked him where he was driving them to, and told him they were not his. He said, "if they are your's, take the whip and drive them while I fetch the person who owns them." I took him to the office. Turner claimed the pigs.</p>

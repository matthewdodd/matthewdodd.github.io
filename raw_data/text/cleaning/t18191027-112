            . I was at the Key, public-house, having a pot of beer, a few minutes after ten o'clock, and sat in the box with the prosecutor; a man named Windred sat on the right, between him and me - the prisoner and one Barrett, sat on the opposite side with another man; I saw them whispering together, and pointing over to Nicholls. Nail jumped over the settle, and sat down by the side of the prosecutor, who was asleep. He first shook his waistcoat-pocket, then forced his hand into his breeches-pocket, drew something out, and put it into his breast; Windred laid himself along the settle to prevent my seeing - Nail went over to his companions again, and they ran out of the house. I sat there about ten minutes, then the prosecutor awoke and missed his watch; I was afraid to speak then, so I went outside of the house, and told the company that I saw the prisoner do it - I did not see what he took. The officer was sent for.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me about ten o'clock that night, and said he had been robbed of his watch. I went with him, and called the prisoner and Barrett out of the house; the prosecutor said a man had seen him do it, but he was not there - I then let him go. I stopped and had a glass of beer while the prosecutor went and fetched Crockett, who said he saw the prisoner draw something from the prosecutor's breeches, and put it into his bosom. I took him into custody, but found nothing on him. I did not search Barrett.</p>

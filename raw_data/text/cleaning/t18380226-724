                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop in Chichester-place, in the parish of St. Pancras. On Sunday afternoon, the 4th of February, I reckoned up the money in my till, and it rather exceeded 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in a bag—it consisted of half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and fourpenny-pieces—on the following morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw the bag safe in the till—about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting by the fire in the parlour, when my niece gave me information of a man being in the shop at the till—I ran into the shop as quickly as I could, and saw the prisoner standing close to the side of the counter—I went up to him—I did not exactly know what he had done, and said, "Well, young man, what do you want?"—he said, "A penny-loaf"—my niece saw I did not understand what she had said to me, and she said, in his presence, "Why, uncle, the man has got your bag of money, I saw him take it out of the till"—I said, "You said a penny-loaf, did you; but what have you been about with the till?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You should not do so, you know it is very wrong"—my niece came behind him and locked the door—when he found he could not get away, he took from his person the bag of silver and placed it on the counter, between me and himself and the till—he then tried to get out at the door, but I got round the counter and secured him—I told my wife to step out for a policeman, who came and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's niece. I was sitting in the parlour at work on the day in question—I came into the shop, and saw the prisoner reach over the counter, put his hand into the till, and take the bag of money out—he then shut the till, and placed the bag between his body and the counter—I made my uncle sensible of it, and then shut the door and locked it—he held the money in his hand while he asked my uncle for a penny-loaf—when he found the door was fastened, he came to the counter, and placed the bag on the counter.</p>

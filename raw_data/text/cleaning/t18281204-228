On the 1st of December I came on shore from my ship, at five o'clock at night- I left my jacket and other things in my hammock; I employed a man to go for them, and he employed the prisoner - they were brought to King James-stairs, by the man; I did not see the prisoner then - I saw the hammock was undone, and I said to the waterman, "Something is amiss - you had better go back;" he put back, and we told the officer of it - the officer took the prisoner, and the duplicate was found on him.</p>

            . I was employed to go on board the Peggy, and get the hammock - the prisoner (whom I have known from a child) went with me to Greenwich; we could not get up, and we went on shore at Deptford -I gave him some grub; I then went to the Peggy, and the mate gave me the things - I brought them to King James-stairs, and saw the prosecutor; I left the prisoner in the boat - he then came on shore: I said to him, "I promised you 6d., and I will give you something more," but he was very shy, as he had helped himself - the prosecutor and I then went into the boat; he saw the hammock was undone, and said, "Avast here. Ralph, shove back - my hammock has been unlashed;" we put back, but I could not find the prisoner - we told Mr. Wilson, who found him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I took the prisoner on the night of the 1st of December, in the White Hart public-house; I told him I wanted him for stealing a sailor's jacket - he said he had had no jacket, and knew nothing of it; he said, "I will go down with you to Lancaster," and in Farmer-street he tried to get away, but he fell down, and I took him to the watch-house - I found this duplicate on him.</p>

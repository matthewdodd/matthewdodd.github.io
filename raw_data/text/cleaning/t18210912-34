On the 8th of August, at night, these things were in my stable, which is about eighty yards from my house. On the morning of the 9th of August, about six o'clock, I went to the stables, and they were gone - they cost me 25 guineas. I published a bill offering a reward, and between nine and ten o'clock the morning, I went to Shadwell watch-house, and found the prisoner in custody with them - I never saw him before. I found a piece of fresh dirt on the harness - I asked him how he could dirt my harness; he said, "Sir, I let it fall;" he said, he was a porter, and lived at Mr. Levy's, an old clothes man, in Rosemary-lane.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Sheldrick. I locked the stable door, about eight o'clock at night, on the 8th of August - the harness was then safe. I went rather before six o'clock in the morning, and found the outer gate safe, it was about twelve feet high, but the stable door was unlocked. I am sure I locked it the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120017"></xptr>night before - the harness was gone. I informed my master.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Shadwell. I saw the prisoner in New Gravel-lane, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, with a load on his shoulder, he appeared in a hurry - it was done up in a wrapper; I asked him what he had got - he said, he believed a saddle and something else, and that a gentleman gave them to him to carry to the London Docks, he did not know the gentleman's name, or the person whom he was going to take it to. I took him to the watch-house - I had seen him twice before that night, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock, and about half-past three o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 24th of December, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was near Kingsland-gate, about one hundred yards from the Tottenham-road, and met the prisoner on my beat carrying a bundle, about two hundred yards from Mr. Rowe's building - I asked what he had got, he said some lead which he had found in a field near my box - I took him to the watch-house; I saw the same lead fitted to a building - it matched exactly with the lead left on the top.</p>

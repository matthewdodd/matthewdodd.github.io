               <p>How do you know them to be yours? - I have cleaned them several times, and well know the pattern of them; there were just so many pair missing out of the window; I saw them there that morning; they belong to me and my mother; my father lately died, and left the property between us; the prisoner confessed before the Magistrate that he took them.</p>
               <p>Was any promise of favour made him? - None of the kind.</p>
               <p>Joshua Grey, the constable, produced the buckles, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I was going to the New Cut, Radcliffe highway, I met a girl, and she gave me buckles in a handkerchief, and desired me to carry them for her, and said she would come to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Yarrow. Did you see me near your house? - About as far from it as the Sessions house is from the top of the Old Bailey; he said before the Magistrate, a man gave them to him; afterwards he acknowledged he took them.</p>

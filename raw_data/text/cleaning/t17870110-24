               <p>I am constable of the night; I took charge of the prisoner and the bag at the watch-house; the prisoner had the bag on his head, and laid it on the bench; I asked the prisoner how far he had brought that bag; he said he came from York; I told him it was a heavy bundle to carry from York on his back; he said he came great part of the way in a waggon; I asked him how far he came in the waggon with his bundle, for I apprehended by his discourse, being a foreigner, that he had carried it a considerable number of miles, but how far I could not make out; I asked him if he was a <rs id="t17870110-24-deflabel132" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>

C. I was not sure whether he said Crandy, or Granby; then by that mark answering, I thought he was an honest man; looking further into the bundle, I saw another tied up in a silk handkerchief; he said there was a jacket and a great coat; I did not examine it then, but he said there is a goose, I saw there was one, I let it lie; we put in the things into his bag, and tied them up, to examine him again in the morning, and discharge him; I asked him how he came by that goose; he said his master passed him on the road about forty miles from London in a diligence, and his master brought this goose, and told him to put it into the bottom of the sack, and put them in the waggon; I asked him if he knew London; he said not much, but he had been there; he said his master's name was one Lester's Esq; in Warwick-lane; he did not know where to find it; he said, his master promised to meet him at a new house, that was building for a public house, and there he would convey him to his own home: our suspicious were most on account of the great cloth; I went out and left him in the watch-house; I returned in about an hour, and the prosecutor had been there on horseback enquiring after a bundle; the next morning I saw the prosecutor; I detained the prisoner and the sack till the morning; I then took him to the Rotation-office, Clerkenwell-green, with the bundle; and the waggoner swore to the things.</p>

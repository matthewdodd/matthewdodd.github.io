                  </hi>. I live at William Rigby's, in Sloane-street, Chelsea. On Thursday, the 3rd of April, the prisoner came to the house, and said he had come for the gentleman's boots to stretch—I asked him, "Whose boots, Mr. William's or master's?" he said the gentleman had called in the morning at their shop—I asked who he came from—he said the gentleman called at their shop in the morning, and he had got a new pair to bring—I asked who he came from—he said from Dudley's—I said, "That is not Mr. Williams's boot-maker; his name is Core"—at last I gave him three pairs of boots belonging to Mr. William Rigby—I am certain he is the person—I have not the least doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Collier's-court, Golden-lane. On the 3rd of April the prisoner was at our place from nine o'clock until a quarter to two, and was never outside the place—I was at home that day I work at home—I am a saw-maker—my wife was with me-a young man came while he was there—I really cannot say his name just now—I cannot think of it at this moment—he brought a saw to be sharpened—he came about nine o'clock in the morning, and stopped till dinner time—that was one o'clock and after—he did not come with the prisoner—the prisoner, was there before him—the prisoner was up in my lodger's room—he did not come to me—my lodger's name is Hollingshead—he is not here—he has been here nearly all the day, but could not stop—the prisoner was in his room from nine o'clock till a quarter to two—I was down stairs at work, and nobody could go up and down without my seeing them—I saw him go up at a quarter to two o'clock—Mrs. Hollingshead had borrowed a pair of bellows of us, and the youngman went up for them—he is a painter and glazier by trade, but his name is not familiar to me—at a quarter to two o'clock I saw the prisoner come down—he was going after a situa<lb></lb>tion—I have never been in trouble in my life—I am sure it was on the day this was committed, because he was taken up that day—I heard of that three or four, or five or six days after—I recollect that, because he has never been about the place since—it was on the 3rd, I believe—the 3rd, was on a Tuesday—he had been at our house, backwards and forwards, on and off, for about a fortnight—he was there two or three hours, I be<lb></lb>lieve, on Monday, but I never went up to see how long he staid—I did not make it my business to know what time he came on Monday or saturday.</p>

On the 3rd of April, the prisoner came to my house at nine o'clock, and went up stairs—I saw him go out of the house at a quarter to two o'clock—nothing par<lb></lb>ticular makes me remember the 3rd of April—I recollect that was the day, because I had a child that was dead, and I recollect the day par<lb></lb>ticularly—the child died on that day—a young man was at our house that day, his name is Staples—he did not come with the prisoner—he came to see me—he came about twelve o'clock—the reason I know that young man was up stairs is, my baby was up stairs with the young man, and I went up with the child—the young man stopped till near two o'clock—he did nothing, only talked to me and my husband—I did not have any dinner that day, nor did my husband—the young man did not stop to dine—there was nobody else there—the reason I know the time so exactly is, my little girl goes to school at two o'clock, and I went to see the time, and it was ten minutes to two o'clock—I think Staples went away after the prisoner was gone—he staid all the time, except going up stairs for an ar<lb></lb>ticle of mine that was up there—when I went into the room at eleven o'clock, the prisoner had my baby in his lap—that was before Staples came—he did not dine there—I do not know whether Hollingshead is any re<lb></lb>lation to the prisoner—I know it was the 3rd, because my little baby, who is now dead, would have been four years old on that day—my hus<lb></lb>band did not write down any thing that day on a piece of paper, or a slate—I saw the slate yesterday and to—day—there is no "3rd of April" written on it—I did not look at it particularly, because it has my husband's work upon it.</p>

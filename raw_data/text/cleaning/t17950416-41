             sworn.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In the parish of Westham, on the forest, at the forest gate; I deal in pigs; I buy them to sell again; I am a pig jobber; I bought one sow and fifteen pigs of Bird the prisoner, on the 14th of January, in the pens of Romford.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day? - One o'clock, as near as possible. There were two sows, but I bought one sow of another man that Bird sold it to.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you first see them there, were two sows and fifteen pigs together? - Yes. He said he had been at Walford market with them, and could not sell them, and came across the country to Romford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what his name was? - No, I did not ask him his name. He said he brought them from Enfield Highway. There was another man along with him, and they both said the same. He asked me first for the pigs eight shillings a piece; I told him that I thought five shillings was nearer the mark. He said he had been bid six shillings, and I told him I could not afford to give any more; and I was going away, and then he asked me what I would give him for the sow, and I bargained for the sow at eighteen shillings; and as I was going away, he said I should have the pigs at my price, five shillings a piece. After that the other man that had bought the other sow of me said, as you have bought all the rest, you may as well buy the other sow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sell the other sow to the other man? - No. It was in the same pen along with the other. And he and I bargained for the other sow at seventeen shillings. Then we went into the King's Head, at Romford, altogether, for to pay for them. The other red haired man went with me that was with Bird, and my neighbour that is here now, and see me pay for them. When we got in there, I think we had three pots of purl and gin, and I could not pay him that I bought the sow of without changing a guinea; he said it did not make no odds, if I paid all the money altogether, and so the prisoner Bird took the money, five pounds ten shillings. Then afterwards, when we came out, I went to the pen, and sold the pig again to Mr. John Biggs, a master baker, at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell them for? - Eighteen pence a head profit of the pigs, and the two sows for fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a considerable profit, on them? - It is no more than I often get, or often lose. I went home to the baker's house to help him to drive them, and received the money for them at his house, and I came away home to my own house, I never heard any thing till that day fortnight, when I see two drovers who were going down the road, who had seen them in the market, and was going down to shew Bastick where the pigs were. He had offered two guineas reward for the recovery of the pigs. I went to Romford market, and this man that lost them came to me at Romford market, and told me that them pigs I sold were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again, how soon after? - I never see nothing more of him till last Friday, when I see him at the office in Hog-lane; I described him as well as I could, and they took him, and that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that you dealt with him for these pigs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before this time? - Not to my knowledge. Bastick went two or three times after the pigs be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160080"></xptr>fore the man would deliver them, and then I returned the money to Biggs, what I told them to him for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent so far, as they swear to the wrong man.</p>
               <p>Court to Baker. How long were you with the prisoner bargaining about these pigs and paying him for them? - I suppose about an hour, or somewhere there abouts.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live near Baker, in the parish of Westham, the forest gate, near the Eagle and Child. I went that day along with Baker from our own house to Romford that market day, and I went round the market and when I returned back again to him he was marking these pigs, he was talking with the prisoner at the bar, and another.</p>
               <p>Q. What past in your hearing between the prisoner and Baker at that time? - Nothing further till we got in doors, no further than he bought a single sow of the butcher back again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the public house what past? - Nothing no otherwise then I sat at the table and drank a little liquor, and I entered into conversation along with these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What past? - Nothing passed than that Baker paid the money to these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner either of these two men? - Yes; he received the money and sold the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay him the money for both sows and pigs or for only one sow? - For both sows together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation pass between the prisoner and any other person respecting where the pigs came from and how he had them? - No further than he said they stood at a great deal of expence of keeping them in the winter and he could not get victuals for them to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent he had the keeping of them in the winter? - Yes; and they lost a great deal of money by them; he said if he had not sold them there, he should have sent them to Smithfield before he went home; and I was going home with another person, in a cart; and between the Coach and Horses, at Hollford, and the Three Rabbits, there is a white gate, which leads up to squire Hulk's, there I see four of them together, the prisoner and three more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave them in the public house? - No, I came out with them, and saw Baker sell the pigs to Biggs, the four men seemed as if they were parting their money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of these men before that day? - I thought I had seen one of them before, and I asked him a great many questions about Ponder's-end. I kept on, and left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation, with the prisoner at that time? - No, I never spoke to him. The next day I told Baker I thought the pigs were stolen; and the fortnight after this, this man, Mr. Bastick, came after his property; he came and slept on Wednesday night in John Baker's house, then the next morning I went along with him to this captain Monro's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Biggs, the baker? - Yes, I have been at Dagnan many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you ever go about these pigs? - Never.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see any thing of the pigs after they were sold to Biggs, the baker? - No; I went to captain Monro's house, and I lay there that night, the next day I went to Enfield highway, where the prisoner said he came from, at Romford, by our giving such a good description of the people, they gave us the best advice they could, whereabouts to find them, and we went then to Baker-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160081"></xptr>street, which is little way out of Enfield-road; we went to this other man's house, who was along with this man when he sold the property; we saw him at home at his own house; I would have taken him, but I had not a warrant. The prisoner was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after? - We went to Mr. Spurrell, at Barton, and Mr. Spurrell granted out a warrant against this man, the prisoner at the bar. They gave us four names; by the description we gave, and he bearing but an indifferent character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to find him again? - I did not go after them again, but Mr. Spurrell sent the constable of Hilford, and Baker, and there they found him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him? - Never before last Friday, and then he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that they gave you the names of four different persons which answered the description that you gave of the man, or four different names of one person? - Of four different persons.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the prisoner till last Friday, when he was in custody? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then having not seen the prisoner the time it happened, till last Friday, will you undertake to swear that he is the man? - Yes, I can very safely; when he sold the pigs he had the smock frock on, and a silk handkerchief about his neck, and a high crowned hat on.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he when you apprehended him? - Walking at the side of the road, at Enfield highway; I took him by the collar, and told him that I suspected that he was the person concerned in stealing the pigs; there had been different pigs stole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - I told him that I was surprised that he should be about the neighbourhood, when he was suspected of stealing the pigs; and he told me that he did not know that he was suspected; he told me I was very busy, and when I took him by the collar he told me he would not go with me, without I shewed him my authority; I told him he was my authority, and he said he would not go with me, and he began to pull away, but I held him fast; he swore he would knock me down; I told him it was out of his power to knock me down; he told me I should be done; I told him it was out of his power, and I called a man out of the house, just by, one Boswell, a taylor; and he went in again, and two soldiers coming by, which I knew one of them, I called to one of them by his name, one Ralph, and told him I had got a thief, and one of them assisted me; and we met the headborough; I had sent for him; then I sent for Mr. Bastick, and took him to the cage; the next morning I brought him to town, and persuaded him to turn evidence, for I was sure he was concerned, by the description I had heard of him. There was no prosecutor appeared that day, only the person that bought the sow and pigs, and they said they could swear to him; they thought to admit him an evidence then, but afterwards one Pepper was taken, and admitted an evidence; Bird owned to me of the robbery after he came away from the magistrate's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Palmer, and live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell. Mr. William Palmer has a dwelling-house at No. 29 1/2, Great Sutton-street, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 13th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Sutton-street, and saw the prisoner Draper between the two parlour windows of Mr. Palmer's house—one of the windows was open, and when I got up to the window, I saw Phillips in the parlour, with the clock in his hand—I asked what he did there, and shut the window down—I then knocked at the door of the house, and called out, "Police"—I then saw Phillips getting out of the window—he ran down the street, and at the same time I saw Draper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080035"></xptr>
               <p>nearly at the bottom of the street, running—I did not see him commence run<lb></lb>ning—I had walked past him to get to the door—it was the first window that was open, and which I shut down—I followed Phillips, crying, "Stop thief," till he was stopped by a policeman—I lost sight of him for about half a minute, in turning the corner of Sutton-street into St. John-street—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him round the corner, and saw him running about fifty yards from me—he ran about 500 yards after getting round the corner—I am certain he is the man I saw get out of the window—I had a full view of his face at the time he was in the parlour, and of his back when he was running—he put the clock on the side-board again, he did not bring it out with him—as we were bringing Phillips back to the prosecutor's house, another constable brought Draper towards us, and he went back along with Phillips—I firmly believe he is the same man I had seen between the windows, by his dress and ap<lb></lb>pearance—I speak to him from his face and dress both</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Palmer. I heard a loud knock<lb></lb>ing at the door, and a cry of "Police"—I went into the parlour and found the window thrown up to the top, and the time-piece moved from the place where I had seen it before—this is it—it is the property of Mr. William Palmer—I had been in that room at eight that morning, and opened the shutters—I am quite sure the windows were both shut down then—they are common sash windows—no one but myself had been into the room that morn<lb></lb>ing—there was only one other person in the house, and a female servant named Clark—she had only just got up, and was at breakfast in the kitchen with me—I am certain she was not in the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there no fastenings to the windows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I opened the shutters a few minutes before eight o'clock—I dusted the room, and left it about eight—the clock then stood on a little sideboard, with its back against the wall, where it always stood—when I went into the room after the alarm was given it was moved close to the edge of the sideboard—I opened the windows, in order to open the shutters, and then shut them down again—there is a little catch to the windows—I know one was fastened—I cannot say whether the other was—Clark was not out of my sight after com<lb></lb>ing down stairs till the alarm was given.</p>

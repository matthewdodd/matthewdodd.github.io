On the 19th of Oct. about half an hour after 10 o'clock at night, I went to the next door, which was about four yards distant from mine? I shut my door, but did not lock it, and left my watch hanging up against the wainscot, and a candle a-light in the shop. I staid about 10 minutes; when I returned, I found the door open, and watch gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see your own door from the place you was gone to?</p>
               <p>Rickerby. I could not. The next day I advertised the watch; and in about a week after, I received a letter from Mr.

            , in Swithin's-alley: I went to him; he told me if I would give him two guineas, he would tell me where the man lived that had bought the watch (I had advertised One Guinea reward.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Shanks?</p>
               <p>Rickerby. He keeps a notary public office by 'Change-Alley. I gave him 2 guineas; then he directed me to Mr. Honychurch, by Cherry-Garden-Stairs, Rotherhithe, where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Rickerby. The prisoner lodged in my house till the time he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home that night?</p>
               <p>Rickerby. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his employ?</p>
               <p>Rickerby. I do not know any employ he is of. I took him up on the Wednesday following, and charged him with it; he owned it, and said it was necessity that made him take it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Honychurch. I am a watchmaker, and live at Rotherhithe; the prisoner at the bar brought this watch to me, on the 20th of October last; he said he wanted to dispose of it (producing a silver watch; deposed to by prosecutor) I bought it of him for two guineas. I was sent for to Justice Fielding, there I heard the prisoner say, he hoped the prosecutor would forgive him, and look over it, as it was the first offence.</p>

               <p>I was going over the bridge, and met a man who asked me, if I would buy a watch? Saying, he wanted money, and would sell it cheap. I gave him 236 s. piece for it, and went to Mr. Honychurch, and sold it to him.</p>

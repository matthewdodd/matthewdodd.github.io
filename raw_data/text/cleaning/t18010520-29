             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Montague. I am errand-boy to Mrs.Yates, No.92, Fetter-lane: On Monday the 9th of March last, the prisoner came and took a rump and a loin of beef away; he said there was a mistake about that beef, he was to take it to Islington; he immediately put a cloth upon his shoulder, and put the beef upon the cloth; he said it was bought at Mr. Gordon's, in Newgate-market, and then went away with it; I went after him, and overtook him at the corner of Hatton-garden, he was walking as fast as he could, with the meat upon his shoulder; I asked him where he was going to take that bees to; he said to Islington; I immediately left him, and went to Mr. Gordon's; a day or two afterwards I saw him at Hatton-garden, and knew him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his being the man?</p>
               <p>- A. None; I told him he had taken the beef, but he did not say any thing to it.</p>

Gordon; I think that was his expression; he said he would go there, or wherever I pleased; he was upon the run when I came up to him, as well as he could with so large a piece of beef upon his shoulder; I suffered him to proceed, not knowing what piece of beef it was that was lost; about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I went with the journeyman in search of the prisoner, and found him in Cow-cross; I then asked him to go to Islington, where he described that he was going; he went along with us a few yards, seemingly contented, and then several times attempted to make his escape; he got away, and I pursued him, and saw him taken by a constable, I never lost fight of him; the boy was shewn into two rooms, and very much cautioned, and then he came into a dark room, where the prisoner was, he immediately said, that is the man that stole the beef; the prisoner said he was not, and used very abusive language.</p>

On the 31st of December, in the afternoon, I met the prisoner and another - the prisoner asked me to go into a public-house, which I did; I was quite sober - I had not seen the prisoner before; Saunders was with him - the prisoner called for some gin and water: we all went into the house together - the other called for the gin and water, and paid for it: the other man, said he met a lady last night, and lent her 5l. to get a bonnet - the prisoner was there, and I am sure he heard it - we then went into the public-house, and had something to drink; I told him he would never see the bonnet nor the woman again - the other then said he had been to the Bank and received 800l.; the prisoner heard him say it - they both asked me if I had any money; I said I had: the prisoner asked me to pull it out and lay it on the table, which I did - it was 19s.6d.; the prisoner took it up and put it into the other one's hat, which was on the table; the prisoner then got up, and called me to the door - I went out with him, and when I returned the other man had run away with the money; it was a parlour we were in: when we got out into the street the prisoner said he was going to get change for a draft, and I left him - before he went away he told me to go back and look after the other one; I went, but the man and money were gone - I prosecuted that man in January last; all the money was gone, my hat and all - I had only 1 1/2d. left: I was at the door two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you positively swear I am the man? A. Yes: I never saw you before nor since till now - I think I was an hour in your company; I did not tell my brother I would not come up, as I did not know you were the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had conversation with these two men? A. Yes, and with the prisoner at the door - I am sure he is the man.</p>

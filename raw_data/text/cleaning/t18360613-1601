                  </hi>. I was lodge-keeper to the late Mr. Robert Westly Hall Dare, M. P.—he was living on the 11th of May in the parish of Barking. I left my house about eight o'clock that morning, and came to town with my family—we left all secure, and my wife locked the door in my presence—my wife returned about eight o'clock at night, and I returned about nine o'clock—I found my coat, waistcoat, and breeches gone, also a basket, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, seven yards of print, and three sheets—the house had been entered by breaking the window, and unlatching the fastening of the window—the prisoner lived in our neighbourhood.</p>

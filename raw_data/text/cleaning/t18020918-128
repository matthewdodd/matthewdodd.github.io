               <p>JAMES MUNYARD sworn. - On the 21st of June, between the hours of one and three, I was standing in <placeName id="t18020918-128-crimeloc682">Cranbourn-alley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by M. Knapp. Q. You felt his hand in your pocket? - A. Yes, but did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him directly? - A. No; he run round the small mob; it might be a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hat taken off? - A. Yes, and the book taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a foreigner, and very innocent of this business; I was going through Cranbourn-alley, where I saw a mob, so that I could hardly pass; I saw the prosecutor in conversation with a man in a blue coat, whom he left, and immediately came up to me, saying, you have got my pocket-book; I produced my own red book, he said, no, that was not his; then my hat was knocked off, and a man said, here is your pocketbook, then he let me go; I was walking on, when he came after me, and said, I will stop you; I told him I would go with him any where, which I did; I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Munyard.) Q. Is it true, he offered to go to Bow-street, or any where, with you? - A. No, he ran away, and I took him again; he said, he was very sorry for it, as it was his first offence; he made resistance for a long time, till he found the people on my side.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020918-128-verdict683" type="verdictDescription">

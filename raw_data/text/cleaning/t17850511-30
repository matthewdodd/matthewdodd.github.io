               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is this true? - I went to look at the prisoner, but this story is not true; I did not ask him for any money.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clisson. We went on purpose to learn his right name, and he offered to give me money, and I told him I did not want money, as poor as I was; he offered me 6 d. when I took him, and his waistcoat, and I would not have it.</p>
               <p>Freeborn. I was with them, there was no money asked; Mrs. Clisson said she did not want any bribe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. On the the 14th of June I was going to the two-shilling gallery of Covent-garden Theatre—I was not half-way up the stairs, when I felt a pressure against my side—I turned, and saw the prisoner Higgs with my gown lifted up, and his hand in my pocket—I said, "What do you do with your hand in my pocket, you are robbing me?—I seized him by the collar, and during that time I saw him pass my purse to Cripps—I seized them both, and said, "Give me my purse, I insist upon it"—they struggled very hard, and Cripps got away from me—I held Higgs till a gentleman came up-stairs, and said, "What is the to let him go till I get an officer"—he said he would hold him while I went for an officer, which I did—My friends who were with me pursued Cripps, and he was taken—my purse contained two shillings, two half-pence, and a foreign coin—I had taken a shilling from it not two minutes before, and put it into my pocket again—this is my purse.</p>

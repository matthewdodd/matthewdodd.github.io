            . I am a butcher, and live in Union court, Chicksand-street. On the 4th of August, I saw the prosecutor coming along Brick-lane, he appeared to be intoxicated. The prisoner had hold of one arm, and another woman the other. I saw the other woman lean over the prosecutor's shoulder, and whisper to the prisoner, which excited my suspicion. I saw the other woman put her hand into his pocket-nothing was taken at that time. They forced him down Hanover-court; I went to the end of the court, and saw the prisoner pull his pocketbook out. I said, "You shall not rob the man while I am here." Two men came up immediately, and wanted to know what business it was of mine? and asked me why I wanted to hinder the girls from getting a shilling? They kept before me. The prisoner and the other woman rushed out-the men prevented my following her. I told Hardy, and we both followed her - She got away. One of the gang threw half a brick at me. Next day the prisoner was taken. I am sure she is the woman - I knew her before.</p>

I turned round, and called for assistance. I looked again, and saw the pocket-book in her hand - She handed it to the other woman; they ran out of the court. I am positive she is the woman.</p>

I overtook her in Flower and Dean-street, searched her, but found nothing on her, and let her go, as I did not know what had happened. I afterwards heard that she was seen to commit the robbery, and took her next morning.</p>

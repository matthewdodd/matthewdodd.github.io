I am sure she is the woman; we chatted together for three minutes, she asked me to give her something to drink, I gave her 6 d., my brother, mother, and sister, were about four yards a-head, agreeing for a hackney coach, she kept me in conversation three minutes, I then left her, she was close to me, when I gave her the money, a man said feel if you have got your watch, I felt and missed it; it was safe just before - we went after her with the watchman, who overtook her - she swore she had not got it, he overhawled her, and found it in her bosom.</p>

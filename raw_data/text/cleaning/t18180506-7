A man of the name of Williams first came up to me; my apron was tucked up over my watch. He asked a man if he wanted any thing? and said if he did, he would punch him in the mouth. I thought I would get out of the mob, but they all surrounded me, with several others. Williams seized my left arm, and Major seized me round the waist, while the others kept shoving me about. Greenfield struck me. I put my hand over my watch and money in my trowsers. At that time I felt it go from me, and called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060006"></xptr>out, "Let me go, Major!" I felt a hand in my pocket. One of them squeezed me in a certain part, by which means they got a half-crown. I called for assistance, and was dragged into a cart by the people - I then lost my senses. When I recovered I saw Major, Greenfield, and Williams, in the crowd. I remained there for two hours, till the bull-bait was over, being fearful I should be molested before I got out of the field; I then gave Gillmore information-the prisoners were afterwards taken. Major and Greenfield robbed me. I do not know that the others did any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I went to the bull-bait out of curiosity. I do not generally attend these diversions. There might be a thousand people there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say you could not swear to Major - A. I said I could not swear that he took the watch.</p>

I saw Green-field, Lockton, and Major there-Major was close to the prosecutor, feeling in his pockets for a long while, while the prosecutor called out, "Murder! for God's sake help!" Major got something from him, which I thought was his watch. He said,</p>
               <p>"I have got it! I have got it!" I saw Greenfield strike the prosecutor a heavy blow on his right eye before the watch was taken - He kept pushing and hustling him; Lockton kept shoving him about-there were fifteen or twenty in the gang. The people pulled the prosecutor into the cart-the gang called out, "Turn it over!" the prosecutor then said he had lost his watch: he was afterwards insensible. The gang did not leave the field. The prosecutor remained in the cart for two hours; he said he was afraid to go - He could hardly walk. He went away with a man named Judd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew the prosecutor by sight. I never saw him at bull-baits - I do not frequent them.</p>

I met the prisoner in Marylebone-lane on the night of the 16th of April—I had a slight knowledge of her before—she went with me to Easely-mews, where I live, over my master's coach-house—we went to bed toge<lb></lb>ther—she got up first, leaving me asleep—when I awoke she was gone—I missed the watch now produced, which had been hanging on a hook near the fire-place—I missed it before fire o'clock in the morning.</p>

I was on duty in Adam-street—I went to Mr. Tomlinson's shop, and, from a motion made by one of the young men, I went outside and stood at the corner of Adam-street—the prisoner came and asked if I had seen a young man that worked at Mr. Peter's factory—I said, "No"—she went into the shop again, but previous to that she said a young man spoke to her in Adam-street and said, "It is rather awkward, is it not? I want to go in and pledge this watch; I don't like to go in myself, I am so well known, for I work at Mr. Peter's;" that he gave her the watch, and told her to ask 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—Mr. Tomlinson then came out and I took her—I went to her lodging, at No. 1,</p>

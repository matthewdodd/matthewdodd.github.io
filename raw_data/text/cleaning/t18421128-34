                  </hi>. I live in Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell. On the night of the 28th of Oct. I was going home through Field-lane, and the two prisoners laid hold of me by each arm—I swear positively to Jones, but not to Jenkins, any more than that I afterwards picked her out from two other girls—to the best of my knowledge, she is the person—after a little time, I got Jenkins from my right arm, but Jones kept hold with both hands on my left, so that I could not get away from her—we got up as far as the new church, Saffron-hill, where there is a court—they wanted me to go up this passage, which I re<lb></lb>fused to do, and at that moment I felt Jones's hand in my pocket—Jenkins stood close alongside—I put my hand outside my thigh, to feel if my purse was safe, and found it was gone—I instantly laid hold of her wrist, hallooed "Police" as loud as I could, and never let go of her till the policeman came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184211280038"></xptr>
               <p>—the other escaped—Jones denied having robbed me—she was taken to the station—I lost eight sovereigns and four half-sovereigns—one of the sove<lb></lb>reigns was a dragon sovereign, which I had taken on the previous Monday, and I noticed it, thinking it was a light one, before I put it with other money, that I should know where I took it from—on the Saturday I was at the Police-court, and Jenkins and two other girls came there—Jenkins was taken into custody, searched, and eight sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, and sixpence, found on her—one sovereign had a dragon—I cannot speak to the money beyond that—it was in a leather purse, which has not been found.</p>

I am gaoler at Clerken well Police-court While Jones was being examined, on the Saturday, I went into the passage, and saw Jen<lb></lb>kins and two other young women, and directed them to be taken into my room to be searched—I observed Jenkins doing something underneath her clothes with her hands, as if putting something from one hand to another—I imme<lb></lb>diately seized her hand, and said I would have what she had in her hand—she immediately put her hand under her clothes, and dropped whatever it was into her bosom—I said, "It is no use, I must see what it is"—she threw herself down, and kicked and bit us—I put my fingers down her bosom, and pulled up this purse, containing eight sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, a sixpence, and two duplicates—the sovereigns were wrapped up in a bit of rag—one was a George-and-dragon sovereign—we asked the prosecutor if he could speak to any of the money, and before I opened the bag he said there was one with the George-and-dragon on it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. Perfectly so; I put my pocket-book into my inside coat pocket behind - I am certain of that; I consider it a very safe pocket - I felt nobody at it; my handkerchief was not in my pocket, but in my hat; I called at a house in Clement's-lane, but seeing a person of the same business there, I did not wish him to know I dealt there, and left - I stopped no where else till I came to Bucklersbury; my pocket is a very deep one, and the book was not large - I have no idea of the distance of Bucklersbury from Fenchurch-street; I suppose it is about half a mile - my pocket was not cut; the book contained papers and a card; I am certain I put it into my pocket.</p>

            . I am a dealer and salesman, and live at No. 10, Field-lane, Holborn. On the 24th of August, about two o'clock, the prisoners came to me to purchase some clothes - they looked out two waistcoats and a pair of trousers, which came to 18s., and offered me this 10l. note; I said I had no cash in the house to give change, and immediately ran to the Bank to get change for it - it was stopped; Mr. Dyte was there - I returned with him; we met an officer on the road, and he went with us to my house; the prisoners were waiting there - I had told them I was going to change the note at the Bank, and found them waiting; they were immediately given into custody - I had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Yours is a clothes shop? A. Yes; I looked at the note, and told them to wait while I went to the Bank to see if it was right - I was gone about a quarter of an hour; I had told them I was going to investigate about the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any suspicion of it? A. No, but if I have a large note, I always make inquiry to see if it is a good one - I took it to the Bank, because if it was a bad note I should lose my money.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you told them you went not only to get change, but to investigate? A. I did- I left them in my back parlour; my wife was with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that when you first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060043"></xptr>gave an account of this transaction, you stated that you told them you were going to the Bank to investigate about the note? A. I might not have said so at first, but perhaps the question was not put to me - I presented it at the Bank for change; I believe I asked the gentleman if it was a good note.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell the exact words you made use of to the prisoners? A. I told them I should go to the Bank to get it changed, and see if it was good.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of August Mr. Dyte passed me in the Poultry; I went with him to Alexander's, found the prisoners there, and asked how they became possessed of the 10l. note; they said they picked it up in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Dyte was present when they said said they had picked it up? A. I think so; the prisoners were in Alexander's parlour waiting his arrival - he told them it was all wrong.</p>
               <p>Northfield's Defence. We did not say we picked it up in Thames-street - we were coming down Thames-street, and up Walbrook.</p>
               <p>Perroten's Defence. I met Northfield, and at the corner of Walbrook he picked up the pocket-book, opened it, and it contained a 10l. note; he threw the pocket-book away, and went to Alexander's to change the note - he said he would go to the Bank, and get it cashed, and we waited till he returned.</p>

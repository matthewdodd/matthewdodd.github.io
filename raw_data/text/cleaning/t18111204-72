            . Forrester and I were going on the 26th of November, we stopped the prisoner in Cutler-street; I said, you have got a log of wood; he said, yes. I took him under is lamp, it turned out to be a ream of paper; I asked him who he was; he said he should not satisfy me; he said a person had given him the paper in the street. I then lodged him in the Poultry Compter, and left the paper with the ward beadle. I have the paper here. I got information that the paper belonged to the prosecutor, and the prisoner was his porter. I searched the prisoners lodgings. The prisoner confessed that he had robbed his master of several reams of paper off his master's pile, but another man had led him into it.</p>

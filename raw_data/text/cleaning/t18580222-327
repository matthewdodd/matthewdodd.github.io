                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abraham Hancock, of No. 8, Ormond Terrace, Regent's Park. On 8th Feb., at about half past 4 o'clock, I saw the two female prisoners—Robinson asked me the way to Mary-le-bonne—I inquired "What part?" because we were only a few yards out of Mary-le-bonne; she said, "Oh, Mary-le-bonne"—I directed her—Fisher was at my right hand very close to me, and Robinson in front—they then left me, and almost immediately I felt, and missed my purse from my dress pocket, contain<lb></lb>ing a half sovereign and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a bill, which I had just paid, and put into it only a few minutes before—I turned, and saw that the prisoners were not going the way that I had directed them; they were walking, but as soon as they saw me following, Fisher ran away—I called to the park keeper, and gave him information; he stopped Fisher—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this paper in it is mine—I afterwards saw the other two prisoners stopped—I went to the station; the three prisoners were present, and somebody threw my purse at my feet—the half sovereign and a peculiar sixpence were gone, but there was some silver left.</p>

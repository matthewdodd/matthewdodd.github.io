                  </hi>. I am a stone sawyer, of End-street. On 26th Dec., I was at the Swan public-house, between five and six o'clock, drinking a drop of porter with four or five others—twelve or fourteen men came and burst the door open—the prisoner and his mate were the first that came in—I was standing at the fire warming a drop of beer, and I put the pot over the fireplace—I caught up the poker to hide it behind a seat—the prisoner caught hold of it, and because I would not give it up to him he took the pot off the shelf and hit me on the head with it, which knocked me down, and I let go of the poker—I had had no quarrel with him—he was not tipsy—I have drank with him before—as I was getting up, a young <hi rend="italic">chap up</hi> with his fist and gave me a black eye—the prisoner was by at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Peckham. Sampson was brought to me next day with a wound on his head—I did not ascertain the depth of it as it was scabbed over—I have no doubt it was a severe blow—there was a bruise all round it—it might have been inflicted with a quart pot.</p>

I was at the public-house, and saw the prisoner come in with two others—twelve or fourteen followed them—one of them knocked a man down senseless under the table—Sampson took the poker from the fireplace and hid it—the prisoner tried to get it from hit hand, and as he could not he took a quart pot and hit him on the head—he had done nothing to provoke him; not a person in the house had said a word to any of them—they dragged Sampson out of the room by the hair, threw him up against the bar, and left him there senseless.</p>

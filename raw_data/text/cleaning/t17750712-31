            . I am a constable; on the 1st of June, about a quarter before eleven, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, by two watchmen, who charged him with breaking open Mr. Stone's cellar, in Great St. Helen's; I examined him, and found in his pocket a tinder-box with tinder; a flint, steel, a bunch of matches and a bit of candle, (producing them) he said, there were two other men concerned with him in taking this vermillion out of the cellar, but would not tell their names. He said, they brought it up and he took it from them. When he was taken by the watchmen, he threw this key from him ( producing it) which opens the padlock of the cellar.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Great St. Helen's, where this warehouse is, on the first of June about a quarter before eleven, I heard the help of the door rattle, as if the padlock was taking off the staple. I went up to the door and saw the prisoner, and the three bags of vermillion at his feet; I asked him what business he had there, he said he was only making water; I told him he must go to the watch house, and give a better account of himself; I called another watchman to assist me, as we were going to the watch-house, I heard him drop something, the other watchman picked it up, it was a key, which I saw tried to the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. to the Constable. Was there any promise made to him, when he said the other two men were concerned with him, and gave it him out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. It was said, if he told who the men were, and Mr. Stone and Mr. Pugh, got their things again, he might be admitted an evidence.</p>

               <p>I was very drunk that night; there were two men had gambled all my money from me, they told me, if I would stay there while they went down into the cellar, they would give me the money they had won of me.</p>

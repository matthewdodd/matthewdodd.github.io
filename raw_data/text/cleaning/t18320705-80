On the 14th of June the prisoner came to their shop- she asked for some ribbon, and some was shown her; she had several yards cut off: Davis gave me information - I saw the prisoner leave the shop, and followed her; she went into a house in Compton-street: I sent for the Policeman, and she was taken - fourteen pieces of ribbon were found in this bag, which she put down at her feet; it is in the shape of an apron, and I suppose had been tied round her.</p>

            . I was serving the prisoner in the shop, I showed her some ribbon, she had several yards cut off, which came to not quite a 1s.: I watched her, and saw her putting something into her breast; I then saw her with one piece which she could not conceal - I looked at her, and she threw it down; I caught her hand: she ran out of the shop - I called to Mr. Muir; she was pursued, and ran into a house in Compton-street.</p>

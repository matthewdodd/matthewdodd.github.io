               <p>Q. Was there nothing done from which you could collect that she took this property? - A. I did not myself, my young man served her.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Chaloner; the prisoner came to the bottom of the shop, and I shewed her some cloth; she did not think the first I shewed her fine enough, upon which I went to the far end of the shop to get another finer; there were five pieces of muslin when I left her, she was close to the counter; on my return, I found but three pieces; I immediately informed Mr. Chaloner of it; I then went to the prisoner, and she bought some cloth immediately, which amounted to four shillings and eight-pence; after that, she was in a particular hurry to get away, she would not stop to have the cloth put in paper; Mr. Chaloner challenged her with the two pieces of muslin, and sent me for a constable; on my return with tho constable, she had delivered up the two pieces, which were given to the constable; they belonged to Mr. Chaloner, I know them by the private mark at the corner of each piece, in Mr. Chaloner's hand-writing, they are worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the shop besides you and your master? - A. There were several customers.</p>

               <p>Q. But you saw her arm moving towards it? - A. Yes; I saw her arm drop from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. And that must have been the time that she took it? - A. Yes.</p>

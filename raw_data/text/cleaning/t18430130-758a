On the 21st of Jan., about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the shop of Eliza Ann Plum—I saw the prisoner take twelve shirts from the counter, and throw them down outside, and two boys outside took them—one of them dropped the bundle—I ran, but did not take either of them—I took the prisoner in the shop.</p>

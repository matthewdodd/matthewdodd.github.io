               <p>Mr. Knapp. In opening of your pocket book could they see you had a quantity of notes - A. Most likely they could.

            . My father is a plaisterer in Gray's-buildings, Duke-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Martin - A. Yes, on day the robbery happened, between four and five in the afternoon; he shewed me a five pound and a ten pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What colour pocket book was yours - A. Black.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that ten pound note in your hand - A. That ten pound bank note I received from Mr. Thrall; I had it in my pocket book that day.</p>
               <p>Martin's Defence. I left there about three o'clock in the afternoon to go to my work, when I got there I could not see. The prosecutor, before the magistrate, said that he did not miss his pocket book till he got home.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Kilby's Defence. That woman, Sharpe, owned she took it from the side of the gentleman; I told him that I saw her give the book to the man, but I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>Sharpe's Defence. I took the book, I do not recollect what I did with it, I wish to have the money what I am to suffer for.</p>
               <p>Pearce was not put on her defence.</p>

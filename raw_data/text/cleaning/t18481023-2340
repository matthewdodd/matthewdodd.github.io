I keep the Crown, Stanhope-street, Clare-market, in the parish of St. Clement Danes—it is my dwelling-house—the prisoner occasionally lodged there—he had his victuals there—on Wednesday night, 20th Sept., about twelve o'clock my wife told me something—I went to my bed-room, and missed a box of jewellery from a drawer, also two waistcoats, six silk handkerchiefs, two shirts, and an apron; worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these produced are a portion of them—the prisoner was there that day and evening—the prisoner slept there that night—I missed some of them before bedtime—these rings are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mr. Clifford's service. I saw the prisoner is the bagatelle-room on the first-floor—I went to my master's room on the next floor, and heard a scuffling noise in one of the bed-rooms—I was in the dark—I got a light, and saw a man's foot under the bed in the spare room—I called out but got no answer—I went down to the bagatelle-room—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not there—he was there five minutes before—I called a Mr. smith, we went up, but saw no one—there are two doors to the ioom, one was us-locked, and the other locked inside; the person under the bed could unlock it, and go down another flight of stairs which communicated with the aters—I went down again, and saw the prisoner in the bagatelle-room—I asked if he had been up stairs—he said, "No"—I saw something in his bosom, and asked what it was—he said his flannel shirt stuck out—I said it did not look</p>

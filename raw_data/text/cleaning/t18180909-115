            . I am an officer. On the 6th of August, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prosecutor in Fleet-street, going towards Temple-bar, and saw the prisoners, standing together, leaning over a post at the corner of Salisbury-court; I had been following them before. They followed the prosecutor, when he passed them. Avery went behind him just at Water-lane, he put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket-Oliver was close behind him; Avery pulled the prosecutor's handkerchief about half way out, the prosecutor still went on; Oliver went up and took it quite out. I laid hold of Avery, and told the prosecutor to hold him while I fetched the other; I followed him through several courts with the handkerchief in his hand, it was red with white spots. He turned to the right into Bouverie-street, and Fleet-street again; crossed Fleet-street into another court and went into a house there, he shut the door, I opened it, but lost sight of him. I returned to Fleet-street, took Avery from the prosecutor and took him to the Compter. I returned, and saw Crouch in Fleet-street with Oliver, I had informed him of the circumstance; the handkerchief has never been found. I was on the opposite side to the prosecutor.</p>

            ) What have you to say to these Plates?</p>
               <p>Young. Mr. Bulter brought me these three Plates upon the 25th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Young. Yes, Sir, I know her as well as I know myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pawn them for?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020019"></xptr>Young. For a Shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whose Plates they were?</p>
               <p>Young. No, my Lord, I knew her to be an honest Woman; I never heard a bad Character of her in my Life.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you done with the Plates?</p>
               <p>Young. When I heard Mrs. Backhouse was pursuing of her for a Silver Spoon, I look'd upon the Plates , and they have Mrs. Backhouse's Name, in Furnival's Inn, upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was wrote upon the Plates, you should have looked upon them.</p>
               <p>Young . Yes, my Lord, I should.</p>
               <p>Court. I think 'tis a very odd Thing you should take such Things without looking upon the Name. Would you give Money upon them without opening ?</p>
               <p>Young . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court . Suppose they had been Pantiles, or any Thing ?</p>
               <p>Q Did she leave the Cloth too.</p>
               <p>Young. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never open them?</p>
               <p>Young. I never open'd them.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis a very uncautious Way of acting; this is to encourage such Things.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you carry them home?</p>
               <p>Young. I believe it was the 19th of June, the Constable has them.</p>

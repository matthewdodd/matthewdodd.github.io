On the 2d of August, I was ill of the rheumatism in my head, and staid in the bar till I could not stay any longer; I laid down my head in the kitchen upon the table, till almost eleven o'clock; just before it struck eleven, I ordered the girl to put up the shutters, for I was so wearied, I wished to go to bed; I then went into the bar, where were the two prisoners sitting with a woman with them; I desired them to go to bed, I thought it was time; when I was going to shut up the house, the girl went into the parlour to shut the window-shutters, and I outside to hold the shutters to till she fastened them inside; I came into the taproom, and missed Whomby all at once, I did not know which way he had gone; I asked Radford to go to bed, and he went out, and stopped about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120061"></xptr>minutes; he then came back and asked for a candle to go to bed; I then ordered the girl to go and fasten the cellar flaps and shoot the bolts; and I went to see it done; since my husband has been gone, I have been very careful to see that every thing was fastened before I went to bed; I heard the girl shut to the bolts while I was fastening the shutters; I locked the tap-room door and the girl locked the cellar-door, and gave me the key; I make it a rule always to take up the keys with me; the girl sleeps in a bureau bedstead, opposite to the cellar door; I saw every thing fast, I went to bed a little before eleven; I got up to washing between three and four, I found every thing fast as I left it; I went out of doors, I took the bolt out of the window shutters, and called the girl; when I took the bolt out of the window shutters, I found my cellar flap almost out of the place where it shuts in, and lifted into the street, it must have been unbolted inside; I have every reason to believe Whomby concealed himself in the cellar, for he had not been to bed, that I am sure. I then called the watchman, I found a cask of shrub missing, and the rum all poured out, I suppose there might be four or five gallons in it. I found myself incapable of washing, and I got a washerwoman; I continued in my tap-room and bar all the morning, till about half past six o'clock; Whomby came in very much in liquor, he did not say a word to me, nor I to him; he went into the yard and stopped there, it might be five minutes; then he went up stairs, I took particular notice of him, for the back cellar has a spring in it, and is generally ancle deep in mud and water; and to prevent my servants going into it, I pump it into the front cellar. When he came in, his shoes and the lower part of his trowsers were all over mud, the same as was in my back cellar; he stopped up stairs about a quarter of an hour, and he made Redford get up, and they came down stairs; they had a pint of beer in the tap-room, it was then near eight o'clock. The girl and I went out to drive some ducks in, and Radford followed me, and stood at the door; and then Whomby gave a great whistle; I thought something was the matter, and I saw Whomby attempt to go up stairs; I went to go in, and Radford stopped me at the door, so that I could not get in; I followed him up stairs, and I got up the two-pair of stairs nearly as quick as him; then I saw him with the cask of shrub under his left arm; I told him, he ought to be ashamed of himself, in the manner in which I was left, to be robbing of me for six weeks; says he, d-n you, you b-h, if you don't get down stairs, I will kill you immediately; with that, I returned down stairs, and called out, murder! thieves! and alarmed the people in the house and at the door; then I went up stairs, but before I could get up stairs, Whomby had given Radford the cask of shrub, and Radford was putting a knapsack over it in a box of Radford's; I did not know then what it was he was putting in the box; I begged of Whomby to give me the cask of shrub, and he said, he had not seen it; and he threatened me a great deal, and said, I was so and so, and he had never robbed me of any thing; Radford kept fastening up the box and standing before it. I came down stairs, and Whomby followed me; I then sent for a constable, and Radford came down afterwards. The constable took Whomby away, and Radford went into the tap-room; I said, Radford, I am afraid you have had connections in robbing me, these six weeks, of every thing I have lost; I told him, he might he ashamed of himself, when he did not know whether I had a father living for my children, or not; and he abused me very much. There was a corporal there gave him a share of a pint of ale; and the corporal was more curious in watching Radford than I was; for I was so full of trouble, I did not observe what was going forward. The corporal went up stairs after Radford, and saw the cask, and then the constable fetched it down; I am sure it was my cask, I had emptied a little shrub out of it the day before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever see your cask of shrub from the day before, till it was produced to you by the corporal? - A. I saw it that evening before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see it from that time till it was produced to you by the corporal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see it in Radford's box? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You had the misfortune to have your husband taken prisoner at Ostend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband alive? - A. I did not know till the 3d of this month, when Sir

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 8th of April I saw the prisoner in Union-street, Spitalfields - he came out of a coach near the Grapes, and had a bag with him; I asked him what he had got - he said, "If you will come with me you shall see;" I said "Where did you bring it from?" he said "From Turnstile, Holborn" - I went into the Grapes with him; he asked the lady if she would take it in - she refused; he said,"You know Thomas Lackey, don't you?" she said "No, I know

Because I was on duty and took particular notice of it - I was not on duty on the 9th or 10th; it was half-past three o'clock in the afternoon - it is a great thoroughfare; only one person got out of the coach, and that was the prisoner - I did not notice the wheels of the coach; he did not say he was employed to take it to the Grapes - he went in there and I followed him; he did not say he was directed to leave it there for Mr. Lackey - the lady said she thought it was all right; and I let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150075"></xptr>him him go, as he appeared to have done all that he said he had to do, to leave the parcel there - I said to the landlady, "I don't think it is all right;" - he was taken up about two hours afterwards; I had never seen him before, but I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How was he dressed? A. He had a red night-cap on that day; I saw the bag opened by the inspector, and it had these two pieces of silk in it - a man might carry them without a coach.</p>

            . I am landlady of the Grapes - I have seen the prisoner once or twice; I do not recollect whether it was the 8th of April, but I was in my house with the witness when a bag like this was left by the prisoner - Mr. Heron came and took it; it contained two pieces of silk like these.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was done with the bag? A. It remained there about two hours, and then the superintendent and two officers took it.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 8th of April I went to the Grapes with an inspector - I got this bag and have had it ever since; I afterwards took the prisoner, at the Prince of Wales, in Wentworth-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go with the superintendent? A. Yes, the bag was taken from the bar to the section-house; the superintendent kept it there till last Tuesday when I went and got it - it is the place appointed to put such things in; I can swear to the pattern of the silk and to the bag.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ - I know these two pieces of silk; I saw them in the morning of the 8th of April, the day before Good Friday, about nine o'clock - I looked for them afterwards and they were gone; the patterns of them were shown to me on the Saturday morning - I have no doubt they are my master's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any thing particular about the pattern? A. Yes, it is rather singular - we never had such a pattern in our house before; it is French silk - more of it may be imported, but I never saw either of the patterns before - we have between twenty and thirty persons in the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your Christian name? A. George - these had been in the silk-warehouse, the upper shop; they were missed about five o'clock in the evening - they are brought into the shop by day, and were very near the door about three in the day, and a young man was showing them; I think it very possible the prisoner might have come in without being observed by our men, we have so many people.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot tell whether the prisoner might not have been outside to receive it, or whether he kept that night cap on all day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Holborn - a gentleman stopped me, and said, "Don't I know you? did you not work for Mr. Tate?" I said Yes; he said he had a parcel to deliver if I would take it in a coach to Union-street; I took it there, and the officer stopped me - I said I did not know what I had, but if he would walk a few yards he would find; I went and asked the lady if she knew Thomas Lackey - she said, "I know Thomas Blackey," she said, "Is he a tall dark man?" I said Yes - she said "I dare say it is all right" - I left it there; the officer came to me, and said he was not altogether satisfied - I said, "You will see the person presently."</p>

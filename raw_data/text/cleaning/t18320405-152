I was coming down towards Gray's Inn-gate, and saw the two men struggling; the prisoner got from the prosecutor- I followed, and came up just as the prosecutor had got the prisoner's collar by one hand, and the watch in the other; he appeared the worse for liquor, but he could run as well as I could.</p>

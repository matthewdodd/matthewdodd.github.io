                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Willow-street, Paul-street. On the evening of the 14th of Oct. I went to the pit of the City of London Theatre, Norton Folgate—I drew my watch out while there at nine and at eleven o'clock, and placed it in a small silk bag attached to my petticoat under my dress—when the performance was over I returned home—my house is about ten minutes' walk from the theatre—when about eight doors from my own house the two prisoners came and looked under my bonnet—I distinctly saw both their faces—it was directly under a gas-light—they knocked me down—Butler tried to get my watch, while Dipper held me down with his hand over my mouth—I felt Butler pulling my watch—I screamed "Murder" twice—a person on the opposite side of the way opened a window, upon which they ran away—I got up, screamed "Murder!" and went on to my own house—in two or three minutes Cross and another policeman brougbt the prisoners home—I said Butler was the villain that tried to get my watch, and Dipper was the one who held my mouth—I can swear to them both distinctly.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 15th of Oct., I was in Paul-street, Finsbury, and heard cries of"Murder!" coming from Willow-street, which runs into Paul-street—I went to the spot, and saw the two prisoners running from the bottom of Willow-street towards me—I am sure they are the men—I stopped them both on the pavement, and asked what they were running for—they first denied running at all—I said, "You cannot deny running when I stopped you running, and this constable behind me saw you running as well—what is it about?"—they said they did not know, they had done nothing—I took them back to where I saw Mrs. Lindon going towards her home—she instantly pointed to Butler, and said, "That is the man that knocked me down, the other is the man who put his hand over my mouth, while Butler tried to get my watch; they got it off all except two or three threads"—she identified them both instantly—Harrington was present, close behind me at the time—I took them to the station.</p>

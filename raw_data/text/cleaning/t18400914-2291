                  </hi>. I am a baker and cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Thomas Gren<lb></lb>ville,</hi> in the East India Docks. On the night of the 1st of September I met Clarke—I went with her to a public-house, and then went home with her—I had a sovereign, four half-sovereigns, and a handkerchief—I lent one half-sovereign to a man—I then had three half-sovereigns and one sovereign left—the money and handkerchief were in my jacket pocket—I was in the room up stairs with Clarke—the prisoner Wilson called me down—he asked what country I belonged to—I said, "Madras"—he kept me talking for about five minutes—I left my jacket on the bed up stairs, and the money and handkerchief in the pocket of it—I went up and the handkerchief and money were gone, and Clarke also—I came down and saw her throw the handkerchief to Wilson, who put it under his feet—I seized Clarke's hand, bit it, opened it, and saw a half-sovereign in her hand—I saw the handkerchief and a sovereign under Wilson's feet—this is my handkerchief, and the one which Clarke threw to Wilson.</p>

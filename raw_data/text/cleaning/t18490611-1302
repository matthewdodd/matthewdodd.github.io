                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Clare Flower, of North-street, Lisson<lb></lb>grove—we let out the next door, No. 26, in lodgings. On 7th April, Peck took a furnished room there of me, for herself and husband—she came to live there—Holland came backwards and forwards, but I do not know that he ever slept there—I never spoke to them together—when she had been there four weeks, on a Sunday morning, I went in, and asked her for the rent—she paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., leaving 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due; she said she would bring that in directly—when she opened the door, I caught sight of the place where the bedstead ought to be; I do not know whether it was there—I asked her where my bedstead was—she said she had got it down to paint it, and aaid, "Look at my apron, it is all over paint"—I said that it did not want paint<lb></lb>ing, and I must see the room—she said, "You cannot, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is dressing"—I saw no more of her—on the Monday, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to see the room—the door was locked—I got in by a key, which I got from one of my own doors, and found Peck and everything gone—I. saw her again at the station in less than an hour—I afterwards went to Mr. Gre<lb></lb>gory's, a broker, in Earl-street, and saw a table, bedstead, bolster, and two pillows, which were mine, and the same that were in the room.</p>

Q.</hi> You made the bargain with Peck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and afterwards paid her the money; the man was outside at the time—I said before the Magistrate I could almost swear the prisoner was the man, and I also said I had not the least doubt—I had never seen him before—he had a jacket on, and light trowsers—I came home while they were there—I then went next door to get change to pay them—the whole thing occupied a very short time; they waited some time before I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. I was in the Strand on Sunday evening, the 29th of March—I did not feel any thing, but the officer came and asked me if I had lost any thing—I then missed my silk handkerchief—he said he knew who had it—he went and took the prisoners, who were in front of me—this is my handkerchief.</p>

I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners arm-in-arm, in Tichbourne-street—I watched them—they went on to the Strand, and followed two gentlemen—they then followed the prosecutor and a lady—one of them lifted up the flap of his coat—I spoke to the prosecutor—he told me he had lost his handkerchief—I took the prisoner, and Fletcher pulled this handkerchief out of his trowsers, and threw it on the rails of Somerset House—I cannot say which took it, but he had it.</p>

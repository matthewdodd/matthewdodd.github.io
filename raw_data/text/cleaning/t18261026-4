               <p>JOHN FARRANT. I have been blind twenty-seven years, and get my living by playing on the violin. In July last I lived at <placeName id="t18261026-4-crimeloc16">No. 20, Dock-street, Commercial-road</placeName>

I remained with them till twelve o'clock, when I laid down for a few minutes, and got up, as my little boy was very ill; I went to bed again, and between that time and half-past four o'clock this robbery was committed. I kept my violin in the bed-room, which has not a good lock to it. I got up between four and five o'clock, being restless, and asked the male prisoner if he would get up and sit with me a little while, as my little boy was ill, but I could not discover that anybody was in their room; nobody answered me. I walked to the street door, which I had bolted, and found it unbolted; I then went to my bed-room cupboard, and felt that the violin was gone; I called up my two little boys, one of whom if fourteen years old, and sent him to Nash - I asked my boy to give me my hat - he gave me one which I knew was not my own; my own hat and violin were gone, with the case and bow; I have not had any of them delivered back to me. I had bolted my front door when I went to bed; the back room up stairs was rented by a window and her three children - she was gone to bed when I fastened the door. The prisoners were apprehended about two months afterwards. John Lewis was to have gone with me on the Monday to Chatham races.</p>

I have seen a hat which was found in the prosecutor's room - I know it to be John Lewis', by the sewing on it; Farrant has worn it since, having no other - here it is; I know Lewis wore it previous to the robbery - I have seen him wear it all the time he lodged there.</p>

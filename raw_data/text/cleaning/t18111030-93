               <p>Q. In the month of August last did you work for the prisoner Pollard. - A. Yes, he is a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his shop. - A. In the two pair of stairs in John's Court, Handy Street, Oxford Street. The prisoner Rippen lodged in the same house in the one pair of stairs, Pollard keeps the house. In the middle of August I was in Pollard's Parlour, Pollard was reading the newspaper, he saw these things advertised, and said,</p>
               <p>"they have got a good booty," I made answer,</p>
               <p>"I think they have." Then the week following Mrs. Rippen came down several times and asked what such stones and such ear-rings were worth. Then after she came down and made these enquiries, then Pollard sent for the same newspaper, and on his reading the same paper she said,</p>
               <p>"I think these things are up stairs." Then on the Saturday night following Mrs. Rippen brought down an amethyst stone and a heart-blood stone, and an amethyst broach, there were nobody else in the parlour but me and Mrs. Pollard, Mr. Pollard came in at the time, he said they were the finest stones that ever he had seen in his life, and then I saw the amethyst broach was crack'd at one end of it, Mrs. Rippen asked Pollard what these things were worth, Pollard said the blood stone was worth a pound, and the others were very good, he could not say what they were worth. Then on the Sunday morning I was up in the shop, I saw several of the sittings of diamond rings broken up, and I saw some stones I had seen the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see an antique head in a ring. - A. Yes, and I saw a gold lockit with a snake round it with diamond eyes, when it opened the inside opened in the shape of an heart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the amethyst stone. - A. Pollard was taking the ring out of the heart, and in taking the ring out of the heart, it broke the stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Pollard did with the antique ring. - A. I saw the stone, he had it reset.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the blood stone. - A.Rippen waited in the shop while I did it, he had it to wear it as a broach in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any sitting of a miniature picture. - A. Yes, I had it, that was among the other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You were journeyman to the prisoner at the time. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What reward are you to have for giving evidence to-day. - A. Nothing, I have been offered something by Pollard's brother not to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to a magistrate. - A. No, I never went to a magistrate till they took me with Pollard and Rippen, I was taken in Pollard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave no account of this transaction until you were taken upon the charge as a prisoner. - A. No. I did not know they were stolen. I did not know whose they were, Mr. Isaacs bought the pearl head piece and the gold locket with the snake round it, some loose diamonds and the beads to match the head piece, and beads for a necklace, for which Isaac's gave eight pound five shillings, as Pollard told me.</p>

               <p>Rippen's defence. The lady's coachman knows he searched my coach with a candle, and then asked me my fare, I told him four shillings, he took my No. 210, at Marlborough Street. I told him the number was 218, after that I went to Vauxhall and it was three o'clock in the morning when I got home.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300054"></xptr>Pollard's defence. I never had any dealings with the man in my life, except making a blood stone, I cut it with my own hands and mounted it, he saw it in the rough state, and the man that worked for me saw me make it; he told me he had lost the broach, well then, I said you have lost it before you have paid for it.</p>
               <p>Rippen called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Pollard called one witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

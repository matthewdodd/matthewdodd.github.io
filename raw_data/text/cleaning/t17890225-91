               <p>Court. Did you lose at any time ten yards of muslin from the warehouse of the Company? - On the 13th of February, Friday, there was a fine piece of goods lost, and I sent several of the men to hunt among the lots, and they could not find it; I found I had lost it about ten or eleven o'clock in the forenoon; there was a piece found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, under Mr. Corbert; I picked up a piece of muslin handkerchief on Friday the 13th of February by the prisoner at the bar; I know nothing of his taking it; he was standing on one side clear of the other man, close to the loop-hole, which is the place where the goods are taken in by the crane; he is a servant, he was standing in the warehouse; the muslins are kept about three or four yards from where he was.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else standing where the prisoner was? - There were several other people standing by him, but not nearer than a yard; I took the piece of muslin, and carried it to the elder, Mr. Oakley; I did not mark it, but I should know it; the mark upon it is 2413, Ry signifies the Rodney; this I am sure is the piece; the prisoner is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Which of you have been the longest in the warehouse? - I have been there four years, and the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, six or seven months; he was put in by the late Mr. Mickie, as I understand.</p>
               <p>You are very properly there set to watch each other; I think very often a piece is missing, is not there? - Sometimes there are.</p>

               <p>How near was this man from that bale out of which this was taken? - Twenty yards or more; he was in that warehouse where this was deposited.</p>
               <p>Was there a number of people to see the goods? - Yes, there were a number of people, and it was at the conclusion of the sale; there were a great number of persons at the sale.</p>
               <p>Any ladies in the warehouse at that time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had you never had any quarrel with this man? - Never, he was a good-natured well-behaved man, for what I know; I never till that day passed three words with him; I had not had three words with him that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Have the labourers any thing to do with these muslins? - Yes, he was employed that day in carrying them about; we have counters in the warehouse, and the lots may be where you are; we carry the lots backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer in the East-India warehouse, on the 13th of February in the warehouse in Leadenhall-street; at two o'clock we were at the door thinking to go out as usual, to our homes; the door was fastened, the goods had been shewn and were replaced; all that we shewed, Mr. Oakley had given orders that none should go out till the piece was found; we went back into the room, and some went searching about to find these things; there was John Way in an alley, between two rows of bales; he was looking at a lot; Nash was near us; I went away, and he gave me a hint; after we were all ordered to be stript and searched, the prisoner moved from the place where he stood, to another part of the room, and I seeing him go forward, followed him close up, and I saw him go to the end of one of our long tables, and I saw him pull out a piece of white goods from his right side, and as soon as I saw him pull out those goods, I told Way he had dropt it; I did not see him drop it; we went round and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that at the time you speak of, all the goods were put in their places? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Did you ever come away till all the goods were in their places? - Yes, sometimes we leave them on the floor uncovered, and sometimes covered.</p>
               <p>Court to Way. When you packed up this piece of goods, was it a place where the goods were usually laid? - No.</p>
               <p>Oakley produced the piece of goods given to him by Way, marked No. 2413, Ry.</p>

            's when Mr. Keeling officiated for Sir John at the examination of the prisoner. Mr. Bonham was sworn. A number of persons were brought into the room, I believe not less than twenty, that Mr. Bonham might fix on the culprit, and Mr. Bonham did so; he very calmly and sedately looked round the room from man to man, and he did deliberately fix upon the prisoner, and said, That is the man. Mr. Bonham's servant, who stood by, did not at all interfere; but some time after his matter had thus fixed upon the prisoner, he spoke, an said, That is the man; I perfectly know the man. At the second examination, the prisoner said, You little jeweller, how should you advertise that I had defrauded you of a diamond ring of twenty-seven pounds value, and eigh guineas. Know, there is a balance of money due to me. You know you owe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030104"></xptr> me the odd shillings upon the balance. Don't you know (says the prisoner) that I was to call upon you for the balance. To which Mr. Bonham replied, Aye, but you knew better things than to call upon me. Sir John said, I thought you was going to ask Mr. Bonham such questions as might induce us to believe you innocent. Don't you know you are confirming your own guilt?</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. You seem to be so exact in every thing that passed; pray, can you recollect how many odd shillings I mentioned to Mr. Bonham were owing to me?</p>
               <p>Gines. I can't recollect exactly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know myself innocent; therefore I hope your lordship will permit me to ask such questions as I think necessary.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask any questions that may be of service to you, but don't be so flippant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Bonham was desired to pick out the man, whether he did not say he could not swear to the man, as it was six months ago?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gines. Mr. Bonham did not say that, he walked round Sir John's office with great caution; he said it was six months ago; and after he had deliberately walked round from man to man, he fixed upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did Mr. Bonham intimate that he said no more about it, because I cleared it up so plain: this Davis would have been a material witness with regard to my innocence. I will call a witness to prove that one Humphreys paid away drafts many times: my name is

The justice desired us all to walk into the room, every man that was there; I was present; I stood next the prisoner at the bar: Mr. Bonham then, after looking some time, looked very hard at me, that I was thinking he would say I was the person; he said he did not know the man, and it was six or nine months ago: this was the first time of the examination: he said he did not know the man, being six months ago.</p>

               <p>Eliezer. He did not know the man, being six months ago; perhaps the man might have altered in the time: one Mr. Bureau standing next to him and Mr. Bond, Sir

               <p>Q. Before that, had Mr. Bonham fixed upon Humphrys at all?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. No; he was looking all round the room, and could not see the man; and looked very hard upon me, being of the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not challenged the prisoner as being the man till Bond pointed with the pen to him, and Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. No; he did not say he knew him till Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had not fixed upon Humphrys till after Bureau said, That is Mr. Humphrys.</p>
               <p>Eliezer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he fix upon him then?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. He said he believed it was him, but put on his spectacles at the same time, and said, that being six or eight months ago, he could not be sure as to his person; he said a man might alter in six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all that passed?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. All that passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the first examination, did Mr. Bonham speak positive to Humphrys, or not?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. After Bureau said it was him, he said the same, that it was Mr. Humphreys.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now that he believed it was, but it was six months ago, and a man might alter his face?</p>
               <p>Eliezer. He said so, and that a man might alter his speech too: twenty people were present.</p>
               <p>The Jury. This witness, I believe, was in court during the examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in court?</p>

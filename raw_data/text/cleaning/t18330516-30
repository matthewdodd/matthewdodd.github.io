             (police-constable T 167). I was informed of the loss of these things; I went in pursuit of the soldiers into Little Chelsea, I overtook the other two before I got up to the prisoner - I could not do any thing with him, he would neither go one way nor the other; then he said he would come, and he walked with me, and he put out his leg to throw me into a ditch; I then threw him down; I let him get up, he then threw this handkerchief and this time-piece stand into the ditch; and he threw something else in, which was buried in the mud, and we could not find it; he then made his escape - I went back, and found these articles and his cap - he joined his regiment in two or three days, and the regiment gave him up to our officer - it is the first regiment of Grenadier Guards.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

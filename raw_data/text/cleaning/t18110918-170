            . On the 12th of July between two and three o'clock, I heard this child cry in Cannon-street-road, she said the woman had taken her bonnet; she pointed to the prisoner, the prisoner then began to run; the child was without a bonnet at the time; I left the child in care of a neighbour, and ran after the woman; I never lost sight of her, only just as she turned the corner; she ran half a mile as fast as she could before I catched her. When I came up to her I said, you strumpet how dare you to strip a child in the road. I took the bonnet immediately out of her hand. The prisoner said nothing but came back along with me. I delivered up the woman and the bonnet to the father of the child in Greenfield-street.</p>

This bonnet was delivered to me by Mr. Day, about three o'clock on the 12th of June, I took charge of the prisoner; he charged the prisoner with stealing this bonnet, in the hearing of the child, and enticing her away by her offering her cherries, and then taking away her bonnet; I took the prisoner in custody, and took her before the magistrate.

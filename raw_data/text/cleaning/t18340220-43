            . I am in the service of Mr. Gerrard, of Hornsey, and look after his sheep - May came to me on the night of the 14th of January, and Watling with him - in consequence of what he said, I went with him to the field where master's sheep are kept - I had seen the sheep a quarter before four that evening - there were six sheep then - the field was fenced round - when I went with May, which was just at ten o'clock, I found only five - on the following morning early, I accompained May to search in the neighbourhood of the field, and saw a sheep-skin and entrails; I did not see it found, but I was in the wood at the time, and saw the skin and entrails in possession of Watling; May was there; Master's sheep were marked with a stroke of ochre right across the loins; they were all marked alike; this was a wether - I examined the skin at the watch-house, but not till I got there, I then found the ochre mark across the loins; I am quite sure it was the skin of my master's sheep - a sheep's head was produced at the watch-house; I saw it fitted to the skin; it appeared to correspond; it fitted quite as if I had taken the knife and done it myself; the end of the skin was cut with a knife, but not cut straight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said it was cut clean across with a knife? A. I said no such thing; it was not cut slanting, nor zig-zag; it was cut in and out - the wool was on it; where the knife parted it, there the wool was; none of the wool was off; there might be a little, but I did not observe any - this is the skin of my master's sheep; if I saw the skin a hundred miles off, I should swear it was my master's property, if I had seen it the day before; there is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200031"></xptr>mark on the head which I told him to look for; there was no other mark on the skin except the mark across the loins; that mark is very frequently on sheep; many thousands of sheep are so marked; there is no brand-mark.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the mark on the head? A. On each side there are two faulty teeth, which I told the watchman to look for before I saw it.</p>

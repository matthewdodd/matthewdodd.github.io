I left my box on board: having lost the key, I was under some difficulty, fearing some of my things should be lost, I left it tied with a cord: I came to London by land. When the ship came into the river Thames I went on board her, but cannot tell the day. The mate asked me whether I found every thing safe in my box, as I left them at Dover: I examined it, and missed my shagreen case, and the things mentioned in the indictment, (mentioning them); and when I settled with the captain, he told me it was stolen.</p>

When I came to my moorings in the river, and brought her to an anchor, I desired every thing in the cabin might be taken care of, and went on shore, and returned the next day on board; then the mate told me the prisoner was gone. I asked him if he missed any thing; he said, nothing in particular. The next day the mate told me this gentleman had been on board, and found such and such things gone.

               <p>Q. What did he say he had done?</p>
               <p>Brown. He said he had cut the trunk open and took the things out, and there they were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say he did it?</p>
               <p>Brown. He said he did it the same night we came to our moorings at the Hermitage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before Sir John when the prosecutor was?</p>
               <p>Brown. I was. He saw the things and owned them, and swore to the whole of them: the constable has them to produce here, and he is not come.</p>

            . On the 12th of November, Benjamin came and informed me he had been robbed. I went and examined the premises, and found the back-door had been broken open, as well as the front-room door; he said he suspected the prisoner. I went in pursuit of him, but could not find him. On the 15th of November, Benjamin came to me to say, he had taken one of the prisoners. I went to the house and found him in the custody of Forester, the officer; as we were going to examine his lodgings we met Noah, and took him with us; he wanted to persuade a young woman in the house that he had not been at home; but she persisted that he had just gone out. We went into his room and found a crow-bar and a pair of gloves in the fire-place, covered over with ashes. I took him into custody. He said he knew nothing about it. The next morning I went to him with his father, who persuaded him to tell where the things were. He took me to several places, and at last to Mr. Davis; he said he had sold some things there; Mr. Davis gave them up to me; he then took me to Mr. Levy's, in Hollywell-street, where he had sold goods to the amount of of 1l. 16s. I then took him before the Lord Mayor. I found this shirt on the prisoner's back.</p>

Two or three minutes after we got in, a man came and joined the prisoners company, and wanted me to play at some game, I said I had no money to play games - the prisoner then took 4 s. out of my hand, and the other man took 3 s. 6 d. I told them they should not have my money, they started out of the house immediately without saying why they took it - they took different directions. I followed the prisoner a little way calling out that he had robbed me. Taylor, the officer, met him and stopped him, without my losing sight of him; he had called for a pint of beer at the house, which he paid for on delivery, and offered me some of it, this was before he took my money. I described the house to Taylor, it is about twenty yards from where he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not game there - A. No, he returned me the 4 s. just as Taylor came up - Taylor was dressed in blue, turned up with red.</p>

            . I am a constable, and apprehended the prisoner in Little Britain; the prosecutor was following him and accusing him of robbing him; the prisoner saw me, he knew me before, he immediately put 4 s. out of his hand into the prosecutors hand, and said</p>

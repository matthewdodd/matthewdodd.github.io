                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live at No. 16, Minerva-street, Hackney road.

               <p>not, they were in a few minutes afterwards—they both spoke to me, but I believe Fletcher was the first—he got into conversation about trade; he said he was a weaver, and had work from a warehouse in the City—we had a good deal of talk together—Atkins, and another man who was there, conversed with Fletcher—the three appeared intimate together—one of them, either Fletcher or Atkins, offered me a glass of rum; I think it was Atkins—I refused it at first; but they urged it, and I took it out of the glass which they handed to me—it was a small glass—I had a second glass offered to me by either Atkins or Fletcher—I believe it was Atkins—I did not take the second glass; I refused; and on my refusing it, Fletcher <hi rend="italic">popped</hi> it into the remains of the rum and water that I had in the glass which I brought from the bar—I did not take any of it—I said, "It will be strong enough; you can put some water in it, and drink it yourselves, for I will have no more of it"—I left the house, and walked down Mile-end-road; and when I was opposite the London Hospital, I saw Atkins—I said, "Are you coming this way?"—he said, "Yes, I live this way"—I do not recollect anything else that occurred till I got to the Dyers' Arms—I went by myself till I got near the door of the Dyers' Arms, and then Fletcher and Atkins, and one or two more, wanted me to go in, and they came and dragged me in—I was just at the door of the Dyers' Arms when I saw Fletcher and Atkins, and one or two more—I know the Three Cranes—I have no recollection of being in there—I recollect they offered me something to drink at the Dyers' Arms; I refused it, and they urged me to drink; I cannot recollect whether I took any or not—there was a seat at the Dyers' Arms, and after standing some time I sat down, and one of them said, "This man wants to go to the water closet"—on that I went into the back yard; Fletcher and one or two others went with me—I went into the water closet, and when I came out, a number of them got round me and robbed me—I was completely penned in—I was nearly paralysed, and one put his hand into my pocket, and I saw him drag my purse out with the money in it—I saw it in hit hand—I cried out, "I am robbed! landlord, I am robbed!"—on my crying out, the men that were about me went away—this occurred just out of the water closet, under a covered skittle ground, within a yard of the water closet—they then went away—there were five or six persons—I cannot speak to any of them but Fletcher—he was one of the five or six—he took me into the back yard; I walked along with him—I cannot recognise any of the other prisoners as being in the back yard but him—I have an idea it must have been somewhere about 4 o'clock when I got to the Dyers' Arms—Fletcher was brought back in about five or six minutes after I cried, "Landlord, landlord! I am robbed;" I cannot say exactly how long; I was very much confused—two other men were brought back, but I could not recognise them positively at that time; but I had an idea of them—I swear I saw the purse in one of their hands—I saw the band distinctly, and the purse in it, but I did not see who it was—I could not see his face; he was behind me.</p>

On 21st March I saw all the prisoners come in—three more persons, who are not here, were in the house at the time—the prosecutor was with them—they came in, but not altogether—Fletcher and Jones, and another, who is not here, were with the prosecutor—one of them had hold of each arm, and another had hold of his back—they wanted him to go in—he refused—they forced him into the house—he said he did not wish for any more to drink—one of them, I cannot be positive which, called for a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—Jones paid for it—my mother served it, and I took the money t—Jones and another man, who is not here, put the glass of ale to Dove's mouth—I had never seen Jones before—I saw the prisoners again on Saturday, 2nd April, at the police office—I am quite certain they are the men.</p>

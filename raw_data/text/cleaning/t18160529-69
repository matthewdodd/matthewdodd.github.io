            . I was concerned with Purviss in stealing some asses off Lord Ellenborough's lands; we stole three. We brought them to Smithfield; when we got there, Purviss sold them; he went with some men to sell them, and left them for a time with me; he left me for about a quarter of an hour. When he came back, we went to Chick-lane, and after that to Hill's house in an alley. When I got there, I saw the prisoner; he bought the asses; I am not positive whether it was twenty-five shillings or twenty-seven shillings for the three; Hill joined in buying them, and they were apparently both concerned. The asses were driven up into the street to Cow Cross; they all stood at the door when Harl paid for them; it was a public-house. I went into the house, and then Harl and Hill proposed drawing up a paper for six pounds, as the price they had given for the asses, supposing any thing should occur that that had been the value of them. A paper was drawn up by the landlord of the house, and some money was paid in the presence of the landlord. I was afterwards apprehended. I went with the officers to Hill's house, where they found one of the asses.</p>

I remember the morning of Friday, the 10th of March, 1814, I do recollect the selling of some asses at my house; but the prisoner is the only one I can recollect. I was desired by the prisoner to write a paper. That is the paper. I did not see the asses; but I saw two pounds five shillings paid.</p>

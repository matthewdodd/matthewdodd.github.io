            . I am an officer. On the 16th of August, about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night, the prosecutrix was brought to the watch-house by a little boy; she was crying very much, and had neither hat nor shawl on, she appeared as if she had been in the dirt-her back was very muddy; she said she had been knocked down and robbed of her pocket-book, which contained five 1l. notes and five duplicates, and her hat and shawl; she described Myers to me very particularly-the boy who was with her, said her name was Myers. I went, with Field, to a public-house in Angel-alley, and found both the prisoners there together - I took Myers to the watch-house, the prosecutrix said it was her that took her pocket-book. She went before the Lord Mayor the next day, and described the other woman, and on Friday night I took Bamfield; she saw her on the Wednesday at the lock-up room, among five or six more, and picked her out as the woman who threw her down and took her hat and shawl, away. I found nothing on either of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an officer. I was on duty. The prosecutrix was brought in by a boy named Cresswell; I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>MYERS'S Defence. We were in the public-house together, Bamfield went out and came back-the officer said a woman had been robbed, and I was the person. The prosecutrix is an unfortunate girl, and lives in Bambridge-street, St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>the 30th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming up St. John-street-road—I turned my head, and found the prisoner and another man had taken a sack off the cart—they were Wil<lb></lb>liam West's oats and sack—I stopped the horse and went after them—they let go the sack, and ran away—they were taking it away—I am sure the prisoner is the man—he ran down Brunswick-street, where there is no turning, and was taken—the sack contained four bushels of oats.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in John-street, and heard Novell call out "Stop him"—the prisoner was the only one running—I went after him—he went down Brunswick-street and pulled off his frock, and came back—I am sure he is the man.</p>

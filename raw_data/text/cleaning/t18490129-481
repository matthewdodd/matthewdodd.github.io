                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, B</hi> 5). On the evening of 10th Jan. I was on duty in Ebury-street, Pimlico, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoners walking abreast down Ebury-street—Gunn had this handkerchief, which seemed to be heavy—they were in conversation together—I stood still, and they came towards me—on their crossing the road I stepped into the road, and stopped Gunn; the other three ran off—Savage took one direction, and Grant and Salmon the other—I took Gunn into custody; be endeavoured to drop the handkerchief on my foot, but I caught it, and still kept my hold of him, and took him to the station—the handkerchief contained this lead and a knife; he said he found it near Chelsea Hospital—knowing the other prisoners I gave directions to the policeman to bring them in—Salmon was brought in about twelve at night—he said he met Gunn near the Hospital, and he had asked him to take a walk with him down Ebury-street—Grant was brought in about half an hour afterwards—he said he had met Gunn near the Bun-house, and he had asked him to walk down Ebury-street—next morning, between six and seven, Savage was brought in, and was told the charge—he said nothing—in consequence of information I went to Chelsea Hospital, and compared this lead on the ridge of a roof, where I found lead to be wanted—the lead corresponded with the marks, I have no doubt it belonged there.</p>

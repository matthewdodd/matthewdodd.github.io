I put down the sovereign on the table for her; she went out, and I told her to take the key - I went to bed and left the sovereign on the table; when she returned, she came up stairs to get the candle, and then she came up with the child - I asked her if she had left the door open, as I heard footsteps in the room; she went down and saw the watchman - I heard him say to her, "You are come home, I see;" she then bid him good night - I had been asleep, but I heard that a neighbour had sent the prisoner for my wife, as the child had cried; I afterwards heard my wife ask him if he had seen any one near the door, and he said there was no one nearer the door than himself - she said no one could have taken it but a person with a light; I got up and told the prisoner I would give him in charge - I followed him to Macclesfield-street, and on towards King-square, where he dropped some money; I caught him, and called another watchman, who came up, and we found 1s. 6d. which he had dropped - we took him to the watch-house, where 2s. 8d. was found on him; it was about half-past nine o'clock when I went up to bed, and I heard my wife talking to him at a quarter before eleven.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say what day you saw it safe over night?</p>
               <p>Smith. I cannot say that: I lost twenty one hats out of my shop; I missed them about a quarter of an hour after I got up. I went to some pawnbrokers to desire them to stop them if any were brought to them, and in about half an hour's time a messenger came from Mr. Edwards a pawnbroker, to let me know he had stopped a hat, and desired to know if it was mine. I went to Mr. Edwards's, and there was the Prisoner James; I said to him, young man, did you bring this hat to the pawnbroker's? he said, yes; I asked him, how he came by it? he said, he made a purchase of it; I asked him, where? he said, in Smithfield; I asked him, who he bought it of? he said, of a drover; that he held it upon a stick, and asked, who would buy a hat? and he bought it; I asked him if he wanted a hat this morning? he said, yes; then said I, how came you to pawn it? I told him, I did not like that way of proceeding, and that I would charge him, if he did not give a better account how he came by it. I went with him into Mr. Edwards's room, and he said, he would tell me the truth; he said he went to sleep in a hay loft, and a man came and pulled him by the arm, and desired he would pawn it for two shillings.</p>

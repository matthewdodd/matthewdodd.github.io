                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Cross-street, Hatton-garden in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. The prisoner was my journeyman. On Sunday, the 27th of September, I left the house at seven o'clock in the evening, and returned at eleven o'clock—I had left the prisoner and my two sons in the house, but nobody else—when I returned, the prisoner was gone—he todged with me, but did not come home after<lb></lb>wards he absconded—I had left my purse, with ten sovereigns and four<lb></lb>teen half-crowns in it, and a small key; in a bottom drawer of a chest of drawers, in my bed-room—the room door was not locked—I had seen the property safe at four o'clock in the afternoon—when I came home I found him gone—I examined, and missed the purse and money—I was at home from four to seven o'clock—nobody had been in the house except a woman, who was not out of my sight.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had fractured his skull when a child, ever since which, drink had produced temporary in<lb></lb>sanity, in which state he must have been when be committed the offence.)</p>

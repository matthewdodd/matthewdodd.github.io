PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after he said he had got a cold, that they swore him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is not true that Sheering had a glass of spruce served him by me, at my house on Sunday morning—I do not keep such a thing—I swear he never was in the house at any time that day—I served a man with half a pint of beer eight minutes before one o'clock—I have every reason to believe my clock was right—the man said it was one o'clock—there was not one person let in barring my own family—I did not serve any one from without with any liquor on that Sunday, during the hours of Divine service—at half-past eleven o'clock my door was shut, and it was never opened till a few minutes before one o'clock, when I opened it to serve that person the half pint of beer—there were not three women drinking gin at the bar—Sheering did not go into the tap-room and call for a pint of beer, and remain till half-past twelve o'clock—it is not true that he said his name was Jack Sheering, and I should not buff him out of that at Worship-street—myself, wife, and children, servant-maid and nephew, were the only persons in the house—I requested my case might he postponed, that I might produce witnesses—I spoke to the Magistrates, but they did not seen to notice it—I had no witnesses for the thing—the man swore no one saw me serve the man with the half-pint but myself—I thought that was the charge—it is not true that three myself before twelve o'clock that day when my door was shut, three drunken persons were knocking outside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You heard Sheering swearing at Worship-street against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I thought it was for the half-pint, and when I got there I found it was a different thing—I said I could bring witnesses to prove against what they swore to, if they gave me time, and that on Sheer<lb></lb>ing's charge I had no witnesses—my nephew was in the house—I could have brought him but I went to answer for the half-pint—they asked if I had brought any witnesses—I said no, barring my own family—I did not say I had not a soul in the house at the time, and I had no witnesses—when Sheering was sworn, I told the magistrate I was sure that it was a mistake, that was not my case at all—I cannot say whether the Magis<lb></lb>trate</p>

               <p>asked me if I had any witnesses after Sheering had given his evi<lb></lb>dence, I said I had brought no witnesses—I did ask for time after Sheering was heard—I did not say I had no witnesses and there was not a soul in the house—I expect I am at the sole expense of this prosecution—I have employed Mr. Woolley—I have seen Mr. Woolley's clerk, Mr. Heritage—I did not see Mr. Woolley, but I employed persons to do it—I employed Mr. Heritage—the prosecutor appeared to me to be drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's nephew, and am a watch<lb></lb>maker. On Sunday, the 22nd of November, I was at the prosecutor's house a few minutes before eleven o'clock—when I first went, the house was open, it wanted a quarter to eleven o'clock when I left my own house, which is about five minute's walk from the prosecutor's—I do not know whether church had begun, but I heard the church<lb></lb>bell strike out—the house was shut up before eleven o'clock my Mr. Goodale—I remained there till a quarter past one o'clock—I was in the bar and took a lunch—I amused the children from eleven to one o'clock from the bar to the tap-room and the parlour—there was not a soul in the tap-room but myself and the children—I saw the servant-girl cleaning the pots, some were drying in the bar and the tap-room—there was no one drinking in the tap-room, no one was served at the bar—the prisoner never entered the house that I saw—he could not be sitting in the tap-room with twenty-seven persons—I do not know whether my uncle keeps spruce—there were no drunken men or women served at the bar—I did not hear any one knocking at the door—the prisoner could not have come in with two people and I not know it—there was no noise or noisy people—all the noise was with me and the children—they are all young.</p>

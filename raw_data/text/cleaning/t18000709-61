            : On Wednesday evening last, about half past seven o'clock, I was at the farther end of the room, by the window, I turned my head round and saw the prisoner come into the room by the side-board; I saw her reach her hand over the sideboard; then I walked up to her, and she had got the mug in her hand, she had got it about one inch off the side-board; I asked her what her pleasure was; she said she came to take a glass of water; I immediately walked out of the room, and shut the door to, I called one of the servants, and desired her to call Mr. Meare; he sent for a constable, and she was detained.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090036"></xptr>Q.What part of the house in this room in? - A. Up one pair of stairs; the side board is within one spot of the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What age are you? - A. Fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the nature of an oath? - A. I shall answer to my conscience.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe you must answer to God? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hear it in your memory that you were examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes, twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the nature of an oath when you were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whenever you were examined before the Lord-Mayor you were examined upon oath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, when you were before the Lord-Mayor the first time, did you not say, that she put her hand upon the mug, and that that was all she did? - I said she hoisted it one inch from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, the first time that you were before the Lord-Mayor, that she had put her hand upon the top of the mug, and that that was all she did? - A. I said she hoisted it one inch from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect, I am speaking of the first time; and I will tell you this, that there was a person by at the time you were examined, and I warn you of that-did you always give the same account before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He asked me but one question the second time, which was, if I was certain she moved the mug, and I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your account before the Lord-Mayor was always consistant? - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the Lord-Mayor reprimand you, and tell you you had been very wicked in giving him different accounts? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not reprimand you at all? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.You must know; it is now Saturday; was it yesterday, or the day before, that you gave your account before the Lord-Mayor? - A. The day before yesterday, and yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have a recollection of what passed? - A. He told me to speak louder; that is the only thing that I remarked.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he never reprimanded you for giving different accounts? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you never say, that all she did was, to put her hand upon the mug? - A. No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Meare.) Q. Did this witness charge the prisoner in your presence? - A. Yes; he told me that the woman came softly into the room; got between him and the door, and put her hand across the side-board towards the silver mug, and moved it; that is, as near as I can possibly recollect, what passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the account that he gave there? - A. At the first examination he was asked particularly as to whether the girl had moved the mug; I particularly desired him to recollect himself; and as well as I can recollect, he said, she moved the mug; at the second examination, the Lord-Mayor asked him again, particularly, whether she moved the mug, and he said, she had moved the mug.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How came you to desire the boy to recollect himself? - A. I desired him to remember to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; I desired him to recollect the facts as they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Lord-Mayor reprimanding him? - A. No; I was, myself, rather dubious about it, for I did not distinctly hear him; and, at the second examination, I desired him to be particular, and he said, she had moved it, but I did not hear him distinctly say that, at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q.Surely, it was only yesterday, you must recollect whether the Lord-Mayor said any thing particular to the boy? - A. I do not want to keep back any thing, but I do not remember any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively, that the Lord-Mayor did not reprimand him? - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not? - A. I can only swear to what I really heard, I did not hear him reprimand the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As soon as I entered the room the young man locked me in; he told his master I was going to take the mug; at the first examination he said I was going to take it; and at the second, he said he took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>HENRY HIGGINS sworn. - I am a smith and bell-hanger, I live in Houghton-street, Clare-market; I was attending before the Lord-Mayor, when the prisoner was examined, but was not at the first examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the second? - A. Yes, the day before yesterday, Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - A. The boy came forward, and said, that the mug that was there, was not moved from off the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there at any other time than Thursday? - A. Yes, Friday.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be at the second? - A. I attended as her friend; the boy said, the mug was not moved, but her hand was upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090037"></xptr>Q.Did he say any thing afterwards? - A.Nothing that I took notice of.</p>
               <p>Q.On the Friday, did the Lord-Mayor say, any thing to him? - A. On the Friday, he did say, this is two different stories.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say on the Friday? - A. He said it was taken from the side-board.</p>
               <p>Q. The Lord-Mayor observed to him this was two different stories? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a married woman? - A. Yes; I have known her six or seven years, her husband kept a broker's shop in Stanhope-street, and after that a green-grocer's; I never knew any harm of either of them, in my life; she bears a very good character.</p>

I left Jeffries in the shop, and fetched King back. Mr. Hopkins came down. A basket was found close to where they stood, containing lace and other things, which I had shewn them.</p>

            . I was called down between four and five o'clock, and found the two prisoners in the shop, Smith charged them with stealing ribbons; he produced a piece which he said he found under Jeffries's arm. I asked her what induced her to take it - they made no answer. I then asked if they had any more - they said No. I saw a basket laying at their feet, and asked who it belonged to - King said she knew nothing of it. I sent for a constable. I found three pieces of ribbon and a piece of lace in it, which are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know it was their basket - A. It stood close at their feet.</p>

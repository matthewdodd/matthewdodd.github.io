The prisoner came to me to lodge—I showed him a bed-room, and locked him in—I went to the room next morning between eight and nine o'clock, found the door unlocked, and the prisoner gone—the servant had opened the door in the morning—I missed two pairs of sheets, a counterpane, and two towels, not ten minutes after he was gone—I have not seen them since.</p>

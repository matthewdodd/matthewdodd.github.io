               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long has the prisoner worked with you? - Thirteen or fourteen months.</p>

               <p>Do not the filings sometimes exceed in weight what you would expect, and sometimes fall short? - Sometimes they exceed, but very seldom; if there is not enough to answer the weight, we send them back to sweep the board to make up the weight.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the prosecutor, I melt the filings; for ten months past, we have found three ounces deficient in twelve pounds weight more than usual; when it was melted it was five pennyweights worse by assay, it should only be two pennyweights worse, because it had passed the hall; in consequence of which I put every man's work separate, I melted them afterwards, and every man's was right but the prisoner's, both in quality and weight; the prisoner's was half as much more waste than I expected, it was owing to some base metal that was put in it; the quality from one assay master was nineteen pennyweights worse in quality in one pound weight, besides the deficiency; I then made another assay by the Goldsmith's Company, and they made it, one ounce one pennyweight and an half worse; we then thought proper to watch. The prosecutor and his son were in the shop, I went down the shop and was close to the prisoner, he was looking at the prosecutor and son, and I saw him put something in his pocket from the hubbing-box; the prisoner turned and saw me, and looked confused; (describes the manner in which the prisoner did it); I called Mr. Burrows and son into the compting-house directly; when the prisoner's work came in that day, I examined the filings, and saw a quantity of lead or pewter in it; I then weighed him out some more; after tea time, about six or seven, he went to sweep his filings up, he took some oil from a crucible, and held it up in one hand, and

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were the prisoner's filings ever melted in his presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say any thing to the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not melting silver into the form of an ingot the most saving way? - No.</p>
               <p>Were these filings produced to the magistrate in the state of filings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they now in the state of filings? - No, the magistrate said they had better be melted to prove the assay; these were not found upon him, they are what was produced from his work.</p>
               <p>How much were found upon him? - Four or five ounces at his lodgings, and six pennyweights on him.</p>

               <p>I searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found this silver in some boxes, (produces it) the prisoner told me where he lived; in one box I found three papers of silver, and in another I found one more; I had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrows, senior. They are silver filings which were taken out of his pocket, and the other are all silver but one, which seems to be flux, which we use in our business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you swear these filings to be yours, which were found in the prisoner's pocket? - No; I believe them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030034"></xptr>be mine, another person's filings may be like them.</p>
               <p>Court to Burrows. Who found those buckles produced at the magistrate's? - One of my men.</p>
               <p>Was it not in the state of an unfinished buckle? - Yes, any person might file one like that.</p>

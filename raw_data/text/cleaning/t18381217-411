                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Kemble. We keep a chand<lb></lb>ler's shop in Manor-place, Newington. I became acquainted with the prisoner at the latter end of July or the beginning of August—became to the shop and bought a cigar at first—he repeated his visits for two or three days—I have a daughter who is seventeen years old on the 3rd of this month—finding he made rather free with her, I asked him what he came so often for—he said he wanted my daughter—I asked who he was—he said he was in the Custom-house, and had an income of from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I asked where his parents lived—he said in Canterbury-place, near me—I said I should like to see his father—he brought his father, and he informed us that he was in the Custom-house, and had a situation of from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, that he was in the Comptroller's office, and very soon would have a situation of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I believe the person is his father, but he is living with Mrs. Bundock, the prisoner's mother, and he has a wife living—I have since found be never was in the Custom-house—(the day he took my child away he told me he was going to receive 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his salary)—I thought him respectable, and allowed him to visit my daughter—on the 18th of August he was at the house—I and my husband were at home—(Myers does not lodge at our house, but keeps his clothes there in a box behind the counter)—the prisoner asked me if I would take a letter down to his father's that day, and I did—he also asked my husband to go to Mr. Wayland the watchmaker, stating that he wanted to see him—he went out, and I went with the letter, leaving the prisoner and my daughter there—I returned in about half-an-hour or three-quarters of an hour, after talking to his father—when I returned I found the prisoner and my daughter sitting in the parlour reading a book—the father came up, and in the evening they asked me if they might take a walk—I told them not to be long, as it was the first day of Camberwell fair, and I migbt be busy—the prisoner and my daughter went out together and did not return—I never saw any more of them for five days—I did not give the prisoner permission to take Myers's clothes out of the box—he knew the things were there, as he had seen Myers put the things on and wear them.</p>

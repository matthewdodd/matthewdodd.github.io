I said, yes, you rascal, and you are the man; I stopped him, and charged the watch with him; the other prisoner followed us to the watch-house; I told a watchman he was a companion of the other I believed, so they secured him; as soon as Child had taken the bundle, Sell came and said hold of Christy and held him, and said, is your honour robbed?</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not secure him at that time?</p>
               <p>Flint. There was a little boy with us; he had another bundle; I was afraid Sell would take that; I took that in my hand, and ran after Child.</p>

Sell came to me as soon as the other had taken the bundle, and said, has he robbed you, has he robbed you, and held me fast; I said, let me alone, you belong to him; I gave a spring from him; I am certain he meant to hold me.</p>

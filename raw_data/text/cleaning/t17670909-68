Mr. Smith the constable came; I desired he would hold him till I went to see what I had lost, and I would come again; he was committed by Justice Miller; I went to see what I had lost; I found this bundle tied up behind the garret-door, a coat and waistcoat of mine, and a coat and waistcoat of my son in law's; mine were removed from a two pair of stairs room; there were several other things put together, but I do not lay them to his charge; when we were before the Justice, I found he had but just received his Majesty's pardon.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Griffiths. On the 13th of August, I was going up stairs, between seven and eight in the evening, to sweep them, I thought I heard a foot going before me; when I was upon the dining-room stairs, I took it to be the girl that belongs to the house; I called several times, and received no answer; I put the oil cloth into the dining-room; after that, I heard a foot go up again; I called again, but no answer; I heard as if it was the rushing of some person going before me; then I ran up stairs within four steps of my own room; I saw my room-door shut too softly, and saw somebody move; I went into the next room to a young man that lay not well; I asked him if he heard Patty go up stairs; he said the cat was there, and desired I would go and turn her down stairs; then I went into my room, and called, but received no answer; I said if she was got under the bed, I would go and fetch her out; (this was upon the dusk of the evening:) I went into the room joining my room, beyond mine, and looked down upon the floor, and there I saw both the legs of a man, out from under the bed; I observed he had brown clothes on; I stood still two or three minutes, and thought it was somebody get into the house, to conceal himself in order to rob the house: I went out of the room, and said to John, my God, John, somebody is got into the house, and under the bed, with intent to rob the house; I ran down and rang the bell; when I got to the bottom, I called the nurse to run and fetch somebody for a rogue was in the house, and got under a bed; I never quitted the stairs till the person came down; I heard him from the two pair of stairs come padding down; when he came to the bottom, he made an attempt to go out at the street-door directly; I went up to him, and asked him who he wanted; he, in a great agitation, said he wanted one Captain Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was he when you spoke to him?</p>
               <p>J. Ironmonger. He was at the bottom of the stairs; I told him, there was no Captain Johnson lodged in the house, and said, who let you in, you villain, you want to rob the house; he turned round, and ran out as fast as he could, and shut the door too after him; I thought he kept the door fast that I should not come after him; I ran out at the other door, and called stop thief; I saw him running down the street; (it was the prisoner at the bar;) my master came in, and went up and found the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person you saw in the garret?</p>
               <p>J. Ironmonger. I am sure he is; I did not see his face, but I knew him by his clothes; there was no other person running in the street but him till I began to halloo out, stop thief; I insisted upon his not being discharged before Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told Mr. Miller that a bundle was found?</p>

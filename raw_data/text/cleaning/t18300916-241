               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. In what situation is the door? A. In the centre - the right-hand is the butter side, and the other the bacon side; the bacon window was covered over - I could see what I have stated; there was a - lb. weight in the scale previous to his placing the butter into it, but he did not weigh it - I had no character with him; his clothes went home to be washed - I believe this girl sometimes brought his things; his mother dealt with me, but very seldom had credit; I never recollect this little girl fetching things on credit - I think he was taken in about ten minutes afterwards; he could not intend to place them down to his mother, as he did not weigh them - this little girl is from eleven to twelve years of age; she was taken at Bethnal-green, about two hundred yards from my shop.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say there was a - lb. weight in the scale? A. yes, but the quantity of butter he gave her was from 1 lb. to 1 1/2lb. - he did not weigh the bacon, nor appear to count the eggs.</p>

By desire of the prosecutor I waited at some distance from his shop - there was a lad placed opposite, who was to convey the intelligence to me; I had been watching two mornings before in the same place, and had seen this little girl each of those mornings, about seven o'clock - on the third morning I received intimation from my boy; I waited till she came to the corner, at the Salmon and Ball - I stopped her, and asked what she had in her basket; I do not recollect precisely what she said, but she wished to push me off, and would not allow me to see - I wished to take hold of the basket; she rather resisted - I took her into the Salmon and Ball, and examined the contents, which were these articles; I asked where she got them - she began to cry; I asked what she had in her other hand, and found this half-crown - she cried, and said she wanted to go to her mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see her enter the shop? A. Yes, but not come out; she went in about five minutes after seven o'clock, and we took her eight or ten minutes after.</p>

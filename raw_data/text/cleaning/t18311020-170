            . I am an officer. I passed the two prisoners in London-street - I then met the prosecutor; he was drunk; he said he had lost his watch - I looked, and his fob was cut off; he said it was two women, and described which way they had gone - I told him to come with me; I took the two prisoners, and one of them(but I cannot say which) threw down this watch and fob- I believe Watkins said they or she had been tempted to do it by a shipmate of his, who had been drinking with them; I found nothing on the prisoners, but the fob seems to have been cut - they said, "Don't hurt us;" I said, "It don't rest with me."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

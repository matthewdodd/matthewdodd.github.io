I felt the prisoner's hand at my pocket; she ran away. I then suspected she had got something from me; I felt in my pocket, and perceived all my money gone in my pocket; I had a five-shilling and sixpenny dollar. I missed all the money I have put in the indictment, and the key of my chest. As soon as the prisoner went from me, I stepped sharp after her, and catched her; I said, you huzzy, you have robbed me of my silver, and likewise my key; she threw down the key, and said pick it up; there is your key. I then said, if you do not give me up my silver, I'll charge the watch with you; she said with an oath, she would not. The watchman came up, and said, you huzzy, you will not leave off your old tricks. I told him what I had lost, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her searched - A. When we came to the watch, I went back to the spot, and found my key in the spot where I supposed she had thrown it down. When I went back to the watchhouse, they told me they had searched her; they produced ten shillings to me; among the shillings was one shilling that I knew; it had two dots in it. I lost more than ten shillings. They searched her again, and found three three-shilling pieces in her stays. I desired them to search her again; they said she behaved so rough they could not search her. Before she was searched I said I could be positive to one shilling.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Newgate-street. Near upon twelve o'clock, the prisoner was brought into the watchhouse, charged by William Cate of robbing him of forty shillings. Cate appeared a little fresh; he was perfectly collected, and had his senses about him. I knew the prisoner as soon as she came in. I said I must search you. She pulled nine shillings out of her pocket, and a purse with duplicates in it. The prosecutor said he should know one of the shillings; he picked out one of them; before I searched her again, she snatched the shilling off the table that the prosecutor knew; I took it from her; and upon searching her further, I found three three-shilling pieces in the lining of her stays. She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250027"></xptr>was so abusive, I did not search her further. There was nothing further found. This is the shilling the prosecutor picked out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Tower Hamlet Militia, and live in Preston-terrace, King-street, Bethnal-green. On the 19th of April I was on duty as ordinary, at the house of Captain Henry Frederick Hawker, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green—I brushed two coats, a cloak, and wrapper, and put them in the orderly room, on the ground floor—I left the door of that room shut, and the window open about two inches—there was a wire blind to the window, fastened with two bolts and two pins at the bottom—it came up within two or three inches of the top pane of the bottom sash—I left the garden-gate closed—these are Captain Hawker's coats and cloak, and the same I put into his room after brushing them.</p>

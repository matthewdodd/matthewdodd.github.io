                  </hi>. I am a seafaring man. On Saturday morning, the 1st of May, I left my lodgings about half-past eleven o'clock, and went down Pen<lb></lb>nington-street, and was told there was a procession of charity children ex<lb></lb>pected in Gravel-lane—I walked with them as far as the church door, in St. George's-in-the-East—I saw them go into the church-gates—there was a great crowd—after they got into the gates I was going home, and making my way through the crowd I saw a man, who was the prisoner Phillips, coming towards me in great haste, and the prisoner Tedgell following him—Phillips came right against me in front, pressed very hard against my waistcoat-pocket where my watch was—at the same time I heard a snap, and felt my watch go from me—the guard was round my neck—that was not broken, but the watch was broken from the guard—I felt the snatch which broke it from the guard, and saw it in Phillips' hand—I directly seized him, and called the police, but no policeman coming near I had to struggle with him for ten minutes—not a single policeman came up for ten minutes—at the time I saw the watch in Phillips' hand I saw the prisoner Campbell on my left-hand side, and Tedgdll on my right, rather before me—this was while I was struggling—Campbell had hold of Phillips' arm, trying to rescue him from me—Tedgell struck me on the arm several times—Campbell attempted to make a blow at my head, and knocked off Phillips' hat—Campbell said, "You have got hold of the wrong man; he is a gentleman"—there were a number of them about me at the time—I cannot identify either of the other prisoners, but they were striking me in all directions—Phillips's waistcoat tore, and he got away from me—I followed him down Cannon-street, across the highway, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped—my watch was found on the spot where the struggle took place—the watch produced is it—it was found with the glass broken.</p>

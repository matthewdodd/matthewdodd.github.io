             had cut a portmanteau from behind a chaise; accordingly Mr. Taylor and I went to St. Giles's at 12 o'clock, and waited for his coming home; we waited till five o'clock in the morning, but he did not come home, so we went home to bed about six o'clock. A person came and informed us, that the prisoner was come home; we went and found the prisoner in a closet in a house in St. Giles's; he had two bundles containing the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed?</p>
               <p>Heley. Only his shoes were off; as soon as I knocked, the door was opened by the person that gave us the information. The prisoner said he found the trunk upon the road, and that it was in the ditch, where he found it; that he had been to fetch away the things. We took post chaise, and took the prisoner with us; he showed us the place where the trunk was, and in it we found a boy's pompadour suit of cloaths; the things were produced before Sir John, and were all delivered up to the lady, except a green negligee, a green sattin cloak and he box.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Were the things delivered up to you that were in the portmanteau?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes, all the things were delivered up to me.</p>
               <p>Heley. When we came to the gate we got over it; he said it is in this ditch: I saw the trunk about fifteen yards before I came to it.</p>

I went into the field, and in the ditch I saw the nails shine; there I found the portmanteau; it was too heavy to carry, so I went away and brought a tool bag to fetch some of the things away; I made no secret of it: but when I came to London, I told how I found it.</p>

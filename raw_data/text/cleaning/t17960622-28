               <p>I keep coaches at Kentish-Town: James Wilcox came to my house, on Saturday the 11th, at four in the afternoon, for change for two guineas, which I gave him; and he called me out into the the garden, and told me he had seven trusses of hay to dispose of on Monday; I asked him if it was good, for it must be if I had it; he did not say any thing about the price, nor I neither; I told him to send it on the Monday about ten o'clock, and I should be ready to take it in; I saw Wilcox again on the Sunday, and he told me he should send it in; but instead of seven trusses there were twelve; he told me he had bought them at two shillings a truss, and I should have them for half-a-crown; I told him I would have it; on the Monday morning, about five o'clock, when I got up, there was the hay upon my premisses.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had you known him before? - A. Yes, four or five years; I did not see him again till he was taken up; I took a lump of it and patterned it with Mr. Stevenson's rick; there is not such hay within six miles of London, any where, it is so very fine, and full of clover, very nice brown hay; I could not find such a load of hay, I believe, for six pounds, if I was to go to market.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever buy any hay before of Wilcox? - A. Yes; if I wanted a truss or two, he had the privilege of the stables where he lived, at the Bull-and-gate Inn, at Kentish-Town, to buy and sell hay as he liked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was he to get hay of his own? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You knew perfectly well he was not the master of that inn? - A. He had the privilege of doing as he liked in the stables.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the privilege of the stables; did you suppose this man had a right to sell hay as he pleased out of those stables? - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stevenson. This man was <rs id="t17960622-28-deflabel160" type="occupation">ostler</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960622-28-defend345 t17960622-28-deflabel160"></join> at the Bull-and-gate, and his master became a bankrupt; a man has been in possession for some time; and, I believe, the Messenger under the Commission, had given him the privilege of these stables; and I am rather apprehensive, in consequence of that privilege, he has made a very improper use of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Crane.) Q. How often may you have gone to him for hay? - A. Never, except I was short of hay, and wanted a truss or two; he sold to a great many people in the town.</p>

               <p>I was going home on Sunday morning, about two o'clock, and met a man with a truss of hay, he is not here present, he was coming up to town from the place where this rick of hay stood; I went on a little further, and met another man with another truss, that was the prisoner, Waters, I did not say any thing to him, I am sure he is the man; I watched them both into the Bull-and-gate, I thought it a very strange time to carry hay in, and I went over the hedge to see if there were any trusses gone, and I got under the hedge, and saw two men come and fetch three more trusses away, and throw them over the corner of the field, and I went home; I did not see where they took them to, but they went the same way; the next morning, I asked my master whose rick it was; and he told me it belonged to one Mr. Stevenson; my master, Mr. Crane, went and told Mr. Stevenson of it.</p>

Yes, I knew him, and I did not always recollect what address he had given before; he had often redeemed plate, apparel, and other things - I lent 15s. on the two dessert spoons, and 2l. 10s. on the tea spoons; I suppose the cup is worth 4l. or 5l.</p>

            . I live at No. 5. Stratford-place. The prisoner was my butler for eight or nine years; he had no authority to take coals or anything from my premises - these are all my articles, and were under his care- I know the drawer in which the keys were found; the box which the duplicates were in belonged to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you received a good character of him from a gentleman named Thistlethwait? A. I believe that was the name; I felt great regret at being compelled to prosecute - he had the care of my plate, and I have not the least idea of when these articles were taken; he recived his wages quarterly, and conducted himself well.</p>

Sir Robert had a good character with me, and I could have had a character from Lord Duncannon, where I lived, but I did not like to trouble him - I should have received twice the money which would have redeemed these things on the 25th of March, and should have redeemed them; they could not have remained there, for they would have been wanted.</p>

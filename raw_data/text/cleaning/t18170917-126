My pocket-book, containing the 417l. was kept in my bed, between the bed and mattress - I saw it the day before, and missed it on the next morning-the goods were then moved. I asked the prisoner if he remembered who moved the bed? he said he did not. He came to my house again at two o'clock; I asked him again. He said I had asked him before. I told him I had reasons for so doing. He asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I had missed a pocket-book, with 400l. in it. He expressed great surprise, and said he would do what he could to assist in finding out who had got it. I gave him in charge. I saw him searched, and my pocket-book, with a 300l. note in it, was found in his bosom, next to his skin. He said he had no more. They found 45l. in his hat, one 10l. and one 5l. note.</p>

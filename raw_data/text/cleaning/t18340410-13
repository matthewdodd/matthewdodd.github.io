On the night of the 5th of March I was passing through St. Paul's Church-yard, and saw the prosecutor stop the prisoner - he told him he had picked his pocket of his handkerchief - the prisoner said he had not, and attempted to run away - I saw the handkerchief drop close at the prisoner at his feet - I took it up.</p>

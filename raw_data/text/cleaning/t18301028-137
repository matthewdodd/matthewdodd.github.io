            . I am a Police-officer. I was on duty about half past twelve o'clock; when I got to the corner of Hatton-garden I heard the prosecutor say, "Give me my watch;" I went up, and Collins gave me this watch out of her hand; I took both the prisoners, with the assistance of my brother officer - in going along one of them said she knew nothing of the other party; the other said she told her to take it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I was on the opposite side - the officer called me; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoners; I took hold of Collins - in going up Hatton-garden I said,"Did you take the watch?" she said, "No, the other one took it and gave it me;" I do not think the other heard that - when we got to the station Collins said she took it, but the other told her to take it; Rowley was present all the while, and said she knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Collins' Defence. I met this gentleman in Holborn; he asked me to take part of his umbrella, and then took me up Hatton-garden, and asked to stop with me all night - he said he had no money, but would give me the watch; he took the watch out, and gave it into my hand - we turned a side to have a little private convorsation; he then said he was robbed of his watch, called the Policeman, and gave us in charge.</p>

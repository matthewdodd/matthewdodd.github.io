My ribbon was cut.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA IVERY. I am beadle of St. Ann's, Westminster. I was in Piccadilly, opposite the new street, and heard the lad say a boy had taken his father's watch. I turned round, and saw Higgins holding Murphy-another boy came towards me; I seized him, he said he had done nothing. I immediately saw Clark stopping with his hat - He dropped two small baskets and the seal and key out of his hat. I let the boy go and seized him. I asked him how he came by them? he said he sold them.</p>

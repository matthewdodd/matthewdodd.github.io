               <p>CHARLES BURWOOD. I am a Police-officer. On the 16th of January I was on duty in St. Ann's-street, Westminster, a few minutes before nine o'clock, and heard Stop thief! called; I ran, and Speed told me his grandmother had been robbed of a pair of shoes, that one of the men had gone into the barber's passage, and if I went through the George and Blue Boar, I should find him - I went, and found him in the privy; his hand and wrist were cut, as I suppose, with the glass bottles on the wall.</p>

               <p>JOHN WILLIAMSON. This cart was mine - I took up the hamper in Mecklenburgh-square, at Mr. Winstanley's- I stopped in Gray's Inn-lane to take up a parcel; I stopped again in Holborn, and soon after the hamper was taken - I did not hear of it, nor miss it till the next morning, when I looked over my things.</p>

               <p>THOMAS JAMES. It is a great untruth - I was in Clerkenwell for an assault once; I should know the person who was with him if I saw him.</p>

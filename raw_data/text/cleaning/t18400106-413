                  </hi>I am a currier, and leather-seller, and live in High<lb></lb>street, Shoreditch. The prisoner was my warehouseman for nearly thirteen years—he served part of his apprenticeship with myself and brother, but left us about three years—he bad been in our joint employ seven or eight years, but my brother and I dissolved partnership about eighteen months ago, since which he was in my sole employ—on the Friday previous to the 21st of December I caused my brother John to mark eight half-crowns and five shillings—next morning he marked ten shillings in my presence—I delivered the eight half-crowns and five shillings to Hedgeman, and the ten shillings my brother handed to Mr. Brown—on Saturday, the 21st of De<lb></lb>cember, a little after one o'clock, the prisoner left to go to dinner—I called him back, and engaged his attention in the counting-house, while my brother fetched an officer, who took him, searched him, and found a half<lb></lb>crown in his outside jacket pocket, and in a purse in his trowsers pocket three shillings- the halfcrown was one of those marked on the Friday, and the three shillings had been marked that morning.</p>

On Friday, the 20th of December, I marked some half-crowns, and five shillings, and gave them to my brother—next morning I marked ten more shillings, and gave them to Mr. Brown—I was at my brother's shop that morning, and saw Brown's servant served by the prisoner with a score of mats, which came to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also saw Archer in the shop—he was served by the prisoner—directly after he served Archer, I carried the till up stairs, and examined the money—I selected all the marked money, and found a deficiency of three shillings, which were marked on Saturday morning, and one half-crown, which had been marked on Friday night—I went to fetch an officer, who searched the prisoner, and found in his jacket pocket several papers and bills, an order which Mr. Brown's servant had brought for the delivery of the mats, and a half-crown piece marked—his other pockets were searched, and from his purse the officer took out three marked shillings, with other money.</p>

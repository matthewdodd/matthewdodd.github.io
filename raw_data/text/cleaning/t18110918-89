On the 7th of June last I went out of town, I left a bunch of keys for the use of Mrs. Spybey, in an open drawer in the back parlour, I was two or three weeks in the country, when I returned the prisoner was at home. In consequence of information that he was seen opening my money drawer at night when he was gone to bed. I called in the patrol and told the prisoner that I had suspicion that he had my keys, the patrol searched him in his pocket he found a key, that was one that I left on the bunch of keys in the drawer, this was on the 19th of July, I sent the prisoner to the watch-house, the spectacles were found upon the prisoner's mother at the office, I had lost them out of my desk. The mother's house was searched at Hoxton, we found a variety of things in her house, among which was this hat, it is a new hat, there is my private mark in it, that hat was kept in the shop in the glass case, I had seen it about a week before the 19th of July, the prisoner slept twice a week at his mother's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master-gardener, and live in Wash<lb></lb>ington-place, New Peckham, in the parish of Camberwell. On Monday, the 10th of February, I left home at half-past one o'clock—I left no one behind—my wife went out half-an-hour previously—I left the house secure, and pulled the door after me—it has a spring-lock—it could not be opened without a key—I returned as the clock was striking seven, and found the door open—I had met the prisoner and two others about a hundred yards from my house, going from it—they were well loaded, and had clothes concealed about them under their coats—upon finding my door open, and re<lb></lb>ceiving information from my neighbours, I went back in pursuit, cried "Stop thief," and caught hold of the prisoner—he had got about another hundred yards from where I met him before—after taking him to the station-house I searched my house, and missed the property stated, which is worth altogether about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner dropped a great-coat, a pair of trowsers, and a waistcoat, when I laid hold of him, and struck me with part of the flute three times, endeavouring to knock me down—I took him about a mile and a half on the road before I met a policeman—I am sure these are the things he dropped—I know the coat to be mine, because the pockets are worn by my carrying my hands in them—my waistcoat had a button off, I believe—I see this has not—must have had it sewn on again, and forgotten it—I have no doubt they are my property—this flute is mine, one of the keys of it has a common pin instead of a proper one, and the maker's name is on it, but it is almost imperceptible—I had had it about two months—I am confident it is mine—the coat, waistcoat, and trowsers were taken from a box in my back bed-room.</p>

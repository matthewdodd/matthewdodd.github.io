            . I am a Policeman. I took Morgan in Somer's-town on the 23rd; I asked if he knew any thing about a copper - he said he had received one from a youth named Bourne, and sold it in the street for five shillings; it has not been found.</p>
               <p>Morgan's Defence. I was coming along, and saw Bourne coming out of this house, where he lives, with a copper; he said his friends were going to remove - I sold the copper for five shillings, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Terrett's Defence. I live next door to the prosecutor. I saw Bourne give the copper to this man to sell.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTON. A person named Bourne lodged with his father and mother in my second parlour, but he has absconded; they had no copper - I gave them warning, as I had some suspicion of their son; the passage goes into the kitchen, and these rooms are on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you known the prisoners before? A. I had seen them; I had seen Bourne in company with Morgan.</p>

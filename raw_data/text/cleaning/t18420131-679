               <p>Sussex-place, Regent's-park, in the parish of Marylebone. On Monday, the 31st of January, between one and two o'clock, I left the kitchen for. five minutes—when I returned I saw the prisoner in the scullery in front of the house, with a cruet-stand in his hand—I asked what he wanted—he made me no answer—I asked him a second time—he made no answer, but looked very vicious at me, dropped the cruet-stand on the mat, and ran up the area steps—I ran after him, and called "Stop thief"—he was pursued—he ran through the park, and up South-bank—I pursued him to Cumberland-gate—I lost sight of him—he was brought back to the house in about ten minutes from the time of my giving the alarm—I am sure he is the same person—I missed a mustard-pot, a salt-cellar, a cruet-stand, two silver forks, two silver table-spoons, a mustard-spoon, a salt-spoon, two cruet-tops, and two penny-pieces—I have seen them all again except one fork.</p>

            . I am a widow. On Monday morning the 19th of June, between seven and eight in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18090626-11-crimeloc63">Newgate market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18090626-11-crimeloc63" type="placeName" value="Newgate market"></interp>

               <p>Q. Was there any body close by you at the time you felt his hand in your pocket - A. Nobody but him when I catched hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him near you before that time - A. I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing at the time you thought you felt his hand in your pocket - A. I was under Mr. Cope's shop, a fruiterer's shop; I was bargaining for some cucumbers at the time he put his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he secured then - A. There was some little tustle till I got my property from him. Immediately the clerk of the market took him, I did not wish to prosecute him on account of his family; I have since heard that he has a family.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not upon that account that you let him go at that instant - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he is the same person, though you parted with him - A. Yes, he is the same man that I laid hold off.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the man before, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you did not know any thing about his family at that time - A. No, only what I have heard since.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the contents of your box - A. A one pound note, thirteen shillings in silver, a bad shilling, and a foreign farthing; I have the box, the money I was obliged to make use of. I saw him slip the box out of his hand on the basket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Do you mean to say that you saw him distinctly put it out of his hand on the basket - A. Yes, I clasped my arms around him, and when I turned round I saw it on the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had got him in front, you could not see through him - A. I turned round and saw the box that he put on the basket, I said you dropped it; a woman said she saw him put it out of his hand. The prisoner and I fell down in struggling; that was after I had my box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there when this happened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260010"></xptr>- A. A great number; but there were no person by when I felt his hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not believe the clerk of the market interfered till this man was pretty well mauled about - A. Yes; a whole mob set about him, and then he run till he got him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, I am taken at a nonplus for character; I have nobody here at present; if it was referred till tomorrow I could have many.</p>

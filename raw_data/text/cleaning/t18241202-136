I had a gold watch a chain, and two seals attached to it - I am sure I had it when I went into the room with her. I cannot say where I put it - there were no other persons in the room that I know of. I had a purse in my pocket, with two 5 l. notes, and four sovereigns in it. I awoke about half-past six o'clock in the morning, she was then gone. I missed my watch, chain, seals, purse, silver pencil-case, and pocket comb - I did not hear her leave the room. I cannot be positive whether any other person was in the room. I gave information, and she was taken into custody that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MILNE. Q. Did you not give me the watch to take care of, till you asked me for it? A. I cannot tell whether I did or not; but if I did, it was only in trust till the morning. I cannot say that I did not give her the purse and notes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Billingsgate Ward. I know this house, it is in the parish of Whitechapel. On the 26th of November, about one o'clock in the morning, I was at the Queen's Head, public-house; the two prisoners came in to get something to drink - they were served at the bar, and then it was made known that there was a bed wanting; the landlady said "Who is it for;" Tibbles said "For my daughter, I have married her mother:" the landlady then said "Do you want a bed too," Yes, said he; Tibbels was feeling for money to pay for the two beds, and pulled out this watch. I stopped them both - the watch, seals, and chain were claimed by the prosecutor two days afterwards. I found no purse, but found the pencil-case, and comb, and one sovereign in the bosom of the female prisoner; the watch, a 5 l. note, and a double sovereign on the man.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MILNE'S Defence. He gave me these articles to take care of till he asked me for them, and I gave them to this old man to keep, as I was much in liquor. Tibbles then asked me to give him a glass.</p>
               <p>TIBBLES Defence. I met Milne on Tower-hill, and she gave me the watch to take care of. We had a glass of brandy. I lent her some money to pay for it - she said she would take a bed there - I thought I had better get a bed there too, and give her the property in the morning.</p>

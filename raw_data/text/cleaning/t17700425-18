On the 8th of March the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me to shew him a watch. I shewed him a silver one with an enamelled dial-plate. He did not like the plate. I shewed him another with a silver plate. He seemed to like it. He said, there is another that hangs up in the corner, let me look at that. It was hanging in the window. I took the frame down in which the watches hung; in the mean time he ran away with the other. I jumped over the compter, and called out, and ran after him, but he out-ran me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Delaforce. No, I never did. I have known him eight or nine years; and some of my neighbours hearing he had robbed me, came and told me he was drinking at the King's-arms alehouse in Bishopsgate-street, the night after. There I went and took him. I asked him, what he had done with my watch? He said, he had taken it, and given it to one

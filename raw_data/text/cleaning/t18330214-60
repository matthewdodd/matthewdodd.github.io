            . I am an officer. About a quarter before eight o'clock I saw the prisoner standing by the prosecutors window; and from a circumstance which happened an hour before, I suspected him - I passed by the window and saw it was not broken; I watched him for nearly half an hour, and when nobody was passing by, his two companions gave a signal - and when the regular Policeman passed they went away, and then I observed him leave the window, I met him in the middle of the road with the book under his coat, and secured him - the window was then broken; it was a quarter after eight o'clock, it was not broken half an hour before; he resisted and would not come back.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the book laying on the path, and as I knew the officer would take it from me if he saw me, I put it under my jacket.</p>
               <p>HENRY LAMBERT. Part of the square of glass was broken out; he told the Magistrate he heard the window break, put his hand in, and took it out as he passed by; I saw the broken glass in the foot path.</p>

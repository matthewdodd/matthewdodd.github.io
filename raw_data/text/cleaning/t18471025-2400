                  </hi> I live with my husband, George Hodson, at 10, Augusta-square, Regent's-park. On Saturday evening, the 25th of Sept., about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, I left the house by the frond door, which I pulled to after me—it is a corner house—there is a window on the Square side in front—I left that quite safe—I returned in about an hour, the front door was as I had left it—I missed some things—some one must have entered by the little window, which was shut when I went out—I went to the station, my things were shown me there—the property here in mine.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 1, Augusta-square. On the evening of the 25th of Sept. I was in my garden, and saw Mrs. Hodson leave her house, and almost immediately I saw four men walk up to the house, examine the front of it, and look at the area window—one of them went into a public-house, and two of them went in front of the house—they went away, and commenced drinking beer and smoking cigars, and then two went in front of the house again, and I heard a breaking of glass—I directly missed one of the men—I afterwards saw him come out of the front of the door, go down the steps, and beckon to the others—one went to him directly, and went into the house by the street door; the other two stood by the rails, drinking porter and smoking—the prisoner is one of the men who went in at the front door—I sent for Mr. Bott, a neighbour, from a public-house opposite—he came in two or three minutes, and while I was speaking to him the prisoner came out with a bundle on his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Kingsworth-place, Pimlico-walk, Hox<lb></lb>ton. I lived at No. 4 when this happened—Shaw and the man Midson lived on the ground floor of the same house—about half-past six o'clock, on Thursday evening, the 30th of August, I went up stairs—I had to pass the prisoner's room—the door was open, and I saw the three prisoners and the prosecutrix—the prisoner Shaw was drinking out of a quart-pot—I went up stairs and had my tea—about twenty minutes after, I came down, and went out of the street-door—the prisoner's door was open, and the street-door too—I went to No. 2, to a friend, and sat outside with him, looking—I remained with him till nine o'clock; but I went through my passage several times—I heard singing in the prisoner's room—about half-past eight o'clock I saw the three prisoners standing outside the door, talking together very slowly—I cannot say how Shaw was dressed—she had do bonnet or shawl on—George Midson had neither bat or coat on—they stood about ten minutes, and then went inside the door, and were no sooner in than they were all three out again, and walked up Pimlico-walk, leading to Hoxton—I passed by the room door again, and saw a widow's bonnet on the table—I went to bed, and was awoke about two o'clock in the morning by a noise—I then heard the prosecutrix—It told her to fetch an officer—I did not see her, as my door was shut—she made a communication to me that she had been robbed—I work at Chiswell-street, about half a mile, or three quarters from this place—I went there next day, and saw a cab with Shaw and the man Midson in it—I followed it as far as Finsbury-square—it stopped there—they got out, and Shaw asked me if I was going to <hi rend="italic">halloo</hi> and George Midson asked me if I was going to come it—I said I did not know what they meant, and he said was I going to split on that affair last night?—I said, I was on my own business, at Mr. Thwaites, the harness maker's, in Bishopsgate-street—they asked me to take something, and I refused three times—I subsequently went to a public-house, with a view of detaining them—I had some ginger-beer, and they had brandy; while there, George Midson asked if I knew how the window got on—I said I did not exactly know, but that she came and knocked at my door, about two o'clock—I said I understood that she had been robbed of a diamond ring and watch—he pulled out a mourning ring and said "This is the ring"—he then put his hand into his right-hand pocket, and pulled out three seals attached to a chain, and asked me whether they were good—he then pulled out the watch, attached to the end of the chain—Shaw then said it was an old-fashioned watch, not much good—I said there were thirty sovereigns—he said, "That was no more than you could spend in a day"—I told him a man in the back-room had been taken upon suspicion, and he said he must send him something to keep him the week he was remanded—he said it would not do for him to take him any thing or he should be taken, and while we were at the door they asked me whether the widow had a ring and pin about her—I said I did</p>

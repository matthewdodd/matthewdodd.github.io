               <p>JOHN FOX sworn.</p>
               <p>I am sixteen years of age, and servant to the prosecutrix; the prisoner came into my mistress's house, which is a public-house, to go backwards; I was washing my pots at the door, and my mistress called me to desire my young mistress to come down stairs; I opened the stair-case door and heard somebody say softly, damn the boy, what a noise he makes; I then went into the kitchen which is level with the tap-room, and I saw the prisoner with some thing black under his coat; he ran out directly, I ran after him down Giltspur-street; he then went into Angel-court, and I ran round Green-arbour-court to meet him, and he ran back again down Snow-hill, and I followed him; he stopt in Bull-head-court and was looking at the cloaks, and I took them out of his hand, and a man assisted me, and we brought him back; he said he was in liquor, and he did not know what he was about, but he did not appear to be so to me; the constable was sent for, and the cloaks delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, prisoner's counsel. This man was much in liquor, was not he? - No.</p>
               <p>You never knew his person before you met him in Bull-head-court? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did he come any part of the way with you yourself? - No, the man was close by the court, and he assisted me.</p>

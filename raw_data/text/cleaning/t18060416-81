I went exactly as he described; in tracing Brown to Mr. Joblin, I enquired of Mr. Joblin if he worked there, I found he did, and he was gone with the waggon to the Hambro' Wharf in the city; finding he lodged in White Horse Yard in Wood-street, I went there, his wife was there; I found this piece of jennet undone, and rolled up in heaps inside of a half tester bedstead which was turned up in the room, I took it away and went to the Hambro' Wharf, where I saw the prisoners Brown and a waggon; seeing so many persons there I told him his master wanted him, I took him into a public house and there I told him what I wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160076"></xptr>with him and what I had found at his house, he was very much alarmed, he was taken to the office, there he confessed in the yard that Pink was concerned with him and Pink had received part of the property; I then went to Mr. Joblin and waited for Pink returning home with the waggon, then I took him in custody, then Mr. Joblin, he, and I went in in a coach to search Pink's house, I forget the street's name, it is in Brick-lane, Spital Fields, we asked him if he lived there, he said he did; there we found a piece of jennet cut in the form of a child's frock, and part of it put together; Pink was taken to the office, they would not confess for two examinations, when they did it was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were locked up in the yard at the police office, did you serve out any promise to them. A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with them. - A. Very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. I should take it that you locked the prisoners up for the magistrate to examine them. - A. Surely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter into an examination of them. - A. I did not; Brown told me if I would make haste and go to a person of the name of Frost, Cole Harbour-lane, Thames-street, I should find another piece, he thought he could not have disposed of it by that time, I got a search warrant from the lord-mayor, I found this piece at Frost's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are now producing another piece. - A. Yes, Pink informed me that he had left a piece at his brother's, Mr. Robinson in Whitechapel; it is a dark piece with the mark of M. S. on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Frost's a public house. - A. Yes, I think it is the Dyer's Arms, or Distiller's Arms, I will not be positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You have said there were two examinations before they would confess, that expression implies an unwillingness in these men to confess. - A. It was two examinations before they would confess, Brown did confess on the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that no one said any thing to these men in your hearing. - A. I heard a friend say to Pink, Oh! you fool, the other has turned evidence, why should you keep so many things in your breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not that expression been made use of in consequence of something falling from you. - A. It had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you desired that friend to say that. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a good natured friend of the prisoners that induced him to say that. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw them sign their confession. - A. I saw the magistrate sign it, and I saw the prisoner Brown make his mark to it; I saw Pink sign his name, and the same magistrate signed it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (to Ferguson) Is that your property. - A. I cannot see any mark to enable me to say; that mark which Trott has shewed me, I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Trott. That piece was found at Brown's.</p>
               <p>Ferguson. The piece that was found at Pink's likewise, I think it is of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That is all you can say, they are of the same quality. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They never were in your possession. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When these goods were taken the papers were gone, which is a material thing, and the fag had been cut off, are they jane or jennet, are they not distinct species. - A. I do not know that they are.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Mr. Joblin) When this package came to your warehouse was the prisoner Pink in company with Brown. - A. They were both on one duty that day, they both came into the yard together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Somebody produced some fag ends. A. Mr. Ferguson did.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Gassign) Are these two pieces of fag ends your marking. - A. Yes, I believe they came off this piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the piece produced by the pawnbroker. - A. This is one of the pieces that was sent to Mr. Ferguson, there is S. M. on this, it exactly corresponds with one piece missing.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe from the inspection of all these pieces, the one that is produced by the pawnbroker, the other piece from Brown, and the piece cut out at Pink's, you believe them to be those pieces that you sent. - A. Yes.</p>

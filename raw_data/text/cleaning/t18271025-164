            . I was coming out of a house facing the pawn-shop, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me - I caught at him, but he put out his foot, and nearly threw me down - I pursued him; he ran against a watchman, and was taken; he said, "What do you want with me? what have I done?" I said, "I don't know, you will know in a few minutes;" this poor woman then came up, and said he had taken two sovereigns - nobody else was running; he said his father was a Bow-street officer; but no such person is known - he made no resistance.</p>

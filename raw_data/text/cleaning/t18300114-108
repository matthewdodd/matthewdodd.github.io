               <p>JOSEPH COLE. I am a Police-constable. On the 11th of December, about ten o'clock at night, I was walking through Buckeridge-street, St. Giles', in plain clothes, and saw six persons together - I laid hold of the two prisoners and took them into a house; I found on Collins four pairs and a half of silk gloves, and two pairs of leather ones -I saw Kelly throw something behind him; I looked, and found it was four pairs of gloves - the prisoners said they had picked them up; the next morning I found they had been taken from a window in Tottenham-court-road, and went to the place I took them to, and found four more gloves, which had been on the coals.</p>

These gloves are all his property - I missed them at half-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 11th of December; there were twelve pairs and an old one taken from the window - they are all here; the window had been broken half an hour before, and had been mended with paper, which was also broken.</p>

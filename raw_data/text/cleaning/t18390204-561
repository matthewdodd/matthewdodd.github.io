                  </hi>. I live at Mr. Henry Sibert's, in Fleet-strtet On the 7th of January, the prisoner came to hit shop between six and seven o'clock in the evening—he was a stranger—he asked if we had a Taglioni coat—I showed him a pilot coat—he tried it on—it fitted him very well—I then rang the foreman down—the prisoner asked him for another coat—he tried on a blue frock coat, which also fitted him—he then asked for 3 pair of trowsers, which he tried on—they also fitted—he then asked the price of them all—the foreman told him, and he <hi rend="italic">bated</hi> him down to six guineas—he then said he had not sufficient money, and asked the foreman to send the lad, meaning me, to No. 63, Brewer-street, Golden-square, and he would pay me when I got there—the foreman told me not to let him have the clothes till I had the money in the other hand—I went out with the prisoner and the clothes, till we got to Smith's-buildings, near to Brewer-street—we went into a court, and when we got to a door there, the prisoner said, "Give me the parcel and I will bring you the money"—the took the parcel from me, pushed the door open, bolted it on the other side, and left me outside before I could recover myself—that door leads into Brewer-street—I saw the prisoner again on the 18th of January in Chan<lb></lb>cery-lane, and gave him in charge to a policeman—the prisoner said</p>

The prisoner is the person who came to his shop—when I came down he had a blue frock coat, and then he asked me for a pair of drab trowsers—I said we had black stripes—he said that would do, and he had a pair—he teal said if I would send any one with him he would send the money back—I told the boy not to part with the clothes till he got the money—I have never seen the things since—the prisoner had no appearance of a man whose mind was wrong—he <hi rend="italic">bated</hi> us down 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and, agreed to give six gui<lb></lb>neas for the things.</p>

            . The prisoner owned to me that he did this fact, and wished the guard had killed him. On examining his lodgings I found a pair of pistols and some slugs, and a coat and waistcoat, which were both shot through. On examining him, I found likewise his back was shot; he said one Robinson had been concerned with him in several robberies, but that he was alone at this time.</p>

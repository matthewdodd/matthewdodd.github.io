                  </hi>. I live at Deptford, the prisoner lodged in the same house for a few days, and slept in the same room with me. On Whit Tuesday morning I missed the things and money stated, from my pocket in the bed-room—they were my own—I have no father—the pri<lb></lb>soner was the first that went out that morning—he knew I had some money, for he had seen me give change with it—this watch-chain now produced is mine—I know it by a join in the middle—I kept it in my pocket in the bed-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable at Seen, near Newbury, in Berkshire. On the 25th of May I apprehended the prisoner at Newbury, on another charge—in searching him I found in his pocket, among other things, this chain—I said, "Halloo! what do you call this?"—he said, "Oh, it is nothing but an old chain that I found on the road"—he said nothing about Merritt having given it to him.</p>

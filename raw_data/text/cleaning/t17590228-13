I insisted on the girl's shewing me the woman's lodgings; we went to her lodgings, but she was out; I went again in the evening, and we broke the door open, in order to find some tools that were given an account of before the Justice; as we had just done, the woman came home, and we secured her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you or your wife let her the lodgings?</p>
               <p>Drew. My wife did.</p>

               <p>Drew. I was.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280016"></xptr>Q. Did any body come along with her?</p>
               <p>Drew. No, she came by herself; I had not then seen the man that was tried with her just now; she brought some things with her and proposed to come at six, but she came at five o'clock; so that I had not time to go to enquire about her character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilson come to lodge with her, for the indictment mentions his having taken the lodging.</p>
               <p>Drew. He came that same night, and lodg'd with her 'till they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they lodg'd there?</p>
               <p>Drew. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass for man and wife?</p>
               <p>Drew. They did; the other prosecutors came to search the lodging-room, the prisoner and Wilson not being at home, the door was lock'd; I gave them liberty to break open the door; the prisoner came home, they took her, they ask'd her where Wilson was; she at last said he was in the Gatehouse Westminster; then I look'd about and miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they part of the furniture of that room?</p>
               <p>Drew. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>Drew. She told me they were at Mr. Fell's a pawnbroker, where I went and found them, and carried them to Mr Fielding's; Mr Fell being there, he took them back again, in order to produce here.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the woman behave?</p>
               <p>Drew. She always behaved herself well, but I belive she has been us'd very ill by the fellow that is just gone from the bar. She once had pawn'd the tea-kettle before, and brought it back again, and I believe, if she had not been taken up when she was, she would have brought the things all again.</p>

             the constable came; we went up into the room, and found a part of the quilt on the bed upon her; we took her in custody, and in the evening she confessed she had been up into three or four of my master's rooms, and had taken the quilt and torn it in two, and thrown one part of it into the yard, and had taken the other way; and the next day we found that other part behind a pair of gates, according to her direction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. I was at the apprehending the prisoner; I asked her how she came by the quilt; at first she said she found it; then I said, if you have any confederates, it may be the means of bringing you off easier, if you will confess; she said, there was a tall woman with her, but that we found was not true; but before I said any thing to her, there was a heel of a woman's shoe given to me, that was found in the room by the side of Mr. Hayes's bed; and when we found her at White's, there was a shoe and buckle by her bed-side without a heel; we fitted the heel to it, and they appeared to belong to each other; (produced in court, and compared.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether she had the fellow buckle on the other shoe?</p>
               <p>Moore. She said she had but one buckle; there was none in the other shoe.</p>

I went a little farther up the turning, and fell down, and got up, and cried stop thief! several times; when I got to the top, there was nobody nigh me; and then the people came out of the public house, and I went back and told my mistress; I lost sight of the prisoner then; I saw him at the justice's two days after; I saw three men before the justice, and to the best of my knowledge one was the same man, but I was not sure; that was not either of the prisoners; the prisoners are the other two men that stood at the end of the court; I knew them before; I did not know the other man before; I had known the two prisoners a long while; Solomons lived next door but one to my mistress, about a twelvemonth ago; I had often seen Humphries with Solomons, but I did not know his name then; when I went back, neither of the prisoners were at the end of the court; that was about half an hour; it was dark; I have seen the two prisoners together three or four times, walking up and down Shoreditch: I have lived five months with Mrs. Greville; and before that I lived with my mother at Mrs. Greville's, when Solomons lodged next door but one; when I went home, I said I had been robbed by Solomons, and the other, whose name I did not know, and by another man that snatched the bundle.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 4th of January, I sent her to Broad-street with three shirts wrapped up; it was between eight and nine; she was absent about a quarter of an hour; when she returned, she seemed very much frightened, and said she had been robbed of the linen; she said there were three boys standing at the end of the court, and one of them she was certain was the Jew boy, Solomons; he had been a neighbour of ours a great while before; she said, the one who took the bundle from her, was a boy in a dark green coat; I do not remember whether she said she knew the other; I saw two of the shirts without the wrapper, at Mr. Staples's, in the possession of Mr. Cooke, the officer; I know them again.</p>

               <p>Court. Remember the situation in which you stand, and take care you say nothing but the truth, in every respect? - I know the two prisoners; but that was the first night I had had any conversation with them for two years; that was the 4th of January; one of them I knew very well; I met them together by chance, the corner of Hog-lane, facing Magpie-alley; it was about seven o'clock; they both asked me whether I would go out with them a thieving?</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the first thing that passed between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprised at such a question? - We had a few words; but I never was out with them before, nor any body else; but their persuading me, I consented; and as we were standing at the end of Bold-court, the corner of Hog lane, this girl came past about nine; we were there about seven; and Humphries said, there is a girl gone by with a bundle, let us go and snatch it from her; and we followed her till she got very nigh Plow-yard; then we crossed the way, and met her; and I came round her, and snatched the bundle from her, and we all ran away to the corner of Magpie-alley; and Humphries took the bundle from me, into his apron; and we all went into Wheeler-street, where we examined the bundle, and found it consisted of three shirts; and we offered them to a woman for sale at a house on the left-hand side, that Humphries knew; and the woman offered us four and six-pence for them, and we would not take it; then we all went into Bishopsgate-street; there I went in and pawned one of the shirts for half-a-crown; and they two stood at the door; and Humphries and all of us went into Back-lane, a place where they live; and Humphries and Solomons went into a house with the shirts; they went up a court, and I stood at the end; I do not know the name of it; and Cook and another gentleman came by and took me; and I said I was waiting for somebody; and Cook went and took Humphries into custody; and Solomons ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Solomons. When Mr. Cook took me at night, did not you say I was innocent? - At first I did, because you told me to say so; but I owned the whole afterwards; I said, at first, Solomons was not with us, because he told me he had robbed the same woman before; that was directly after we had robbed the girl, as we were walking along; and if he should be taken, therefore for me to say he was innocent; and I not knowing what to say, I said so.</p>
               <p>Did not his father give the officers four guineas to get him made an evidence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the officers say, if you did not swear against me, you would be hanged yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the other prisoner know me before? - Yes; they both lived in one house; the two prisoners were ten yards behind me, when I took the bundle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Humphries to prosecutrix. Did you see me, or was I nigh you, when the bundle was taken from you? - No, I did not; I saw him at the end of the court, with the other two.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you know that boy in the green coat? - No, Sir, I never saw him before that night.</p>
               <p>Do you know him now? - I do not know his face; I never saw his face; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120014"></xptr>know his back; he is the person that took the bundle from me, to the best of my knowledge; it was about his size and figure.</p>

               <p>I was coming down stairs to get something for my supper; and coming along, Humphries asked me if I knew of ever a pawnbroker's near? and I told him, and went with him to the pawnbroker's, where he asked five shillings for the shirts, and they offered him three shillings; I was going to pawn a handkerchief for six-pence; and coming out, I went up stairs, and was going to bed; and I came down stairs to fetch a pint of beer, and Mr. Riley and Mr. Cook took hold of me; and they asked me if I knew any thing about any shirts? and I told them I saw a lad ask five shillings for two shirts, and he was offered three shillings; and then they let me go; and I went home and went to bed; and then Mr. Pirnell took me in the morning; and Humphreys and Archer said they knew nothing of me, and I had not been with them.</p>

               <p>I am no relation to the prisoner: I live in King's-head court, Shoreditch, with my mother; she sells fruit, and has done so thirty-four years. On Tuesday night was a week, William Archer came across the street of Shoreditch, and had a halfpennyworth of apples; I was minding the stall; and he asked me to let him leave a bundle with me, which he had in his hand, till he called again; and he went across the way again, after he left the bundle with me; and he brought the prisoner

             across the way with him, and asked him to pawn a few things for him; and Archer said to me, give this Lawrence the bundle I left with you, which I did, and they both went away together; this was about half after eight at night, as near as I can tell; I never spoke two words to either of the lads in my life; I knew them no farther than buying fruit of me, and going away again; Archer said the bundle belonged to himself.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of bundle was this? - It was pinned over in a brownish coarse-cloth.</p>
               <p>Court to Archer. Did you see that girl there? - I have seen her going backwards and forwards to my work, but never laid out a halfpenny with her in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver any bundle to her? - I never did; for as soon as the bundle was snatched, we all ran up Plow-yard, to Magpie-alley; and then Humphries took the bundle, and we all went to Wheeler-street, to a place he said he knew.</p>
               <p>You never saw the girl that night? - No, my lord, I did not; I tell you nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>Q. How is your mill situated? - A. It is a water-mill, and under the same roof with my dwelling-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300019"></xptr>but there is no communication to it but by the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the door of your dwelling-house? - A. Not two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you want to go to the mill you must go out at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the same roof level all the way along? - A. No, the mill rather rises; I missed my sacks and my flour on the 23d of June, 1800, about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks did you miss? - A. Nine sacks, they were filled with flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the sacks worth? - A. About four shillings, there were five bushels of flour in each sack.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the flour worth? - A. Five pounds a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before? - A. My servant had seen them on the Saturday night, I cannot say whether I did or no; I found them on the Sunday week following through information at the house of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home at the time? - A. I believe he was, but he absconded when the constable entered the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to charge the prisoner as to what time they were taken? - A. No; the flour was in my care, though absolutely not my property, previous to the 21st of June.</p>

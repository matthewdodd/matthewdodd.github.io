                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Reid. He has a house on Finsbury-pavement, and also a house at 9, Little Moorfields—they join at the back—they are in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman-street—persons live in them in the daytime, and I sleep there at night—there are no lodgers—on Tuesday night, 14th Aug., I went to the house to sleep, at a quarter before eleven at night, with Mr. Reid's son—he sleeps there also—he put the key into the door, and found it was bolted inside—I had a bag in my hand; I gave that to him to hold while I; tried to open the door—before I had time to try the door, it was opened from the inside, and the prisoner and another man rushed out—I had not an opportunity of seeing him at that time, but I followed, and never lost sight of him till I gave him in charge to the police—one of the men knocked young Reid down, and they then ran in different directions—I overtook the prisoner in South-street, which is nearly a quarter of a mile from Little Moorfields—after giving him into custody, I went back to the house in Little Moorfields, where I found three sacks of boots, which had been removed from the place where they were ordinarily kept—I had never seen them in the place where I found them—they were Mr. Reid's—they had been kept hanging on hooks round the shop—the desk in the shop was broken.</p>

I have the whole house—on the afternoon of the 18th of April, I was at work in my shop, as late as four or five o'clock—the prisoner came in—I had seen him about six days before, when he came with a customer of mine, Mr. Harman—I</p>

               <p>had a watch marked up in the window—he came in and asked me to let him look at the watch, as a friend of his, a baker, had seen it, and thought it would suit him—I showed it him—he approved of it, saying it would suit his friend, it was the sort of watch he wanted—and he left my shop, promising to meet me at eight o'clock in the evening at my shop, with his friend—he left the watch—he came about eight o'clock in the evening alone, and told me his friend was gone to some baker's shop at Stones-end, but would be back presently—he waited some time till a quarter to nine o'clock—his friend never came—while he was waiting, I had been at work on a small gold horizontal watch, and showed it to him—I then wrapped it up in paper, and put it into the drawer of a desk which stood on the table—he saw where I put it to—I then asked him if he thought his friend would come, as I wanted to go to the West-end—he said he was sure to come, and he should recommend the watch to him, as he thought it would suit him, and he desired me to put a chain on it—I then asked him to drink a glass of ale—he said he would—I sent my little boy, about eight years old, for it first, and they did not send it by him—the public-house is next door to mine—I then went for it myself, leaving the boy at the counter, and the prisoner sitting in a chair some distance from the desk—when I returned, I met him close by the door—he said, "I think my friend may have dropped in next door, allow me to go and see"—I poured him out a glass of ale which he drank, and went out immediately—he never returned—after he was gone I perceived the drawer of the desk a little open—I am sure I had shut it—I looked and missed the horizontal watch I had shown him—I ran to Stones-end and made inquiry—the next morning I found Harman who had been with him before, and he told me where to go for the prisoner, and about nine o'clock in the morning, I found him in the street close by where he lives—I asked him for the watch—he said he had never seen me before in his life—I said, "Well, will you go home with me? my wife and children will recognise you, I am certain"—he acknowledged, in going along Blackfriars-road, that he was at my place with Mr. Harman, but that was the only time—he went with me—I am quite certain he is the man, and my wife recognised him immediately—he had a much narrower-brimmed hat on in the morning when I found him, than when he came to my shop—he then had a broad-brimmed hat on—I went with the policeman, and found the broad-brimmed hat at his lodgings, No. 26, Addle-hill—I had left the prisoner in custody with the narrow-brimmed hat on—at the station house I said there was an alteration in the man, that he had a broader-brimmed hat on—I went to his house the next day.</p>

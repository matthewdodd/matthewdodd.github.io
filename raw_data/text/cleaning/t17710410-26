            . I live at the upper end of Bunhill-row, and work in Petticoat-lane. On the twenty-fifth of March, I left my work a few minutes after seven. Going home, I saw Levi and another man walking together: I saw one of them walk up to the window; and, looking through the glass, he left the window and went into the shop. I saw the other man stand as if he was holding the door open. I walked on till I came to Stony-lane. About twenty yards off, I saw Levi receive one drawer covered with paper, the other man took another drawer. Levi ran down the lane, the young man that was with him came up towards me; the other two that were with them walked soberly on. I saw Levi receive the first drawer. When I saw the other two follow Levi, I turned about, and was going home: A man came by me in a great hurry, and asked a gentleman if he had seen any body with some drawers; I said, Yes, master; one is gone up this lane, another down. I went home. I did not hear the gentleman say he was robbed. The next morning, when I went to work, I told my master I saw a man take some drawers out of the prosecutor's shop. My master said he was robbed of an hundred pounds worth of goods. I told him I knew the man. I had taken off a lock to mend for him, in Marlborough-court. My master took me over to Mr. Routh. I went to a public house that same day, with one Brabroke and some more men, to the Red-lion: Levi came in. I said, That is the man; lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw a drawer, covered with paper, received by Levi?</p>
               <p>Routh. Yes; I knew him very well. Sometimes he wore an apron like a porter; at other times he would have a bit of cane like a bailiff's follower.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Why did you not stop me when the man came out of the shop? Why not stop me, or give notice?</p>
               <p>Homan. Seeing the other parties go along so peaceably, I thought no harm had been done.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. Did you know the man that gave him these things?</p>
               <p>Homan. I know the gang: there is a sad gang of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man a Jew?</p>
               <p>Homan. They are all four Jews; I have seen them many times.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was they at?</p>
               <p>Homan. A bad house; it has been indicted several times.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100014"></xptr>Q. Did you think the prisoner to be a dishonest person?</p>
               <p>Homan. He slash'd away, and never seemed to do any thing for a living.</p>

            . I live in Gravel-lane, Petticoat-lane. I have known the prisoner three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he get his living?</p>
               <p>Jones. Portering. He lodges at one Mrs. Mark's, in Petticoat-lane, not far from where I live; that is, in Marlborough-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this man was the night the garters were stole?</p>
               <p>Jones. At his lodgings. I nursed Mrs. Mark's child. I went there for money, about three in the afternoon, on Monday; next Monday come fortnight: I staid there till above a quarter after eight. I went home to put the child to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mrs. Mark's?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But he does not live with Mrs. Marks?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in?</p>
               <p>Jones. Between three and four. He said he had hurt his back by carrying a load. He laid down upon Mrs. Marks's bed. He desired her to buy some fish for supper. A woman who sells fish, and lives in the court, brought some. Mrs. Marks called the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they pay for it?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot tell. I went home about a quarter after eight. He never went out of the room whilst I was there. He walked about, smoaking his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor?</p>
               <p>Jones. Only one pint of beer, which Mrs. Marks fetched. She gave me a shilling; she said she had no more. I went next morning to fetch a boiler I had lent her, then I heard the prisoner was taken up. I did not go before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bowman?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room in which you found him, the room in which he lodged?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't say: I have seen him there when I have been for money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this happen?</p>
               <p>Jones. A fortnight, next Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on Monday?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Monday?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Monday before last?</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a fortnight next Monday. I was there on Monday, he was taken up next day.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had happened on Lady-day, you would have known it?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was not Lady-day. I think it is a fortnight ago, but cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What was due to you when you received this shilling?</p>
               <p>Jones. She pays me four shillings a week; there were fourteen shillings due then.</p>

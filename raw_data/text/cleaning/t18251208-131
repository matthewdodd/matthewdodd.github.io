On the 4th of November, the prisoner came and ordered some steaks for supper, which were got for him, and immediately after he was gone, I missed a salt-seller and a spoon, similar to those which had been set before him at supper. I have not found them. On the 5th he came again - he ordered a rump steak for supper, and I laid before him four table spoons, two salt-sellers, two salt spoons, and knives and forks. While I was gone to cut the bread, one of the salt-sellers was missing. I then went into the kitchen to get the steak, and when I took it to him, I missed two table spoons. I came out and mentioned it to Mr. Thomas. Morris, the officer, was sent for; he went in and told the prisoner he wanted him - the prisoner said"You are mistaken, you don't want me" - he said he did; the prisoner then got up, and the plate was found concealed behind him; he said he had been out, but I said he had not - he was then taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not some things been missed before? A. Yes; he could not have gone out without my seeing him - no part of the property was concealed about his person - he did not seem intoxicated - no other person had gone into that box.</p>

I said "No, I am not, you must come;" he got up, and I saw the property on the seat. I took him to the watch-house - he made no resistance.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a dealer in glass, and live in City-terrace, City-road. On the 18th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoners on <placeName id="t18251027-73-crimeloc391">Holborn-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18251027-73-crimeloc391" type="placeName" value="Holborn-hill"></interp>

I saw Swindell take a handkerchief from a gentleman's coat pocket, and hand it to Ives, who was close by; they had crossed over the way to the gentleman, and followed him for two or three minutes; I saw them from the opposite side: I do not know the gentleman. I collared Ives - Swindell ran through a corner shop, with two doors, and down Field-lane; I hallooed to the gentleman, but could not make him hear. Ives struggled with me, and dragged me down into Field-lane. I took the handkerchief from under his coat, and gave it to the constable. I did not see Swindell again till next morning, but am sure I am not mistaken in him. I watched them in consequence of Hughes pointing them out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoners going up Holborn-hill together, and knowing them before I watched them part of the way up the hill. I had occasion to stop, and did not see the felony committed. I saw Phillips taking Ives to the Compter. I took Swindell next morning, in King-street, Cheapside, and am sure he is the man. I fetched Phillips, who identified him - he said he had come there to look for his father. Phillips delivered the handkerchief to me - it is worth 3 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner IVES. Q. You never saw me in Swindell's company? A. I am positive of it. I knew them before; I have often seen them together.</p>
               <p>IVES' Defence. As to Swindell taking it, it is false. I had it in my hand when Phillips collared me; he said he was an officer.</p>
               <p>JESSEE PHILLIPS. I have been an officer, and said I was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Wyndham-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone, and am single. I have gone by the name of Sharp for some years, but my real name is White—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner better than twelve months—about a fortnight before the 12th of October, I was unwell, and the prisoner came to me, and said her sister and her had quarrelled—I employed her to attend me in my illness—she came backwards and forwards—I kept my purse and jewellery in a drawer—I occasionally sent her to that drawer—she was the only person I ever sent to it—the articles in question were safe in that drawer when the prisoner came to me—she left on Friday the 30th, having been with me nearly a fortnight, and I missed the articles on the Monday—I never authorised her to pawn them—I never had occasion to do it—I have bad occasion to pawn, I am sorry to say, but not while she was with me.</p>

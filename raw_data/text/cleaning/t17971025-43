I cannot say that we missed any property, it is only from information that we know any thing of it; I apprehended the prisoner behind my counter, on Saturday the 7th of October, and in consequence of further information, I sent a constable down to Ware to search the house of Griffiths. I attended the second exa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250023"></xptr>mination before the Lord-Mayor, when the articles mentioned in this indictment were produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any person there, make him any promise, or threat, to induce him to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Was it not taken in writing? - A. I cannot say; but I believe it was not.(Mr. Knapp objected that the confession before the Lord-Mayor could not be received in evidence, which was over-ruled by the Court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Wrench. I asked him what articles he had taken from our house; and I recollect mentioning thyme, marjorum, or sage; I asked him if he had taken any bags; he said, he had taken half a dozen of half-peck linen bags; and he was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those letters and papers? - A. They are every one his hand writing. His box was searched in my presence, and in it was found Bank notes and bills to the amount of 70l. three of them were promissory notes, one for 21l. 2s. 6d. the other two for four guineas each; upon a further search we found a roll, containing sixty six guineas.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Every thing that the prisoner sold would have such sort of memorandums upon them? - A. I never remember an instance of putting a memorandum inside the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. You appear in one instance to have had a customer of the name of Lee, whom you did not know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe it is regular to mark the parcels outside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You would not have dealt with this Lee if you had known who he was? - A.Certainly not; he was a runaway apprentice of mine.</p>

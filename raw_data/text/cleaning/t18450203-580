                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Isabella-place, Black-friars. On the 15th of Jan. I met the prosecutor in Blackfriars-road and went into a public-house with him—we had been to a coffee-shop first and then went to the public-house, and had part of four half-quarterns of brandy—he got rather the worse for liquor, and I led him away from the bar, as there were so many coming in and out—he fell down on the pavement, and his hat fell off—the prisoner came up to him and I thought he was going to pick him up—instead of that I saw him put his hand into his right-hand pocket and take some money out—he left him lying there and went off—I called "Police!" and another female said "Stop thief!"—I ran after him and the policeman stopped him half-way down the next street—he struggled with the policeman, and I heard some money fall as the prisoner was given in custody—I saw a half-crown and several shillings with the prosecutor before he came out of the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer. I remember being with Rogers on that morning, and going into a public-house in Westmin<lb></lb>ster-road—I had then two sovereigns, two half-crowns, some shillings, and some coppers—some part of it was in a tobacco-box—I had no money; that I know of, in my waistcoat pocket, but I do sometimes put money in another pocket—when I came to myself I had only 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left.</p>

I perceived two pieces of Irish linen gone which lay on the counter; I ran out, and cried stop thief: we took him back to the warehouse, and took out of his apron these two pieces of Irish cloth, which are my property. When I took the linen from him, I asked the reason why he took them, but he gave me no answer. I delivered him into the hands of a constable, who carried him to the Compter. I did not know the prisoner before. (The linen produced.)</p>
               <p>Where have they been since? - In the constable's hands; but he has been very bad.</p>
               <p>Can you swear, that that is your linen? - Yes; I can swear that those are what I took from the prisoner, and likewise that they are mine.</p>
               <p>JASPER FOX. I am a servant to Mr. Dales. I know the linen very well (After looking at the linens produced, said) I am positive that they are my master's linen, and that they were taken from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dales was again called, and asked, Do you know that that is the boy who was in your shop? - Yes; I went directly out, but lost sight of him for about half a minute: I cried stop thief, and he looked about: I believe him to be the same boy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 62.) On the 28th of Oct. I was in Fleet-street, in plain clothes. I saw both the prisoners—I knew them well before—they were going up Fleet-street, following two or three per<lb></lb>sons whom they touched up behind to feel if they had got anything—they then saw the prosecutor coming down Fleet-street, and the prisoners and another who was with them touched one another—I then saw Osborne take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his own pocket—I said, "Give me that "—he said, "It is mine, but you can have it"—Parker was close to him, but I cannot say that he tried any pockets—I had seen them in company for a quarter of an hour or more, and speaking together.</p>

On the 28th of Oct., about one o'clock, I was in Fleet-street—I went down to the Crown tavern—the officer Thompson came to me and produced this handkerchief, which I believe to be mine—I have no mark on it, but I have six others like it—I have no doubt it is mine, and my handkerchief was gone which I had had in my pocket.</p>

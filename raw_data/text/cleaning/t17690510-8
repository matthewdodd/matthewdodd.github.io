            . I am in the toy and silver way. The two prisoners came into my shop on Saturday the 15th of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, and wanted to sell a watch to my wife. I was not at home. They went away and came again the 18th. I was then at home. They produced this watch, and asked two guineas and a half for it. I said I had not so much money then, but if they would call the next morning by nine o'clock, I would get up the money and buy it. After they were gone, I went to Sir

I came home on the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176905100008"></xptr> morning. I met a gentleman at the Salutation at Billingsgate to receive my money. I took this young fellow at the bar with me. After that I saw some young fellows in St. James's park tossing up; one of them had this watch: he asked two guineas for it; he said it was Pinchbeck. I gave him that for it. After that he called me back, and said he had got a seal to sell. and shewed me a white stone seal: I bought it of him for two shillings. The same afternoon I went to the gentleman's shop and asked him if the seal was gold; he tried it, and said it was, and gave me ten shillings for it. I returned home and put that seal to the watch that is on it now. On the Monday morning my money was all spent. I lived with a young woman that made me spend all my money; then I went to sell the watch: they took us both and carried us to prison.</p>

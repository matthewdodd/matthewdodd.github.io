            . I live with Mr. Barnes. On Wednesday morning, the 14th of June, the prisoner came down about six o'clock, which was his usual time. I sleep in the shop - I got up immediately and called Pim up; when I came down the prisoner asked if Pim was getting up? I was absent about three minutes - I said he was not out of bed yet. He immediately went to the end of the shop where the bombazeen was - I was putting my bed away. I then went to the end of the shop to open it - he asked me how that piece of bombazeen was left out from the rest? this very piece of bombazeen then laid on the counter. I said I could not tell. When he was apprehended I told Pim of it, the bombazeen was then measured, and eight yards and a half were gone.</p>

               <p>Bowman. I am in the engine way, and mend locks. I went to several pawnbrokers to enquire after the things, and found my box at Mr. Rodbard's in the open place Black Friars, it had a paper in the inside with the prisoner's name, it was pawned for 4 s. I paid 4 s. 3 d. for it, I could not find the other things. I took the prisoner up, and before my Lord-Mayor he said he was very sorry for what he had done in taking it, and said he never would be guilty of the like again.</p>

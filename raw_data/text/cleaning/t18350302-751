                  </hi>. I live in Drury-lane, and am a whole<lb></lb>sale stationer, in partnership with Thomas Spalding and two others—we are in the habit of supplying Walter McDowall with paper. On the 25th of February, about half-past six in the evening, this request for goods was brought to me, in his name, by Wooddard—I asked him if he was to pay for the paper—I showed the order to my brother—it says, "No. 4, Pem<lb></lb>berton-row, Gough-square. Gentlemen, please let the bearer have four reams of printing royal, perfect, for Mr. Anderton. Your obedient ser<lb></lb>vant,—W. McDowall." My brother told Wooddard he must fetch a sample of the paper wanted—he went away—my brother kept the order—he came again in about an hour afterwards, and brought half a sheet of</p>

               <p>paper as a sample—my brother saw him then—I saw him, but did not hear what passed—next morning he brought an order to my brother (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is it—Wooddard said, "I think there is something wrong, and you seem to think so too, Sir"—this order says, "Mr. Ander<lb></lb>ton says you refuse sending him the paper ordered yesterday, as he has no account, it is for my use; I hope my name and credit is sufficient for you to furnish the order.—Mr. McDowall."</p>

I saw Wooddard when he brought the sample—I told him he could not have it till morn<lb></lb>ing, as I could not match it by candle-light—I suspected the order—I saw him next morning, about nine or half-past nine o'clock—he brought this letter—Wooddard said he thought there was something wrong—I asked him if he came from McDowall or Anderton—he said, "No"—I asked where he was going to take the paper—he said to Wych-street or Holywell-street—(I had communicated with Mr. McDowall in the mean time)—I sent Wooddard for Kirkman the policeman, and gave Wooddard the paper, with instructions how to act.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Pemberton-row, Gough-square. The prisoner was in my service, as clerk and porter, for about two months—he had opportunities of seeing my handwriting, and I saw his—neither of these orders are my handwriting—they are the priso<lb></lb>ner's writing, to the best of my belief—there are two R's and two P's—one R is like a printing R, and one like a common R—he used to write so, and the P's are the same—he knew who I dealt with, by himself entering the invoices.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often do you think he saw you write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—the foreman was more frequently in the habit of sending orders for paper—they were printed—what I sent out were generally writ<lb></lb>ten—the overseer and the warehouseman sent out printed orders—they filled up the blanks—I have seen the prisoner write—he had very nearly filled a ledger—he has entered all our invoices for about three years—he copied them into a ledger—I am prepared to swear that I believe he wrote this.</p>

               <p>Q. What quantity? - A. Fifty-one pound of lead.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day do you think it was taken? - A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lead affixed to the house, had you seen it in the course of the day of the second of December? - A. Yes, it had been put on about a week. I saw it myself in the course of that day, just before they left work, and it was safe there, nailed down.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find that the house had been robbed? - A. We discovered it between six and seven o'clock, directly after it was done; we saw the prisoner on the scaffold, we alarmed the next house, they took up a light into the garret, where they saw the prisoner lying down by the window, in the gutter. I saw the prisoner when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up to him when he was taken? - A. When he was taken I was within ten yards of him. He was seen lying in a gutter; he returned back, he was catched partly on a sence wall that adjoins the building; he had left the lead in the garret of my house that I was building.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this man? - A. He has worked for me these six months.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he able to earn a week? - A. I gave him fifteen shillings the last few weeks, and eighteen shillings in summer. The lead was torn off, and the nails were drawn; I sent my son up to measure the place where it was taken from, and it measured to the place exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the lead? - A. I suppose I paid about fourpence a pound for it.</p>

             sworn. I live servant with Mr. Brown. There was a gentleman in the parlour with my master. I was waiting in the yard to let this gentleman out of the gate, I looked up towards the new house, I saw the prisoner pull the lead up from the new house next door to us; my master was building it. I stood for some minutes to be certain whether it was him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his person well, did you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person on the house besides himself? - A. I did not see any body else. I stood for some minutes before I called any body. I saw him pull the lead up and roll it together. I am certain the prisoner is the man, I went and told my master there was a man on the house taking the lead, and when my master came into the yard, I said it was John, I was there all the time, and saw him taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself? - A. He shook<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040086"></xptr>his head, and said, ch! Jenny, how could you tell your master of me.</p>

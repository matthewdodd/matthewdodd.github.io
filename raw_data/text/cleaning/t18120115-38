            . Q. I believe you were apprehended about the middle of December last on suspicion of having had dollars - A. Yes; I had in my possession when I was taken eighty-six and two more that the constable did not find at the time, and those two I have now. These are the two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this money - A. From the prisoner. The constable took the eighty-six. I got part of them on the 5th of December, and part on the 16th. On the 5th I got fifty-six from the prisoner's wife, and on the 16th I received fifty-four at the prisoner's house, I went there between ten and eleven in the morning, the prisoner and his wife were in bed. They got up. I told him what I came for, I asked him if he had any dollars ready, he answered he had; he took out a paper and told me it contained forty; I took him at his word, I did not count them: I gave him eighteen pence a piece for them. I breakfasted with him; I said I was going to Sheerness; he said I had better have a few more, it was too little to go a journey with; I told him I had no more money; he said he would trust me until I came back; he went out of the room and fetched fourteen more, they were of the colour of a penny-piece; he coloured them in my presence: he gave me some of the same stuff that he rubbed them with in case people should rub them. He gave me a cork, he told me to rub it on with a cork, and not to touch it with my fingers, it would burn them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he made them - A. He told me he cast them in sand and rotten stone, that he made a great quantity; he could supply me in any quantity I wanted; he sold some weeks four or five hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. The dollars that you had with you in the country were taken from you - A. Yes, except these two they were too bad, I thought, to offer; I put them bye; one is marked G B; I got these on the 16th, both of the prisoner; they were in the paper of forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the house that you received the dollars at - A. No. 6, Somers-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a very honest fellow, you were so fortunate as to get them at eighteen pence a piece - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, and you thought you had better convict somebody else than yourself - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let this be a warning to you, do not carry on this any longer - A. No, the game is stopped, I believe.</p>
               <p>- Q. You are a constable - A. Yes; I apprehended the last witness; Mr. Foy the officer has got the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the dollars that Foy has got the dollars that you received from the last witness - A. Yes, there is eighty-six of them.</p>

I did, on the 31st of December, it is in the county of Middlesex; the prisoner was not at home; on my going into the house I enquired if O'Conner was at home; I was told he was not; I saw a woman and two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that woman - A. He acknowledged her as his wife, and that room was their habitation. I searched the woman and found nothing on her. In one of the drawers of that room I found twelve pieces of copper with the impression of dollars upon them. and not coloured. On the floor of the same room I found an eighteen-penny token, coloured, and resembling the eighteen-penny token; I found a counterfeit dollar on the mantle-piece ready for circulation. On the floor I found three files; the files had copper metal in their teeth. I searched the back room, on the floor I found a coat there, the prisoner claimed it as his; on searching the pocket of that coat I found six good dollars. These are the six good dollars. In the cupboard of the same room I found a counterfeit dollar ready for circulation. In a hat-box I found a counterfeit seven shilling piece, it was coloured of the gold colour, ready for circulation. On the floor five files and two pair of sheers, one has been used, the other I believe is new. I went up to the top of the house, on the stairs were corks, gloves, rags, drying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150037"></xptr>sand, and sand wetted in two pans, wetted with strong acid, and seventy old penny pieces; these implements, corks, gloves, and rags, were wet, and had been used shortly before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these things used in the manufactory of counterfeit coin - A. The are; it is necessary they should have such sort of things. I tried the garret door and found it locked; I went down for the key, but did not get it; I broke the door open; I found a furnace fixed in the garret, a quantity of coke and charcoal for the fire of the furnace, five crucibles, all having been used, some having metal in them; a pair of furnace tongs, casting sand; on my examining that sand particularly I found part of the sand impressed with the impression of a dollar; I have some of it here, it still bears the impression; there are several pieces marked with various parts of a dollar, not whole; here is another bit of sand, it has been crushed to pieces, it contains some part of the head and the letters; I have no doubt it was part of the mould that had been used for casting dollars; I found two phials, one I believe contained aquafortis, that is a liquid used to give them the colour. I suppose upward of an hundred blanks for sixpences, a cutting instrument to cut round blanks, a working jacket, it had been used and very much burnt. I found various gloves and rags in the room that appear to have been used in rubbing metal; four iron frames for moulds, that had been frames that the sand is put into with boards to put between them, and a screw to screw them together; the boards were very much burnt, and a pair of nippers to hold the coin in; two pair of shears, two sives holding sand, one finer than the other; four punches with letters on them, such as are used in marking money; a quantity of sand-paper, some of it new, and some of it having been used in rubbing metal; five files that had been used upon copper metal; I found a broken gallipot with a white mixture in it, nearly dry. I tried a little of the composition and rubbed it on a halfpenny, it produced the colour of silver, and I found some on paper, all of which produced the colour of silver on being rubbed on copper. I then came to the lower part of the house, in the passage under the stairs, there I found a paper of cream of tartar, and in the front parlour a dish with some greasy dirty stuff, and a rag that is used to take off the brigtness, to make it look as if it had been in circulation; in the parlour, on the same floor, there was a good quantity of coke and charcoal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other family in the house but the prisoner, his wife, and family - A. No other but an old woman, whom they said was the chairwoman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards when the prisoner came home - A. I did not see the prisoner come home. I left somebody to wait for him. He was brought to the house I was waiting at. About seven o'clock he came home and was taken in custody; he was brought to the Crown public-house in Clerkenwell by

             told me in his presence that he had found twelve uncoloured dollars; I then asked him how he came possessed of these that I found on him, and those I found in the drawer; he said a girl had found them and brought them to him in the morning. I understood he meant the girl in the house, his daughter. That is all that he said then. The next morning he said that he had found them himself in the yard at the back of his house, and these six were along with them; he had put these in his coat pocket.</p>

                  </hi> I am an officer of the Customs, and live at 9, Walburgh-street, in the parish of St. George's. My house was under repair—I had a large chest containing a dressing case, and the articles stated in the indictment—I saw it safe last on the 14th of Feb.—on 21st Feb. I missed a waistcoat from the chest, which induced me to look further, and the other articles were gone—the chest had been opened by a false key, and the writing-desk, which was in the chest, was broken open—the prisoner was at work at the house as a painter—there was a coat, which was the top thing in the box, and I found that had finger marks of white paint, and over that a piece of brown paper, with paint on it, as if somebody had been at the chest.</p>

                  </hi> I live with my father and mother, at 17, Oxford-street, Stepney—my father keeps a beer-shop, and the prisoner often came there—on Wednesday, 17th Feb., I was in the tap-room, and the prisoner showed me some coins, there were two three-halfpenny pieces—I do not know what the others were—they were in a steel tobacco-box—he asked if I would buy them—I saw him with some shirt studs, which looked like gold, and had red stones in them—he asked me to buy them—I said they were of no use to me—he said never mind, he could put them in his own shirt—they were quite round, very thin in the middle, and wide at each end—I know what a stud is.</p>

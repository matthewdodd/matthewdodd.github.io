             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of Bishopsgate; I produce nine pair of stockings, one handker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160025"></xptr>chief, and a picture; I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner. Did you see him at Mrs. Aguilar's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody? - I did; and on searching him I found this picture, in his right hand pocket; his right hand was in his pocket, and I took his hand out, and this here was under his sleeve, in his hand. The other things were given me by Miss Aguilar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of the prisoner? - No, it was not; he was in one room and I was in another. I found this crow laying at the prisoner's feet, I did not find it on him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Williams. Was this room usually kent locked? - No, never locked.</p>
               <p>Q. To Catir. Did the young lady see the things taken out of his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they remain in the same parlour, the things when the officer came? - No, they were taken into the back parlour, to the bell of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the young lady delivered them to the prisoner? - I believe I was, I was present all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things left in her custody any time, out of your presence? - No, the officer took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have no doubt but they are the stockings, and the same handkerchief? - I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the miniature picture is that the same? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Williams. Look at that miniature picture. Is it the picture of any one of the family? - It is Mrs. Aguilar's son-in-law, set in gold; I think it cost her about thirty pounds, when she had it first, but the value is very little now; the stockings have the initials, R. A. on them.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of them? - I am sure I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they new stockings, or have they been wore? - They have been wore.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost new? - About seven shillings, a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Now that cambrick handkerchief; do you know that? - Yes; there is the same name as on the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of the cambrick handkerchief? - About four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been very ill for about four weeks before that, and I got up in the morning, and I was quite almost out my senses when I went into this house, and I found this picture on the stairs, just as I was going up stairs, and I went up and put them stockings in my pocket, and they came up and took me down stairs, and asked me what I had go in my pocket, and I told him; I have been ill these thirteen weeks with the bad distemper.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are all the stockings marked R. A.? - Most all; there is one marked J. A. they were a pair of stocking that were too small for Mrs. Aguilar, and she gave them to her daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any number on them? - There were, but I do not recollect the number.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went to the prisoner on the seventh of January: the landlady that let him his room came to me between seven and eight, and said there was a new bed carried out of the house, but could not tell by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Warren. Yes; No. 7, Carriers-street, St. Giles's; a single room up two pair of stairs. She said she insisted upon my going with her to see that none of her goods were carried out. It was sometime before I would go with her; at last I did: the landlady went up first; the door was open: I said to the landlady, Please to look round, and see that your property is here: she said they were all, except one blanket, a long bolster, and an old blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other thing there but what was the property of the landlady?</p>
               <p>Warren. This table-cloth and old blanket she said were not hers, and a bolster. Thornton came up, and swore, that if he catched an officer in the room, he would use him ill: he came up into the room; the landlady and I were in the room; he said nobody had any business to break his room open, or to enter his room: with that he took up a plate; I had my short staff in my hand; I bid him not be outrageous; he flung it down on the floor: I said I only came to see that this gentlewoman's were in the room. I asked him if the other things were his property; he said, what was that to me, he would not give me any account of it. Another man came up into the room: I charged him to aid and assist, and we took him to the justice: he said he would not be led: he said, Here is a watch that cost me a good deal of money; take it, and I will come down to you: I said I would not quit him till I had him before the justice: the justice examined him, and asked how he came by these things; he said he bought them of an old cloaths-man in Brown's-Gardens. Then the justice asked him were he worked last; he said with a man in Monmouth-street. The justice ordered me to go and enquire of another master where he said he worked in Monmouth-street. I went to search for this man; he never lived in Monmouth-street; he still stood to it that he bought them: he was discharged that night.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The bolster, the new blanket, and the old blanket are all mine: the old blanket is marked, the new is not marked: I cannot so well swear to that on that account; I can to all the rest.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of January, a person came to inquire after Thornton at Mr. Welch's. I asked what he wanted; he said, to see him, he believed he was in a little trouble. I asked what he wanted with him, he would not tell me; I took him before Mr. Welch. The Justice desired him to go with me, and shew me where Thornton was gone to. I went to the place where Gibbons lodges; as soon as she saw me go past the window, she locked the door; I saw her as I passed the window, it was in Newtoner's lane. I demanded the key of the door; she refused it: at last, in four or five minutes she offered it to me. As soon as I went into the place there was that little china lamb and a jarr upon the chimney piece in the woman's lodgings; that was the ground floor. I took her directly away to Justice Welch; I lock'd the door, and left her in custody there, and went back again along with another person, one

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Edward Tyler, who keeps the Colville Tavern, in King's-road, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. On 6th April, about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, my attention was attracted by the jingling of some money; in consequence of that I went in the bar, and saw the prisoner with a little tin tray which had this money on it—he was against the street-door, and had the tray in his hand—I had seen it safe on the side, about three minutes before—there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it in silver and gold—there were eight shillings worth of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-penny pieces, and three or four sovereigns, I could not say for certain—the money was Mr. Tyler's—I am sure the prisoner is the person—he saw me—I called to him and said, "What are you doing with that strap?"—I thought he was cutting the strap of the street-door—I had an opportunity of seeing bit face, and he had been in the house before, that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and reside in Chelsea. At twenty minutes before eleven o'clock that night, I was about twenty-five yards from the Colville Arms—I saw a man run past roe, and he threw down what I thought was glass—he was running in a direction from the Colville Arms—he went on about twenty yards further, and threw a tray down—in about two minutes I went to the spot where I heard the other substance thrown, and picked up 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the ground—there were half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—I did not observe the features of the person, but hit drew was exactly like the prisoner's—I only saw one person running—the officer came up with the prisoner about four or five minutes after I saw the man pass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Assembly-row, Mile End-road. On the afternoon of the 13th of February, between three and four o'clock, I was in Moor-lane, leading into Fore-street, City, and felt the prisoner run against me, and take my handkerchief from my pocket—I immediately turned round and knocked him down, and at the same moment saw him throw my handkerchief from his hand,—he got up, and ran off across Fore-street, into Aldermanbury-postern, where I again knocked him down, and gave him into custody, without losing sight of him for a moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Stapleton, of Whitefriars.

                  </hi>. This table is my property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it by the foot being broken—I was sending some goods to Manchester on the 25th of April, and had intended this to go there—I put it away in the end store warehouse—I never authorized the prisoner to take it—there was a defect in one of the feet, which is here now, and I swear it is my property—H never was sold—I missed it on the morning of the 27th of April—on the 7th of June I went to the premises of the male prisoner, in Clarence-street, Waterloo-town, with a policeman, and found the table there—I claimed it—the prisoner was there—I told the policeman to put his initials on it—I asked the prisoner where he purchased it—he said, of a man at his own door—I did not ask him when—it was unpolished when I lost it—it had to be finished, and to have the leg mended, before it went to Manchester—the prisoner was in the habit of working at the end warehouse at the time I lost it—Hutchinson was in my service—he has absconded—I know the prisoner and he were acquainted.</p>

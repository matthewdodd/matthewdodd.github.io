                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Re<lb></lb>gent-street, Newington. The prisoner assisted me in moving and putting my things to rights, for three weeks—during that time I was doing no business—he did a job or two on his own account, which I allowed him to do—he took the advantage of that, and took my property away, and pawned it from time to time—I have seen a box containing 70lbs. of metal type at Mr. Hitchcock's, the pawnbroker's, but it is too heavy to bring here—I saw it at the pawnbroker's, and it is my property—it is a mixture of all sorts of type, and among it is some foreign type, from the Continent—I found about 5cwt. altogether there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ever send me to pledge any type for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I went with you and several men, in consequence of getting into trouble, having 801. rent to pay—I took you and several others with some type, and pawned it—I named to the pawnbroker the reason of my doing so, but that I redeemed again.</p>

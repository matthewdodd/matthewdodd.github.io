            . I am shopman to Mr. Angel, pawnbroker, of Liquorpond-street. I have a spoon, a ladle, five forks, five table-spoons, and two desert-spoons, pawned at different times, from the 27th of April till the 7th of July, in the names of Stevens and Stevenson. I only took in the soup-ladle, and believe the prisoner to be the person,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060070"></xptr>though he is much altered - these are the duplicates of the property.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to MRS. GILL. Q. Had you authorised him to pawn any of this property? A. No; I know he has a wife and one child - I never allowed him to pawn any article - I did not take him when he gave me up the duplicate, as I thought I could get my property; but they would not give it up - he slept in my house that night, and next morning I said to him, "You will go and point out the property at the pawnbrokers," and when he got out he ran away, and was not taken till November. I am very sorry, indeed, to prosecute him.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker at London Wall, I know the prisoner; on the 14th of February, about nine at night, he came into our shop with this spoon to pledge. (Produced.) I asked him whose property it was, and he said it belonged to his brother, and then afterwards he said it belonged to his brother's master, that lived at Shoreditch; I told him I would go with him to his brother's master to Shoreditch, and going by Bishopsgate church-yard, he ran down there; I missed him directly; he said his name was

               <p>Did he tell you where he lived? - He said he worked at a cow-house, he did not say where he lived; I ran after him down Bishopsgate church-yard, and caught him just going into Broad-street; I then told him I would not go any further with him, but I would take him back to our shop at London Wall; we sent for a constable, and sent him to the Compter: the next day, we had him up before the Lord Mayor; he desired us to advertize the spoon; we did so, and the prosecutor came and claimed it.</p>

               <p>On Monday I went to go to work at my master's at Islington, and he had nothing to do that day, and in my landlord's house we were playing at cards, and there came in a disorderly woman and a man, I took them, my Lord, to be nothing but whore and rogue, for his breeches-knees were all over dirt; and we played at cards for three pots of beer, and I played with him, and in the mean time my landlord winked at me, and I winked at him, and he says I should not grudge that woman sixpence to go up stairs with me; the woman went out first, and he followed her, and we drank our beer; they were gone about half an hour, and I said, where have you been? and he said, what is that to you, and then the woman came in again, and they went up stairs together; the next morning I got up, in order to go to work; my master was gone to London, then I thought as I could not go to work, I would go and fetch me a clean shirt; and going along I found this spoon honestly, and will be bound for it, it had been hauled out by somebody that had stolen it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived at Mr. Constable's? - Seven days.</p>
               <p>What made you run away from the pawnbroker? - Because they said, they would keep the spoon, I have not a friend in the world but you my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, notwithstanding that the prosecutor keeps a very bad house, and is never in bed till one or two in the morning, and last Sunday morning, he came to bed at two o'clock very drunk.</p>

            . I live in Hackney-road, and am a farrier. On the night of the 21st of December, I was in Hackney-road, at the corner of Crabtree-row; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and about a hundred yards further I saw a mob of people running; I saw a man running with a parcel - I pursued him; he dropped it near a baker's shop door, and turned into Crabtree-row - I then returned, took up a parcel, and pursued him down Union-street; when I got half-way down I lost sight of him -I staid there, and the people told me to take the parcel to the station-house; the prisoner was afterwards brought to me by the officer, but he was not the man that dropped the parcel - he was a stouter man than the prisoner, and rather taller; I saw two running, but only the face of one - the prisoner was not the man who dropped the parcel which I took up; the other man had a parcel, but I do not know that it was the prisoner.</p>

I ran in the direction of the Rising Sun public-house, and met the prisoner running by a baker's shop - I met him at the corner of the house; I attempted to stop him - he dropped the parcel; I pursued him down Crabtree-row - I secured him, and found the parcel in possession of a boy, who had taken it up where I saw it dropped - I had not lost sight of the prisoner; he was in the path, and I in the road - when I got level with him he set his back against the wall, and said, "What are you going to do with me? I have done nothing;" Shipway gave me this other parcel.</p>

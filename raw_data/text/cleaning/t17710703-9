               <p>M'Dowall. Any lawful orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you once that Troope had given him this linen to pawn as his own, which he had bought in the city; and he said he carried it to pawn for him?</p>
               <p>M'Dowall. Yes, he said so; he said Troope had shewn him bills of parcels of linen bought elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you fairly whether you have not said that you thought the prisoner believed it to be Troope's, and that he was imposed upon?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain as to the expression; was it, Is Troope at home, or above?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. I think, at home, but will not be certain.</p>
               <p>- Williams. I keep the Blue Posts in Maiden-lane. The linen was left at my house, but I cannot tell by whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner frequent your house?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What does he come for?</p>
               <p>Williams. The sake of drinking and seeing company.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep any shop at your house, or sell things there?</p>
               <p>Williams. No; not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to come of a morning, or afternoon?</p>
               <p>Williams. I have seen him there in both.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular room in which he sees company.</p>
               <p>Williams. No.</p>
               <p>- Ellis. I am a butcher (produces a piece of linen.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that piece of linen?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I bought it of the prisoner at the blue posts. I use the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he usually sell things there?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I don't know; I was told by several people that he sold things of that sort,</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I was to give three shillings a yard for it: it has been out of my custody since.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030009"></xptr>Prosecutor. This is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any other piece of him.</p>
               <p>Ellis. No.</p>
               <p>- Halliburton. I had this piece in my custody; it is the same I received of Mr. Ellis.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutor. How much was that linen worth.</p>
               <p>M'Dowall. It cost me three shillings per yard.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the piece you delivered to Halliburton was the same you bought of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ellis. Yes; to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it sent to you?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Spurrier's Defence. I met him in York-street about ten o'clock; he went with us, and sent Walters for 1s. worth of gin and cloves, then for another, and for four or five - he made me quite tipsy, and I went to bed; he undressed, and went to bed too.</p>

               <p>Walters' Defence. When I went in with the last gin and cloves, he said he was sorry he had not money to pay for more, and he gave me his watch; I then went to bed, and he grumbled at three of us being in bed - I got up and went to another bed.</p>

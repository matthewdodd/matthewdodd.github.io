             sworn. - I was cleaning the door, between seven and eight o'clock, and saw the two prisoners at the bar standing loitering about the opposite side of the way; I saw them four or five minutes; I am sure of their persons; I had occasion to go down stairs for a pail of water, and might be four or five minutes down stairs getting the water; when I came back to the door, Mr. Morris, the baker, informed me that two men had stole it; he pointed the men out to me, and one had my master's great coat under his arm; they were both together at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he be from you then? - A. About twice as far as I am from him now; I am sure that the men that he pointed out to me, were the men that I had seen loitering about.</p>

             sworn. - On the morning of the 7th of April, I saw the two prisoners the other side of the street; they were talking together; I live next door to Mr. Dell; I could see them very well looking out of my window; and having a great deal of bread in my window; I watched them; I saw the prisoner Wilkinson go into Mr. Dell's; he had nothing in his hand, because I took particular notice of him; when he went in, he brought out a great coat with him; I might have took him if I liked, but I did not know whether he had stolen it; I called to the maid, to know whether she had lent her master's great coat; she said, no; then I said the man has stolen it; I pointed out the man to her; they both walked very gently away, Wilkinson having the coat under his arm; Mr. Dell came out, and I pointed out to him, Brown, as Wilkinson then had got off with it, Mr. Dell pursued Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. The two prisoners were both together before you saw Wilkinson come out of Dell's with the coat? - A. Yes, they went up the passage of the court together, after they had got the coat, and Brown stood still at the door, while Wilkinson went in and took the coat.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson's defence. I work for Mr. Slade, of Oxford-street; he told me to carry a chaise axle-tree to Mr. Thorp's, in Holborn; after that, I went into this public-house, and

             was sitting there; he asked me to have a pint of beer, and before the beer came into the tap-room, Dell and this man came in, and said I was one of their prisoners. I know no more of the charge than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I had not been out of my bed ten minutes; I went to this house, where I usually use, and I never saw the man before that time we met accidentally at this public-house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Morris.) You have not the least doubt about their persons? - A. No. not in the least.</p>

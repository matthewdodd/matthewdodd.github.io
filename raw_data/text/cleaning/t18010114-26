               <p>Q. Was that done for which she had it to be done? - A. Yes; it was tied up in bundles; I then weighed it again, and it wanted fourteen ounces of weight; I immediately went to the prisoner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140036"></xptr>found her at the Old Mermaid, in Church-street, Hackney; I told her there was some property missing, and I was pretty sure she had got it; she said, if there was any missing, she was sure she knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. I told her, I was positive she had got it in her possession, and that there was an officer at hand ready to be called for to search the place; she made hesitation, and then said there was a woman up stairs, Mrs. Whitely; and I went up stairs with her to Mrs. Whitely, and the prisoner opened a box, and gave me out the Bengal silk that was missing; there were fourteen ounces, which exactly made up the deficiency.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it, as far as you can guess, from colour and sample, the same silk? - A. There was not the least difference; she begged for mercy, and hoped her master would not prosecute her; I sent for an officer, he came, and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had this woman been in your service? - A. I suppose, ten years.</p>

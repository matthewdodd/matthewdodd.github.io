                  </hi>. I live in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell, and am a pawnbroker. On Monday, the 23rd of August, I was passing through King-street, and saw a person outside Mr. Nolan's shop—I looked in, and saw the prisoner inside with his hand over the counter—he pulled out the drawer and took some money out—I went in and gave information—the prisoner turned round and knocked on the counter—he was searched, and three shillings found in his right hand, with the glove of the left hand upon it,</p>

               <p>Was your gold watch ever found? - Never; I went in a coach after to Mr. Hyde's office, and described the woman, and she was taken the next morning, and he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure she is the same woman that you saw? - Yes, I am very positive it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing her? - I talked to her, and changed a great many words with her on the stairs, and again on the landing-place; I stood facing her some time; I know her by her speech; I am very sure it is the same woman.</p>
               <p>When had you seen your watch at your bed's head? - About eleven o'clock the same day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This was about half after two, I think you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not say it was two, did you, when you was first examined, you did not mention the hour of two? - I do not remember that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Are you deaf? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090032"></xptr>Then why do not you answer me, because it is a plain question, whether you did or not? - No, I did not, I said it was after two.</p>
               <p>Now you have got to half after two? - I never said no other.</p>
               <p>You did not alter your note when this woman said she would prove where she was? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Your maid servant was there when the person was on the stairs? - She was called up.</p>
               <p>To look at the young woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your wife at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she called up too? - No.</p>
               <p>She did not see her then? - No, she had some ladies with her, but the maid servant came to look at her particularly; she only put her head up; she did, I believe, see her.</p>
               <p>Is she in your service? - She went away from us this morning.</p>
               <p>How came that about, is not she here? - No.</p>
               <p>How came she not to be here, Mr. Willows; did not you tell her the trial was to come on this day? - I told her nothing about the trial; she was not the only person about the house that saw her, my daughter saw her, and the coachman in the yard; the maid servant is not a sober person; she was discharged for being drunken.</p>
               <p>Yet you kept her from the first of January till this day? - I suppose she lived with us six months.</p>
               <p>You was a little alarmed at the time you know? - Very well, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much so, that you could not hold the young woman but let her go, and was so frightened that you did not follow her? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Now all these things that were put into the indictment, none of them were lost, but they were found on the stairs? - She left them on the landing-place; she had them there first.</p>
               <p>That is as you say? - The first person I spoke to was Mr. Hyde; I did not speak to any of the family first; I saw one as I went in; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Was that the man that brought you the woman? - I do not know who brought her.</p>
               <p>Who came to you? - One of Mr. Hyde's men; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>What did he say; master we have got the woman, that will do for us, did you see the person? - No; what person do you mean.</p>
               <p>Is not he here? - I do not know who it was that did come with the bag.</p>
               <p>What had you no conversation with any one of the runners about this business? - I had no conversation with any of the runners.</p>
               <p>Why you described the person? - Yes, I did; I had opportunity enough of seeing her, and hearing her speak.</p>
               <p>How did you describe her speech? - Very soft; I knew her by her speech as much as any thing, though the next time she came to Mr. Hyde's, she came disguised.</p>
               <p>Who did you describe her to? - To Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>Did he take it down in writing? - I do not know; I did not give it in writing; I described her person.</p>
               <p>Let us hear you describe the person? - A short woman with a pale face, a black bonnet, a black cloak, a black gown and a white apron.</p>
               <p>Now does not every woman almost answer that description; which of the runners was it that told you they would find you a woman that would answer the description as well as they could; was not it the same person that told you, I owe a grudge to a young woman for indicting me at Hicks's Hall some time ago? - I described her very hollow in the upper part of her nose.</p>
               <p>You mean to say upon your oath, that without any other marks at all than what you have told us, Mr. Hyde immediately told you, I know the person; come on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090033"></xptr>Monday you shall have a woman that will answer the purpose? - He said, he believed he knew who it was.</p>
               <p>Who whispered the justice? - Nobody saw her in the house so much as my eldest daughter; she is here; she was in the doorway of the room, about a yard and a half off.</p>
               <p>And the woman had a bonnet? - It was not a deep very bonnet; her face was seen plain enough.</p>
               <p>Was not you told the day afterwards that she was the woman that you was to know again? - I was sent for to see if I knew her, and I did know her.</p>
               <p>What was you told as you was going there, or when you came there? - I went by myself.</p>
               <p>Who spoke to you first, upon your oath? - I believe Mr. Hyde.</p>
               <p>Are you sure one of the runners did not, upon your oath? - I am pretty sure they did not.</p>
               <p>Where was the woman put? - To the bar.</p>
               <p>No other young woman put there but her? - I believe there was; I think there was another young woman present.</p>
               <p>There was another young woman present; she was a very tall woman perhaps? - I do not know; I know this woman; there was another woman in sight.</p>
               <p>How wide is the bar? - I suppose four feet.</p>
               <p>Why you know to the contrary, because it is the width of a common door? - No, it is wider than a common door; there is another door into the office.</p>
               <p>No; that is the door into the office? - I do not believe it is much less than four feet.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you say you live? - In Leicester-fields? I keep a carpet and upholstery warehouse.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see this woman before that day? - No, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to part with that maid servant this morning in particular? - She was not a proper person to bring; she is hardly ever sober; we have hired another to come this week past; she is to come to night.</p>
               <p>When was it fixed that she was to go away to-day? - It was fixed two or three days ago.</p>
               <p>Why did not you bring her here as a witness? - I looked upon it that myself and my daughter, and another woman that saw her come into the house, were sufficient witnesses without her, who is never sober.</p>
               <p>Did you ever take that maid to see the prisoner, since she was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Never? - No.</p>
               <p>She has never seen the prisoner, to your knowledge, since she was taken up? - No, we never thought of her being an evidence in the cause.</p>
               <p>Why you called her up to see if she knew the prisoner? - Then it was for want of thought indeed, and nothing else; I declare we had never any other meaning, whatever the Counsel may insinuate.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Who advised you to indict this young woman capitally? - I know nothing at all of that.</p>

               <p>Were you at home when the woman was found by your father in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see that woman? - Yes, in the passage.</p>
               <p>What was she doing in the passage? - She was struggling to get away from my father.</p>
               <p>I believe she did get away from your father? - Yes, Sir, I saw her.</p>
               <p>How long was it before she got away from him? - Not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Your idea of ten minutes cannot be correct; do you mean to say she was struggling with your father ten minutes? - Yes, I dare say she was.</p>
               <p>Have you any idea how long ten minutes is; was it as long as you have been out of Court? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now as near as you can judge, how long might she be struggling with your father? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>How many servants were in the house at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090034"></xptr>that time? - I called them all; the moment she saw the servant come up, she got away from my father.</p>
               <p>Why could not the servants come up sooner? - I did not call the servants till my father told me.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you to call them immediately? - No, not directly.</p>
               <p>Where did you stand? - At the nursery door, that is on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Was her face or her back to you when she was struggling with your father? - Sometimes one, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Did you see her, so as to know her again? - Yes, perfectly well; it is her, I am quite positive of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old are you? - Between sixteen and seventeen.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you did not go to your father's assistance at all? - I heard a person on the stairs, I was in the nursery, then I went to the door, they were in the passage struggling.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go to your father's assistance at all? - No, I staid still, and called the servants; the person struggled and got away, and nobody went after her; I had never seen that person before; the person had a bonnet on.</p>
               <p>Part of the time you saw the face, and part the back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the side was to you, you know you could not see the face at all? - Part of the time she faced me.</p>
               <p>The person did not stand still for you to take an observation of them? - No, Sir, they did not; I never saw the person before; I saw this young woman at Mr. Hyde's, and she was the person I saw at my father's.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the person came from Mr. Hyde's to fetch you and your father? - Yes, I was there.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - My father came the first time to fetch me to Mr. Hyde's, my father asked me, if I knew the woman when I saw her.</p>
               <p>Did not your father tell you there was a woman in custody? - My father said he fancied he had the woman, and desired me to go and see her.</p>
               <p>Then he told you he had been at the Justice's, and he had seen a woman there, who he fancied was the prisoner? - To the best of my remembrance he did; I had not seen the officer from the office before that.</p>
               <p>As you was going to the Justice's, your father and you talked about this matter? - No, Sir, all he said to me was, he fancied the person was in custody.</p>
               <p>The maid did not go with you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>She has left you to-day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was with you this morning? - Yes, she went this morning.</p>
               <p>What kind of a woman is she? - A cook.</p>
               <p>A decent person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A woman of good character; I mean nothing bad about her? - No Sir, it did not suit my father to keep her.</p>
               <p>What was she parted with for? - Because she was apt to drink.</p>
               <p>She was not tipsy this morning, I suppose? - No Sir, not that I know.</p>

               <p>Court. She does not seem to be short; do you mean to say the prisoner is a short woman? - She is not very short nor very tall; I do not know her by any thing particular, only I went to her house; Mr. Hyde mentioned it first, and desired we would go there.</p>
               <p>How came he to know her by that description? - I do not know, she had been at our office several times before.</p>
               <p>Had there been any dispute between Mr. Hyde and her before? - None that I know, only that she was brought out of a house in Leicester-fields by two constables.</p>

               <p>Where did the prisoner live? - At Chelsea.</p>

               <p>Did she come in that dress to the office? - Yes, in a black gown; she brought a silk gown with her, and wanted to put it on before she had her hearing; but Mr.

             the magistrate heard her first, he would not let her; we went back to the house with a search-warrant, and found a parcel of keys that I have in my pocket; but nothing belonging to Mr. Willows; Mr. Willows went with us; (the keys produced) she picked out the key of her own house, and here is a turn-screw.</p>

               <p>This was the prisoner's own house? - Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Why did you call it a lodging? - I went into her bed-room.</p>
               <p>Who had you the description of this person from, from Mr. Hyde or Mr. Willows? - From Mr. Willows himself; I was called into the room after he had been talking to Mr. Hyde some time; then Mr. Willows gave me the description.</p>

               <p>I live in Castle-street, Leicester-fields, at one Mr. Bishop's, a chandler's shop; I do not know the number.</p>
               <p>Was this young woman with you on New-year's-day? - On the last day of December she came in the afternoon to see me, and slept with me and my girl all night; I have a husband and a boy; we have two beds; my husband and the boy slept together; in the morning we had our breakfast, and she dined with me on cold beef; she staid with me to the best of my knowledge, till ten minutes, or a quarter before three; she and me went out; she said, she must go home, for her dog and cat would be perished; says I, stay with me, and drink some tea; she said, you might as well go home with me; but I had a cold; I went across Leicester-fields to the corner of Milman-street, opposite the Hay-market; I said, I cannot go any farther, my breath is very short, and we parted; she says, you go home, and make the kettle boil, and I will be at your house in the course of an hour and a half; I went home immediately.</p>
               <p>About what o'clock was it when you parted at the end of the Hay-market? - I think it was about three when we came out of the room, and we were some minutes going that way; I left her there, and she came as she appointed, about five; I did not see her again till she came; I am positive it was near three when she and me went down, and we walked so far; she was never out of the room, nor myself, one moment before that.</p>
               <p>Court. She was with you on the last day of December, and the next day till after dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came she to leave you? - She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090038"></xptr>wanted to go home because of her cat and dog; she asked me to go home with her; I told her I did not imagine I could, my breath was so short, I will not be punctual to a minute or two, for I take it to be ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, when we came out; and when I left her, I take it, it was past three; she came back about half after four, or between four and five; the bells had just struck out for prayers.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - At Chelsea, in Clifford's-row.</p>
               <p>What part of Chelsea is that? - Almost by the bridge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever visit her there? - Yes, I have been at her house several times.</p>
               <p>How long are you walking there and back again? - If I was well and hearty, I could go there and back in an hour and half; it is no great length from my place.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Leicester-fields to that part of Chelsea? - I suppose it was not more than a mile.</p>

               <p>What is her general conduct and character? - If I had not thought her a worthy honest person, you should not have seen me here in behalf of a wrong doer; she is the most reputable of all my tenants; I say she is the most reputable of all I have among my neighbours, and I have eleven or twelve; if I thought her to be any thing like the person she is represented here, I would not have come; I do verily, and from my heart, believe, she is injured in this business.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Payne. How was the prisoner dressed the day she was with you? - She had a black gown, a black cloak, bonnet and white apron, and stuff round the bonnet; as she came, so she returned; in the same dress.</p>

               <p>I belong to St. George's Hospital; I am messenger and collector; I live at the hospital, within two doors of it; I have known the prisoner, I think between five and six years, when she lived by St. James's Church; I have never heard any thing against her till this moment, of this charge; she bore the character of a very honest woman as far as I knew; I always took her for such.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Court to Mallison. You came to Court, upon oath, to give a character to this woman; and although I did not think it fit to prejudice the Jury before they had given their verdict, yet it is a most impudent thing, when prisoners have been tried before, to come to give them characters.</p>
               <p>Mallison. I never knew a syllable of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you have not known her between five and six years? - I knew her five or six years ago; but I have not seen her, till within a month, for three or four years.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you came to give a character to a woman that you know nothing about?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is more than six years since I was in the Court before.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the prisoner, the Jury have spared her life, and I shall certainly order her to be</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. This is a public place? A. Yes; I saw nobody standing about but them - seeing them confused made me suspect them - the boots were in Salcomb's hands; they were high long boots, without tops - Hitchman had an apron full of things; I swear positively to both the prisoners - Mr. Sansom sent for me when he came to town - I described them to the officer, who apprehended them.</p>

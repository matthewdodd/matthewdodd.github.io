               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Were there more persons near you than one? - I cannot say; I did not see; there might be; but I was not aware that there were others; there were a variety of passengers passing.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right the first alarm you had was from somebody calling out to you? - It was from the coach.</p>
               <p>So that it was not done very privately? - I do not know; it was noon day.</p>
               <p>Is the handkerchief here? - I have brought a handkerchief, which may be the handkerchief, but I cannot swear it is the handkerchief; but this I can swear, that it is one of the number; for I was not aware that it was necessary to return the particular handkerchief, as thinking I had preserved the mark and number, necessary to ascertain it; when I came home I threw it among the dirty linen; and all those that were bought at that period were all marked with the same number of fourteen; being handkerchiefs of a certain number, therefore I cannot swear that it is the same; but I swear it is one of the same sort.</p>

On the 2d of June I was behind the carriage, and I saw Mr. Crespigny walking, and I saw a young man take a handkerchief out of his pocket; I immediately called out to the gentleman that he had lost his handkerchief, and I pointed out the young man that had got it; the young man ran off on my calling out; and I saw Mr. Crespigny pursue him up Gate-street: I did not see him taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You saw distinctly some young men picking Mr. Crespigny's pocket? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was up two pair of stairs, and I heard the cry of stop thief; and I saw a young man running, and chuck a handkerchief into a house; I am not rightly sure to the young man: it was a red and white handkerchief, to the best of my knowledge; I do not know whether it was a silk one or no; but I believe it was a silk one; I think I saw Mr. Crespigny pick it up himself:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070029"></xptr>a constable took the prisoner away, and a brewer's servant stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was up two pair of stairs, on the other side of the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know the man at all? - No, I cannot swear to him: it was a great deal of red, and a little white.</p>
               <p>A very bright red? - Not so very bright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

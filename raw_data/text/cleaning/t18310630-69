On the 9th of June, about two o'clock, I left the parlour, and went up stairs to dinner, leaving a great many things in the parlour - I had left the street door open, and the parlour door locked, with the key outside; I heard a sort of snap, and in two or three minutes heard the parlour door open and shut -I went down, but did not miss any thing; I went out, and saw Goulding on the leads next door - I asked if he had seen any body come out of my place; he said Yes, a woman, and she had gone into the next door - I went there, and saw the prisoner; I asked what she had been into my house for - she said she had not been in; I said she must, for she had been seen to go in and come out - she then said she was looking for a lodging; I said she ought to have knocked before she went into my place - she said she did not know there was a knocker; Clark, a Policeman, called that evening, and produced a collar, which I had left in my room when I went up stairs.</p>

On the 9th of June I was on the leads which lead to Hector-row, and saw the prisoner, about two o'clock, go into Mr. Land's house, and come out in four or five minutes; I afterwards saw Mrs. Land, and told her; I followed the prisoner round into the New-road, and saw her go into a house in Newland-street - she came out, and went into No. 6, Little Queen-street: I afterwards saw her in George-street with a bundle - I told the Policeman, who took her; she had some things loose on her arms - I am sure she is the woman who went into Lands.</p>

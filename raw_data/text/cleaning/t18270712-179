I asked her to drink, which she did; I gave her 1s. to get an apron - she returned, and sent her girl to get breakfast; she took me to her room - I sat on the bed; she asked for 1s. to get breakfast, which I gave her - the landlord then came in for his rent; she had not enough, and asked me for another shilling, which I gave her - I laid down and fell asleep; when I awoke I gave her another shilling - she bought four mackarel, and then said she was going to a wake, and would I give her half a gallon of beer, which I did - when she was gone I missed my money from my fob. I had put my trousers under the pillow; there had been another woman there, but she was not near the bed. I missed a handkerchief from under my head - I found two halfpence in my fob, which I am certain were not there when I went to sleep. We found her in about an hour and a half, drinking gin at the bar of a public-house - we found five shillings and my handkerchief in her pocket.</p>

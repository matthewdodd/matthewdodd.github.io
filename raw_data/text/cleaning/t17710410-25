I asked him when he had been at Chelsea, for his innocence would greatly depend upon that; he said he had not been at Chelsea for seven weeks; the officer shewed him the warrant; he said he did not know that he had done any thing wrong, and was very ready to go before the magistrate.

About two o'clock, by the college clock, three men came a-top of the building by a ladder; the prisoner was one; when they first came a-top of the house, one of them passed where we were concealed, to listen, I suppose, if any body was watching; then he came up again; and they began working, cutting, and ripping the lead five or six minutes I believe; then I got out with the blunderbuss a-top of the house. I had no sooner got out but the prisoner came up to me with a knife, and was going to make a blow at me with his knife; he was within a yard of me; I told him if he did not stand I would shoot him; he still advanced; I was afraid of taking his life; I fired at his legs in order to disable him, that I might take him; he was about two yards from the edge of the house; there is a little wall about two foot above the leads; he threw himself head foremost over there; which is about eighteen foot high; the other men throwed themselves over in the same manner.

            . I am a waiter at Chelsea. The prisoner was at our house on Monday the eleventh of March, about 3 o'clock, with two other men, I took particular notice of him; he staid but a little while; then he came about nine in the evening again with the same men and one woman, they only had a glass a-piece at the bar, and did not stay. I was at the public house by Sir

            . I keep the Fox and Hounds, opposite the Swan Walk, Chelsea. The prisoner came to my house, in company with two other men, about four o'clock, on the eleventh of March, and staid till almost nine; they called for a pot of beer, and one of them went out to fetch some bread and cheese. The prisoner went out: he returned again, and said it was not flood. I said, How far are you going? They said, To Westminster. I said it was an odd thing to come against the tide, and go back against the tide. The prisoner said, We come against tide, and we will go back against tide. The other two men said it is cold, we will walk. One, I think the prisoner, said, Masters don't go without me: I would rather carry you for nothing than go without you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't deny this. I said I had not been there for seven weeks, till Monday.</p>

               <p>When I carried these people up it was very cold; we had some purl and some hot; I drank with them. They went down to the Swan afterwards, and gave me some rum. I landed them at Westminster bridge, just before nine o'clock: I was, at nine, at Mr. Smith's, drinking a pint of beer and smoaking a pipe. The reason I was lame, was, I had had a needle in my leg fourteen years, which is worked out now.</p>

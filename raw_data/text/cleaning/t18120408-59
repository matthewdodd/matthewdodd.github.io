               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose nine shirts and a shawl that you were employed to wash - A. The shawl was my own, these things were taken from me on the 5th of July last, the prisoner was working for me, the shirts were washed and ironed ready to be taken home, the prisoner took them while I was out upon my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day on the 5th of July did you leave your house - A. About eight o'clock in the evening; I left the prisoner in my house, I returned between ten and eleven, I found her at home, I had seen the shirts safe in my house in the fore part of the day, this was Friday, and between four and five o'clock on Saturday morning there was an alarm of fire in my house, in the room where she slept, the girl called me to come to her as soon as I could, and when I opened the door the flames came out of the drawer against me, my husband throwed a pail of water against the place where the fire was coming out, and put out the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner dressed when this alarm of fire was given - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the girl completely dressed - A. No, the prisoner awoke the girl out of her sleep, we asked the prisoner about the shirts, she said they were all burnt to ashes and the shawl with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find the shirts and shawl - A. Yes, at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all injured by fire - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any of your linen burnt by that fire - A. Two shirts and a sheet, the drawer was not burnt.</p>

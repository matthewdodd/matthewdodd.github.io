About the 2d of January I met the prisoner in Compton-street - he asked me if I wanted a situation on board a ship? I said Yes. He showed me where his father lived, and said he would get me a place, as he knew a Captain who would take me. He kept on in this way about a week, and said he would get my things washed, in order to go before the Captain. He persuaded me to let him have them washed, and I gave them to him for that purpose. Next day I asked him if they were done? he said he could not be bothered with me, and left. I never could find him. I had given him these things to get washed as my mother was ill. He said he would give me the trowsers out of the bundle before I left him. He afterwards said he would give them to me in the morning. In about a week I met him, and asked him for them - he promised to meet me next day, but he never came. I have never got a single thing back. I found him in custody at Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 10th of March I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18200412-48-crimeloc272">Guildhall</placeName>

I watched him for about an hour, and saw him try several gentlemens' pockets; at last I saw him take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, whom I do not know. I laid hold of him, took it from his hand, and asked the gentleman if he had lost any thing? he said he had not. I told him to feel, which he did, and said he had lost a blue and white handkerchief. I produced one, and he claimed it. I went to the Magistrate's room with the gentleman and the prisoner, but the Alderman had done sitting. The gentleman refused to give me his name, and I have never been able to learn it. I found another handkerchief in the prisoner's breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the election. The gentleman said the handkerchief was a good deal like his, but I will swear it is mine.</p>

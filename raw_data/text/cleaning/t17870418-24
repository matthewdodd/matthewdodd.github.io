I lost a watch the latter end of August last, in the house I live; I saw it the same night; I lost it about nine; I missed it about five; I slept in the prisoner's room; the next morning when I awoke about five, I missed my watch; the prisoner was there; she was up before me; I asked her whether she had my watch, and she denied it.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes; I was at work that very day.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober when you went to bed? - My master had given me some beer when I was at work. I was not drunk, nor I cannot say I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Was that the first night you slept in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged in that house? - About two years.</p>
               <p>How long had she lodged there? - I cannot say; I suppose she had been there a twelvemonth before I lost my watch. I found my watch the 1st of April; I did not take her up at that time.</p>
               <p>What did you think of its being gone? - When I asked her for my watch, she threatened me so hard, that I dropped it; she threatened to get a warrant against me for taking away her character; I found it at a public house door, where there were some men quarrelling in the street; it laid on the ground.</p>
               <p>Was she there? - She was in the house. There was a man standing by me, and he said, there is a watch on the ground; and we both stooped and picked up the watch, and I knowing the men were quarrelling, I told the man I would keep the watch till we found who dropped it. I put it in my pocket, and told the landlady of it; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180027"></xptr>not know it was my own watch then; I went home, and went to bed, and in the morning, when I awoke, I found the watch to be my own.</p>
               <p>When you went into the public house, to say you had found a watch, did you see the prisoner? - Yes; she was in the house; I did not tell her I had found it; I told the woman of the house.</p>
               <p>Had this woman continued to lodge in the same house, from the time you had lost the watch, till the 1st of April? - Yes, she did. I went away about two months since; I left the house before Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Had you any intimacy after this? - No. The 2d of April, which was Monday, I took up the prisoner; I charged her with it; she said she picked it up in the bed, two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the room had you left the watch, when you went to bed? - I did not undress myself at all; I kept on my cloaths, and laid down on the bed. I have got the watch here.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Did you search the bed the morning you missed it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was she undressed? - No.</p>

               <p>I lost the watch when the prosecutor found it. I bought the watch of the prisoner, and gave her 1 l. 18 s. for it; I had it about four months or more; I did not hear him talk about the watch at all; I did not see him pick it up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know that this man dropped the watch till the next day; it was a stranger that was with me.</p>
               <p>Do you know the watch again? - Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Look at the watch; is it the watch you bought of her? - Yes, this is the watch.</p>
               <p>When you bought it of her, did she tell you how she came by it? - She said a young man that had come out of the country had left the duplicate with her; and if he did not return in such a time, she might release the watch, and sell it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The latter end of last October, I picked up a duplicate of a watch, and I shewed it to a great many people in the neighbourhood that I do not know, and they persuaded me to have it raffled for; others persuaded me to sell it out and out; I could not do either, because I did not know the pawn-broker. A person informed me of the pawn-broker; I enquired if it was their duplicate, and they told me it was; I spoke to several people to raffle for the watch; two or three people that work for me, persuaded me to sell the watch out and out, and Rourke said he wanted to buy a watch; he went with me to buy it; my husband has been here all day.</p>

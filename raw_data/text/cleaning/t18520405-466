These tools (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are mine—I swear to this chisel, it having been made by a person I know; and this plane I know by the paint marks and notches—I did not miss them till I was spoken to about them on 1st Feb.—I had last seen them safe aout two months before—they were kept in a loft over the stable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 190). On Sunday evening, 1st Feb., about 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Wandsworth, coming in a direction from Mr. Hahn's premises—when he saw me he crossed to the other side of the road, and stopped a minute—I went towards him, and he set off running as hard as he could, and I lost sight of him—I noticed he had something bulky in his pockets—I saw him in about five minutes after, standing against the Roman Catholic chapel door, with seven or eight other lads—I knew his person, and am certain he is the lad—I went, caught hold of him, and asked him what made him run back when he saw me—he said he never saw me, and he did not run back—I asked what he had got about him—he said, "Nothing"—I saw he had something, felt round his jacket, and in the inside pocket found this plane, three chisels, and a brad-awl—he said they were his—I took him to the station, he resisted all the way, and in the scuffle I lost one of the chisels.</p>

I found the stable-door ajar; the screws had been drawn out of it.</p>

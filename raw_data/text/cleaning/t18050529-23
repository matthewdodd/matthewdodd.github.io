               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I took the room of the prosecutrix, I was in view of paying my rent; I went for my monthly money, they told me they would not pay me the money, as they had got an account that some of the men were dead; I was very bad, I have got two children, I was very much distressed. If my prosecutrix had given me a little time, I would have replaced them, I had got good work coming in.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The Monday before the Saturday she was apprehended, she said she had received two pounds ten shillings, she paid me one four shillings.</p>

I told the officers to search his premises; Woodroff then said, "he is here;" the officers asked in what part of the house? he said in the garret, and he would shew us up stairs; we went up with him-the door was locked-Woodroff put his foot against the door - We found him there - I said he was the man we were searching for-the officers took him to the watch-house.

He attended voluntarily before the magistrate, and has surrendered himself here to day.</p>

He had a bundle, which he threw down, and said, "What will you give me for this?" My wife opened it, and said she would not have it, it would not do for her; he was going away, he had got to the door, and asked if he might leave it till the morning; thinking he might lose it, she gave him leave; he never returned.

            . I live in Rose-street, St. Luke's. I went with Mrs. Hanmore, to whom the property belonged, to Bow-street. While we were there, a man, named Barnet, brought a bundle, which the prosecutor paid him 2l. for. I went to him, and asked him if he could bring the remainder of the things? he said they were to be got if he had money to fetch them. I told him I would pay him; he went away, and returned in a few minutes, and said, if I would pay the money that they were sold for, he could get them. I went to a house in Drury-lane with him, and told Wilkinson to follow me privately; when we got near the house I told him to wait outside. Barnet introduced me to the prisoner Farthing; it was at a public-house-he was sitting in the back room there; Barnet said, "This is the gentleman that belongs to the shirts;" Farthing then said, he supposed I did not mean to prosecute Bozier; I had not mentioned Bozier's name, I told him two of the shirts belonged to me, and I did not want to be waiting about any longer; he asked me which two were mine? he did not produce any; I told him they were marked E.S.; he asked if it was my intention to return the money they were sold for? I told him I would; he went out with Barnet, and returned in ten minutes, and told me his wife was out, and he could not get them; I said I would wait, if she would return soon; he said he had got but two of them, but an acquaintance, who was a bricklayer, had got the other two. He then said, "I will depend on your word, and if you will take my word, you shall have them to night; and if the two which I have got are not yours, I will get the other two from the person in the evening." I told him if he could not produce them, I should like to have the worth of them, and gave him the address of the owner, in the Strand. He pulled out two 1l. notes, and asked if that would satisfy me as a deposit, that he would produce the two shirts in the evening? I said it would. Just as I got my fingers on the notes he changed his mind, and said he would put them into the hands of the landlady. As he gave them to her he said, whatever the shirts cost, she was to return him the 2l., and pay him for them, which I agreed to. I went out, and gave him in charge to Wilson.</p>

Farthing went out with Barnet-he returned in about ten minutes, and said his wife was out, or he would have got two of the shirts, but the other two he could not get before eight o'clock in the evening, as a bricklayer had got them. Gallery wished to wait while he went back again; Farthing said he would leave 2l.; he pulled out two 1l. notes, and was going to give them to Gallery, but drew them back, and said he would give them to the landlady; he said, he expected when he brought the shirts, he should have the money that was paid for them.

            . On the 24th of November Rice gave me information. I went to the Black Dog - I went to the corner of the street, and saw Farthing standing against the door. Wilkinson said he was the man who had left the 2l. I went into the house, and asked the landlady for the money; she said she should know the man who had left it-I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030050"></xptr>brought Farthing in - She said he was the man. I took him to the office. The four shirts were sent home to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BOZIER'S Defence. I got drunk, but did not intend to steal the things.</p>
               <p>WOODROFF'S Defence. Bozier came to my house, and had a pint of beer - He came again about half-past ten o'clock, quite drunk, with the bundle. I took him up stairs, thinking that the parish-officers might report my house, he being drunk. I took charge of the things the while.</p>
               <p>FARTHING'S Defence. Bozier and another man came to a public-house, in Wild-street, where I live, with a basket and bundle, and some women. On the Monday two men came, and asked if I knew the prisoner? I said I did not; but a man had been to the house with a bundle, and went to Drury-lane to fetch the man; I said I would go and send my wife to see for him - I returned, and said she was not at home, but I could find the man at eight o'clock, and get them.</p>

            . I was at Woodroff's when Bozier came in very drunk, about half-past ten on Sunday morning - He asked for drink; Woodroff took the basket, as he thought he was not able to take care of it himself.</p>

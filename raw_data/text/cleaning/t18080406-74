               <p>Q. Did you lose a black silk cloak and other articles - A. Yes; I lost them from my lodgings on the 23rd of March, about a quarter before seven o'clock; I had seen them safe about a quarter past three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you left the prisoner at home or not. - A. I did. She was with me in the front parlour; when I came back, she was gone. On the 26th, I had an officer with me, I found her in Royal Tent Court, in the Borough; I charged her with having robbed me; she acknowledged it, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to tell you. - A. I did: and she did tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear it. - A. I found the pellise on the bed where I found her; the other things were down stairs in the lower apartment, all but the cloak. She was a lodger to Mrs. Green; she directed us up stairs.</p>

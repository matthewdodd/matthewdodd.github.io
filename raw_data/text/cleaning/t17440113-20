             . The 21st of Dec. at night , a child came and told my master that a man had taken a pair of breeches out of Mr. Coleman's shop window, I saw him about a dozen doors off, walking along with the breeches under his arm; I was afraid to speak to him, so I got a neighbour to go with me; we followed him, and then I asked him how he came by them, he said he bought them; we followed him still , called him rogue and villain, and then he was stopped.</p>

I have known the Prisoner these 20 years , he had been in the service of my father many years; and had been an industrious fellow, and saved up a sum of money, and lent it to a pawnbroker to make great interest of it, and lost it, and he has been a drunken fellow ever since; I believe he has been an honest fellow for 20 years. <rs id="t17440113-20-verdict106" type="verdictDescription">

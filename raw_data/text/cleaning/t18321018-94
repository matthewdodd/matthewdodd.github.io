            . I am a goldsmith and jeweller, and live on Holborn-hill. On the 22nd of September my attention was called to Dyer's-buildings; I saw the prisoners coming down the buildings; Stepto was carrying this copper, and a chain; Davis was carrying a basket of carpenter's tools; I asked where they were going to take the copper; they both said to Ludgate-hill - I said that could not be, as it was not their property; they said if I had any doubt they would go back to the person who gave it them - Stepto put the copper down, and was going away, but I told him to take it back to where he brought it from; he took it to No. 5, Dyer's-buildings, and put it down in the parlour; Davis went in with him -I sent my brother for an officer; he could not find one - I went for an officer, and got one; we then went to the house, and tried to get in with a key, but we found the door was bolted, or locked, inside; we went to No. 6, and tried to unlock that, but it was fastened inside; the officer then tried to get in with a crow-bar, but could not -I then got through No. 4, over the roof, to No. 5 - I went down there, and let the officers in; they searched that house, but found no one - we then went to No. 6, and on going down stairs we found a white apron; we went into one of the yards, and found a basket of tools, which I believe is what Davis had in his hand - an officer then went on the top of the houses, and found Stepto between two walls; he was got out, and the officer took him; in the mean time a servant came, and gave us some information - we went to a house in Castle-street, which is at the back of the houses, in Dyer's-buildings; we could not find Davis, but he was afterwards taken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Davis at the Compter the next morning; I asked him if the basket of tools belonged to him - he said they did; I said,"Stepto means to throw it all on your shoulders, for he says you hired him to carry the things" - he said, "That is false, for we both agreed upon the robbery," and asked me what story I would advise him to make.</p>

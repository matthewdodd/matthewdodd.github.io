            . I am an officer. The prosecutor said he had lost nearly 1l. worth of silver - the prisoner and another person were there; I found on the prisoner this money - here is 17s.; it was in the waistband of his breeches - I had searched him the day before, and found nothing on him; I took every thing from him but a needle and thread.</p>

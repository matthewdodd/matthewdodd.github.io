               <p>Thomas Lake. I keep an optical shop in Leaden-hall-street. I was in the shop, and heard the cry stop thief! between 5 and 6 o'clock on the 14th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210008"></xptr> of Jan. and saw the prisoner run by my shop door from a gentleman that was without a hat; I said to the gentleman, what, have you been robbed of? he said, a hat. I pursued the prisoner and took him in Fenchurch Buildings, another witness then followed me, and we found this hat under the prisoner's coat ; (produced in court); we brought the prisoner to the gentleman without his hat; he desired me to give him the hat, saying, it was his hat, which I did. This was Mr. Fanandus ; there came another Jew behind him, and they whispered together; then the gentleman gave the prisoner the hat again, and said it was none of his hat, but still he kept pulling it at several times to take it out of my hand; I charged the constable with the prisoner; then the person that should have been the prosecutor laid hold on the prisoner, and would not let me have him away; then the prisoner said he was going to carry the hat to be cleaned, and that it was his brother's hat.</p>

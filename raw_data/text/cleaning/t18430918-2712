               <p>Edward Labern, who keeps the Stag, in Cumberland-market. At half-past seven o'clock on the 23rd of August I was sitting in the bar—the prisoner walked in and looked over the parlour—he ordered a pint of half-and-half a biscuit and cheese; he walked right up stairs to the sitting-room—what be ordered was sent up by the boy—he was in the house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he then came down and went out—I went up a little after, and found my bed-room door had been broken open, and all the place in an uproar—five silver spoons and the tea-tongs had been taken out of one of the drawers—my box had been drawn from under the bed, and six spoons and some other things taken from that, and the knife which the prisoner had with the biscuit and cheese was lying on the bed—I am certain of that, because there was a little notch on it—I had seen these things safe about five o'clock, and not a soul in the house between that and the time of the prisoner's coming had been up stairs—no one else could have done it—I am sure he is the person.</p>

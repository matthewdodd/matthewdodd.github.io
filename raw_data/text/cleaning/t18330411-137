I was porter to Mr. Boyd; on the 24th of December; the prisoner was my fellow servant, for that day only - he had come that morning; the desk was at the lower end of the shop, nearer to Farringdon-street; on Monday and Friday, after the shop is shut, it is a rule to clean the windows - this was on Monday, and I set about cleaning the windows - the shopmen were all up stairs at the time; the prisoner told me, he would give me a penny if I would clean his window for him, as he was so awkward, he was afraid he should break them - I said I would, if he would finish mine, which were at the Farringdon-street end - I then missed him - I did not see him go out; I remained in the shop till eleven o'clock; when the cash was missed, I was sent to the prisoner's house, but he was not at home.</p>

             (Police-constable C 90). I apprehended the prisoner on the 2nd of February, at Kingston; he began to speak to me as we were coming along; I told him he had better say what he had to say before the Alderman - he then said it was a planned thing with Tim Leary and Bill Allen, and they had acted as b-y rogues to him, or they would have paid the money - he said he knew it was quite up with him, when Mr. Boyd found him out - he said he was ashamed of himself, and he ought to doat on the ground Mr. Boyd walked on, as he had been a good master and a father to him; I said, "You must have made hay while the sun shone to spend 53l.;" he said, "It soon went away with the boys and girls."</p>

               <p>SAMUEL GARDNER. I am the driver of a van from the Elephant and Castle. On the 2nd of February, which was Saturday morning, I was engaged to fetch the prisoner up from Kingston gaol - I went with Feltham; in coming up Robinhood-hill; the prisoner said, the moment the knock came to the door, and they were all called up, he knew he was wanted; in coming along he said, if it had not been for

             and Bill Allen, he would not have been there, and they ought to have paid the money for him; the Policeman told him to reserve what he had to say till he came before the Alderman; the officer said, "You must have made hay while the sun shone, to get through that money;" he said it would have lasted him and his family for twelve months; the prisoner said, "You know what a parcel of boys are, when they get together; it soon goes."</p>
               <p>MATILDA COWARD. I live with my mother, in Gravel-lane, Southwark. On the evening of Christmas day I was at a neighbour's house, and saw Tim Leary there and a young man named Allen; Leary pulled out some money - I went down the yard some time after, and saw Johnson, the prisoner; he asked me if I had heard any thing about him - I told him No; he said if any one asked me if I had seen him I was to say No - I cannot say what quantity of money Leary produced in his hand, but he dropped one sovereign; I cannot tell whether it was gold, silver or copper that he had in his hand - I did not take notice; if any one said it was a handful of sovereigns he pulled out that is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your hand-writing? A. Yes; this mark is mine - this paper was read over to me before Mr. Alderman Atkins; I told the same story I have now.</p>
               <p>ANN SUGDEN. I live in Gravel-lane. On Christmas-day I met the prisoner, with Tim Leary and Bill Allen - Leary pulled out some money, but it was in a dark street, and I could not see it well; he said he was going to Ireland - I was returning home some time after, and saw the prisoner, who told me if any one asked if I had seen him, to say that I had not; I had known them as neighbour's children - the prisoner's parents live in King's-gardens, Gravel-lane - I was in service at Woolwich nine months ago.</p>

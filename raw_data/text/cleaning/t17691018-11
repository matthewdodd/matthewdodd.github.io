Mr. Smith touched me on the shoulder and said, You have lost something. I put my hand in my pocket, and said I missed my handkerchief. He said that man (meaning the prisoner) has got it. He was laid hold of, and I saw it taken out of his breeches. There were three other handkerchiefs found upon him.</p>

            . I was standing behind the prisoner, and saw him make attempts to pick a man's pocket. The man had a button at his pocket, and he felt him. The man came back a little, and said, I believe that fellow tried to pick my pocket. I said I thought so too. Said he, Let us look at him. We did, and in about four or five minutes I saw him put his hand into this gentleman's pocket, and take out something. I saw but a bit of it. He put it into his breeches. Then I asked the gentleman, if he had lost any thing. We secured the prisoner. I told the gentleman, If he has your handkerchief, he has it in his breeches. There we found it.

On the 2d of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at Simpson's window - when I first came up he was standing pushing his belly close against the window; I had seen him before - I came by him quite sharp, and heard the glass rattling - I crossed over the street, came back on the other side, and stood in a dark doorway; he remained at the window two or three minutes, and then went away - shortly after I went over, and saw the window was cut; this was about a quarter-past six o'clock; he returned in ten or fifteen minutes; I remained there till twenty minutes before nine, and saw him come to the window at least twenty times, but could not see whether he took any thing out, till twenty minutes before nine, when I contrived to be on his left-hand side, where there was a gas-light; I then saw his left-hand go inside the window, and draw these two handkerchief out, and put them into his right-hand coat pocket; I immediately went across, and seized him; his hand was all over blood, and his little finger cut; he said he had nothing about him, but I took the handkerchiefs out of his pocket; I took him into the shop - I found nothing else on him, but an old coat; Mr. Simpson gave me this piece of glass next morning - it was shoved inside the window. When I took him he said if he had two sovereigns to give me it would be all right, and I should let him go.</p>

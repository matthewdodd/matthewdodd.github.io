                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, Moses Levy, of Gravel-lane. About twelve o'clock, on Friday, the 5th of Jan., I was returning home, and saw the prisoner enter the passage of our house—the door was open—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him in, and closed the street door—he returned from the parlour to the passage, with his arm full of shoes—when he saw me, he said, "How much a pound do you give for metal?"—I said, "This does not look like metal"—he then dropped the shoes, used very violent language, and tried to get away—I called a man from the warehouse—as I was going out, one of the pri<lb></lb>soner's companions gave me a violent blow on the note, which broke the bridge—when I got the prisoner to the station he was very violent—he said, "I know this is a <hi rend="italic">bellowser</hi> for me, and I won't have it for nothing," and he struck me again.</p>

I was called to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house—when I got there I saw several persons round the prisoner, holding him—he was trying to get away—he was given into my custody—on the way to the station he began to kick, and got me round the legs—a com<lb></lb>rade came up, struck me, and assisted in throwing me down.</p>

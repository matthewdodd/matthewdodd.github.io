In January my House was robbed; I was up my self 'till 11 o'Clock, and left my House safe when I went to bed; in the Morning, a Shutter was taken off, and the Sash which was nailed down, was forced up. I lost 3 Pots, 6 Copper Sauce-pans, 3 Pewter Dishes, a Velvet Cap, and a Peruke.</p>

            . I made my self a voluntary Evidence against the Prisoners, intending to go to Sea, and get away from them. A pretty while after Christmas, Pritchard asked me to take a walk with him, and he and I, and Morris went to Hoxton, about 12 o'Clock at noon; we viewed Allen's House, and Pritchard said, this is a proper House, we can get in here. Then we went to the Farthing Pye-house, and drank two Full Pots; about 11 o'Clock at night we went to Allen's again, and staid about the House 'till 12. We found the Doors lock'd and fast, but with a ripping Chissel and a Knife, I made way to open the Pin of the Window; then we wrenched the Shutter down, and finding the Sashes nailed, I forced one of them up my self. Then says Pritchard, D - n me, who will go in; one was afraid, and t'other was afraid; keep a good look out, says I, and I will go in: They said, if any body came by, they would cry, Hyp. I got in, and unbolted the Door, then I handed out three Porridge Pots, one of them had three Feet on the bottom; six Sauce-pans, they were Copper, I believe, and as soon as we had got them, we carried them to the Prisoner Eades, three Pewter Dishes, a Velvet Cap, and a Natural Wig; we put them into a Flower-bag, and thinking we heard a Noise, we got out, and went off. I put the Cap and Wig in my Pocket; Pritchard and Morris put the rest of the Things into the Bag, as I handed them out. Then we made the best of our way, and took spell and spell, turn and turn to carry them to Rag-Fair, and we got there between two and three; from thence we went to Salt-Peter Bank, to a Glass-house, which is tumbled down, and we hid the Things under the Rubbish, and stow'd Bricks upon them.

I asked her, if she would sell them for us, and told her, we had stole them; she said, she knew a Case, where she could dispose of such Things; so I gave her the three Porridge-pots, and the six Sauce-pans, to another Woman who was with her. They went away together, and came back for the Dishes; we gave them the Dishes directly, and then they went away, and brought us 25 s. G - d d - m your Blood, you B - ch, says, Pritchard to Eades, have you brought us no more? she said, no, she could not get any more. About two o'Clock that Afternoon, I sold the Wig, and the Cap for half a Crown each, which made just 30 s. together, and Eades had 4 s. for her Trouble; 2 s. we spent upon her, and divided 8 s. a piece. The 2 s. we spent at an Irish Man's at Salt-Peter Bank, at the Sign of the Hoop: After this, I did not see them for a matter of four Months.</p>

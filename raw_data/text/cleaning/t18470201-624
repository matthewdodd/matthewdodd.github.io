                  </hi>. I am an engineer in the employ of Messars. Kibbel, Shephard &amp; Co., lead-manufactures, in Love-lane; Mr. Kibbel's name is Henry; he has two partners. On the 2nd of Feb., in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners and two others on our premises, by the side of the counting-house, coming out of the melting-house, running towards me—Brewster had a bag in one hand, and three pieces of lead in the other—he threw the bag at me, and ran back—I called Casey, and he secured Brewater—I picked up the bag—it contained three pieces of lead—they are particular pieces of lead—we have a particular mould—I can swear this lead, which was found in the bag, is my master's property—there is still white lead adhering to it—the prisoners had no business on the premises, they were all together—Jones said, "It was not me, master—I had been to the privy."</p>

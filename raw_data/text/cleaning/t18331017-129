            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Watling, at Paddington; on the 3rd of October, I saw the prisoner Arnold go by with two red wheels - I had seen him before - one of the wheels were similar to these and one was a smaller wheel - I noticed them particularly - I am sure this is one of them.</p>

             (police-constable T 138). I went to Ward's house and saw these two wheels at the door; I went close to them and saw they had been red before - I went to the prosecutor and took him to the house - I asked Ward where he got them, he said he bought them of John Herbert, in Arlington-street, for half-a-crown - my sergeant took the wheels, and I went to Arlington-street, but there was no John Herbert lived there, nor any wheelwright - I then took Ward to the station-house, and from some information, I went in pursuit of Arnold; on my return, I met my brother-officer with Arnold; I said to him, "I want you for those wheels," he said, "I did not steal them;" when we got to the station-house, Ward said to him, "You are the person I bought the wheels of," he again said, "I did not steal them, I carried them for a man."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that Arnold went by the name of Herbert? A. Not since I have known him - the officer who took him is ill - I heard that Ward's wife gave Arnold into custody.</p>
               <p>Arnold's Defence. I was going up Praed-street, and met Herbert, whom I knew - he asked me to get him a customer for a pair of wheels, I sold them to Ward, and Herbert gave me one shilling for it.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Ward; he gave me a job to paint the front of his house; I had some paint left, and I painted these wheels with it, as I thought they looked rather scaley - I had no orders to paint them - Mrs. Ward, (who is my mother,) saw Arnold in the street, and she accused him of having sold these wheels to her; he ran his fist in her face, and I went up and took him till the officer came - she said he went by the name of Herbert.</p>

I left my room on the 22nd of May, about six o'clock in the evening, and was absent nine or ten minutes - I locked the door, and on my return I found the door half open, and the bolt of the lock shot; the prisoner was in the room - my cloak, which I had left on the back of a chair, was on the floor - I found my barometor, which I had left hanging against the wall, was rolled up in the cloak on the floor; the prisoner was not a resident in the Fleet - he was quite a stranger to me: I laid hold of him, and asked what business he had there, and how the door came to be broken open - he said he did not know, and he had come there to inquire for a Mr. Green; I had been in the Fleet about six months, and knew no such person - the door must have been opened with great force, for it cleared the bolt, and carried away part of the iron work that it shot into; he said there had been two gentlemen in the room when he came there, and they desired him to wait for Mr. Green.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of the Fleet, and received the prisoner in charge: I put him into the strong room, searched him, and in his right-hand pocket was a crow-bar, and in his other pocket nine keys - they are not skeletons, but corresponded with the room doors of the prison; I compared the crow-bar with the door - it corresponded exactly with the marks; it required a good deal of force to open it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday evening, between five and six o'clock, I saw a young man in Fleet-street, who used to work with me in the country - he asked me to go and see a young man in the Fleet; I went and inquired for Green - two persons were in the room: they said Green was on the racket-ground, and told me to go in and sit down; I did so - the prosecutor came and asked what I wanted; I told him the gentlemen were gone to fetch Green to me.</p>

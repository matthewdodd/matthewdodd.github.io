            . I was by the Red-Lion door, in Drury-Lane, when the prosecutrix came and asked me if I saw a tall woman come that way, for she had stole a sheet. I said she is gone into one of the houses in Short's Gardens. She went into one house and I into another, and presently the prosecutrix came after me. We found the sheet on the landing-place, up two pair of stairs and the prisoner in the room above. When we came before justice Welch, she owned she took the sheet.</p>

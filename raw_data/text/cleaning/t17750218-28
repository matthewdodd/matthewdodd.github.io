My work-shop, which adjoins to my house, was broke open on the first of February between the hours of seven and twelve in the night: there is a communication between the house and the shop. My apprentice called me up between six and seven in the morning, and I found the window had been wrenched open: my man was last in the shop the night before, and my apprentice was first in the shop in the morning; they are neither of them here. The window had no great fastening, it was easily wrenched open. Crouch the constable, came to me about two in the afternoon, and brought a part of the hemp. He said, he had stopped a quantity of it on one Profit. The next day the prisoner's brother came to me, and told me, he understood I had been robbed, that he had taken care of the hemp, and I should have it if I would send for it. I sent my man, and he brought seventeen pounds.</p>

            . On the first of February I left work at ten o'clock. I went to the Spread Eagle in White Cross Street, and had a pint of beer: the prisoner was there, sitting on the twelve pounds of hemp, I knew him; he was quarreling with a woman who wanted to leave his company and go with a barge-man; she went out, and he ran after her, and desired me to take care of the hemp till he came back. He never returned; so I thought I would not take it home, but lodge it in the watch-house. Crouch met me and took it.</p>

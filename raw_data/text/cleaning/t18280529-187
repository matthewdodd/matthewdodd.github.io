            . I am a patrol. A few minutes before eight o'clock on the 10th of May, Best applied to me- we found the prisoner in about half an hour, going into a pawnbroker's; I found 6d. in copper on her, but nothing else; Best persisted in her being the girl; he was perfectly sober - he pointed her out to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him in Whitechapel; he asked where I was going; he followed me to the house, and gave me 6d.; they wanted another 6d. for the room - he would not give it, and went out.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BEST. I did not go with her, or give her anything.</p>

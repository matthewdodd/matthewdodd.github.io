               <p>Did you mean to dwell there again? - Yes; there was nobody in the house, it was broke open, but I am not sure of the day, I did not hear of it till the 10th, then I went in to examine, and found several things were taken away; the things in the indictment, and many more: the Bath stove was fixed in the chimney in the first room in the house, the value of that was about 14 s. and the sacking of the bedstead worth 4 s. there was a brass sender; I locked up the house and took the key with me, the key was never lent to any body at all, there was a fox trap, value 5 s. and two wooden chairs, value 2 s. there were four wooden hammers, value 1 s. each, one iron spade, value 18 d. four earthen flour pots stood on the mantle shelf, value 1 s.</p>
               <p>Did you rent this house or was it your own? - I rented it, and when I went to look at it, I discovered a hole broke at the end of the house where they got in, and then the window was set open to get the things out; when I examined the house, I found this street lamp which they had to light them, left in the house; I cannot tell how far the prisoner was concerned, the other witnesses can tell you.</p>

On the 26th of August, about a quarter past nine o'clock at night, I was at the corner of Neptune-street, Ratcliffe-highway, walking with a lady, my daughter and another lady were behind, and behind them my son.

My son hearing the cry ran after him, and one of the three came before him, but he was taken without my losing sight of him, the others got away.</p>

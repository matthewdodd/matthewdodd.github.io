               <p>Q. Was that where the prisoner was taken? - A. Yes? my master bid the keeper give a look out, to see him come out; a few minutes after, I saw him on the leads of the house, where they dry cloaths; I said, there is the man I saw with the sugar; I will swear to him; then my master sent over a man, who took hold of him, and found more sugar about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man? - A. I am certain this is the man: when I wished him to go down, he said, give me my hat; and pretended to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk? - A. No; I believe he was sober enough.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer: I was sent for, on Wednesday the 23d, to take take charge of this man, in the house where he was taken; I searched him, and this sugar tied round his middle, under his apron; I went over, with the gangsman, into the warehouse; I found another hogshead knocked in, took some sugar out, and found it to be the same sort as the sample I took out of the hogshead; he behaved very ill when I apprehended him; this is the sugar,(producing it).</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How do you know it to be the same sort of sugar, by the taste, or look? - A. By the look.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a warehouse-keeper: On the 23d of December I was called out of a warehouse opposite that the sugar was supposed to be taken from; and was told the prisoner was in an empty house, upon the top of the leads; I went there; he was then come down to another story, and pretended to be much in liquor; I saw the sugar taken from him.</p>
               <p>- DEANE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gangsman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do these warehouses belong to? - A. Collings and Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Who have the care of the things in it? - A. Me and my partners; there are ten of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you answerable for things in those warehouses? - A. We are; I know nothing of the transaction but what was related by Steole; he called me down; it is like the sugar that came out of the hogshead; but as sugar is so much alike, I cannot positively swear it came out of that hogshead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never took it from them; I never belonged to them; a keeper called me to roll nine hogsheads into Water-lane; he told me to scrape the hogshead; there was a little sugar I might have for my trouble; I scraped this out of the hogshead, and put it into the handkerchief; this man came into the house where I was, and took me into custody, and charged me with stealing the sugar.</p>

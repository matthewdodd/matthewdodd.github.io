            . I am an inspector of Police. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and this property was brought in by the prosecutor; I found two skeleton-keys on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did he say of them? A. He said one was his street door key, but did not give me his direction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not removed more than three days - my landlord's goods were seized, and I moved opposite; I went to get some keys at Mr. Cox's, and he lent me one to fit the door while he made one - there is no skeleton-key among them; this is the key I had made, and this one I borrowed.</p>

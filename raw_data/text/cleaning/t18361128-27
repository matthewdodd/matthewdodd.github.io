                  </hi>. I live in North-place, Camden-town. About four or five o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of November, I was passing through Bishopsgate-street—some one said something that induced me to see if my handkerchief was right—I saw the prisoner in custody of a number of persons—he begged to be let off—I saw my handkerchief with one of the parties who detained him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Bishopsgate-street.

                  </hi>. I was present, and saw a taller boy take the handkerchief and give it to this one, who put it under his jacket; I saw it drop as soon as he was taken by Kilsey, who happened to say he was not a constable, and he made great resistance—I collared him—he still resisted till the officer came and showed his authority.</p>

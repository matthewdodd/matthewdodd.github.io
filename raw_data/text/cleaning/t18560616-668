I thought you was one of the gentlemen"—I said, "No, I am not, I am a policeman, and I want you to show me what you have done with them, and come along with me"—he put his coat on, and said he would show me—he took me to Drummond-street, Buston-square, and he said that a gentleman took them out of his <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and took them down a street which he would show me—he took me to the corner of Whittlebury street and Drummond-street, which leads down to the railway station—he pointed to the kerb and said, "This is where they left me, and went down there"—I made inquiries, and kept him with me all the time—I then told him I could not believe his statement, and I should take him to the station—I took him to the station, and from there to Walworth station—T there said, "You are charged with being concerned with two men in custody, and two men not in custody, in committing a burglary in Mr. Butler's house, in the Old Kent-road yes<lb></lb>terday morning"—he said, "You cannot say that I am concerned any more than taking the things away in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>"—I had been looking for Hart,</p>

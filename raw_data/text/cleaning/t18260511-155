            . I am an officer. On the 8th of May, between half-past eight and nine o'clock in the evening. I was in Margaret-street, going into Regent-street; I heard a cry of Stop thief! - I saw the prisoner running, and collared him; Wilson then came up and said "This is the man who has robbed the carriage;" we took him to the Court-house - he had this coat on his back, which Wilson said he saw him take from the carriage in <placeName id="t18260511-155-crimeloc889">Cavendish-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner deny this? A. Yes; and said he had picked it up.</p>

He was out the night in question, and left this coat in the carriage when he got out at the Hanover-rooms; I shut the door, and saw the coat there; I went to Old Mary-le-bone-street - the coachman took the coach to Mr. Townsend's yard, and when I returned the coat was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you leave it safe? A. About nine o'clock at the Hanover rooms - the coachman took the coach to where it always stands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up in the square - I called out "Does this belong to any one;" no one answered, and I put it on.</p>

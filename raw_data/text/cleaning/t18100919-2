            . I am a beadle of Whitechapel parish. I was sent for by Mr. Windsor, Pawnbroker, in Whitechapel; the prisoner broke a window there, he offered to pay for the window. I knowing there had been a house broken open, I took him on suspicion. I found this coin on him, this black silk handkerchief, and this knife, which Mr. Wigan swore to.</p>
               <p>Q. What money is it - A. Halfpence and farthings, and this bad silver, twelve and three pence altogether, and some foreign copper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Can you swear to any of that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190004"></xptr>money - A. There is one farthing and a sixpence that was in the window, and one farthing laid on the bar; that knife is mine, it was in the drawer, and that is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home from the West Indies with Captain Poppell, I had Portuguese money like this. I am in a strange country, give me fair play; the knife I brought from Martinique, and the handkerchief I brought from Philadelphia in America.</p>

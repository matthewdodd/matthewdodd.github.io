On the 18th of last month I had the misfortune to be burnt out. On the Sunday morning a person came and told me they had taken a man up with some things, that they apprehended he had stole from the fire, and I was desired to attend at St. Margaret's hill. I could not go myself, so I sent my servant, who I thought was better acquainted with these sort of goods than I was, she being my cook. She went, and when she returned, she said they were my property. After that I was sent for to my Lord Mayor, and was bound over to prosecute.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. About twelve at night, on the 18th of last month, a man came to me at the watch-house, and said a man had got some things, offering them for sale at the Bridge-foot, and he apprehended they were stolen. At that time there was a fire at Bridewell precinct. I went and met the prisoner; they had stopped him in Tooley-street. There were a copper pottage-pot, and a copper saucepan, but the tea-kettle was not there. I found that the next day. I examined him in the watch-house; he was quite different in his story. I put him in the Borough Counter, and the next day he was examined at St. Margaret's hill. After this Mr. Sharpe's cook came, and claimed them to be her master's property.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner offering the things to sale, on the Friday night that the fire was, about eleven o'clock. I suspected he had stole them. I followed him down Tooley-street, He would have made away from me; and he turned up a court that goes to the King's-head tavern, but the door was shut; then he went farther down Tooley-street. I followed, and charged the constable with him.</p>

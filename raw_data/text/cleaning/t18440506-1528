                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 88.) I saw Renshaw on Monday, the 22nd of April, coining out of Mr. Clark's shop—I followed him to the Waterloo-road, and there took him into custody—I said it was for stealing two coats from No. 127, Blackfrias-road on Friday last—he said he knew nothing of any coats.</p>

On Monday, the 22nd of April, I met Thompson in the New Cut, and asked if he knew any one of the name of Renshaw—he said no—I said Renshaw was in custody on suspicion of stealing two coats, and I should take him for being concerned with him—he immediately put his hand into his trowsers' pocket, pulled out this dupli<lb></lb>cate, and endeavoured to put it into his mouth—I knocked it out of his hand on to the ground—it is the one I have prodoced.</p>

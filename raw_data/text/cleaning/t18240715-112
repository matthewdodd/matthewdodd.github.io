               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. There are many persons out on Sunday - A. There might be some passing at that time, but I saw the prisoner in front of me when I turned round; if any other person had taken it there would not have been time to have given it to him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and was with him, he said he felt a pull at his pocket; I turned round and saw the prisoner with the handkerchief hanging partly out of his coat, there were one or two young boys on the same line with him, but they ran off; the prisoner did not run, he said he had picked it up; I do not think there was time for him to have picked it up.</p>

               <p>No. 11, Spital-square—my warehouses are on the ground floor of that house—the upper part of the house is occupied by Mr. John Wallen—when you enter the house, you first go into a hall—on each side the hall there are two rooms on the ground floor, and an inner door which communicates with the house, but that is only opened when you knock or ring—the street door is open, I do not keep the key of that—the two side doors inside the hall lead into my warehouse—I was in the habit of going out about 1 o'clock in the day, and remaining about three quarters of an hour—there might have been one or two exceptions, but, as a role, I may say I did that every day—on 20th Feb. I left my warehouse about that time, leaving there a quantity of velvets and black silks—I returned at 2 o'clock, after being absent half an hour—I found thirty-two pieces of velvet gone, and tea pieces of silk, three pieces of which had been sold, and were wrapped up in paper, and left on the counter—they were perfectly safe when I left—when I came back I had some difficulty in opening my door—there were no marks of violence—I lost upwards of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—I have not recovered any portion of it—the premises are in the liberty of Norton Folgate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Thomas Kemp, a silk manufacturer in Spital-square. Our warehouse is nearly opposite Mr. Mar<lb></lb>shall's—on 20th Feb., about ten minutes to 2 o'clock, I was coming out of Mr. Kemp's premises, and saw two men come from the private door of Mr. Marshall's premises—I mean the street door, the front door—I did not see them come out of either of the warehouse doors inside—etch man had a black bag on his back containing something about a yard long, and twenty inches wide, as if they were velvets—the bags were similar to an old clothesman's bag, only new and glazed—they looked full—I watched the movements of those men—they turned towards White Lion-street, walking one behind the other—they walked across White Lion-street out of the square, and went towards Elder-street—there was a cart in Elder-street, about a dozen yards round the corner, with a man in it—the parties put the bags into that cart—they did not get in themselves—it was a dirty cart, of a greenish shade, I think—a spring cart—it had no covering—it was an open cart—Elder-street is very nearly opposite Spital-square, within a few yards—I saw the two men leave the cart—they turned round to the square again, turned out of Elder-street into White Lion-street, and that was all I saw of them—I did not see where they went to—I then went to dine—I left the cart still standing there, as if waiting for the parties to come back—I did not see it go away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman silk dyer, and work at Mr. Hendry's, in Blossom-street. I recollect in Feb. last seeing a cart in White Lion-street, coming from Norton Folgate—Hopkins was in it—I can speak positively to him—I used to see him frequently in White Lion-street, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon—the cart was coming from Norton Folgate in White Lion-street, and turned into Blossom-street—he was sitting in the cart—he went gently on until he came to Fleur-de-lisstreet; he then turned towards Elder-street, and I saw no more of him that day—it was on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 20th Feb.—I heard of the robbery the same afternoon—Blossom-street is not the direct line to Elder-street—there is about a stone's throw between Blossom-street and Elder-street—since I was before the Magistrate I have stepped it, and made it seventy-six yards or steps—Blossom-street is not the shortest way to Elder-street from White Lion-street, the nearest way is along White Lion-street—I saw him turning into Fleur-de-lis-street, but I did not see him further—if he was going to place his cart within twelve yards of the bottom of Elder-street, he would be going round, and not the nearest way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the Metropolitan Police. On Monday, 25th Feb., I was in company with sergeant Jackson in the Kingsland-road, and met the two prisoners together—we followed them; we were in plain clothes; we followed them some distance down the Kingsland-road—I then stopped Hopkins, and said, "Pray, what is your name?"—he said, "My name? why?"—I said, "I wish to know"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—I said, "I am a police officer, and I have a motive in asking you"—he said, "I shall not tell you, but Mrs. Welsh knows my name very well"—there is a Mrs. Welsh who keeps a low public house in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I said, "Then if you refuse to give me your name and address, you must go with me"—he said, "Very well,"and I took him to the station house in Spital-square; and after the witnesses Bowles, Dye, and James had seen them, they were charged with this offence—Jackson took charge of Stewart—he stood close by during this conversation, but said nothing—they both refused their address at the station, to the acting in<lb></lb>spector, in my presence—they each said they should not give their address—I searched Hopkins, and found on him a silver watch and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nothing relating to the charge.</p>

               <p>them together, he took them away with him—next morning, I think he showed them to me pasted on this board—I received it at his house—I had examined the papers that I found, the evening before—they were not soiled in any way, some of them were wet—I can speak to some of these papers as being the same 1 found in the pan, they are like what I found, they have similar figures as them—water cannot be let into the pan from the cell, it is turned on from outside—a person who uses the pan cannot empty it—that is done, on purpose, for precaution—a person using the pan can throw anything into it, but cannot pass it below.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 2, Gray's-build<lb></lb>ings, Kingsland-road. On Friday, the 17th of December, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I was at the top of Wentworth-street, White-chapel, walking down the street, towards my home—two young men met me, and one of them put his hand into my pocket—I asked what they wanted—they said my money—I said they should not have it—they threatened to kill me if they did not have it—they ill-used me, and knocked me about dreadfully, got me down, kicked me, ill-used me very much, and left me in the road—they took from my pocket a knife, three sixpences, and one or two halfpence—I saw the prisoner on Saturday at Worship-street—I could not swear to his being one of the persons who robbed me, for I was smothered with mud and blood at the time—I believe he is one of the persons, but I was so ill-used I could not say—I was not sober, but I knew what I was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-binder, and live at No. 1, Old Nicol-street. On Friday night, the 17th of December, I was coming home rather late, and passing by Wentworth-street, I heard a great scuffle down the street—I turned down to see what it was, and saw two men shaking the prosecutor several times—after they shook him, they knocked him down three times—he got up, and asked them what they wanted—they said, "Your money, or your life"—he said he should not give it to them—they then knocked him down again, dragged him across the road, and told him, if he offered to halloo, they would have his life—I saw a policeman at the top of the street, and told him there was a man knocked down, and went with him to see—the two men were then gone—the prosecutor was standing on the edge of the curb—I had not known either of the two men before—the policeman went to two houses to look for them, he came back again, and, a few yards from the top of the street, I saw the prisoner and another man striking another man, near to where they were before—I showed them to the policeman—I am quite sure the prisoner is one of the men that had been striking the prosecutor—I told the policemen so, and they took him to the station—I was on the other side of the way when the two men were ill using the prosecutor, right opposite to them—it is not a very narrow street—a woman was standing at a door, with a candle in her hand, at the time they knocked him down—I saw the faces of the men, and am quite sure of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 89.) On Wednesday, the 17th of December, I was on duty, and heard a noise in Wentworth-street—I went towards it, and met Sarah Ward, who gave me some information, in consequence of which I went on with her, and met with the prosecutor—his face was all over blood and mud, and he was rising from the ground—I saw two women sitting on the right hand side of the street, in a door-way, not six yards from where I found the prosecutor—they had a lighted candle with them—I went in search of the persons—I returned in about twenty minutes to Brick-lane and saw the prisoner engaged in a scuffle at the top of Wentworth-street—Ward, who was along with me, pointed him out, and said in his hearing, that he was the person who knocked the man down, and helped to rob him—I went and took him—he said he was innocent—his side was all over mud, and on examining him at the station I found the left wristband of his shirt stained with blood and mod, quite fresh—I tore it off, and now produce it—I found 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, this handkerchief.</p>

               <p>women, and they both stood up at the door at the time of the scuffle—the prisoner had a cut on his hand, and he showed it before the Magistrate—it was on his right hand, and the cuff which was bloody and dirty was the left cuff—I do not know how old the wound was, but the Magistrate said it did not appear like a fresh wound then—I have known Sarah Ward about four years—my beat is in various parts in the district of the division—I do not think I ever served a month in Old Nicol-street, but about Hackney-road, Wentworth-street, and Monmouth-street—I never saw Ward in Wentworth-street—I have often seen her in other streets just the same as any other person, walking the streets casually as any other person, not more—I had not seen her on the night in question before this hap<lb></lb>pened—I had not seen her, perhaps, for a fortnight before—I took no notice of the girl—I might have met her in the street—I first knew her by her being a sweetheart of one of our men—that is between two and three years ago—I know the street she lives in, but not where she lives—I have often seen her out of a night, sometimes late and sometimes early—not so late as one or two o'clock, except on this night—I have seen her out as late as one o'clock before, alone, going along as any other person would—I have seen her walking along with other persons—whether accompanied by them or no I cannot say—I have not seen her walking with different men—I swear that positively—I never thought she was one of the sort you mean—I never said that I had known her for four years as a prostitute.</p>

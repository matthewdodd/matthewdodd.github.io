We brought him to Gravesend; I opened his box there, and found several of the things which were missing, but cannot particularize them; I remember seeing this brass tobacco-box there (produced in court;) the box was fastened up, and we left that there, and ordered it to be sent up by the Gravesend boat; we took the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030005"></xptr> with us, and brought him to Sir

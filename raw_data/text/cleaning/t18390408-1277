                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Feltham. I have man in, my service of the name of Holmes—I had some sheep in my field, and on Saturday, the 9th of March, I directed some trusses of tare hay to be conveyed to those sheep, from a stack on my premises—it had been cut while it was in flower, and there was a layer of clover placed in it—I seat twelve trusses to the field, and on the next morning I received intelli<lb></lb>gence, went to the field, and found four trusses were gone—I observed some remains of hay about the premises—I traced it a long distance—I spoke to Thorp, the constable, and put him upon the track—I went with him within 400 or 500 yards of the prisoner's house, which is about a mile from the field where the sheep were, and in the way that he carried the hay I saw the tracks of the tare hay all the way I went—the prisoner keeps a beer-shop—I went into his shed—I found the tare hay there, nearly all we had lost—they had pulled the trusses to pieces, and his horse was eating it at the time—there was a portion of the clover layer among it—my hay was cut in the flower, if it had been ripe the con would have been in the ears, but here are the ears, but no corn—I desired the constable to take the prisoner into custody—I saw the prisoner on Monday morning, the 11th of March, at my own house—I asked him how he came by it—he said he did not know any thing about it.</p>

I remember his ordering me to cut this tare hay for the sheep—I cut the trusses from the rick—I knew the stack had a layer of clover in it—I put these twelve trusses under the rick, and sent them the following afternoon, by a boy, to the sheep field—I afterwards saw the hay found in the prisoner's shed-it was the same that I had cut.</p>

On the Satur<lb></lb>day afternoon, I was in the field, and received twelve trusses of tare bay. which I put under the cart in which I sleep—I went to supper about five o'clock—the hay was all right then—there were ten trusses—I had given the sheep two, I came back again, about half-past eight, some trusses were then gone, but I could not tell how many, as it was then dark—I did not go to tell my master that night, because I was afraid somebody would come and steal the sheep if I did—I staid with the sheep all night, and told my master in the morning.</p>

The prosecutor came there on the 5th of April with the prisoner - he asked her what she would take; she said a glass of gin - he took a glass of porter, and they talked together; the prisoner came to my house next morning; two officers went by, and said to me, "Are you aware you have a pane of glass broken?" I said to the prisoner, "You must pay for that glass;" she said she had no money, but she would leave security, and she gave me the same watch which I gave to the officer.</p>

I was passing under Temple-bar, and saw the prisoner in company with two boys, following the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's left-hand coat-pocket, and put into his jacket on this side Temple-bar; I secured him, and took him up to Mr. Mason, who missed his handkerchief - I took it from the prisoner; his companions made their escape - I saw them again as I was taking the prisoner to Newgate, but could not take them; I should know one of them again - they were about his own age, they bade him Good bye! as we went along.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

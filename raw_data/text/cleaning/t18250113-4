            , JUN. I am a carpenter, and live at Brentford. On the night of the 9th of November, I locked up these tools in my father's work-shop (his name is Henry) and next morning missed them. On the 17th of December some of them were produced at Queen-square; the tool chest was wrenched open. The shop door must have been opened by a skeleton key.</p>

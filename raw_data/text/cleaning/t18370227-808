                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 38, East-street, Red<lb></lb>lion Square. On the 3rd of January the two prisoners occupied a furnished lodging at my house—they left on the 14th of February, saying they were going to Liverpool, on business—they were going that night to the Bull and Mouth, as they were going off next morning early—about half an hour after they left I missed two spoons, some glasses, decanters, and other things—on the 16th, two days afterwards, the elder prisoner called at my house to see if there was a letter come—I told her I had missed some things—she said she dare say they were taken away by is take, and if I would come the next day, I should have them—she did not say where they were gone to, but I had learnt where they were gone to, and I had got a constable from Hatton-garden: he came by my house at the time she was talking to me, and he and I followed her to where she went, which</p>

               <p>was No. 25, Hyde-street, Bloomsbury—I went into the house to the se<lb></lb>cond floor back room—the elder prisoner went in first, and the constable and I went in after her—I found the younger prisoner there, and a gentle<lb></lb>man named Cousins, the witness—he told me I ought to be ashamed of myself to bring a constable there to respectable people—he did not tell me who he was, but he used to visit at my house when they lodged there, and Miss Newman said he was her uncle, but not in his presence—he never said he was related to them—I said, I had missed my things—Miss New<lb></lb>man said I was welcome to look, as she had nothing at all belonging to me, and they opened some boxes—they left the room several times to go into the little room adjoining, and the younger prisoner told me to come into that room, and look myself—when I got into that room she opened a box or two, and pulled her things out, and asked me to look—the elder prisoner was present—I found nothing of mine in those boxes—the elder prisoner went out into the big room, and went out at the door to go into the passage, the officer fetched her back, and she had got the rummer con<lb></lb>cealed down by the side of her—I identified it directly as being mine—the younger prisoner said her mother had only taken it out to drink—I after-wards found one of my tumblers in a small box wrapped up in paper—the box stood in the large room—after that the officer told me to go and look in the bed-room, and I turned the bed things up—the decanter was rolled up in something, and put under the bed—when the things were found, the younger prisoner said, "By G—d the things are mine, I bought them at Liverpool"—Mr. Cousins was there at the time—he laid a sovereign down on the table in their presence for me to say no more about it—he said, I ought to be ashamed to bring an officer there to respectable people, and he did not think any thing of the kind had happened, and told me to take it and say no more, and that would pay me for my loss of my glasses—he did not say then, "Say no more about it."</p>

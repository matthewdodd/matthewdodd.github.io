When I got into the court she came up to me, put her hand into my pocket, and pulled out three one pound bank notes; she dropped one of them; I attempted to pick it up, and some women who were standing in the court pushed me a way; I saw the prisoner pick it up; I called the watch, a german came up; he called watch, the watchman came and immediately the prisoner ran away; I and the german and the watchman pursued her; the prisoner ran into a house and shut the door; I and the german went to St. Martin's watchhouse and got a constable; he knocked at the door and they opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the court - A. I do not know; it was a different court. They opened the door and we went up stairs; we looked into one room where there were some young women; the young women cried out, is it me; I knew it was not them. We went into another room and found her in bed; she then said she had never been out that night; no notes were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken any personal liberty with her - A. No; there were no more words passed than what I have spoke to you; she did not speak a word when she put her hand in my pocket, and she had her hand out so quick I could not stop her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the room where you found her in bed - A. Yes; the bed and the room was searched; we found no notes. I was perfectly sober. I had been to Knightsbridge barracks to see my brother-in-law's brother. I had only a share of a pot of porter that afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you knew her person before - A. I did; I am sure the prisoner is the person that ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get in the house - A. The door was made fast as soon as she went in; I advised them to go to the watchhouse and to bring the constable of the night; they did; the constable came and ordered the door to be opened; it was opened; we went in the house and found the prisoner in bed.</p>

I went in doors and came out again; there were six or eight women outside of the door; them I saw a piece of paper on the pavement, one of them stooped and picked it up; I went up stair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180004"></xptr>and did not hear any more about it till they came up, searched me and the room, and took me to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor up towards Templebar, and back again - the prosecutor was not sober, but was capable of walking and talking; in about a quarter of an hour I saw the prosecutor with a hat on, which I had seen Drover wear the same evening, and that caused suspicion; I took Hartin on the 13th of August - I had seen both the prisoners in company before, and knew they were associates.</p>
               <p>Hartin. Q. Did you not see the prosecutor stripped, in the act of fighting? A. I saw him taking off his coat; he was having an altercation with some person - I did not see you pick up his clothes from under feet.</p>
               <p>M - MOSES. I keep a clothes-shop. I bought this coat of Drover about half an hour before the officer came - there was some other man with him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Drover's Defence. The prosecutor took my hat off, put his hat on my head, and put mine on his head, to disguise himself, to go to fight a porter at the gate of the lun- the handkerchief was in his hat, and I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Hartin's Defence. I and a friend went into the public-house opposite the Angel Inn; I heard an altercation, went out, and saw the prosecutor fighting - the Policeman came up and separated them; he was beastly drunk: no man would have behaved as he did in his sober senses; the Policeman sent him towards Temple-bar, but he returned once or twice - I went into the public-house again, and he came in with his coat off, and Drover's hat on; the porter, and two female servants were in the house, having a glass of ale; the prosecutor insisted upon fighting the porter - the man behind the bar jumped over, and turned him out; a respectable person, who was with me, came to Bow-street, and proved that I was not out of his company till half-past eleven o'clock that night, but he was sent by the Scotch society to Scotland, the next day.</p>

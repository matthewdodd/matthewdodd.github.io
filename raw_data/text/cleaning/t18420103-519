                  </hi>. I am single, and carry on business in New Bond-street, as a milliner. On the 7th of November I received this letter, (No. 1)—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in an envelope, by the general-post—I had not at that time the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Colonel Hill personally—I for<lb></lb>warded, in answer, some patterns of velvets to Newport, in the Isle of Wight, according to the direction—on the 13th of November I received this letter (No. 2) by the post—in consequence of the receipt of this, I used expedition in getting the object of the writer, a velvet dress, of not less than seven breadths, prepared and forwarded to the Royal York Hotel, Southampton, addressed to" Mrs. Colonel Hill, Royal York Hotel, South<lb></lb>ampton," by the Southampton Railway—I sent it on Tuesday evening, the 16th of November—on the 13th I had also received this other letter, (No. 3)—this is the velvet dress—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—which I forwarded to Southampton—I afterwards received this other letter, (No. 4) pur<lb></lb>porting to come from Mrs. Colonel Hill, acknowledging the receipt of the dress, and saying it was approved of, and containing another order for a dress and a cloak, which I did not execute—I entertained some suspicion, and my brother went to Southampton—there was a bill of parcels for<lb></lb>warded with the velvet dress—the price of it was fifteen guineas—the box produced is the one in which the dress was sent—the direction was on a</p>

               <p>No. 2.—"Mrs. Colonel Hill will thank Miss Clapham to send her a dress of the enclosed velvet, provided it can be sent to her address, at the Royal York Hotel, Southampton, on Wednesday next; if it cannot, Mrs. Colonel Hill will decline it. Mrs. Hill sends a pattern enclosed, and is rather a stout figure. The number of breadths required will be at least seven."</p>
               <p>No. 3.—" Mrs. Colonel Hill, in her note of this morning, forgot to mention that a train is not required, and wishes it to be made as plain as possible, and her height is five feet four inches 3/4."</p>
               <p>No. 4.—" Mrs. Colonel Hill has received the velvet dress, which fits exceedingly well, and will thank her to send a fashionable gipsy walking cloak of black silk, with velvet trimmings, and a grot-de-Naples morning dress, on or before Friday next, with the account, and a remittance will be forwarded.</p>

                  </hi>. In November last I was one of the waiters at the Royal York Hotel, Southampton. On the 17th of November, the box produced arrived there by the railway—it was addressed to Colonel, or Mrs. Colonel Hill, at the Royal York Hotel—I delivered it to the prisoner on the same day it arrived—he had been there before, and asked for letters addressed to Colonel Hill, or Mrs. Colonel Hill, and had received two letters—when he came for this box, he came to the bar-door and said, "Is there anything addressed for me or Mrs. Colonel Hill?"—I said, "Who are you?"—he said, "I am Colonel Hill"—I said, "There is a box"—I de<lb></lb>live ed it to him, and he took it away.</p>

               <p>

Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that the first letter you would not speak to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it to be his writing—the fourth letter does not assume the character of the prisoner's handwriting so much as the others do—it is a different style of handwriting—in my judgment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are in his ordinary handwriting—there is nothing at all unusual or disguised about them.</p>

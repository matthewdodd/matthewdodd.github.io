On the 20th of May I was at Greenwich fair about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, and saw two gentlemen passing—the prisoner and another were following behind them—I saw the prisoner put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and take out this handkerchief—I seized him, and took it out of his hand, and told the gentleman—he wanted me to give him the handkerchief back—I asked him his name and address—he would not give me his name; but his friend gave me the name of "S. Ward, Knight Ryder-street, Doctors Commons"—I have been there—his friend lives there; but he refused to give me the name of the person who was robbed—it remains unknown to me—I found another silk handkerchief in the prisoner's pocket, with the mark of "M. Y. Z." on it.</p>

            : On Saturday I think the 11th of October, I missed some bed-lace; I bad seen it three or four hours before; there were about seventy-two yards of it (the bed-lace produced); there is no mark upon it, but I believe it to be the same; there was a small piece out off, which has been matched since.</p>
               <p>JOSHEPH BUNTER sworn. - I work for Mr. Walker, in Shoreditch: Last Saturday fortnight the prisoner came in, and asked if I would buy any bed-lace; my mistress came out, and asked him what he asked for it; he said, what will you give me for it; she asked him how many yards there were, and he said he did not know; the said, it was extraordinary he should not know the length; he said he had swapped for it in the country: she asked him where, and he would not tell where; she said, she thought it was not honesty come by, Office, and have it advertised; she stopped the lace, and told him to go about his business; he would not go without the lace, and I went to the Officer, and brought an officer; while the lace and the man were gone to the Office, Mr. Walker went to Mr. Ranshall's which was just accoss the street; he brought a piece of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ranshull. I did not miss it till Mr. Walker came for the pattern, and I gave him a piece, which tallied with the piece I had missed: it had been lying loose upon the counter; I had been it about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Bunter. It was about six when he brought the lace to me; I was just shutting the shop up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not hear the prisoner striking the shilling on the counter - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not speak about a jacket, or ask to purchase any thing - A. I did not charge him at first with taking a half crown piece. I sell jackets, but none was shown to him; he talked about one afterwards, I told him I would take him to Queen-square; he dropped three sixpences and the shilling. I saw him searched, and 7 l. 9 s. 6 d. was found on him. I have seen him at my shop purchasing before; I am positive that no conversation passed about his buying a jacket.</p>

I was going down the Broadway and saw a jacket marked 9 s. 6 d., and went into the shop to buy it; I knocked on the counter with a shilling; it dropped at the end of the counter, and I then saw half a crown on the floor; this gentleman came and accused me of taking money from the till.</p>

I met him in Park-lane; I went down the mews with him - he gave me 1s., and staid with me about five minutes; he then said I had robbed him of three half-crowns; I said I had only one half-crown; he called the watchman, and said I had given him two half-crowns, and if I did not give him the other he would give charge of me - as we were going along, the prosecutor said if I would give him 3s. he would let me go, that he would give 3d. to the watchman, and should do the same and go away.</p>

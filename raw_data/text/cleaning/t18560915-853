                  </hi>. I am a glass engraver, of Charles-street, Grosvent square. On the night of 8th Sept., about 12o'clock or half past, I was walking up Bruton-street, Berkeley-square, turned under an archway for a necessary purpose, and Garrett came up to me (I was sober)—he put his arms round my throat, compressed it, and pulled me on my back on the ground—I saw my watch chain safe when I went there—it was an Albeit chain, through my button hole—while my throat was being pressed, Mur<lb></lb>phy came up, looked me in the face, and then knocked me over the eyes and mouth while Garrett held me—I was half down, there were gas light on each side, one in Bruton-street and the other by the Mews, sufficient to enable me to see a person's face—Murphy took hold of my chain, and snapped it off; I both saw and felt him do it—some police officers came to my assistance, and when the prisoners heard them coming, one of them left me, and Murphy was walking away when a policeman caught hold or him—they were both taken within half a dozen yards of where it happened—I this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the piece of my chain.</p>

On the night of the 7th instant, at a quarter past 12 o'clock (I had been to see some relations at Marylebone in the afternoon), I was crossing Oxford-street to go home to Westminster, when I heard a noise; I went down the street where the noise was, when I was surrounded by several policemen; one caught me by the collar, and began to strike and ill-use me very badly; I asked them not to ill-use me, and I would go with them quietly if they had anything against me; the</p>

               <p>prisoner Garrett, on arriving at the station house, made a statement that I was not the party who had been with him, and that I was an innocent man, and that his mate had escaped; now, my Lord and gentlemen, this is a very hard case against me; I happened, as I have told you, to be unfortunately in the neighbourhood at the time, and was taken into custody, but that is no reason why I am guilty.</p>

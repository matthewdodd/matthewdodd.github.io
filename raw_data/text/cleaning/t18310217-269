            . I am a Police-constable. I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner run about twenty yards before I caught her; the prosecutor said she had robbed him of a sovereign, and a bag - the flap of his breeches was undone, and the knees muddy: I found the handkerchief on the prisoner, a sixpence, and 4d. in copper; the prosecutor was the worse for liquor, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH McGURRIN. This handkerchief was in my coat pocket - I did not give it to her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor, who was intoxicated, had followed her, endeavouring to prevail on her to accompany him, but that she had not robbed him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 11th of October I saw Mr. Berckemyer coming towards St. Martin's-le-grand; the prisoner was near him - I followed him as far as Butcherhall-lane; he kept near the prosecutor, who stopped at the corner of the lane, at a bookseller's - the prisoner was close behind him; some carts passed, and I being on the other side, could not see, but suspecting something, I went to the prosecutor, and from what he said, I went after the prisoner, and saw him crossing from St. Martin's-le-grand, shoving something into his breeches: I stopped him, and said he had something which did not belong to him; he said he had nothing: I believe another person was with him: I searched him, and at the back of his smallclothes, found a handkerchief, with Mr. Berckemyer's initials on it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along and saw the handkerchief fall, but did not see who dropped it; I picked it up; a young lad said he had a right to half - I said I wanted one, and if there was any thing in the newspaper about it I would return it.</p>

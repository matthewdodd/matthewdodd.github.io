On the 13th of April, I was down in the kitchen, my mistress called me to mind the door, it was on a jar; I came up stairs to go into the parlour, I saw the prisoner walking across the passage, he had the things under his left arm, and with his right hand tried to pull the street door after him; I called out, stop him; he turned to the right, and went down the street; I ran after him; he throwed down the clothes; I still followed him; he turned the corner, and went into a public house, I went in after him, he was trying to get into one of the boxes in the parlour; I caught hold of him and told him he had been robbing the house; he denied it; I told him he should go to the watchhouse to be searched; he begged me to let him go, he wanted to go and see his uncle in Oxford-road. A neighbour came in, he took him back to our shop; he denied it there, and said he had not been in the house; I never lost sight of him until he was put into the hands of the constable.</p>

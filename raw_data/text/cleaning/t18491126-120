                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, at 9, Knightsbridge-terrace. On 19th Oct. last, at nearly half-past twelve o'clock, I was standing behind my counter, and the prisoner Rolls called me to the door, and asked me to tell him the price of three dressing-glasses that were placed outside one of my shop-windows, on an elevated step from the pavement—I saw no one with him—I went out, and he asked me the price of the glasses, and kept me talking for two or three minutes—there were no prices marked on them—he asked me the price of all—he said he dare say that either this or that (pointing to two of them) would suit, but he would bring his <hi rend="italic">old woman</hi> in the evening, and have one—I told him I had a great many more inside the shop, and 1 thought I might be enabled to sell him one then, and I induced him to enter the shop with me—I think I stepped on one side, and be went in, and I followed him—I took a dressing-glass from off a chair, and placed it on the counter, and at that moment 1 saw a row of gold watches in a different window to the one we had been out to, swinging about; it was not an open window—my shop stands at the corner of two streets; the door is at the corner, and one window in each street; it is immediately opposite the Albert-gate and Mr. Hudson's house—the looking-glasses were in the window in front of William-street, and the watches in the window looking into the Knightsbridge-road—the watches were in motion, as if the string was shaken; they were in full swing, giving strong evidence of having been recently disturbed—I discovered two tickets swinging without the watches, and this ticket, which I produce, had disappeared, with a gold watch, altogether—that ticket was found behind the counter—I missed three watches—a person behind the counter could get to the Knightsbridge-terrace window—whoever robbed me of the watches robbed my till also, and this ticket was found close behind the counter where the till was—the till was robbed at the same time I lost the watches—a person would have to go behind the counter to get at the watches—I have a key to the till, but never keep it locked during the day—it was a long distance from where the watches hung—the till was at the extreme end of the counter—when I saw the watches swinging, Rolls was in the shop—I said, "I have been robbed," and ran out in an agitated manner, and returned again, thinking I might see something, and on my return a man told me, in Rolls's presence, he was just at the door; that he had seen him in company with another man, and advised me not to let him go—I left the shop again, and returned, and the prisoner had then gone some distance across William-street, nearly as far as the shop on the other side of the way—I told</p>

               <p>him I could not part with him, and brought him back to my shop—I had left him in the custody of my wife in the shop: there was no opportunity for robbing the till then—the man who had. advised me went and brought a policeman—the prisoner was taken to the police-office—after I returned from the examination my man asked me if I had paid the money away, as there was none in the till, and I then found the till empty of the gold—I am certain there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the morning—I did not miss any silver; there was nearly 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth—the gold was kept in a bag, and the silver in a wooden bowl—the gold bag was not gone, hut there was no gold in it—the shop forms part of my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square.</p>

On 19th Oct., about half-past twelve, I was standing at the corner of William-street, in Knightsbridge, opposite the Albert Gate, about three yards from Mr. Killick's shop—I saw both the prisoners together—they passed by me abreast, went about six yards from me on the kerb, and stood together five or six minutes, about two yards and a half from Mr. Killick's shop, with their backs towards it, like men in conversation together—they then turned round and looked hard at me, as if they knew something of me—I had never seen them before, but I stared at them—I then saw Rolls turn to his left and go to Mr. Killick's door, and King walked leisurely towards the window in Knightsbridge as a person going to look at anything—I saw Mr. Killick come out and go with Rolls to look at some glasses under the window in William-street, and while they were so doing, I saw King walk leisurely into the shop, as a person going in to buy—I should say he might have been in a minute ora minute and a half, I cannot say exactly when I saw him come out, and he turned to his right and walked off at a brisk pace towards Hyde Park-comer—in about a minute I saw Mr. Killick go into his shop and Rolls follow him—he had been in the shop about a minute or a minute and a half, when I saw him come out again and run into the next shop in a frightened manner, like a man excited—he appeared alarmed, as if something was the matter with him—as he ran out I said, "Is anything amiss?" but he did not hear me—when he came out of the shop again, Rolls was outside—I said,</p>

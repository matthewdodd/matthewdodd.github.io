On the 1st of August, in the afternoon, I went to a field adjoining the church; there I saw the church had been stripped of a quantity of lead: a soldier took me to a ditch; I found the lead lay there. I and several of the inhabitants watched from half past nine at night till half past eleven. While I was watching with

            , I heard a cart come into a bye-lane, opposite of where the lead lay. About ten minutes after I heard the cart, I saw a man come into the ditch; he took a piece, and threw it on the bank; he threw out another, and then he put it on his shoulder, and was going across the field with it. Then I sprang the rattle, and all came that were on the watch, and Wood took him. The lead was compared with the lead on the roof; it tallied; I have no doubt but it was the lead. There was about four hundred pound weight in the whole.</p>

            , a bricklayer, came to my house for me to go to Finchley to bring some apples that he had there. When I came to the White Lion, he told me to wait there; I thinking the delay too long, went on to meet him. He told me that he had not got the apples, but he had got something in a field there. I went with him, imagining it was his own, and that he was responsible for the act. I went for it. The people sprang a rattle, and fired a pistol.

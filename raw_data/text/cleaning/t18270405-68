On the 29th of March, about eleven o'clock in the morning, a young man informed me that a paper of gloves was removed from a recess - I searched, and found them secreted on a form which was suspended from the ceiling of the cellar - there were sixteen pairs in the paper; I marked three or four pairs, and also the paper, and at five o'clock in the afternoon I found they were moved. I found the prisoner in custody at half-past five, with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Simpson? A. Five months - he has no partner. The gloves were not laid in the recess to see if any body would take them.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out between five and six o'clock - I pushed him up a passage, and took out of his breeches this parcel of gloves; he said he had picked them up behind the counter.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

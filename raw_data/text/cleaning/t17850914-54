               <p>On the 16th of July last, about five, I was informed my master's stable door was open, I went and I missed four geese of mine, and one of Mr. Weston's a neighbour; on the Monday following I heard there were two men stopped at Islington, with some geese; I lost them on Saturday there were three grey ones, and two white ones, and one of the grey ones had a white wing, I have had some of them near a twelvemonth, two were young ones, I heard of them at Mr. Lack's, the constable at Islington, he shewed me the geese, and I was sure they were mine.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday morning the 16th of July I saw the two prisoners at the bar, coming down what they call the back road Islington, with two sacks on their backs; by their appearance I thought they looked disorderly, I stopped and they passed by me, I looked after them, and there was a foot of something hanging out of one of their sacks, so I looked after them, and this Broome had something rolling in his sack I stopped them and they put down their sacks, I opened one, there were three geese in it, I did not open the other's sack then, so I took them to Mr. West of Islington, a cow-keeper, they said they would go with me where I liked, they said they bought the geese in Holloway, of a waggoner, who was going into the country, so I had them committed; in the other sack there were two geese, and two pieces of iron, a kind of a crow.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the colour of these? - I did not take particular notice, Lufkin came, the Tuesday following, and claimed the geese, and swore to them before Justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>At what time was it on Saturday that you saw this? - At five in the morning.</p>

               <p>I went to Highgate to see a sister of mine, that lived at the Red Lion, she was gone away, and had been gone two months; I got a lodging in the town, and this young man was there, and he said he was coming to London in the morning; we both got up in the morning, at about a mile out of Highgate, we met a farming man with geese, and I bought three, and this young man bought two, and he gave us a bag each of us, to put them in.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, I dined with Sir Lumley Skeffington, in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square. I quitted his house at about nine o'clock in the evening, for the purpose of going to the Haymarket Theatre; Sir Lumley accompanied me part of the way; I went through the Green Park, down Constitution Hill, where Sir Lumley quitted me. Just as I got to the <placeName id="t18150913-60-crimeloc337">Queen's gate</placeName>

He said, my name is Manners, and I wish to speak to you. I told him, he must be mistaken, and desired him to leave me immediately. He then said, he was in great distress, and he wanted some money, which I refused to give him, having never seen him in my life before. He then seized me by the collar of the coat, and said, unless you give me some, I will accuse you with having attempted to commit an unnatural crime upon me, and will follow you to your own house. I was not at all alarmed; but told him to follow me quietly into Pall Mall, and I would borrow some money of a friend, as I had none about me. I had money about me, he said so, and the first watchman I met was just at Hammersley's the banker's, to whom I gave him in charge. He then begged pardon, and begged to be let go. I went with him to the watchhouse, and there when I had given in my charge, the prisoner dropped upon his knees, and entreated me over and over again to let him go. I was determined however not to let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was one night, about this time twelvemonth, sitting in the stage box at Covent Garden Theatre, when Captain Parker came in, and fell into conversation with me; after the play was over, he went and spent the evening with me, at the King's Head coffee-house, just by Furnival's-inn, in Holborn, and I paid five and thirty shillings for him, as his share of the reckoning, and this evening, I was in the Green Park, he met me as he was walking with Sir Lumley, and said, how do you do, Manners, where have you been all this time; I told him, I was in very great distress, and would thank him to let me have the money that he owed me, but he said, he could not speak to me then, as I was dressed so shabbily, and Sir Lumley Skeffington was with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Since the prisoner has dared to set up a defence of this kind, I must go farther in proof.</p>

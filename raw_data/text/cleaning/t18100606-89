               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Dodd that day - A. I did not. As I was standing there, between two and three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners come out from among the people, and go into Westminster hall, I knew them both; I called to Preston, and desired him to walk to the hall door to watch them.

            's left hand, and it seemed as if he was counting them; there was no other person near them within a dozen or twenty yards, they had taken a circular walk round the hall, and where they were there was no company. I directed Preston at the door to take hold of Joseph, whom I pointed to, and that I would take hold of Solomon; I put myself inside of the door, and that moment I was seen by Joseph, he turned round and ran away towards the Court of King's Bench; Preston pursued Joseph and secured him, just as he had got up the second or third step leading into the Court of King's Bench; Solomon stood still, I took hold of him; I said, I had no doubt that something wrong had been done, I must search him. Preston had got hold of Joseph, at that moment I saw Joseph attempting to put something in his mouth, which I suspected was the notes, I called out do not let him eat the notes; Preston said, he has nothing in his mouth, and brought him up to me. Joseph refused being searched by Preston, and said, Vickrey shall search me, he has known me a good while, and whatever he finds he will return me. As I was searching Solomon, I perceived something strike me on the toe.</p>

               <p>Q.At the time that this struck you on the toe, were there any person near you and Solomon, excepting Preston and Joseph - A. Neither of them were near enough at that time, but there were a number of people collected round. I picked up the book, it opened by falling, and the papers fell on the ground, it was this pocket book with the papers it now contains; I searched Solomon further, in his fob pocket I found four one pound bank notes; in his right hand coat pocket I found a one pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060048"></xptr>bank note, with a number of loose papers, and a lottery bill; in his left hand breeches pocket I think there were eight dollars, which were returned to him all except two. I searched Joseph, I found nothing in his pockets; I attempted to take off his neckhandkerchief, he refused, said no man should take that off, I took it off; in his neckcloth was a thirty pound bank note; between his shirt and his neck, a five pound bank note, and in the same place a two pound note. I then took them up to the office in Bow-street. In the pocket book there is a banker's check, payable at sight; Mr. Dodd has sworn to it; and a bill for goods sold and delivered to Mr. Dodd, outside it is endorsed, Mr. Dodd, Eltham, that led me to find Mr. Dodd out; I sent word down by the stage coachman that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Solomon near enough to you for the book to fall from him - A. We were close together face to face, there was only room for my hand to be in his pocket between him and me.</p>

            . I am one of the patrol of Bow-street. On this day, when the electors of Westminster met in Palace yard, between two and three o'clock, Vickrey came to me, I was standing near the hall door, he said, there were two men, noted characters, gone into the hall, he desired me to see in what part of the hall they were, I looked, and saw the two prisoners in company together. I was told by Vickery to walk towards them, they were looking at something, which appeared to me to be bank notes; Joseph had the notes, and when I got within two or three yards of the two prisoners, Joseph looked towards the door and ran, he ran towards the Court of King's Bench steps, I catched him; and Vickery cried out, mind, he is eating the notes; I clapped my hand to his jaw bone, he opened his mouth; he had nothing in his mouth; I said to Vickery, if it is any where it is in his neck. I brought him to Vickery; Joseph delivered to me eight shillings, I asked him if he had no notes, he gave me a one pound note out of his hand. I was ordered by the magistrate to give him the one pound note and the eight shillings. I was going to untie his neck-handkerchief, he resisted, said he would not be searched by me, Vickery should search him, as he had known him: I told him I would indulge him; I kept hold of him while Vickery searched Solomon. On Vickery's searching Solomon, to the best of my recollection he was unbuttoning his waistcoat, I saw a pocket book shop from some part of Solomon's person, and the papers flew about, they were picked up by Vickery. I held Solomon while Vickery searched Joseph; Vickery untied Joseph's neck handkerchief, and there took out some notes between his shirt collar and his neck. I accompanied Vickery to the office with the prisoner's, and Mr. Dodd appeared on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dodd. Look at the pocket-book, is that the pocket book of which you were possessed that day - A. Yes, and here are some memorandums I can swear to, here is an order for payment in my favour, it was in my pocket book when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the notes which Vickrey took from Joseph - A. The thirty pound note, I had not taken the number of that note, I traced the number, Mr. Lloyd is her from whom I had it.</p>
               <p>MR. LLOYD. Q. Look at that note and say whether you know it - A.On the 11th of April I received thirty pound bank note for a check.</p>

I did not observe whether the note had any writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dodd. Did you observe at the time that you received the thirty pound note of Mr. Lloyd, whether there was any writing on it - A.

               <p>MR. MORRIS. Q. Look at that five pound note, do you recollect paying Mr. Dodd the five pound note - A.

            . Q. Were you present when these men were in custody of Vickrey and Preston - A. I was present at the time Vickrey told Preston to go towards Joseph, he advanced towards Joseph; Solomon was perfectly composed when Vickrey took him in custody. Preston took Joseph and brought him to Vickrey, he was searched, and I saw something taken from his collar, which I supposed to be Bank notes. During the investigation I saw a pocket book fall at the foot of Solomon.</p>
               <p>Joseph's Defence. I was coming along the bridge to Westminster I picked this book up, and looking at it I put the notes in my neck for safety, and the next morning I intended to look in the newspapers to see if they were advertised. I meaned to restore them to the owner if they were advertised.</p>
               <p>Solomon's Defence. On the 17th of April curiosity led me to go the Westminster Meeting. I had not been in the crowd two minutes, the crowd was so great I ran out for fear of being hurt. I proceeded to Westminster-hall, and I had not been there one minute before somebody catched hold of me Vickrey searched me, and found five pound notes, which was my own property, seven dollars and half a crown, and a cork-screw, and papers that I took coming along. I had no conversation with any one, nor had I any intention of committing a felony whatever. I am quite innocent of this business. I never had the pocket book in my possession; I was before Vickrey, and Preston behind me, I do not know how he could see me drop a pocket book, Mr. Vickrey and I being face to face, if I had dropped it, surely he must have seen the drop it.</p>

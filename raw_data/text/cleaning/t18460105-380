On Saturday morning, the 3rd Jan., I was on duty in Cow-lane, about forty or fifty yards from the Ship public-house—while there I heard a whisparing over a wall, which induced me to watch—shortly after I heard a rustling, like the getting over a fence, and I heard some one say, "Be careful, don't break the glass"—I listened still till they appeared to come into a shed on the other side of the wall—I went and fetched some other constables—the yard belongs to the prisoner Breeson's father—I got up on the fence, turned my light on, and saw the prisoner Breeson come from behind a cart in the shed—I jumped over the fence to see who it was—he said, "It is all right, master; I sleep here; there is no one here but myself"—I took hold jf him, and handed him into the custody of a constable—I then searched further, and found the prisoner, Cun<lb></lb>ningham, sitting in one of the swing-boats they use at fairs, with his arm lean<lb></lb>ing on a peppermint show-bottle—he said, "It is all right, sir; I am just come in; I sleep here with Breeaon"—after placing him in the custody of another constable, I went behind the cart that Breeson came from, and there I discovered this coat, in the pockets of which were these six brass taps, a parcel of tobacco, and some pieces of old brass; and close to the coat I found ibis small dark-lantern.</p>

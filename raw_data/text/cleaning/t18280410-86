            . I am a baker, and deal with Mr. Doubleday. I paid the prisoner five guineas for him on the 7th of November - he gave me this receipt, but I did not see him write it.</p>
               <p>MR. DOUBLEDAY. On the 11th of September the prisoner paid me no money, but on the 12th he paid me 10l., for Mr. Vasey; on the 3d of November he has entered 10l., for Mr. Cutmore, and on the 24th he paid me 2l. for Mr. Haydon; he has never accounted to me for the balance: he left me on the 8th of December - I had spoken to him a day or two before, respecting an account which was incorrect, and he left me on that day, without notice. On the 10th of December I received a long letter from him, begging me to take him again into my service, and offering to allow part of his wages to pay me the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence. stating that if there was any deficiency in his accounts, it was owing to his being compelled to drink at different public-houses, in order to get orders - that he was frequently intoxicated, and might have been robbed when so.</p>

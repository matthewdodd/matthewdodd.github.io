The prisoner is a settled pensioner there—I ordered his mother to procure a suit of clothes for one of my son's who was twelve years old—she brought them to me—I then told her to take them house, and bring the boy down to me on Monday, that I might take him down to Mr. Buttress's manufactory—she returned to me in the afternoon, and said that they were stolen.</p>

I know the nature of an oath I recollect my mother having a new corderoy jacket and trowsers—she put them on the table in the room on the ground floor—our house is in Islington—I saw my brother, the prisoner, there—he saw the clothes—he asked where my mother was gone—I told him she was gone out—he then mended his own jacket, and took the new suit of clothes, and went across the field—he did not bring them back.</p>

            . On the 5th of September, in the evening, Count and Steadman came to my house in a chaise, and told me their master's son had been robbed a little before, and desired me to go with them; I got my horse and pistol, and followed the chaise; we turned into the duke of Bedford's road; then I turned back again, and met these men coming up the New Road; I passed them, and went on to Gray's-inn-lane-road; there I saw three young men; they went through the rails into the road; they swore several oaths that a carriage was coming, and that they intended to rob it; I went up the road as if I would go into Gray's-inn-lane; when I got out of their sight, I dismounted by the new houses, and walked up towards the three men, and made my horse serve as a screen to me, till I came within about twenty yards of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Plenius. No, it was moon light; it grew lighter and lighter. I heard them say they would attack that chaise that was coming up the New Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Plenius. I do not know; they said in case they should be attacked, they would fire and would kill. They went towards the chaise; I followed them till they turned round the corner of Gray's-inn-lane Road up into the New Road, where the chaise came up; one of them went in the foot path, another on the outside of the posts, and the third, which is the prisoner, went into the middle of the road; he in the foot path was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177212090015"></xptr> Murphy; he was a little before the other; he went round the chaise; Earle came on the other side and the prisoner stopped the horses; I mounted my horse by the turnpike that goes to Pancras; the chaise came toward the turnpike; I went further up to the right of the road; I saw them attack the chaise, and heard them demand their money; I waited a little to see if the young men delivered their money; there were some words between them; I rode up to them; Earle lay upon the ground, and Lewis and Murphy were together; Earle cried out, d - n your eyes, fire! and Lewis to the best of my knowledge fired, and then I fired at him; when they found I had fire arms they run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish with certainty whether Lewis or Murphy fired?</p>
               <p>Plenius. No; one of them did. One of them was taken by Count; I followed the other two; Murphy got through the rails into the field; I could not go after him; I followed Lewis; I kept him from the rails, and some persons that followed us on foot secured him: he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>- Steadman.

             and I were in the chaise; we were attacked by three men.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Plenius to you when you were attacked?</p>
               <p>Steadman. I believe a hundred yards or upwards; I did not see him; he went before us, came back, and returned again; one of the men took hold of each side the horse, and demanded our money; I asked if it was money they wanted; they said, yes. I chopped at Murphy with my hanger, and cut him on the shoulder. I saw the little one (Earle) then, and cut him down; the other attempted to fire, but the pistol did not go off; he run back: there were some people behind; I called out to them, Stop him, that is one of them! and Lewis was taken; I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not swear to his person?</p>
               <p>Steadman. He is the person to the best of my judgement but I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a firing from one I believe?</p>
               <p>Steadman. Mr. Plenius I believe fired; I heard report, I thought it then at a great distance from us, I could not be positive who fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Plenius says one fired first?</p>
               <p>Steadman. I am positive that pistol did not go off; I saw no more than a flash in the pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hinchcliffe's watch ever found?</p>
               <p>Steadman. No.</p>

            . I was in the chaise; we were attacked by three men; one held the horse's head, and the other two came, one on each side of the chaise, with pistols in their hands, and demanded our money; Steadman said what do you want? they said money; he said it is our money is it, and struck one down; with that we both got out of the chaise directly; he got to Earle, and struck him in the head, upon which Earle cried out, d - n your eyes, fire! why don't you fire? upon that a pistol flashed in the pan, but did not go off; then he threw the pistol away and ran off; Steadman halloo'd out, Stop him, that is one of them! in consequence of which he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. to Plenius. How long after Steadman and Count had acquainted you that Hinchcliffe had been robbed was this attack made?</p>
               <p>Plenins. The highest time might be half an hour, from the time of their coming to me till the chaise was attacked.</p>
               <p>Q. About what o'clock was it when you fired?</p>
               <p>Plenius. About nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Earle in the other trial say something about the watch?</p>
               <p>Plenius. Yes; he said Murphy who got off had the watch.</p>

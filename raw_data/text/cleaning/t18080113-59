            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 4th of this month, going up Bethnal Greenroad I met Ives near his own house; I took charge of him, and took him to his house; I asked him if he had any deals brought him within these two or three days; his answer was that he had none. He has got two small yards, I looked over the first yard; there was none there that Mr. Weston knew; we went a little further from his dwelling house, looking over there there was one Mr. Weston knew was his property; I asked him how he got that, he said it was brought him to be sawed by a person, he could not tell where that person lived; I then asked him if he had not sold a deal that morning: he hesitated for sometime, he then said he had sold one; he told me it was brought by a person that he thought he could make free with to sell it for him. I put my mark on them; this is the deal I received from Ridley, and the other is just here.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified</p>
               <p>Houndle's Defence. On the 4th of January, as I was going to work, between seven and eight o'clock, I met a man with two deals; he asked me if I knew any body that could cut him a deal; I shewed him this yard, he pitched them there; I went down and spoke to the boy, I said is your master going to cut these deals for the man; I did not know where the man got the deals; I did not bring them.</p>
               <p>Ives's Defence. I was in bed when these deals were delivered in my yard; the boy did not say they were brought by Houndle.</p>

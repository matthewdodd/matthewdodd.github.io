                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Horatio Wilson Scott and Mr. Wright, man's mercers, in Glasshouse-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. It is the dwelling-house of Mr. Scott—he lives in it, and no one else—on Friday, the 6th of June, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning, I took down the shutters and cleaned the shop out—I afterwards shut the door, and went to the back part of the shop—Judd came in in about a minute and a half, and told me something, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I looked in the front part of the shop, and missed a brown paper parcel, containing three pieces of velvet, worth about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen it safe in the shop after I shut the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Cox, of Glasshouse-street. On the morning of the 6th of June, about eight o'clock, I was standing in front of the shop which is next door to Mr. Scott's, and saw the prisoner come by Mr. Scott's and walk by our house—I was looking at him—he turned back, and went right into Mr. Scott's shop—the door was shut—he opened it—he had nothing with him when he went in—I saw him come out again in about a minute and a half, with a brown paper parcel in his hand, and go down Vine-street—I followed him—after he had got a little way he looked round, saw me looking, and ran away with the parcel in his hand—I lost sight of him—I gave information to Uridge.</p>

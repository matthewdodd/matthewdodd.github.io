                  </hi>. I am a tobacco pipe maker, and live in Cornwall-street, Mile End-road—the prisoner is my brother-in-law. On 16th May, about half past 11 o'clock, I was at my father's house, 25, West-street, and saw the prisoner there—he was in liquor, but knew very well what he was about—he was <hi rend="italic">heaving</hi> stones at my father's door and shutters—I went out to get some beer for supper, and he began using abusive language, and throwing stones at me—I came back with the beer, and more stones were thrown, and at last one very large one was thrown, and my father went out to give the prisoner into custody—he ran away, and during the time we were going up the street we met a policeman, and my father gave him in charge—I was with my father, and was going to point him out, and during that time the prisoner came back again, ran across the road, and said, "I have you, you b----take that," and laughed—I was stabbed in the groin—my bowels were disarranged, and I was obliged to put my hand to keep them from coming out—I did not see anything in his band—after that he attempted to strike my head, but my father struck his hand down, and it came by my ear and inflicted a cut—I called out to my father that he had a knife, but I could not halloo very loud, and he did not hear me—I managed to get in doors, and found myself bleed<lb></lb>ing very much—I had not quarrelled with him—I have had a few words with him, but nothing to any effect—I was taken to the London Hospital, and remained there seven weeks—I sometimes feel the effects of the wound in the groin now—the wound on my head is healed—I believe I was in great dan<lb></lb>ger for some time while in the hospital—I was not able to come out at all during the seven weeks—I can do a little work now, but I cannot do a hard day's labour.</p>

               <p>at the door he said, "Come out you old b----and I will give you something for yourself"—after that more stones were thrown, and I went out with my son—I got a policeman, and the prisoner ran away—he came back again, we went across the road to him, and he stood behind my son, and said to my son, "I have caught you now, take that you b----"—I did not see anything in his hand, but he aimed a blow at my son in the groin, and was about to repeat it on his head, when I knocked his hand down, and it slid down his head—I did not know he had any knife—my son bled, he fell and went in doors—the prisoner then turned upon me—I did not see any knife in his hand, but one was afterwards produced—the prisoner had been drinking, but ought to have been sober by that time, he had been annoying us three hours—I have had no quarrel with him, and have no bad feeling towards him—I know my son had had no quarrel with him that day—my son was taken to the hospital, and I remained there some time.</p>

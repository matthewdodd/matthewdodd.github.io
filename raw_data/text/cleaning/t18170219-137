On the 27th of January, I let the prisoner my top room-the articles stated in the indictment were let with the lodging. He left the house between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the first week, without giving me notice or paying his rent. I missed the property out of his room, and he was taken the same day.</p>

            . I work at Mr. Bryan's, trunk-maker, Ludgate-hill. On the 5th of February, about a quarter after nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked if he might leave the things there till four o'clock. I never saw him before. I gave him leave, and he went away. At a quarter before one, he came for them. - I had got the officer in attendance at the time; he asked the prisoner if the property was his; he said it was, and that he had brought it from an hotel. The officer said he would go with him. There was a French grammar among the things, which had the prosecutor's name in it.</p>

            . I am officer. I waited in Mr. Bryan's shop-the prisoner came in; I asked him who the property belonged to-he claimed it, and said he brought it from an hotel. I desired him to shew me the hotel - He took me to the Swan with two Necks. I found he had been there, but they knew nothing about him. I secured him, and found Mr. Deckman out, by his name being in the grammar.</p>

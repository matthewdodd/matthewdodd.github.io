On the 12th of April my servant came up to me, and said a young fellow was below with a message from Mr. Poultney, or some such name, to know if he was to have my company that morning; I told him I had no engagement with a person of that name. I went down in about two minutes after, and asked where the man was; I was told he was gone. My servant asked me how many coats I had that hung in the hall; I said there were four: she said there were two taken away. I looked and missed them; I gave them over for lost. Some time after this I found there was a man in Clerkenwell Bridewell for stealing great coats and hats, this was about a fortnight ago; I went to see him, it was the prisoner; I asked him if he remembered any thing of stealing two great coats from my house; he told me, if I chose to go to Justice Girdler where he had made his confession, I might hear of them. I went there, and found he had made a confession of stealing my two coats in particular, describing my house; the Justice told me I might go back and ask him any questions I thought proper. I went back to him; he was very open, and said he had taken the two coats, and directed me to two pawnbrokers where he had pawned them; I went by his direction and found them.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BARTON sworn. - I am a bricklayer, employed by Mr. Bolt, in taking some copper from a gutter fixed upon a store-cellar, near Mr. Cator's brewhouse, as it was formerly; I had information that some copper had been stopped, and carried to the Justice's office; I went to the office, and saw it; I then took it to the place, and it fitted exactly; I missed it the 28th of August; I saw it the same day at the office.</p>
               <p>JAMES FITZGERALD sworn. - I am a watchman of the parish of St. Luke's: On the 28th of August, a little after two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner turn up Hartshorn-court with a bundle; I instantly ran up Cowheel-alley, and met him at the top of the court; he had hid himself behind a piece of marble that stood at a stonemason's door; he drew back, and ran; I followed him; I got very close to him, when he turned about, and threw a piece of copper at me, which knocked me down, and prevented my taking him; I took the copper to the watch-house; he was not taken till the 23d of October; I am sure he is the same man, I knew him before. (Produces the copper.)</p>
               <p>Barton. This is Mr. Bolt's copper.(

               <p>Prisoner. He has drank with me several times since, and always said I was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Fitzgerald.) Is that true? - A. No, it is not; when my partner and I met him on the 23d of October, he stopped us, and asked us to drink with him, and we would not; we knew we were not strong enough to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not two of you? - A. No, it was more than six could do to take him.</p>

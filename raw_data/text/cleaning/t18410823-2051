                  </hi>. I live in Kingsland-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and am a surgeon. On Monday, the 12th of July, a little after ten o'clock, I was sitting in my shop, and saw two per<lb></lb>sons looking in at the window twice—I shortly after got up, put out two gas-lights in the window, went round the counter, and told the boy to put up the shutters—after he had put up two or three, and was gone down stairs for another, I heard something fall on the pavement—I went out, found a pane of glass broken, and some scent-bottles removed, and eight gone—I had looked at the window several times, and it was not broken before that—I had seen the scent-bottles there that evening—I looked round, and saw a policeman crossing the road with the prisoner Clark—the police<lb></lb>man had four bottles in his possession which were four of what I lost—I went to the station with the policeman, and found out where the prisoner lived —I accompanied him and another officer to his house—his brother and sister who he lived with were out—Sanders went away with me, leav<lb></lb>ing Edis to wait till they came home—next morning I found the other four</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 12th of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was on duty at the bottom of Hackney-road, near the prosecutor's house—I heard a crash of glass, and saw two per<lb></lb>sons crossing the road—Clark was one—I do not know the other—he was a short person, exactly of the same stature as Brinjcsworth—it was not a boy—I followed them in the direction of High-street, Shoreditch—when they got on the pavement, Clark stopped suddenly against the railings of the churchyard, and deposited something—he then turned back in a con<lb></lb>trary direction, and I found these four bottles in the place where I had seen him deposit something—I secured Clark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 12th of July, I received information, and about two o'clock in the morning I went to the prisoner Brinksworth's house—I know it was his house from infor<lb></lb>mation I received—I knocked at the door, and inquired if he was at home—a man put his head out of window, and said something—he let me in—I went up stairs and commenced searching, in company with my brother constable—I then went down stairs in company with the man and his wife who keep the house, and found in the second drawer of a chest of drawers four scent bottles, a nail, and a religious tract—I took the man and his wife to the station, leaving the other constable in charge of the house—I then came back again, and stopped for several hours—about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, a knock came to the door, and a female voice, as it appeared to me, asked me something—I answered her from within in a feigned voice, and she went away—about ten minutes after the prisoner Brinksworth came to the door and said, "You, <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> is any body here?"—I answered, "No"—he said, "Are you sure there is nobody here?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Open the door"—I told him I could not, he had got the key—he did not speak for a moment or so—I then opened the door, seized hold of him, told him what he was charged with, and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by that? - I understood that he thought there was no law for it; when we came to Mr. Walker's, Mr. Fletcher knew me; the prisoner made no defence.</p>
               <p>- DANZEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman where the coaches stand; on Sunday morning the 11th of June, I saw the prisoner at half after three, and just at four, he came out of the Hampshire hog-yard with this cloth, which he was putting under his apron; I saw him put down his apron; I asked him what he had got, and he said a waistcoat, I asked him to let me look at it, he need not be afraid; he would not; I said, I thought it was not a waistcoat, or that he would not have did it; I went to move his apron and some of the wool dropped; I took him to the constable of the night, and I went to the prosecutor's coach-yard, and the coach door was open, and all the wool about the coach; I have kept it ever since; nobody came out of the yard but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I never came out of the yard, two men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190094"></xptr> went in and they dropped this cloth; the man will swear my life away, I can see that plain enough; when he asked me what I had got, I told him some cloth that would make a waistcoat.</p>

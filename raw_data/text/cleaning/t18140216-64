               <p>Q. On the 7th of February, what time in the evening did you go out - A. About half past eleven o'clock. I left the street door on the latch; there was one of the lodgers wanted to come in; that was my order; and my own room door was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th did you miss any thing out of your room - A. I did, two coats, value one pound; two waistcoats, value five shillings; a hat, value seven shillings; a neck handkerchief, value three shillings; and a silk handkerchief, value seven shillings. There was a one pound note in the pantaloons pocket. A pair of pantaloons, value four shillings, and seven shillings in silver, I saw the note in the pantaloons pocket on the Sunday evening. I saw my things when I went to bed last. They were the things I had on the Monday. I saw my things again on the Tuesday at Mr. Brooks's, the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I live in High-street. On the morning of the 8th, about nine o'clock, the prisoner pledged a hat, two coats, and two waistcoats, for eight shillings. The prosecutor came in an hour after, and claimed them. The prisoner came the next morning, and offered me a handkerchief to pledge. I sent for a constable, and had him taken in custody. The snuff-box was found on the prisoner, and two duplicates in the snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day stated in the indictment, as I was going up Oxford-street I was accosted by a man that appeared as a man that dealt in clothes; he shewed me the things in the indictment. I gave him twelve shillings for them, and being in want of money I pledged them for eight shillings, and the next morning going to the same place to pledge a handkerchief I was apprehended. Is it likely that I knew the things had been stolen? No. if I had I should not have gone there again in the course of a few hours. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

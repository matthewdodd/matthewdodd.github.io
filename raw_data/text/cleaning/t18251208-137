               <p>Prisoner. Q. How longbefore my apprehension is it since you saw that brass figure? A. A long time - perhaps two years; it was in a cellar - there is no private mark on it, but I can swear to it. I cannot swear there is not such a thing to be had in the trade. I do not pretend to swear to the other part of the property.</p>

            . I live with my father in Brownlow-street, Long-acre - he deals in metal. I saw the prisoner at our shop last Saturday - he brought 40lbs. weight of old metal - there was nobody at home but me - he offered it for sale, we had bought some metal of him a fortnight before, and having received some information, I stopped him. He gave no account of the property, but got away, and ran down the street - a neighbour stopped him about one hundred yards off. He had been in the habit of coming for about two months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time of the fire in Mortimer-street, there were a great many things brought out of the kitchen, and I had a great many things given to me. I sold them at Pitt's-place - it is three months since, - Many servants have things given to them which are not worth repairing, and I have sold them for them.</p>

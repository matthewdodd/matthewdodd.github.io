                  </hi>. I am a modeller of ships, and live at No. 29, Bruns<lb></lb>wick-street, Black wall. I was in the Commercial-road on the 16th of December, about half-past eight o'clock—I got to Dean-street, when the prisoner, whom I had never seen before, came up to me, and put his shoulder against me with the intent to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> me down—I did not say a word—I looked at him steadfastly in the face, so that I know him again—the other person who was in company with him shoved him against me, so that I should have fallen if I had not resisted—when they found they could not <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> me down, the prisoner took hold of my seal and key—as soon as I saw his hand take hold of them, I put my right hand against my watch, and he ran off with the seal, key, ring, slide, and riband—the riband was fixed to the watch—the ring of the watch broke—they both ran down Dean-street—I followed the prisoner and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Stop Thief"—he ran down John-street, and was taken at last—I am sure he is the man—I can swear to him by looking so hard at him at the time.</p>

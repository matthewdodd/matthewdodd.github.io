I went with my brother in pursuit of him; it was about five hours after the robbery; when we took him we said, we have got you now, you have taken the things away; and he said, now you have got me, what will you do with me; we first saw him in Long-alley, Moorfields, about twelve yards distance, at a public-house door; I was past him; I looked behind me, and saw him come out of the door of a house in Long-alley, and cross into a passage; I said Josh! Josh! here he is! he saw me; he had his face over his shoulder, watching me for some distance; when I got into Moorfields, I lost him; he ran all the way till he was taken; nobody else was running; I found eleven shillings in his pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, and live in Hackney-road. On the 27th of January the prisoner came and offered a silver spoon for sale; I saw it was bent, and thought it was not right - she said her mother sent her to sell it, and she had had it in the drawer for a long time - that her mother lived in Union-buildings; I said I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160037"></xptr>go to her mother - I went with her, and she took me to the corner of Crabtree-row - she then said she would take me to her mistress', which was only a few doors down; I went with her a considerable distance, and asked her how far it was - she said not much further: we still went on, she saying it was not much further, till we got to Bethnal-green-road - I then said I would take her to the station; she fought and bit me very much - a crowd collected, and she again said it was not much further; she then took me to Hope-town - I again asked where she was going; she said, "Up to the top, and round to the left;" I then took her to the station.</p>

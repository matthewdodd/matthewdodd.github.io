                  </hi>. I live in Bateman's-buildings, Soho-square, and am cab-driver. I was going up Oxford-street, about a quarter past six clock, on the 19th of March, and saw the prisoner take two boots from the door of Mr. Bryan's shop—he got a space from the door, doubled them up, then put them under his arm, and ran off—I said to a man, "That man has stolen these boots"—I went on, and got to Crown-street—the man belonging to the boots overtook me—I told him—I then went on towards St. Giles's Church, and saw the prisoner opposite the churchyard, in conversation with two women—I went across, and said, "Old fellow, you have got a good pair of boots there"—he said, "Yes; I make them"—I said,"Yes, you made them pretty quick, for I saw you take them from a man's door"—he up with his fist, gave me a <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> on the side of the head, and down I went—I got up, and said I would follow him—he went on to Bainbridge-street, and stopped at a door, and said, "I live here"—I said, "I shall stop and see you go in"—he said, "Then I will not go in now"—he then went on to the "Rookery," and I was afraid to follow him—he was taken by the policeman.</p>

I saw you take them, but I did not know that you stole them till you doubled them up, and ran away, or I could have stopped you—I did not see a policeman when I saw you the second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Butler, a cheesemonger, and live in St. Pancras. On the 30th of Sept., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the back of the shop, and heard my boy calling out, "Stop thief," and saw him run out of the shop after somebody—I went to the shop door, and saw the boy pick up something—this ham is my husband's—I know it by my two B's on it—the prisoner was brought to the shop soon after.</p>

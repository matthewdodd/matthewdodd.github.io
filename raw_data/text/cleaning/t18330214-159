             (Police-constable T 26.) I saw the prisoner at a public-house at Ealing, on the Sunday morning, at two o'clock; I afterwards met him near Tomkin's garden, which is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's; he then had a bundle - I turned my light on him, and he ran into Tomkins' stable, and was making towards the hay-loft - I took him before he got there, and my brother officer produced this bundle, with four hens and one cock in it, in a smock-frock, which I had seen on the prisoner at two o'clock that morning, and several times before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What I carried was a bag of nuts, and he never turned his light until he got into the stable. Witness. He had a bag of nuts besides the bundle; I turned on my light four hundred yards before he got to the stable; he jumped over the ditch and got into the stable.</p>

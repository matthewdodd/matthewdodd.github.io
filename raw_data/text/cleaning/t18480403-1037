                  </hi> I live in Avery-row, Lower Grosvenor-street.

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) stating that he was recommended to me by Mr. Jabez Moore, of New Bond-street—Mr. Moore's name was not then on the note—I told the prisoner I did not know sufficient of him to discount it, but if Mr. Moore would endorse it I would do so—he came again on 6th Aug.—the name of Jabez Moore was than on the note—he stated that Mr. Moore was a particular friend of his, that he had been under obligations to him, and he had got his endorsement—I gave him a check for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. taking about sixpence in the pound discount—I did not see him again till he was taken into custody—on the day the bill became due, a letter was left at my house—I do not know the prisoner's writing—I tried in every way to find him, and advertised in every paper in London—he gave his address, at 43, Davies-street, Berkeley-square, when he came to me—I called there, and he was not known—I afterwards found he was living at a house in the Re<lb></lb>gent's-park, now occupied by Mr. Bodkin—I went these last Oct., and he had left—I also wrote a letter to him at Wellington-terrace, and received an answer—I apprehended him at a chop-house, in Woodstock-street—I told him I came to him about a bill of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., addressing him as Mr. Anderson—he said his name was not Anderson, but Williams—I said he certainly was Mr. Anderson when I gave him the check for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he must recollect Mr. Moore, of Bond-street—he said, "No, I know nothing of him"—I said, "Then I must bring some person up who can recognise you more clearly"—I called up the policeman who was waiting below, and gave him into custody—I am certain he is the man—I took him out of a room where there were twenty other parties.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Bond-street. I have known the prisoner many years by the name of Anderson—I did not endorse any promissory note for him in Aug., 1846.—the endorsement to this note is not my writing—I never gave him, or any other person, authority to use my name to this bill, in any way—he never asked me for my authority to this bill—I never gave him leave to refer Mr. Allen to me, nor ever recommended him to Mr. Allen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had business transactions with the pri<lb></lb>soner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as a customer twenty years ago—I am a breeches-maker—I have never endorsed bills for him—nor ever authorised him to use my name—I saw him repeatedly about July, 1846—I know Mr. Allen as a neighbour—the prisoner came to me, and asked if I knew whether Mr. Allen was in the habit of discounting—I said I did not—he said, a gentleman, named Platt, in Maddox-street, had told him that Mr. Allen was a great dis<lb></lb>counter of bills—I said, if he was I did not know it—he wanted to get a bill discounted by Mr. Allen—I did not see him on the matter afterwards, to my recollection—I rather think he told me that Mr. Allen would not discount the bill on his credit alone—I did not understand that he wanted me to endorse it—I would not endorse a bill for anybody—I should not think he could have imagined, from what I said, that I authorised him to use my name—he had not dealt with me for many years—he told me he was in the wine trade—I did not consider myself under any obligation to him at this time—he was always friendly, giving friendly advice, and so on—I expressed myself very much obliged to him for some services he had performed—it was after that that the conversation took place about Allen's discounting the bill—I never expressed myself so as to lead him to believe that he had my authority to sign my name—I had no idea of anything of the kind—I might have said I should be happy to serve him—I do not know that I did—I was very ill at that time, and had been for seven years.</p>

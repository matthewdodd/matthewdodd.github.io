On the 2d of February, a little before six o'clock in the evening, I left my box coat on the carriage box, in the mews; I put the carriage into the stable when I had cleaned the horses, and do not know whether the coat was then on the box - I fastened the stable, and next morning, about nine o'clock, missed the coat - it was nearly a new drab coat, and had six capes - the buttons had master's crest, which is a hand and snake, on them - it has not been found.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Mitchell-street, Mary-le-bone - the prisoner lived in the next room to me for about a week. On the 2d of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came up to his own room door, and knocked - finding nobody answer him he knocked at my room door, and asked me if he could leave his coat there till he or his wife came home; I said Yes; he said, "I should not say it is mine, for it is master's;" his master belongs to some Paddington coaches; he left the coat in my room, and went away. I gave it to his wife about half-past ten o'clock, when she came in; it was a gentleman's coachman's drab box coat, with six capes; the bottom one being a kind of half cape- I noticed a hand and snake on the buttons, the same as is on Lucas' coat now; there were two buttons missing on the side - it had three loops and three buttons on them - I observed it particularly, as I suspected it was stolen, and I showed it to Robinson, my landlady. I saw the prisoner on the stairs next day - I gave information, and he was taken on the 5th.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is false - the gentleman put his hand into his pocket on my leaving him, and his friend said,"Have you all your property safe?" - he said, "I do not know" - he looked down, and his friend said, "You have got his handkerchief" - I said "Search me," and then he said, "Oh there it is" - his friend had three or four handkerchiefs in his pocket, and in pulling them out I suppose he must have dropped it.</p>

             re-examined. I had two or three handkerchiefs in my pocket, but very different ones to this; they were not all in the same pocket - there was nobody near us - I had had a glass or two of liquor, but knew what I was about.</p>

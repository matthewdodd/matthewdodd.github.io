            . I am a watchman. I had just called twelve o'clock, and heard the patrol call out watch! I ran, when I got to Palmer's-terrace, they said a man had ran into the garden. I saw a person go up the steps of the house, and I found the prisoner concealed behind the bottle-rack. I took him. On lifting him up I found he had no shoes on. I asked him what he did there? he said he had just dropped down there to go to sleep. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170044"></xptr>asked him where his shoes were? he said he had been ill used by several people, and they had thrown his shoes away. I gave him in charge of Cox, went to the roof of the building, found the gutters cut all to pieces, and the lead lying near them. I found a chisel at the back of the building, and part of a pair of sheep shears, with which he might have cut the lead. It weighed 157 lbs.; some of which was ready to be thrown down.</p>

            . I am patrol. I was going by the house a little after twelve o'clock at night, I turned round and saw two men on the building, when they heard me they droppsd from the leads, which were eight feet high. They got off the roof on to a bow-window, and from there on the ground, ran through the yard; before I could get up to them one got over the wall; I went back for the other, he could not get out at front, and ran towards the back again. I found him behind the bottle-rack. He said he had been in liquor, and did not know how he got there-he had no marks of violence on him. I went on the roof, found the lead cut to pieces, and part on the parapet, ready to be thrown down. I am sure he is one of the men.</p>

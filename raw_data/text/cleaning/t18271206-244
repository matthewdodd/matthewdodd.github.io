I said, "You have robbed Mr. Cattaneo's shop of some glass;" he said, "No - I have come here for a certain purpose." and while Collins was gone for a constable, Hawkins knocked me down, and kicked me about; my nose has not been right since; he said, "If I had a knife, I would stick it into your bl-dy heart;" some people about said, I was no officer, and had no right to take him - I said I would hold him - one Blatch assisted me in carrying him along; he threatened to stick a knife into Blatch's heart also; his clothes were buttoned up, when I found him in the area.</p>

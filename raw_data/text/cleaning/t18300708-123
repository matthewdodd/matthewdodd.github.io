I have known Lilley six or seven years; she lives not far from me - I met her in Tottenham-court-road, and asked how she was; this was last Tuesday three weeks, about two o'clock in the day - she said she was very poorly; the other prisoner was with her - I said I had nothing with me, but if she would stop till I came back I would give her something to drink; I then left them, and went up to my husband's mistress - when I came back they were gone; I observed that Lilley seemed surprised - I went home about half-past two o'clock; my door was then broken open, and all the property stated was gone - I had locked the door and had the key; it was the back attic - there are six rooms in the house, and a private door which goes on a pulley; I went to a constable, and while I was talking to him the prisoners came up - Lilley spoke to me; she seemed very much confused, and I said, "This is a pretty circumstance that has happened" - she said, "What is it?" I said, "I have been robbed;" she said, "Dear me, you surprise me" - Goodyear ran away; Lilley then said,"You and the Policeman are very welcome to search my room" - I had said I suspected her; we went, but found none of the property there, but while we were there Goodyear was taken by another officer - they were both taken to the watch-house, and next morning to Marylebone office; the Magistrate ordered Good year's room to be searched - I went there, and found the bonnet, shift, and stockings, this piece of cloth and some other things; I had heard the night before where she lived - I found nothing of mine at Lilley's, but there was a towel mangled, and I had lost one like it; it has no mark, but I lost one in the state this is - it was taken at the time the other things were.</p>
               <p>JOHN NAISH. The prosecutrix applied to me on the night of the 22nd of June, and said her door had been broken and she had been robbed - I went in search of Goodyear, and after some time we found where she lodged, but she was out; I went out and met the two prisoners - I took Lilley; the next morning I got this property from Goodyear - I found sixty-two duplicates at Lilley's.</p>
               <p>DAVID COLLINS. I was on duty the same night, and the prosecutrix came and stated the case to me - I took Goodyear, and in going along she threw away a skeleton-key which opened her own room, and next morning I found this property; I told her she threw away the key.</p>
               <p>Lilley's Defence. The prosecutrix asked me to treat her - I said I had laid out the last shilling and could not; she said she was going for money, and would treat me, but did not tell me to wait - she lives with a man they call Blackguard Jack, and walks Oxford-street every night; she knows more of my husband than me.</p>
               <p>Goodyear's Defence. I met the prosecutrix, but we did not wait for her; I then met a young woman in St. Giles', who said she was going to her place to get some things - she brought them to me, and I took them home to keep for her, as she told me.</p>

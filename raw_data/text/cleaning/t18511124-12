On 10th Nov., about half-past 2 o'clock, I was on duty on Ludgate-hill, in company with Rowe—it was on the occasion of the celebration of the fete on Lord Mayor's-day—I saw the prisoners on Ludgate-hill, in company with another man—I did not know them of my own knowledge, I had never seen them before—I saw them all in conversation together—I watched them for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw them hustle against several gentlemen—my attention was drawn to them from their appearance and manners—at the bottom of Ludgate-hill by Bridge-street, I saw Rogers look towards the waistcoat-pocket of Mr. Williams, the prosecutor—he immediately turned and spoke to the other three who were behind him—they then all rushed on Mr. Williams; Smith in front, and the other three pushing Smith up behind—that was at the corner of Ludgate hill, on the footpath—I saw Smith put his left arm up against Mr. Williams's breast, with his right hand underneath—he did not lift up Mr. Williams's arm, be pressed it against his breast, and was pushing him back<lb></lb>wards, and the other three were pushing him behind—I should say the effect of that would be to take away the use of Williams's arm; I mean it would confine his arm—I then saw Smith with his right band take a silver watch from Mr. Williams, and push immediately into the crowd with Rogers—at the same moment Lind put his band into Mr. Williams's waistcoat pocket—I collared Lind, and took him into custody—he said, "I have not got the watch, let me go, I will show you the man that has got it, they are all gone up there"—he did not point anywhere—I had bold of his hand—he was looking up Ludgate-hill at the time; with that I took him out of the crowd with some difficulty to the station, where I searched him and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

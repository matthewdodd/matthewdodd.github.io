                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Derby-place, Bays water, in the service of Mr. Hopper, as housemaid—he has two grown-up daughters, Miss Jessie and Miss Emily—Emily is the oldest—the house faces Kensington-gardens—there is a gate almost opposite the house, leading on to the broad walk of the garden—the young ladies occasionally walked there. On the 6th of July, the day the Queen held a drawing-room, I saw Miss Jessie come in from a Walk, between twelve and one o'clock, I think—I had not seen her go out—shortly after she came home, the prisoner rang the bell—I answered it—he asked me if that lady who had just entered the house had lost any thing, as he had just picked something up at the gate—I went and spoke to Miss Jessie, returned, and told him she had not lost any thing—he said he was sure it was hers, for he had picked it up close by the gate—he held his finger in his hand, as if holding something—he said he should not show me what he had found, as it was his intention to advertise it the following morning; if the young lady found she had lost anything, and looked in the newspaper, she would there ascertain what it was—he asked if the young lady lived there—I said she did—he then left—his hair was very thick over his face, but it is now shaved off—he had a very large beard, both on his upper and under lip—I was ex<lb></lb>amined before the Magistrate—he had his beard then—on the 20th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I heard the coachman's bell ring—I then received this letter from Mary Chandler, the coachman's wife, and</p>

On Monday, the 17th of July, I was in Kensington-gardens with mistress's child, and saw a tall stout man there, with a high forehead and long mustachios, and a great deal of hair on his chin, over his lips and below—the prisoner is the man—his mustachios are now cut off, also his whiskers and beard—there was nobody with him—I took him to be a foreigner, and could not think what he was looking at—he was on a seat, on the right-hand side—he did not get up, but looked very hard at me—I was playing at ball with the child—I went down to the bottom of the garden, and came up again—he was then on a seat on the left hand—he looked at me very hard—I came straight out of the garden—I know Miss Emily Hopper, she had been in the garden that Monday, and spoke to mistress's child, on the left-hand side of the garden—on the next day I went to the gardens again, and saw the prisoner and a woman with him, about the middle of the gardens—the woman stopped me and said, "What a pretty child"—I said, "Yes, ma'am"—she asked me the little girl's name"—I said, "Fanny Puddick"—the prisoner then asked me, was not Mrs. Puddick a friend of Mrs. Hopper's—I said I did not know, as I had not been there long—he then asked, was not that Mrs. Puddick that lived round in Porchester-ter<lb></lb>race?—I said "No; Mrs. Puddick, my mistress, lives here, facing the gar<lb></lb>dens"—he then asked, "Was not that Miss Hopper speaking to the little girl in the gardens yesterday?"—I said, "Yes, sir"—he then asked how many Miss Hoppers there were—I said I only knew two, Miss Emily and Miss Jessie—he asked their names before I told him—then he asked if there were any more—I said, "I do not know"—the woman then asked the child to kiss her, and she did not like at first—he said no more, and I passed on—I recollect his telling the woman that was Miss Hopper speaking to the child yesterday in the gardens.</p>

I will, therefore, be as plain as possible with you; and I expect you will give me a decisive answer before twelve o'clock on Tuesday next. You must be aware that I have been at great expense in watching your movements for so long a time; and what I now have to ask is this—will you pay me for the expense and trouble I have been at, and keep all a secret, or will you refuse to pay</p>

               <p>me, and hare all your friends know your mishaps? Your father, I suspect, knows it, by his removing you from home; but whether or not, I shall tell him all, as well as the rest of your friends and neighbours, unless you pay me for holding the secret. I have used you too well; for had it been some persons, they would have at once disclosed all; but I feel anxious to give you a chance of saving your reputation from utter ruin, and yet you neglect the opportunity I have given you. My object was merely to wish to save your character from being blasted; but if you don't care about it, let me know, and I shall apply elsewhere. Perhaps you think that my word alone will not be credited; but I am fully prepared for this, as I have several witnesses, all of them respectable householders, ready to identify you, should my word be doubted; but I know you dare not compel me to produce them. At present none of them know who you are, or where you live, but all of them can iden<lb></lb>tify you from a hundred others. In fact, one of them is a gentleman living exactly opposite the house; both him and his wife saw you several times, and he knows both your face and that of your friends. You had better let him see this, and hear what he says. I don't suppose he would like the affair known either by your father or in the public papers; but this will be the case, I assure you, unless my expenses are immediately paid. I do not wish to compel you to pay me, if you do not feel anxious to do so, as I am quite sure of being paid by some one or another. I merely give you the chance of purchasing my secret, which you will admit is worth knowing, This is very kind on my part; but, as I said before, I would rather sell my secret to you, and save you from ruin, than sell it to others, who would ex<lb></lb>pose you and your family. However, do just as you please. Should you not write before twelve o'clock on Tuesday, I will explain all to your father and your brother, besides all your friends, both in the neighbourhood and elsewhere. Besides, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper would gladly purchase a secret so well authenticated as mine is. This certainly would amuse your friends. Your having neglected to write has compelled me to send this to your sister Emily; and if she reads it, it will be your fault. You know my determina<lb></lb>tion, and I will only refrain from exposing you when you have made me some offer for the expense and trouble I have been at. In case I am out of town, you must write to me, 'care of Mr. Hamilton, 39, Somerset-street, Portman-square.'—P. S. Your sister has carried a very high head with my messenger; but I dare say, when all is known, she will be glad to hold it a little lower. An advertisement may perhaps bring you to your senses."</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Hopper.—Somerset-street, Portman-square, July 27.—Sir, I beg to inform you, that I have received instructions from Mr. Robert Bell, of George-street, to subpoena a daughter of yours, Miss Jessie Hopper, as a witness against a brothel in this street, which Mr. Bell and others have authorized me to indict at the ensuing Session, and which brothel your daughter has frequently visited during the last two months, in company with an officer, who will also have to appear as a witness for the prosecution. As I imagine you are ignorant of these proceedings, I have thought that the better plan would be to inform you of Mr. Bell's intentions, before any further steps are taken, in so disagree<lb></lb>able a case; and I would advise you to put yourself in communication with Mr. B. immediately, as it is his present determination, in case I should not be able to serve your daughter with a summons, to produce his witnesses in Court, to prove that your daughter visited the house for an immoral purpose, Therefore, whether she appears in Court or not, the exposure will be equally as great. I should not have given you this notice, had it not been mentioned to me, that your family are highly respectable, and actuated by a wish to</p>

                  </hi>. I am governor of the gaol of Newgate—the prisoner was brought in on the 5th of August—he then had a beard and moustachios—his appearance is very much altered since then—last Monday I saw him in the cell-yard, and drew the attention of the Sheriffs to him—he had then been shaved, and had a handkerchief tied round his face—I observed to him that he had shaved himself, that the turnkey had put into my hand a knife, which I produced, and I asked how he had got it into the gaol, as it is the practice to search prisoners, when they are brought in, to take from them any weapon they may have about them—he said that he had it at the New-prison, scraping his nails with, and that a prisoner there told him he would not be allowed to bring it into Newgate, but if he was desirous of doing so, he could put him up to a plan by which he might effect it, and that was, by concealing the blade between the sole of his boot, which he told me he had done, and had come in with it in that way—he said that was the knife with which he had shaved himself.</p>

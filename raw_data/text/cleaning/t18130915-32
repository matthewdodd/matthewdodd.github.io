Coming home between four and five in the morning I met with a gentleman that I owed some money to. I said if he would stop at the public-house I would go home, fetch the money, and pay him. I paid him, and I had fifty one-pound notes over in my pocket; and after parting with him the prisoner,

I sat down and drank with him, and having some drink the over night I fell asleep alongside of him. I stopped all day with Oakley at the public-house; at night my wife and a friend fetched me home. I was not sober when they fetched me home. The next morning I missed my bundle of notes. It was in a bundle as it came from the Bank.</p>

I took him in the house and searched him; I found five one-pound notes in his breeches pocket, and four watches, and some silver. I then took him to Tothill-fields bridewell. In the jail I again searched him, and in the lining of his waistcoat I found thirty-one pounds more in one-pound bank notes. They are nearly following numbers. These are the notes. I asked him how he came by the notes; he told me they were from his hard earnings; he had been down in Lincolnshire. The notes are all dated the 9th of August. He told me where he had bought the watches. I went to the house where he told me in Moorfields; I found he had bought them with one pound notes. I advertised the notes; Mr. M'Ritchie came forward and owned them.</p>

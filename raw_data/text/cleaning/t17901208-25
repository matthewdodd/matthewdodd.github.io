               <p>Did any thing pass between Lawrence and the prisoner? - Lawrence said, what a wicked man you are to commit such an affair the prisoner owned that he was guilty, and hoped he would forgive him, for he took his clothes out of pawn; Lawrence said he had taken three guineas, the prisoner could not deny it.</p>
               <p>Did you or the prosecutor say any thing to desire him to confess? - Neither of us did to my knowledge; the prosecutor said he would do nothing in it himself, he left it to his master.</p>

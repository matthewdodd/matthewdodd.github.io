                  </hi>. I am an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse, and have care of the relieving-office. On the night of 7th Jan., I fastened up the relieving-office—I opened it in the morning at eight o'clock, and found the window of the bread-room broken open—the door leading from the bread-room into the passage was broken; a piece was cut away—the top part of it is glass, which had been attempted to be removed—the putty was cut away—I found a knife on the bread-room floor; that is where they kept the money—I found a razor on the floor, belonging to one of the inmates, and which I had seen in a hat in the bread-room the night before—a third of a half-quartern loaf had been eaten—the prisoner was an out-door pauper.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly employed in the stone-yard; the prisoner was employed there also—on Christmas day he came to me, and told me he intended to get into the overseer's office, to get some money—I mentioned it to Mr. Newman, the superintendent of the stone-yard—on 6th Jan., about four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and said he had just come from the relieving-office; that when he was paid over night he never came out of the yard, but hid himself in a watering-place until Mr. Legg was gone—that Mr. Legg came to the watering-place within two yards of him, but did not see him—that he then went round to the back-window, removed some broken glass, got into the bread-room, found a razor in a hat, and used it instead of his knife, to cut a hole in the panel of the bread-room door, because it was sharper—that he hang his coat over the hole to hide it from the watchman who came up, and when he was gone he cut the bar down, and then the watchman came again, and he thought it was best to get away, and he got away over the wall—he said he had left his knife, and wanted my wife to get one like it—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's; I have seen him with it.</p>

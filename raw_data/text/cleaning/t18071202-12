She gave me all the duplicates with the ribbon I before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates were there. - A. There were two of mine; the other was for a broach she stole of her master's she lived with in Broad-street; then I missed the note. I told her if she would give me the note I would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not give up the note. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your enquiring of this girl for the things you lost, you examined the box. - A. I examined it when I missed my stockings; only the fifty pound note was gone; the other three remained, with some other money belonging to some gentlemen that use my house; there was near one hundred and seventy pound altogether in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what became of the fifty pound note. - A. On the Sunday there was a young man came in and called her out to a gentleman that came from Chelsea; we asked her if this gentleman had the note, she declared that he had not nor had she seen it.</p>

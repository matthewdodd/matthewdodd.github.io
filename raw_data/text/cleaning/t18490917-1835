                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Blackfriars-road, and am as engineer.

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, and live in Princes-street, Lambeth. I was at the Albert coffee-shop that morning, between four and five o'clock—I saw Eadie asleep in a box, his legs were lying across another box—his head was lying down, and his waistcoat-pocket was lying open, and the money in it projected out—the prisoner went and looked at it, and said, "This <hi rend="italic">bloak</hi> has got some money"—one of the other men who was there, said, "We will have it"—they took some and went away, and a young woman went afterwards—the prisoner then went and took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the prose<lb></lb>cutor's pocket, and gave it to another young man—I awoke the prosecutor; he said he had lost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I only saw 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. taken by the prisoner, which he gave to the other man—I went after the prisoner, and he was taken in the Hand and Flower.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is John—the prisoner is my son—he lived with us. On Thursday, March 4th, I missed a pair of trowsers of my husband's from a box—I had seen them there on the Monday before—the screw of the lock had been taken out and put temporarily in again—the prisoner left home on Tuesday—I did not see him again till Friday, when I found him in Stafford-street, Lisson-grove—I asked what he had done with his father's trowsers—he at first denied it—he afterwards said he had sold them to Taylor, a dog fancier—he went with me to a man who said his name was Taylor, but he knew nothing of the trowsers or the priosoner—I gave the prisoner into custody—I went to the police-office on Saturday, and when I got home I found the trowsers returned to me, in a paper parcel.</p>

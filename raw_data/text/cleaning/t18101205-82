            . On the 8th of November I was in Chick-lane, watching some receiving houses there. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050048"></xptr>observed three or four men coming down the lane; they stopped at Mrs. Etherington's door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Etherington. - A. She <rs id="t18101205-82-deflabel511" type="occupation">keeps a chandler's shop</rs>

I observed the prisoner Williams, and two others, forcing that copper into the street-door. It is a large copper. It was too wide. When they got the copper in, I ran over the way directly. I got into the house, and seized Williams standing by the copper, and Molloy standing by him. Mrs. Etherington was standing with the candle in her hand, by the side of the counter. They seemed alarmed at my coming in so sudden upon them. Mrs. Etherington turned herself round, and went into the parlour. I secured the two prisoners. I told Mr. Barnley, a constable, to go in the passage. It is a double house. They are two houses joined together; and as they got the copper in, the two men went in the passage into the other house - they made their escape. I secured these two men. Williams face was all over black. I took them to the office, and left Mrs. Etherington in the care of Barnley. I came back from the office, and then took Mrs. Etherington in custody. When I got her to the door, she put a dollar in my hand. She said,</p>
               <p>"let me go, and be as easy as you can." I told her I could not do any such thing, and returned the money back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The moment you saw these persons go into the house, you directly went into the house, how many were they. - A. There were three, Sir. I went in directly after the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no bargain for money that you saw. - A. I did not.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of November, Mr. Hutt called and asked me to point out Etherington's house to him. We went and looked in the window, then crossed the way and stopped there. We saw either three or four men come with something along. I saw them put it down at Mrs. Etherington's door, and they tried to get it in one way; they could not; they turned it, at last they got it in; the door goes with a pulley; it went to. Hutt ran over. I said,</p>
               <p>"stop, let them buy it first." Hutt was in a hurry, he ran over. When I got in, Hutt had got hold of these men. He said,</p>
               <p>"Go on, there is some more gone up the passage." Mrs. Etherington was there, and I think, with the keys of the warehouse in her hand, but that I do not swear to. Her houses are No. 10 and 11. I questioned Molloy and Williams, where they got the copper from? they gave no satisfactory account at all.</p>

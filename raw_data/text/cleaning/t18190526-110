On the 27th of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the back of the shop; my son was going out, and said the shop-window was broken, and the person, who did it was walking away; I went out and laid hold of the prisoner - my son pointed him out to me - he had got about five doors off. I charged him with it; he denied it, and at that instant Thompson came up and said,</p>
               <p>"This is him - I saw him do it." I sent for a constable, who found a knife and some wire on him. I lost three odd pistols out of the window.</p>

I informed my father, who went out, and took the prisoner. I am sure he is the boy - the window is close to where he stood.</p>

            . I was passing Mr. Hewson's, saw the prisoner on the steps, and the window cut; his hand was on the pistol, in the act of throwing it out when he perceived me. He came down from the steps, and ran by to the corner of Air-street; Mr. Hewson came out and took him - my eyes were never off him. I am sure he is the boy - there was another boy about two yards from him, whom I did not see after the prisoner was taken.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 19th of August, about a quarter past five, I was coming down Shoreditch, and a person stopped me, and told me there is a young man that has a large feeder about him, says he, if you make haste you will overtake him; accordingly I went on, and I saw him coming back towards me, I looked at him, and he was rather shy of me, and he went into a shop, and bought a brick or a roll, and began to eat it, I went up to him, says I, Myers, you have something about you; he denied it, I took him to a public house, and as soon as he came in he chucked a handkerchief upon the table among five or six more, and I heard the spoon fall out of the handkerchief, the bowl sell on the table, and this part went on the settle, I took the prisoner into a back room, and I searched him, and found nothing else upon him; I said, you must go with me, no, says he, do not take me, you may as well, well it; he struggled, and I threw him across a chair, he said, I had broke his back, I took him to the Justice, and produced the spoon, I thought it was like mine, but I advertised it, and I came home about two in the morning, says I to my wife, do you know this spoon, says she, I have lost a spoon, and would not tell you, but I have been crying my eyes out about it; says she, let me look at the bowl, I can tell by that, and she looked, and there was the mildew.

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Charlwood, in Surrey, two miles from Crawley. I received a bag at the shop of North, Simpson, and Co., to be conveyed according to the address—I went to the Talbot Inn, in the borough, and there put the bag on the top of the load—I then went to an ironmonger's near St. George's Church—I went into the shop, and was absent about five minutes, and when I came out, the bag was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Portsoken-ward. On the evening of the 24th of October, between six and seven o'clock, I was passing along Houndsditch, and the prisoner passed me a few doors from Gravel-lane, about two miles from St. George's Church, carrying this bag with its contents—I ran up Gravel-lane, and stopped him, and asked where he was going—he said, "Just round the corner"—I said that would not do, and asked who employed him—he said he got his living by carry<lb></lb>ing parcels in the street—that a gentleman stopped him near London-bridge, and asked him to carry it—he could not tell where he was to take it to, but afterwards he said something about the Cock and Hoop—I opened it afterwards, and found the invoice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I was on London-bridge by the steam-wharf—a gentleman came up and said, "My lad, will you carry this parcel down Houndsditch, and I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—so I carried it—the gentle<lb></lb>man kept talking to me till I got to Houndsditch, when I was taken hold of, and then he went away—I thought he was following me—when the officer told me to stop, I thought that it was the gentleman speaking to me</p>

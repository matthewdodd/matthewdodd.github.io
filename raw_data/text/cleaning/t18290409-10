I apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of March. in West-square, Gravesend, at a public-house; I said, "Well, young gentleman, what do you think of yourself;" he said he had nothing to say - I asked what he had done with the money - he said he had lost six sovereigns out of his pocket, and the rest he had spent: I asked if there was any money at this public-house, as I understood he had given the publican two sovereigns and a half, to take care of; but I found only half a sovereign in the publican's care.</p>

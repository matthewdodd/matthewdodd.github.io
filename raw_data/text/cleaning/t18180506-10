            . I am a constable of St. Dunstan's in the West. On the 4th of April, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, Davis and I were standing by St. Dunstan's church, and saw the prisoner coming with the coach-glasses, wrapped in an apron, under his arm. I asked him where he was going with them? he said he received them from a coachman of the name of Oakley, at Mr. Goulder's, Swan-yard, Knightsbridge, and was taking them to Mr. Windus, the coachmaker, in Bishopsgate-street. I told him I must detain him and the property until I was satisfied. He said he did not know to whom the glasses belonged; that he received them the night before, but being futigued he could not carry them that night, but kept them till the morning. We went to Swanyard - They knew nothing of them or the prisoner. While we were there a man came and claimed them.</p>

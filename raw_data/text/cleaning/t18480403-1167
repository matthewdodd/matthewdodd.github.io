                  </hi> I live in Albion-terrace, Lambeth. I was at Southampton-street, Camberwell, on 13th March, and saw Taylor at Mr. Grey's—I did not see him at Mr. Jameson's—I chased him about a mile—he threw something over a wall in Bruncswick-terrace—I caught him in an area—I helped a man over tha wall; and saw some shoes found there.</p>

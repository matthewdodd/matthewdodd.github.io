            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday, the 17th of March, in Little Earl-street, Seven Dials - I told him he was charged with having two wives; he at first denied it, but afterwards at the office he said,</p>
               <p>"I want to speak to you," and said,</p>
               <p>"What had I better do, had I better confess it;" I said,</p>
               <p>"You know best whether it is in the books or not;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Then it is so in the books, and I shall confess it, it is true - we were married at St. Mary-le-bone six years ago, and have two children;" he afterwards said to Clarke, in my presence,</p>
               <p>"I shall throw myself on the mercy of the law, or the mercy of the Court."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say to this man,</p>
               <p>"You had better tell the truth?" A. No, I am quite positive I did not; his wife came to the office on the evening before, with the register in her hand; she was not examined at all upon her oath.</p>
               <p>MARY HAYDON. About the beginning of this year I lived about one mile from the Earl of Bradford's - the prisoner solicited me in marriage; he represented himself as single; I married him at Blynhill, in Staffordshire.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLOUNT. I was present at the marriage of this young woman and the prisoner, on the 24th of February last, at Blynhill.</p>
               <p>MARY HAYDON re-examined. Q. How long did you live with the prisoner? A. About one month; he came to town, and staid about one month after he married me; he was living with me in London when he was taken up; he was very kind to me.</p>

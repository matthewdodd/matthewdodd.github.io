               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you say that I took the money from you? A. I can only say that I locked the door myself; no one could come in, and it was half open in the morning - there was a lock on the door; there had been a padlock on it, and I told the landlord, if he did not put a proper lock on, I would not stay.</p>

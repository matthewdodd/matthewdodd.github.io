            . I am foreman to Robert Briggs and another - the back of their premises opens into Cock-alley - I had seen the lead secure on the top of the manufactory before this happened - the party had got on the roof from the outside - it is a great height - they must have had a ladder to get up - the lead appeared quite bright and fresh - there is a soot shed adjoining the premises - they must have got on the top of the shed; the lead was cut in a very unworkmanlike manner - I have seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About eight o'clock at night, I went to bed - I went outside to do what I wanted, and saw the lead lying on the ruins - I took it up stairs and went to bed.</p>

The name Taylor and Co. was on the door - I have called three or four times, but can find no Mr. Taylor there - the house was shut up about the 27th. I never saw the prisoner or Taylor until he was taken; I went with Hawkins on the 24th, to No. 12, Lime-street, and saw he prisoner there - I said "That is the man I delivered the goods to," and he took him. I have never seen Taylor nor the goods since.</p>

On Friday, the 26th of October, I went to No. 12, Lime-street, Taylor and Co., was written on both sides of the door - I did not see the prisoner there, I called twice on the same day. On the 27th I went to the house, it was completely closed then, and remains closed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was engaged as clerk to Taylor and Co. The man brought the goods, I received them with a bill and receipt - I said I had not sufficient money, and Mr. Taylor was not within, he said he must take them back, I said, very well; he hesitated for a quarter of an hour, I said "It rains hard if you like to leave them, and ask your master if you may leave them, I will take care of them," he did not return, and at four o'clock I left the warehouse. I told Mr. Taylor the goods were left, he said he would call and pay for them. On Monday and Tuesday, I was helping a man who opened a new shop, on Wednesday I went to the counting-house, and was apprehended - next day Taylor said he had tendered the money - he was taken in custody. Mr. Corf the partner, was arrested, and is in Whitecross-street prison. Taylor lived at Blackheath - I cannot find him.</p>

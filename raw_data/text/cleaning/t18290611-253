               <p>Prisoner CRAWLEY. Q. Did you not have your watch again? A. Yes; I took it up and put it into my pocket again, in the same house where I went in for my dog; there were one or two persons there, and I went in and treated them with drink - I was rather drowsy; there was a blue ribbon to my watch - I lost it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner NORTH. Q.Did you not let me have the watch to look at? A. No.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN PHILLIPS. I was fetched to the King's Arms public-house to lock up a disorderly man - I saw the prosecutor, a woman, and the two prisoners; I took the woman out at five o'clock in the morning to the watch-house; I then went in sight of the house on duty, it being market morning; I saw the prosecutor came out in about three-quarters of an hour; I saw his watch-ribbon; he then went into the house again; after that he came out again, and said he had been robbed: I went and told two other officers because I could not go in myself; the prisoners were gone from the house, but they were taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN GATES. I am landlord of the King's Arms. I saw the prosecutor come in soon after four o'clock, with a female and a dog; the two prisoners came in afterwards - the woman was very noisy, and was taken away; the watch was afterwards found on the ground, and was picked up again - after that the prosecutor and the two prisoners had some beer; there was a deal of conversation about the watch: about half-past five o'clock they all went and sat down on a seat in front of the bar - the prosecutor went to sleep, and North appeared to be asleep too; Crawley stood up with a pint pot in his hand - I went into a small room where there was a glass over the fireplace - I heard a rushing, and looked into the glass; I saw Crawley running out of the house - North rolled over the prosecutor, and went out; I went to the prosecutor, shook him, and asked what he had lost - he said his watch; there was no other person there at that time but a female, who had come from the country.</p>

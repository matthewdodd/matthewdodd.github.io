On the 24th or 25th of August, Elizabeth Costellow brought some towels, and two coarse aprons, which I bought of her; it is called huckaback; there were two letters on them, but I cannot say what; I sold them again - she came again the same afternoon, and brought the articles which are here; Mr. Pace came on the 30th of August and claimed them.</p>

            . I was on duty in Vauxhall-road, on the 24th of August, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, and I saw Dickinson and another man coming up Belvoir-terrace, towards Pimlico; they made off at the back of Belvoir-terrace, and I saw them turn their heads frequently; I thought there was something wrong, and I made up to them, and overtook them; I asked them what was the matter; they said, Nothing - they had been at the Cobourg, and staid drinking all night; I did not detain them; it was directly opposite Mr. Colley's place that I first saw them.</p>

From the information I received I suspected Dickinson to be concerned in the robbery, and I went to the back of a house in Duck-lane, Westminster; I found Costellow standing at the door with another woman; I went into the back part of the house, and found Dickinson in bed; I said to him, "What is your name?" he said, "Pace; you know my name very well;" I said,"Get up," which he did, and under the bed I found this chissel, and these three centre-bits in a cupboard by the fire-place; I took him to the office, and took the female the same day, when she came to inquire about him; they had been living together. I sent Mrs. Colley to Mrs. Longley's - before I got there she hung up the jacket; and I went and said, "Who did you buy this of?" she said,"Of a woman, in the family way, named Carrotty Bet - you know her very well."</p>

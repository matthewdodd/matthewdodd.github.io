                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles James Jones and his partners, who are oil and colourmen, living in Leadenhall Buildings, Grace-church-street. On the 3rd of December I had some goods to take to va<lb></lb>rious customers in a waggon—I had two boxes, containing thirty glass bottles, and some oil and paint, directed to Mr. Hitchcock, Taunton—this is the box—I was in Fore-street between five and six o'clock, and left my waggon for about five minutes, at the outside—I returned and saw this box in the middle of Fore-street—I had left it sale in the waggon—I saw the prisoner in custody immediately afterwards.</p>

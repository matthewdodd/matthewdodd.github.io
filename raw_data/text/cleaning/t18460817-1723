I have seen Heffer with my brother—on the 6th of July my brother came home in the morning, and told me be bad some hides for sale—I inquired what sort they were—he said something similar to what I had there—nothing was said about the price at thai time—I said I was not in want of that particular description of hides—on the following day I met him accidentally in the street, and after some conversation he talked about the hides, and I consented to have them sent to me—I first asked him if they were bis own—he said they were not; he had to sell them for a person or persons, I do not know which—Heffer brought them on Monday, in the middle of the day—I have given twenty of them to the police—this description of hides was constantly in the market.</p>

On the 18th of July, in con-sequence of information, I apprehended the prisoner Lewis, at the Old Rose, Russell-street—(Heffer was in custody at the time)—I told him I took him for receiving twenty-five bides, stolen from Pickle Herring-wharf the pro<lb></lb> perty of Mr. Beresford—he said, "The hides are all right;" that he had them from two young men, one dressed in a white smock-frock, and the other had a cap close to his head—in consequence of that, two people, Collins and Edwards, who answered the description, were taken into custody and dis<lb></lb>charged, there being no evidence against them Lewia said they told him that they picked them up one by one at the water-side, and had had them in their house some time—he afterwards told me he had sent them to Wallen's, the tanner; that is where his brother was employed—I took him to the station, went to Wallen's, and saw Lewis's brother there, who showed me the twenty five hides, and gave them up to me—I have known the witness Good some time—I never heard of his being a bad character.</p>

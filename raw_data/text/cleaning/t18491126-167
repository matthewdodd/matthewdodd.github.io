                  </hi>. I live at 10, Fox-buildings. On 30th Oct., rather early in the morning, I went into a public-house in the Borough, to have something to drink; I do not know the name of it, but believe it is the Crown—the prisoners were standing by the door—I took out my money in the</p>

On 30th Oct., about six o'clock in the morning, I was standing outside the Crown door, and saw Sullivan follow Cornelly—she shoved her and feel on her—Lane came out immediately and took some money from her, but what I cannot say—I heard some drop, and there was a scrambling after it—Lane went in and passed something to two young men—they then all came out and went away together—I told them if I saw a constable I would give them in custody—I did not see them again till the following Saturday—I am quite certain of the prisoners—I know them well.</p>

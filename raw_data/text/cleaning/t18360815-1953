                  </hi>. I live at Hanwell. I had a grey gelding last July, in the meadows at Drayton-green, in the parish of Ealing about a mile from my house—I missed it on Thursday, the 28th of July—I had seen in the day before—I went and examined the meadow after my servant had been—the gate was never locked—I found a gap in the hedge—the prisoner had been employed by me the Saturday before, and might have been so to this day if he had liked—I had not discharged him—he was been in my service as a carpenter lately, and sometimes as a hay-maker—I am a builder as well as a farmer—he had not been dismissed, but never came to work after the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a little land at Greenford, about two miles from Hanwell. On Thursday, the 28th of July, I was coming out of my field, along the road, about the middle of the day, and met the prisoner, on a grey horse, sitting on one side of the saddle—I looked at him, and he stopped—I said nothing to him, but he said he had been looking after his master's horse all day, for his master wanted him to go to London—I then asked him who his master was; but he spoke so very hoarse I did not understand what name he mentioned—I asked him where he came from—I understood him to say from Norwood-green—I did not ask him any more questions—I saw Mr. Ankins a day or two afterwards—he made inquiry of me, and I told him what I had seen.</p>

            . On Friday the 23d of this month I missed two guineas cut of a bag which I had locked up, and thought no body could get at it, having the key in my pocket. I suspected the prisoner; he was my <rs id="t17690628-39-deflabel198" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

I went to pay his fees, and take him out, but there I was informed he had spent a great deal of money. He owned he had stole two guineas from me. I went home and found it so.</p>

            . As he was coming home last Saturday morning up Swan-Alley, I asked him whether the money he spent was his master's. He owned before Justice Girdler he had taken some of his master's money. I went to see him in prison after. I asked him how he got at it; he said, as his master was asleep by the fire, he took two keys out of his pocket, went to his chest, and took two guineas out of the bag, locked it again, and went and put the key in his master's pocket, while he was asleep.</p>

About eight o'clock last Saturday evening I was going down Holborn, towards home - I had had too much in the course of the afternoon; I met some women, but I have but a very faint recollection of them; I had had a purse with some silver, but I do not know whether I had it at that time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEFFREYS. I saw the prosecutor and the three prisoners come into the <placeName id="t18291029-253-crimeloc1422">Castle tavern, Holborn</placeName>

               <p> -. I am an officer. I took this purse from Collins.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Now this Plate of mine was in a Box in the Kitchen, which Box he broke open, and took it away bodily. I enquired after him of an old Acquaintance of his, who told me that he heard he was gone to a certain Whore in the Mint. Then I went to the Mint to see for this Whore, and there I understood that she was removed to fresh Quarters in Drury-Lane. The Prisoner was afterwards taken at the Swan in Leadenhall-Street . He confess'd he had pawn'd the two Mugs and six Spoons at the White Hart and Anchor in Barbican, where they were found. The Tumbler and the other three Spoon he presented to Madam.

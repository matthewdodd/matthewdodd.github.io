On the night of the 26th of Oct. the family retired to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I was the last person up, but I did not go over the house, or to the street door—I do not know how the house was done up—the next morning I missed a great number of knives, forks, and other things—two glass-cases had been opened, and property taken from both, but not the whole of the things—I said the amount of the things taken was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I think it was nearer 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have discovered more loss since I was before the Magistrate—I missed a great-coat which had been left there that night—I have seen the knives and forks which are here—I have no doubt they are my husband's—they were for sale—I have not sold any lately—I manage the shop—only my daughter and I attend the shop—I know my daughter had not sold any—they were safe about half-past nine o'clock at night, to my certain knowledge, when I was down in the shop, and they were gone <hi rend="italic">the</hi> next morning.</p>

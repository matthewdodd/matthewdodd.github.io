The prisoner was in my service at ladies' maid; she came on the 15th of April, and left on the 10th of August, at Bologne, and came to England. I went over to Paris, and returned to England with my family. On the 20th of January, in consequence of information which was given us by a servant, that articles were missed, I got a search-warrant, went to Carburton-street, with Plank, the officer, and found the prisoner there; and in the room she was in I found the articles stated in the indictment, which are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140014"></xptr>mine. None of them were at Bologne - they were at my house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Murray to the prisoner's lodging, which was a shop and parlour - she was in the parlour. I asked her if both belonged to her - she said Yes. She acknowledged having lived with Mr. Murray. I asked her if she had any property on the premises which was not her own, and if she had to give it up - she still denied it. I said Mr. Murray suspected her, and I had a warrant to search her - there were five trunks in the parlour. She delivered me the keys upon my asking for them. I found this property - Mr. Murray came in while I was searching her, and recognized it, She said she had great part of the property from a lady named Morland, whom she formerly lived with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ladies'-maid in the service of Mr. Gilbert Farquhar Graeme Mathison, of No. 2, Royal Mint, Tower-hill. On the 29th of Aug. I was at No. 20, Lower Grosvenor-street—I packed up a dressing-case, some brushes, shoes, slippers, a toilet-glass, and a quantity of articles, in a black leather bag and a carpet bag—I cannot swear which bag the dressing-case was in, but I think it was in the black bag—the brushes and shoes were in the carpet bag—after I packed them, I brought the bags down, and placed them in the hall—the footman packed the carriage—when we got to the Euston-square railway-station, we missed them—I did not see them after I put them in the hall—the articles now produced were in those bags, and are to property of Mr. Mathison.</p>

Mathison, Esq., passenger to Rugby"—was locked.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector.</hi>) On Saturday, the 16th of Sept., I went to the prisoner's house, No. 36, Dean-street, Soho, and went into the back parlour, which is used as a bed-room—I understood from Mrs. Morley that it was their bed-room, and the prisoner was in the house at the time—the front parlour was used as his shop—in a chest of drawers in the bed-room I found this dressing-case, these shoes, slippers, brushes, and toilet-glass—they were in different drawers, among other things—next day I went again, having left one of my man in charge of the house—I searched a cupboard on the land<lb></lb>ing, and received the keys from Mrs. Morley to unlock it—I there found, among other articles, this carpet bag, and this black leather bag, both broken open—the black bag is still locked, but the rivet is completely forced on—this carpet bag was also locked—that has merely a common padlock—almost any common padlock-key would unlock it, but the other is a patest lock.</p>

The prisoner was pointed out to me by Palmer, about a quarter before ten o'clock at night, on the 11th of Dec., I saw him with a handkerchief covering over this piece of pork—I asked him what he had there, he said, a piece of pork, which he got at a shop in the Edgwara-road—I said, "Come with me, and show me that shop"—I was taking him there, and he said, "Oh no, a drunken man gave it to me, coming along Church-street"—I took him to Mr. Foster, he said it was his property, and he had cut a rasher off it a quarter of an hour before—the prisoner said he had not stolen it—he put down a shilling, and said, "I will pay for it."</p>

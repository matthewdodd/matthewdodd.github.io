The first thing we got was a shoulder of veal, with the nuckle cut off; we had it dressed; then we went and picked a man's pocket of a handkerchief, where people were quarrelling; then we turned down a court, and met the prosecutor; he was coming towards Holborn; he fell down; we ran to assist him to pick him up; he made a mumbling, as if he had lost something; I looked, and saw nothing upon the ground; then Harris came up, and said, He has got a watch. Then I said, We will have it. Dyal was not come from him; we went back; the prosecutor fell down again; I did not see any body knock him down; I went to help lift him up, and fell over him, and in the mean time Harris took his watch. Then we went, and left him upon the ground; I know nothing of the half-guinea; if they took it, they never told me of it: then we went for Turnmill-street, and Dyal took a breast of mutton. On the Monday morning I got a watchmaker's apprentice to go and pawn the watch, which he did by Goswell-street bars: Harris and I staid at a public-house the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor in liquor at the time the watch was taken?</p>

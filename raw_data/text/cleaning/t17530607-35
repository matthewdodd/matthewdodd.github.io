Between 9 and 10 o'clock, on the 26th of May, at night, my maid discover'd a door to be broke open, and the sheets to be taken from off the bed; I was busy in my business; I went up and found it so. I went up to the garret door, there I found a large nail fix'd to the lock, and a knife lay under it; I had a suspicion of the prisoner at the bar, she having robb'd me before, and I forgave her. She work'd with my wife at quilting petticoats. but did not live in the house with us. She came to work on the Monday morning as usual. A woman that work'd with us said she believ'd she had seen the nail and knife at a place in Beech-lane, where the prisoner was found when she robbed me before. I went to the place, they were own'd there by the two women; there came the mistress and the two women to our house, we call'd the prisoner from her work, she was tax'd with it, and immediately confess'd it, and told where the sheets were; one was pawn'd in Golden-lane, the other in Spitlefields, both in her name, she went with us, she call'd for them, and they were deliver'd</p>

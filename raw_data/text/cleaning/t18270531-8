The pocket-book has not been found - it was a black one.</p>

            . I am a private in the 1st regiment of Guards. I was in Thames-street between twelve and one o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! at the bottom of Queen-street - the prisoner came towards me - I pursued him down Thames-street, and stopped him, without losing sight of him; he threw something from his person as he ran- I saw his hand move from him: I gave him up to the constable, and went with them to Guildhall - I did not observe Mr. Allen till I got there. Before he was taken I saw him throw a tortoiseshall snuff-box away, which I picked up, and gave to the officer. Mr. Allen charged him with taking a pocket-book from a gentleman - he said nothing to the charge.</p>

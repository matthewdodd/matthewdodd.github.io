               <p>Prisoner's defence. My business is in the china painting line; we always work by day and burn our china in the evening; my master ordered me at nine o'clock to get my supper, and to return at ten; being rather late I got up behind this carriage; as soon as I got up behind the carriage, the man jumped out, at the corner of Great Russel-square, and said I had taken the brace from behind the carriage; I endeavoured to vindicate myself; he said that he was certain that I had; and he had lost one or two more, and I should pay for the rest.</p>
               <p>Lee. There was nobody behind the carriage that night till I took this man.</p>

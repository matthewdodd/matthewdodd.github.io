            . I am a constable. On the 9th of October, between twelve and one in the morning, two of our parroles brought the two prisoners to the watch house, together with the things mentioned in the indictment; Mitchel said they were his property; that he was removing them from his apartments, in St. John's Palace, Tottenham Court road, because there was a writ against him. Carter said he was his brother, and was assisting him, and said that he was going upon duty, and desired me to let him go, which I did; the justice believed what Mitchel said, and ordered me to keep the goods till the landlord was satisfied and so Mitchel was discharged. He came again the same day with a man that took upon, him the character of his landlord. I observed that the man appeared a good deal confused. I sent him and Mitchel, with the beadle, to the watch house, to look at the goods; I saw no more of that man, but Mitchel came back by himself. I went with him to go to his apartments, in St. John's palace; when we come to the fields he refused to go on; he desired me to wait for him, and he promised me he would return again, which he did. I took him to Mr. Welch's; I told him that I must detain him, for I had heard that he had broke open a house; then he said that his brother broke open the house, and that he assisted him. He went with me to take

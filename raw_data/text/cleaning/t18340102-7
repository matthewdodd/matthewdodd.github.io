            . I live in Macclesfield-street, City-road - I was in the opposite house, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the cloth - Mr. Rawlings went after him; I pursued and saw him drop it - I followed and brought him back.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PEARCE. I am a constable - the prisoner was given into my charge - I have had the cloth ever since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWLINGS. This is my cloth - the house is in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going across Clerkenwell - a man ran after me and took me into custody - I am innocent.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWLINGS. I lost sight of the prisoner after he had thrown the cloth down - I followed him for three minutes before I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL BARKER. I saw him drop the cloth - I took him myself - I did not lose sight of him at all.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILD. I have been in very extensive business in the woollen line for 30 years past - there has been a considerable advance in woollens lately, but I judge, to the best of my knowledge, that this is worth 12s. a yard; that is the outside of the value to purchase it; I should think I should sell it for 14s. a yard, but I can't speak accurately, by this light - the trousers I am not a judge of.</p>
               <p>JOHN STOGDEN. I am a tailor, and live in Hatton-garden - I have known the prisoner nine years, five of which he was in my service, until June last - I have known nothing of him since, but believe he lived with his parents - his character was strictly honest; I trusted him with money; he possessed the entire confidence of my partner and myself; he had the control over 300l. or 400l. of stock every day; we never lost a shilling.</p>

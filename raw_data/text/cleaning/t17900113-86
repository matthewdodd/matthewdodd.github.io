               <p>On Friday, my father sent me out with a box of biscuits and sweet-meats: I was going with them to Bishopsgate-street; I met with the prisoner at the Bank; I asked him which was the way to the Green-dragon? he said he was going that way; he took me down a yard, and said, this is the Bull-inn; and he said, turn on your right hand, and that will take you through to the Green-dragon; he said there would be a porter come up the yard, and take the box, and two-pence for booking; then the prisoner took the box from me; then he walked down the yard; then he began to run, and I ran after him; I never lost sight of him; he dropped the box; I did not stop him; I do not know who stopped him; a man stopped him, and gave him to the constable, and he was taken to the Compter; I picked up the box, and went to the Compter after them, and gave the box to Jones, the constable. When the prisoner spoke to me, he had a great coat on; and when he took it from me, he was in another dress, and I did not know him again directly; I was afraid of my father, if I did not recover the box.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; on Friday, the 8th, I was called to by the boy, who said he met a man as he was going to the Green-dragon-yard, who took him down another yard, and said this is the Bull; on this charge I took him into custody; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130088"></xptr>had the box in my custody; I have never opened it, nor do I know what was in it.</p>
               <p>(The box produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>- HAND sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep a warehouse in Wormwood-street; I saw a young man and this boy coming out of Bishopsgate-street; I cannot swear it was the prisoner; I saw some halfpence pass; I cannot say who gave them; but as soon as the halfpence were pocketed, the boy delivered the box to the man; I said to the boy, my little boy, what have you been doing with the man; I am afraid he has swindled you out of the box? says he, he is going to the Green-dragon; says I, he is not going that way, call out stop thief! and the boy and me both called; but the prisoner was not taken in my presence: I think the man had not a great coat on, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

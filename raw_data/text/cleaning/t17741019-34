I went to the till to give change, and missed all the halfpence; soon after that, I had occasion to look into a little box which was overnight full of farthings; they were gone; it might contain I believe more than 100. I had a drawer full of halfpence in 5 s. papers to the amount of between eleven and twelve pounds, there were about twenty five shillings of them bad half-pence; they were all gone; in the evening I missed my scales and weights for weighing gold, and there was a light quarter guinea in the drawer; this was on the Friday. The prisoner lived in a yard behind my house; I had no suspicion of him. On Monday a young fellow, one Burgh, gave me information that the prisoner was in custody: I went to the compter; in my way I met Macdowgal with a bundle, he opened it, and there I saw my great coat and a silver tea spoon which we had used the night my house was broke open; I had not missed them then; this was about one o'clock; the prisoner was committed to the compter; I went there to him. I asked him who were concerned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177410190015"></xptr> with him, and I told him it would be better for him.</p>

               <p>Q. How was your house broke open?</p>
               <p>Broughton. He had got to the top of my house by means of some low buildings adjoining; he then untiled the roof, and came through the cieling; there is a door between the shop and the kitchen, which was locked, he did not break open that, but he broke a large pane of glass in the door, and so got into the shop and the kitchen: my house fronts the street, and I have a back door into the yard.</p>

            . I keep an eating house in East Smithfield; the prisoner came to my house yesterday was sen'night at night; he brought this basket in just as it is now about eight o'clock at night; I was serving my customers; he said, do you know me? I lay six months one time in your house, can I have a lodging to night? he said he had been a hopping: I asked him what he had in the basket, he said his cloaths. The next morning my girl told me he had taken some halfpence out of his basket. I felt in the basket and found there were some papers of half-pence in it: I asked him how he came by those halfpence; he said I told you last night I had been a hopping; I earned three pound, and they paid me all in halfpence; he said he would come at twelve or three o'clock; but he never came again, and therefore I advertised it; Mr. Broughton came and described the marks. I carried the basket up to Justice Sherwood's.</p>

            . I was constable of the night; this watchman, Macdowgal, brought the prisoner and this box (producing it) to the watch-house; he gave me the key to open it; I found in it twelve crown papers of half-pence and there was a pair of stockings that had some loose halfpence in them; I found a spoon in the stockings: as I was taking him to the Compter, I observed the surtout coat he had on did not fit him; therefore I thought it would be right to take care of it. On Monday a young man, one Bird, taxed him with breaking open Mr. Broughton's house, and he acknowledged he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bird give him any hint that it would be better to acknowledge it?</p>
               <p>Bull. I did not hear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Macdowgal. I am a watchman in Portsoken ward: last Monday morning between the hours of one and two I saw a person come up Aldgate High street with a box; I found it to be the prisoner, he was agreeing with a coachman to take him to Dark house-lane; he had this box; I asked him what it contained; he said a pair of shoes and a pair of stockings, and I understood him some aprons; I mentioned the word aprons to him again, and he said, yes. I took him to the watch-house upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor deposed to the great coat, the spoon, &amp;c. which were produced in court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said he found them, and that he was but twelve years of age.)</p>

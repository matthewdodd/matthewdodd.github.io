I got up, and still pursued, but could hardly keep sight of her - I ran nearly a mile, till I could run no further; and then I called to a watchman to stop her, which he did. I had not lost sight of her; she went behind a man and woman, and was taken - one of the plates was found in the road, along which she had run.</p>

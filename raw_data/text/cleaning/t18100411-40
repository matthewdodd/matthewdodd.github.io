                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18100411-40-victim371 t18100411-40-viclabel219"></join>, living in Northamptonshire - A. Yes. On the 7th of March I first saw the prisoner at the Half Moon in Smithfield, he was sitting in the tap-room; a neighbour of mine asked him where he came from; the prisoner said he came from Wellington, he came away from there on account of a girl that his father would not let him marry; I asked him whether he would wish to go home; he replied, he had a great desire to do it, but he had no money; I told him if he would go home I would pay the coach-hire, which I did, and I told Mrs. Stokes, the landlady, that if there was any thing to pay I would see that it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day were you to go - A. I was not going with him; he was to go the next morning by ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner sleep - A. At the Half Moon; he did not sleep there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you retire to bed on the night of the 7th - A. Between eight and nine, I think.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-40-person373">Q. </persName>
            Had you at the time that you went to bed, any money about you - A. Yes, a pocket book containing near three hundred pound bank of England notes. In all there was an hundred pound check, and two hundred and fifty nine pounds besides the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a five pound note amongst them besides the check - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed where did you put that pocket book containing that note, and the other notes - A. In my breeches pocket. I am sure I had it in my breeches pocket when I went to bed. I put my breeches under my pillow and went to bed</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that night before you were called up - A. No, not after I went to bed, until I was called up; I was called up by Mr. Donn, near eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner some time afterwards at the watchhouse. When Mr. Donn called me I looked for my breeches; on my examining them my pocket book and notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see your pocket book any where - A. In about half an hour after that I saw my pocket book at Mr. Donn's; it had got all the notes in it. Mr. Donn has that pocket book now.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom had you received that five pound note - A. From Mr. Cole in Smithfield. I can swear that I took it there, and I have no doubt it is my pocket book.</p>
               <p>MR. DONN. I am a butcher; I live in St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Mr. Buswell - A. Yes; I had been in company with him about two or three hours before it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that night, on any occasion, see Mr. Buswell's pocket book - A I did; I saw his pocket book at the Half Moon. On that night the prisoner came to my house near nine o'clock, as I was shutting up my house, he came for some mutton chops; he had with him a pocket book, and a great deal of money in it; he was very tipsey; he paid for the mutton chops in silver; he asked me for something to drink, I told him he was not in a place to have any thing to drink. I I saw some companions with him, I did not think them of good character, I asked him in, and said I would send for some porter; he came in with me; I gave the mutton chops to the people that were with him, and told them to get them dressed, I would send him bye and bye. When he was in the parlour he took out the pocket book again, and began to pull out the notes; he asked whether one of the notes (a thirty pound note) was not a ten, which gave me suspicion; at last he gave me that bit of paper with Mr. Buswell's address on it. Then I questioned him about Mr. Buswell, and seeing that paper, and he having so much money, and hardly knowing what it was, it struck me that it was Mr. Buswell's. I slipped out and told our folks to see that he did not go out, and went to the Half Moon and spoke to Mr. Buswell, and when I came back, I said, young man, give me that pocket book, I know whose it is; he gave it me with the notes and every thing in it, just as it is. I saw Mr. Buswell's name in the pocket book: I sent for a constable, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

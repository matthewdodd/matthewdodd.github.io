                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Nicholas Shearley, a butcher, in Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square. I purchased two sheep at Mr. Hicks', in Newgate-market, on the morning of the 11th of April—I gave them to Bell, to carry to the cart, in Newgate-street—I saw one of them afterwards at Guildhall—I have no doubt of it—I had bought the two hind and the two fore-quarters without the skin—I took such notice of it, I could swear it was the same—it was a Scotch sheep, brought up by the steam-boats; and the weight was the same as one of those I bought—the prisoner said he was in distress, and I believe he was.</p>

                  </hi>. Brett gave me the carcase of the sheep—I took it to the cart—I went back to fetch some more meat, and when I returned it was gone—I had seen the prisoner about twenty yards from the cart, when I put the carcase in, but he was not there when I went back—I made in<lb></lb>quiry, and found the prisoner near the church in Newgate-street in about ten minutes, in the hands of Rice, the constable—I saw the carcase, which the officer had detained—I have no doubt it was one I had put into the cart.</p>

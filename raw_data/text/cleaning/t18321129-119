            . I am a Policeman. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended - I went into the room with Underhill; the prisoner was sitting in a chair by the corner of the table, before the fire - I was the last constable that entered the room; as soon as she saw me, she said, "My God! I am undone; I wish all the bloody curses may light on Bill Barrett, for learning me to make them!" - I searched her; nothing was found on her - I found on the table this file, with white metal in the teeth of it; there were two files found; I also found by the file the handle of a metal spoon, with the bowl melted off - I found this old perfect spoon on the table; on the hob of the fireplace, I found this tobacco-pipe, with white metal in it, and in the drawer I found this piece of mould - it is made of plaster of Paris; and on the table was this bag of plaster of Paris.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint. The shilling produced is counterfeit - this is part of a mould for the obverse side of a shilling; I have examined it, and it appears the counterfeit shilling has been cast in this mould - there are two scratches across the nose which are in the mould, as well as on the shilling - the mould is made of plaster of Paris; here is also the broken part of a mould, having a portion of the reverse side of a shilling; it is also made of plaster of Paris, and appears to be a portion of the same mould - here is a bag of plaster of Paris; I cannot say whether the reverse side of the shilling has been cast in the mould, but the two parts of the mould fit together - these spoons are Britannia metal, the same as the shilling is made of; the metal which fell from the pipkin is the same metal - the files are used to remove any roughness from the shilling after it is cast - here is white metal in the teeth of these files; the shilling bears a fac-simile impression of a genuine one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was with my brother all day, and met a young girl coming down stairs; when I went to my mother in the morning she gave me the key of the door - I saw the pipkin and mould on the fire, and lifted it up; it was hot; I let it drop, and it broke - I went after the young woman, but could not find her; I had not been there many minutes before the officers came -I said if they would wait I would let them in.</p>

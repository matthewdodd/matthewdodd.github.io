             (City-police-constable, No. 71). On Wednesday evening, the 19th of February, I saw the prisoner in Holborn, at nearly half-past six o'clock, with this bag - I asked what he had got - he said he did not know, he was going to sell them for old rags - I asked where he brought them from - he said, from No. 20, Plough-court, Fetter-lane, where he said he lodged with his mother, in the second-floor back-room - I went there, but it was not true - I found in the bag the articles stated.</p>

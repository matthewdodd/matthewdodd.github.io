                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cherry, and live in Middle-sex-street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday morning, about half-past threeo'clock, I was coming home from Vauxhall, and saw the female prisoner insulting the prosecutrix—I fancied they were companions, and did notinterfere till they got a long way down the road—the prosecutrix said to her, "Do leave me, pray leave me; you have robbed me of my shawl, aparasol, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my pocket, what more do you want?"—she would not leave her, but kept pulling at her bonnet, and got the string undone—I then stopped them, and asked what was the matter—the prosecutrix said she had been robbed—I said to the prisoner, "Did you see this woman's shawl on her back when you first met her?"—she said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "Give her her shawl"—she said, "What is it to you?"—I said to theprosecutrix, "Give her in charge"—the prisoner herself then called for thepolice—the policeman came up, and the prosecutrix gave her in charge—I did not see the man.</p>

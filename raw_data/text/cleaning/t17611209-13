               <p>Jos. Husey. The prisoner has used the house of Mr. Young to my knowledge three years. I went in there with her for a pint of beer; she and I sat in two boxes, back to back. I saw her lift up the bar window, and heard her take halfpence out. They lay told out in six penyworths; I cannot tell how many she took away. There were three shillings worth found upon her; and she sat all the time as if she had done no harm at all.</p>

            . I keep that alehouse, these halfpence were my property; there two witnesses came and told me the prisoner was taking halfpence from under the bar window. It used to be fastened; but at that time it was not. I went to her as she was going out of the door; I took her back, and found three shillings in halfpence in her apron; which she told me were my own. She had three half pence, or five farthings, in the hand that did not hold her apron. She said they did not belong to me. I missed more; but I found no more upon her.</p>

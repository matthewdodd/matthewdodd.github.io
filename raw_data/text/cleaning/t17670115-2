About two in the morning, last Monday, the prisoner was brought to me by the watchman, to give an account how he came by these things; they were brought with him; he said he got the cloaths by paying so much a week into a club for them; he said he bought the spoons of a Jew; he said the square was a brass one; he dropped a letter directed to Mr. Polock, by which means I went to Mr. Polock; then he owned he had robbed his master of these things, and he came with me to the prisoner; I heard the prisoner say to his master, if he would forgive him, he would serve him seven years for nothing.</p>

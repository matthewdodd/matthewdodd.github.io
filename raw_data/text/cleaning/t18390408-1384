                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Mahoney. I was out with my husband on Saturday night, the 6th of April—I do not know whether the prisoner was an acquaintance of my husband's, but I have seen him, and we met him that night—my husband and he stood talking together in the street, and seemed very glad to see each other—the prisoner said, "Come, John, we will have a pint"—they went across to the corner of Moor-lane, and had a pint of porter—they stood talking some time, and the prisoner said, "We will go and sit down somewhere"—I had not drank any thing—they then went to the Stirling Castle in London-wall—I went in with them, and sat by the side of my husband—they had a pot of porter—after some time another pot of porter was called for, and then the prisoner called for half a quartern of the best "cream of the valley," that is gin—it was brought in a pewter measure, with a small glass—it remained there some time—the prisoner called the waiter, and told him to bring him a full measure—that is, a larger glass—the waiter brought it, and the prisoner poured what was in the measure into the large glass—it remained there some time, and the prisoner in the course of conversation with my husband kept fingering and handling the glass—he told my hus<lb></lb>band that he could earn 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-day, and he could lie in bed till twelve o'clock, and then turn out and earn 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I said to my husband, "How hard you have worked to bring me home 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner then said to me, "Here, Mrs. Mahoney, take this from me"—(holding me the glass of liquor)—I said, "No, thank you"—he held it up, and said, "This is a glass of good gin"—I refused it again, and my husband said to me, "It is cold, Mary, take it, it won't hurt you"—I took a little of it first, and then I finished it—in five minutes I felt my right hand drop down, and then my other hand, and I felt no support in my legs—my head fell back, and the gas-lights appeared to be blue and green—I could not tell any more—I fell back on my husband, and felt no more till I felt them putting me into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—(I remember hearing one word said about smuggling)—I was forced into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I remember somebody was sitting by my side in</p>

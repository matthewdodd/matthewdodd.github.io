                  </hi>. I was journeyman to the prisoner in March last. He resided at 25, Brydges-street, Covent-garden—on Friday, 22nd March, I was in the bakehouse, which is under the shop and parlour—the prisoner and his wife slept in the back-parlour I believe—I believe the upper part of the house was let out to lodgers—I went to the bakehouse about eleven o'clock—I was in bed when I was called—after I went into the bakehouse, the prisoner bolted the door after me—he was in the habit of doing that—I could not then get to the parlour or other parts of the house—I was to call the prisoner at three o'clock—after I had been in the bakehouse about half-an-hour, I heard noises in the parlour—I heard mistress screaming as if she was being beaten—she was screaming very loud, and it continued till about three, as from a person in pain; not all the time, but time after time—I did not hear any words—I heard also a wrestling on the floor, as if a person was dragging another about—that continued, from time to time, about twenty minutes, at intervals during that time—I heard the dragging and screaming at the same time—it appeared as if the person who was dragged was the person who screamed—it was my mistress's voice—I heard my master talking very loud, but I could not make out what he was talking about—I think the screams came from the parlour—at three I knocked at the ceiling to call my master—he came down—I did not say anything to him about what I had heard, or he to me—he stayed about an hour and a half in the bakehouse, and then went up-stairs again—I remained in the bakehouse, and heard nothing more that night—I saw the prisoner's wife in the shop about eight, when I was about to go out with the bread—her face was in a very bad state indeed, all swollen and bruised, and there was a cut at the side of her left eye—it was not bleeding—I then went out with my bread, and saw her again when I returned, between ten and eleven—she appeared then just the same as when I saw her in the morning—she appeared rather heavy, and looked as if she was not well—I saw her again about six in the evening, in the shop—Mary Ann Bryant was present—Mrs. Moir was standing at the shop-window, attempting to take some bread out of the window, and as she turned round she fell on the floor—she did not strike against anything—she fell clear of everything—Mrs. Bryant asked the prisoner, who was present, to lend her assistance to assist her up—he said, "Let the d—d b—h lay there till she comes to herself"—he did not assist her to get up in my pre<lb></lb>sence—Mrs. Bryant assisted her up, and I then left the shop—I never saw my mistress again—I saw the prisoner between nine and ten next morning—I asked him how mistress was—he said she was in a very bad state, and had been all the night, and he did not expect that she would live, and he was astonished that it had lasted so long as it had done—I was only there one week—this took place the first week I was there—I went on the Sunday before this happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married—my husband is a carpenter and joiner—I am second cousin to the prisoner's wife—her name was Susan Moir—they occupied the shop, parlour, and kitchen, all on one floor, and the bakehouse underneath—from the street you go into the shop, from there into the parlour, from there to the bedroom, and then into the kitchen—they are all on one floor—the parlour is a large room; the other two are small—I have been in the bakehouse, but I am not aware whether it extends under the whole—they have two boys, one thirteen, and the other seven; they slept in the kitchen—I called there on Saturday, 23rd March, about one o'clock, as near as I can tell—the prisoner was at home, and his wife also—his wife appeared very ill indeed, from being knocked about, as she informed me, on the previous night—the prisoner was not there when she said so—he went out—her neck was swollen very much, and her hands were a very dark colour, bruised—I am not aware whether she had a black eye or not, as she wore spectacles; I could not see—I think she was thirty-nine years old—I cooked the dinner that day, and the prisoner returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I was in the habit, when I went there, if there was anything not ready, to do it for her, to give her a little time to rest—the dinner was very nearly ready when the prisoner returned—the youngest child told his father that the eldest would not take out a baking his mother had desired him to—the deceased was then in the parlour, standing by the table, and the prisoner began swearing at her, d—n—g and bl—g her eyes, and hitting her in the back with his fist, and boxing her ears with his open hand—he boxed her ears at least a dozen times—they were violent blows, each almost enough to knock a person down—he said he would make her remember not sending the man with the baking—she said she thought she should do wrong by sending the man, as he was making the York biscuits—she stated that at the first commencement—some time after that they sat down to dinner, and he said of the gravy that was made for the mutton-chops, "This is something like gravy, not like the soup you made yesterday," and then he began beating her again on the side of the face and ear with his open</p>

               <p>hand—he struck her three or four times, I dare say—they were about the same sort of blows as before—they then both sat down to dinner, and the two children—I did not—the prisoner then threw a piece of bread at her, and it hit her forehead—it was about the quarter of a half-quartern loaf, just as you would cut it, half crust and half crumb—the eldest child picked it up and put it on the table—the prisoner took it up and threw it again, but it did not touch her—just before they sat down to the table he told me he had been very much put out with her; that on the Friday evening she got very much intoxicated, and that he had left home to go out, and ordered her to shut up the shop, and she did not shut it up as he ordered her; and when he came back he shut up the shop and went into the parlour, and she was frying soles, and she said she was very glad he had come in, as she had got some nice fish for his supper; and he told me that he told her he did not want the fish, and that he sat down on a chair by the fireplace, and he saw a ginger<lb></lb>beer bottle standing under the pianaforte, and he went and took it up and put his finger in and found it was full of gin, and that made him very vexed; and that when he asked her where she fetched it from, she said from the "Cheshire Cheese"—the deceased said she did not fetch it from the "Cheshire Cheese," but from a house in Middle-row, Holborn—I told her I did not think she had brought it herself at all, but I thought a Mrs. Doe had brought it to her—she said she had not, she had brought it in herself—I told her she had better tell the truth, for it would save her a great deal, and say who did bring it in for her, for I felt sure she did not bring it in herself—she said she did bring it in, and she got her little basket down and showed us the manner in which she brought the bottle in—I thought she could not have brought it in, because the prisoner said there was no cork in it, and she showed us how she put it in her basket to bring it—when he first beat her about the eldest child not going out with the bread, he also kicked her violently at the back part of the body—that was before they sat down to dinner—he kicked her at the back part of her person, and on her legs—he struck her at least a dozen times—he did not say or do anything more then, and the cloth was cleared, and he went to get the bread for the eldest boy to go out to Camden-town with—the deceased then prepared to dress herself, and he came in and got his pipe, and sat down by the fire—she went into the bedroom, and I remained in the parlour—he did not say or do anything to her then, and I sat talking to him by the fire—after the bread was thrown she did not want to finish her dinner; and he said if she did not sit down to her dinner and finish the meat, that he would send for a rolling-pin, and force the piece of meat down her throat—she then sat down, but did not finish the meat—she put it on the dish again—he then got up, and kicked her, and boxed her ears—he struck her three or four times in the back-part of her person, at the bottom of the back, her sitting-place—they were very severe blows with his open hand—she repeatedly said, "Man alive, don't kill me; man alive, don't beat me!"—he said he would murder her outright, but he would murder her by inches, so that the law should not touch him—he said, "For I can cheat the Devil, and I am d—d if I do not think I can cheat the Government over you"—after she went into the bedroom he told me he thought he had hurt her head very much indeed, and he wished I would get some warm water and bathe it for her, and look at it—I went into the bedroom, looked at her head, and found it in a most dreadful state—her ear was the colour of a piece of sheep's liver—I did not notice which ear it was—she had a cut on her head, some distance above the same ear—the parts all about the ear were swollen—I did not put my hand to her ear—I found there was clotted blood</p>

               <p>he would send for one—he asked me to come early in the morning—I cannot say what time it was when I got there—I should think it was not long after six when the little boy came to me—the prisoner sent the eldest boy for me soon after six, and I was there some time before eight—I found her just in the same state as I had left her—I asked the prisoner if he had sent for a doctor—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better send for one directly"—he said he did not know what to do, or who he should send for; and I advised him to send for a gentleman who had been attending her, Mr. Pritchard—he said, "I do not know where he lives now"—eventually a Mr. Watkins was sent for, and he came while I was there, and saw her—I remained there till past twelve that Saturday night—she was quite senseless all that time—Mr. Watkins saw her repeatedly in the course of the day—I went again about eleven next day, and found she was dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who put you in mind of this about murdering her; what made you think of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard father mention it once or twice before, when my grandmother was alive, which will be twelve months on the 23rd of this month—Mrs. Bryant is my cousin—I and Mrs. Bryant have not talked this thing over—we have talked about it, and said it was a bad thing—I have not repeated this conversation to her that I have told to-day, and she has not repeated it to me—no one at all repeated it to me—I told it to some gentleman yesterday—Mrs. Bryant was present then—she said it to the same gentleman, too—I said it after her.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">the solicitor</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw him yesterday—I had not seen him before, that I am aware of—I was with Mrs. Bryant when he asked me the questions—we went together—she was in the room when he asked me first of all—she told it first in my hearing—that was before I had been examined by that gentleman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Chandos-street, Charing-cross. On Sunday morning, 24th March, about eight o'clock, I was called to see the prisoner's wife—I found her on a bed—I examined her—her head, neck, and face, were covered with contusions—the face was amazingly swollen, and the features very much distorted—she was perfectly insensible—the entire scalp was contused—it appeared to be a very dangerous case—I apprehended fatal results from the first—I visited her on the Sunday evening, two or three hours, and she continued completely insensible till the Monday, when she died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—she died of compression of the brain, in my judgment, caused by extravasated blood under the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—the contused condition of the head, face, and neck, might produce rupture of the internal vessels and extravasation—repeated blows from the open hand on the head would most decidedly cause the appearances I observed on the head—the brain was remarkably healthy; I have seldom seen so healthy a brain—the liver was a little paler than usual, but plump and elastic, and so were all the abdominal viscera—the paleness of the liver was probably pro<lb></lb>duced when death took place—the whole of the back was contused from the head to the lowest part—those bruises did not conduce to the death—I attri<lb></lb>bute it entirely to the bruises on the head—the head was in a perfectly pulpy state; there was extravasation of all the fluids under the integuments of the head—on examining the viscera, I discovered not the slightest alcoholic smell—the viscera did not present any appearance of a person given to drinking; and that I might be perfectly certain of that, I inserted my head into the body; so that had there been any effluvia from any alcoholic liquid of any kind I must have detected it; and another thing, the liver of a drunkard is of so remarkable a character that it is impossible to mistake it—it was certainly not the liver of a confirmed drunkard—I made the examination on the Tuesday morning—there was not the least smell of liquor in the interior.</p>

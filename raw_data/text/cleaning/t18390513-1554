                  </hi>. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a shoemaker. On the 10th of April, about half-past five o'clock, my boots were in the shop on a shelf—I had seen them safe about a quarter of an hour before I went down to tea—while I was at tea the girl called me, and I missed a pair of half-boots—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I took Gilbert that night—there was another person running away with her, whether it was Rossiter I cannot say—one of them dropped the boots.</p>

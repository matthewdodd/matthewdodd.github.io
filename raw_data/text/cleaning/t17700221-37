            . On Friday seven-night in the afternoon, a gentleman came to me, and asked me, whether or not there were some people in the information about the coiners, that were not taken? I could not inform him. I took him to the justice: he made information against the prisoner's wife and one Morris. He imagined the prisoner to be Morris. There was a warrant granted. He said to me, You must use some stratagem, or you will never get into his house. There is a door to go in under an arch-way, and when people knock at the door, he looks out at a window and fees who it is, before he will let any body in. I made up a piece of paper in the form of a letter, and sent Mr. Taylor with it as a porter. I said, Knock at the door, and if he looks out, tell him there is a letter for him. Mr. Taylor went and knocked at the door: the prisoner looked out at the window, and asked who was there. Said Taylor, Sir, is your name Martin? He said, yes. Said Taylor, I have a letter for you. The prisoner came and unbolted the door, but it was fastened with a chain, so that it opened about nine inches. I put my knee in, and said, Mr. Martin, open the door. He would not for a long time; but at last he did. I went in, and up stairs, and in searching on the top of a shelf in a closet, I found this plate, all but the milk-pot and tea-tongs. (A silver half pint, a silver pint, a silver pepper-castor, a milk-jug, a punch-ladle, five table spoons, tea-tongs and boat, produced in court.) The others I found in the house.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These I believe to be my property. Here is a private mark which I made myself on the half pint. I don't absolutely swear to the spoons; they have taken the cyphers almost out. I have one here which matches with them, which they did not take, which makes the half dozen complete. Here is a bruise on the milk-pot, by which I can swear to that. I can swear to all but the spoons; and I believe them to be mine.</p>

            . The prisoner sells watches and things. I have known him nine or ten years. I am a peruke-maker, and live at Marybone. On the 15th of January last, I carried him home a new wig, between ten and eleven in the forenoon; he lived on Millbank, Westminster. There was a man they called Arnold, and a good deal of plate on the table, and a pair of scales and weights. There was a pint pot, a half pint pot, some spoons, some foreign pieces of silver, and broken buckles. This person they called Arnold, asked five and eight-pence an ounce for it. Mr. Martin said, it was too much. At last they agreed for five and six-pence, and Mr. Martin paid him the money upon the table. Then I tried the wig on, and he paid me for it, and I gave him a receipt. I was served with a subpoena to come here. He paid me a guinea for the peruke; and I believe he has the receipt in his pocket now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that Arnold before?</p>
               <p>Lee. I believe I have seen him before. I did not then know his name; but when he was going away, the prisoner said, Mr. Arnold, I wish you a good morning.</p>

               <p>Q. to Bond. Was you present before Sir John when the prisoner was examined?</p>
               <p>Bond. I was. Sir John asked him, how he came by the plate? He made no answer. I found some watch-cases in a desk at his house, and a gentleman has seen them since, and owned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out this prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Bond. By a hand-bill from Goldsmith's-hall, that he had had dispersed about. I could perceive the spoons had cyphers on them, but were in part filed out, which made me suspect the plate was stolen; so I brought that and the prisoner away together. When he was examined about the plate, he did not mention a word about buying it of Arnold; neither did he mention being in company with this last witness. All he said was, he desired Sir John would discharge the woman that he lived with: he said, she knew nothing of his affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you at the prisoner's examination declare the time you lost the plate?</p>

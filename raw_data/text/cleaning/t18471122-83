                  </hi> I am an officer of Excise. On Wednesday evening, 3rd Nov., I was near Rood-lane, in Fenchurch-street, between six and seven o'clock—I was carrying a bag in each hand—some female came up to me—I do not know her—she either asked me the way to the railway station, or whether I had come from the railway station—she did not stay with me, she went away—I had a silver watch, secured with a silk guard—after she was gone, a policeman came to me, and in consequence of what he said I missed my watch—the guard had been broken or cut, I do not know which—my watch was afterwards shown me by the policeman—this now produced is it.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Manfield, a draper, No. 65, Whitechapel-road. I came from the country to look for a situation, and was going about applying to different parties, and met the prisoner about eleven o'clock, in the day time - he was a stranger to me; I met him again between twelve and one o'clock, in Leadenhall-street; I then had this property in my possession - he asked me to treat him with something to drink, which I did at Mr. Jackson's public-house; these clothes were then tied in a silk handkerchief - I was then going to the situation I now have; I left my clothes at the bar, with the landlord - I have not seen them since; the prisoner and I left the house together - and in about twenty minutes he desired me to stop, saying, he was going to call on a friend, and would return in about ten minutes; he left, and I saw him again in about ten minutes - he said he had not seen his friend; we walked on, and stopped at another public-house, and he wished me to stop half an hour there, while he went to his friend - he left, came back, and sat for three quarters of an hour; then we left the house - we parted, and I have not seen my clothes since; he was taken up next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you never see me except on the morning in question? A. I saw him when I was looking for a situation on the Friday previous.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of February the prosecutor and his master came and took me to the Seven Stars, Whitechapel, where I apprehended the prisoner - he acknowledged that he had taken the articles away, and sold them to a Jew; I found two brushes on him which the prosecutor identified.</p>

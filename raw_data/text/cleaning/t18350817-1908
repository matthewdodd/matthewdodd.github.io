I was in Mr. Baggallay's service—he lives at Camber<lb></lb>well—the prisoner was in his employ—on the 4th of July, he had a dinner-party—the party was used that day for the party—on Monday, the 6th of July, I took the prisoner down one coffee-pot and a wine-cooler, which mistress had sent down to be cleaned—I laid them on the dresser, in his pantry, and told him what mistress had said—he said she might go and be d----d, he would not do it—at that time, I believe, I saw the whole of the plate on the pantry dresser—I saw both the tea-pots, and a number of forks and spoons lying on the dresser—I supposed the whole of the plate was there—there was a black coat and waistcoat of my master's, lying on the chair in the pantry—I went out of the pantry, and returned in about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner was not there—the plate, and coat, and waistcoat were also gone.</p>

The prisoner came to my house on Wednesday morning, the 5th of October, about half-past nine o'clock. The servant came while I was at breakfast, and said a boy had come respecting a pair of shoes which a lady had bought the day before. Mrs. Elston requested me to go down, as we had been robbed, and question the boy.

I saw him look into the dining-room, the door of which was open - but I did not suspect him, as his tale was so plausible. I went up again and said, I had no idea the boy was a thief.

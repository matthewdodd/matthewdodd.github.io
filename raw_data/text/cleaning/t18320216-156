            . I was with Farrant - I saw the prisoners watching several gentlemen, and when they got into the Strand I saw Colston take a handkerchief a little way out of a gentleman's pocket, who was looking into a shop; we followed them to Cheapside, and there Colston took this handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket - I crossed and collared him, and he threw it into a door, behind him; Williams was close to him, and so he was in the Strand - we had been watching them nearly two hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy a house at St. Mary, Newington. I left my shop on the morning of the 25th of August, about half-past eight o'clock, and returned at about half-past eleven—before I left I had about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silk handkerchiefs in the centre of the window, about a foot or a foot and a half from the glass—the window was quite safe—none of the glass was broken—when I returned, my wife was standing at the door, and gave me information—I saw the glass ha been broken, and missed about half the quantity of handkerchiefs which had been in the window—I judge them to be worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the best of them were taken—I am confident they were worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen</p>

I stand in the street with my father, selling oysters—I was going past Mr. Kennard's shop on the day in question, I saw Knight put his hand into window and take the handkerchiefs out—I did not see the window broken—I saw that it was broken before he put his hand through—I cannot tell how many he took out—he put his hand in twice—there was some one with him—I did not notice the other—I knew Knight by sight before—I am sure he is the person—I was going on an errand—I went on—I then went back and told my father, and he told me to go and tell Mr. Kennard.</p>

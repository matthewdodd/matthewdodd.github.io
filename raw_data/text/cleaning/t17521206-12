He lay there and went away with the key the next morning leaving the door locked; there had been clean sheets laid on his bed, which he took with him. He came again the 16th of last month to take lodgings of me, pretending that he worked at the same place he had said before he did, which I enquired into and found to be false, but, knowing him again, detained him on this theft.</p>

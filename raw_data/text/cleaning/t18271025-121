               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. What time was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, as I was putting up our shutters - I am certain it was silver - Elms was drunk; several other persons were round him, but none of the reat were touching him; it was his breeches pocket, to the best of my knowledge; he drew the pocket out with his hand; nobody else could see it, except four or five, who I believe were helping him- several had hold of him.</p>

            . I was on duty at the watch-house on the 6th of October, and heard an alarm about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I went out, and saw the prisoner run away; the persons round said he had been robbing the man - I pursued, and brought him back; he had only 41/2d. in his pocket; I went to the spot in the morning and found a half-sovereign in a bag, within a yard of where he had been; I went to attend to Elms, who was covered with blood; I could not bring him to the watch-house without assistance - and when I returned, the night constable had liberated the prisoner, as only 41/2d. was found on him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of October: as I took him to the watch-house, he said, "Now you have not got me;" he ran off - I pursued, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you say you took him for? A. I said at first it was for knocking down a woman - I went to see for Ratson; the prosecutor is here, but he is completely deaf - it is impossible to make him understand any thing.</p>

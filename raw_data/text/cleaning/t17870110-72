               <p>Had she the key of the cellar in her power? - The key of both cellars hung on a string; on Monday the 22d of December last, when I returned from the country, I found she was in custody of the constable, about six in the evening, she begged I would forgive her; she fell down on her knees, and begged for mercy; I understood from Mrs. Kydd that she was in custody for taking these things; I told her, she had no reason to beg for mercy, because she had behaved ungrateful; I had some intention to forgive her, because she pleaded distress; I enquired into the distress, and the enquiry did not turn out in her favour, and the next morning I took her to the Justice; and she there confessed taking the several things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

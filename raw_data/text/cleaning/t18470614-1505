On Saturday morning, the 29th of May, about half-past four o'clock, I and my husband got up—I slept in the back parlour—I went into the back room, and saw Mr. Johns' back window open—I took no notice of it, as the wea<lb></lb>ther was warm—I went to my own back window on the third floor, looked out, and saw the prisoner jump out of Mr. Johns' window, with the blanket under his arm—my little boy was standing at the back door—the prisoner said to him, "Hallo, Jack!"—I did not know the prisoner before—he jumped over the wall of the wash-house to Mr. Johns'—I tapped at Mr. Johns' window, gave an alarm, and afterwards saw the prisoner in the street and Mr. Johns after him—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I did not go to the house, nor run after him—I saw the pillow and the blanket laying at the foot of the stairs—I took them up—the policeman came, and took them from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay-carter, residing at Enfield-wash. The prisoner was employed by me. On Tuesday, the 2nd of November I went up to London with a load of turnips, and left a wagon of straw and a load and a half of straw to come to London by the prisoner and a young man who is here when the prisoner came to the bridge he sold the straw, and went to Winchmore-hill—my little boy told me of it—I said, "You sell</p>

               <p>these turnips, and I will go home"—I went home and found the prisoner had absconded with the money—I authorize my men to sell straw at any time when they can get the money for it—they were to sell this for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a truss—that would be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that money should have come to me.</p>

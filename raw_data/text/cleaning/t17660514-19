            . We were upon a trial at Guild-hall; Mr. Olive stood very near me: he missed his pocket-book; he told me he had a suspicion of the person behind him, which was the prisoner; he said he lost it that instant; we charged the prisoner, he held up his hands and said, feel me; a gentleman by us said, take him by and examine him; we took him out on the back part of Guildhall, just by the gate-way; there we examined him; he said he had nothing; we made him pull off his coat; he then fell down on his knees and begged for mercy, and put his hand in his breeches and pulled out the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was hearing the trials, and saw the pocketbook lying on the floor; I took it up, and put it in my breeches pocket; I did not know who it belonged to; the gentleman asked me for his pocket-book, I was very stupified and could not answer at first, but I did produce it to the gentleman, and said, I picked it up from the floor in the court. I am a Swede, and have been in England ever since the year 1763.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Macdaniel. I live in Rosemary-lane; I have known the prisoner going on three years; he lived in the neighbourhood, and dealt with me, he was very honest in all his dealings.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he lived since he came to England?</p>
               <p>Macdaniel. He has lived upon what he brought from sea; I do not know what business he is of.</p>

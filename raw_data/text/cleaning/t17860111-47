               <p>I was coming through the town of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110135"></xptr> Hampstead, and I picked up a bundle in a brown cloth, I carried it the course of twenty yards, the woman run out after me and cried stop thief, I stood staring! I never heard the cry of stop thief before, and they took me; I have many friends in the country, I have been out of the country about three weeks.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Where is your garden? - Near my house on Hampstead Heath, it opens into the high road, and goes strait down into the town, there is a road between the house and garden.</p>

               <p>How is your garden fenced off from the bye road? - It is a wooden pale.</p>



               <p>How far was he from the pale when you first saw him? - Not above ten yards.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Where did you come from? - From Winchester, I lived with one Mr. Dalton, at the White Hart.</p>

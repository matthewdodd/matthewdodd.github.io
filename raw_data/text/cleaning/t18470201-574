                  </hi>. I am an attorney, and live at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Last Dec. I was in London, and stopped at Hinton's Coffee-house, Red Lion-street—between twelve and one o'clock, on the night of Christmas-day, I was driven by a <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> form the City—I was to be driven to Holborn—he said it would be as near to go up Chancery-lane—when we got to the Grapes public-house the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped, and I saw the prisoner—I treated the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> and the prisoner there—they appeared to know each other—I had been drinking, and got three or four shillings of the landlord on a brequet-chain—I spent that in drink—the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> left me, and the prisoner said he would see me home—on coming out of the Grapes he pleaded poverty, and said he did not think he could get a place to rest himself, he could not get a place to go to—we walked on to Holborn to the Coach and Horses, and had some ale there—I left a diamond ring with the landlord—we left there somewhere about three o'clock—I let myself into my lodgings at last, and the prisoner went with me—about ten o'clock in the morning I asked the prisoner to raise up the bed and give me my watch—I looked at it—it was a little after ten o'clock—it was a gold watch—it was left then on the chimney-piece, and I dozed off to sleep again—when I awoke the prisoner had left the room, and the watch was gone—I got up, and found all my things strewed about the</p>

               <p>room, my papers especially—the key of my portmanteau was in my pocket the night before, and the portmanteau locked—I found it open, and missed things from it—as soon as I could dress myself I gave a description of the prisoner to the policeman, and saw him at the station on Sunday—I have not the least doubt of his being the person, and never had—he had a better handkerchief round his neck, I thought, a better coat, and a new hat.</p>

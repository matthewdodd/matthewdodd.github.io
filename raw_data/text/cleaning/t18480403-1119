                  </hi> I am the wife of John Mason Shead, of 1, Willow-walk, Bethnal-green. On Saturday, 25th March, I left the house, with no one in it, at half-past seven o'clock—I shut the door quit safe—I returned at a quarter-past eight—I met Cole, and in consequence of what he said I has<lb></lb>tened to the door, and put my key in—the moment I did that some one from within pulled it open, and three men came out—the prisoner was one—he had a gown of mine tied up in a handkerchief—he threw it into the ditch opposite, and Mrs. Scaife picked it up, and gave it me—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner ran off, Mrs. Pluckrose caught him by the coat, and tore it—I went into the house, found the door had been opened with a key, my desk broken open, and papers scattered all over the place—I missed nothing but the gown—the chairs were put one on the other, and the bed was being rolled up—the prisoner was brought back to the house by the policeman—I swear he is one of the three that came out.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Pluckrose, and live next door to Mrs. Shead. On 25th March I saw her go to the door, and saw three men come out—I caught hold of one of them by the tail of his coat—the coat tore up, and he got away—I cannot say for a certainty that the pri<lb></lb>soner is the man—the man that was brought back by the policeman was the one I had laid hold of.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Willow-walk. On this night, a little after eight o'clock, I went to Mrs. Shead's, knocked at the door, and got no answer—I looked through the window, and saw two men in the room—I went and told Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Shead—while Mrs. Shead was putting the key into the door, the door was pulled out of her hand, and three men rushed out, and almost knocked her down—Mrs. Pluckrose laid hold of one of them by the cost—it tore, and he got away—I ran after him, and kept him in sight till he was stopped—Mitchell caught him—it was the prisoner.</p>

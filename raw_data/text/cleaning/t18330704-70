            . I was in Fleet-street on the 18th of May; this witness came to me and asked if I missed anything - I felt and missed my handkerchief - I went down Bouverie street, and in the Temple we took the prisoners and accused them of it - Saunders took off his hat and said, "I picked up this handkerchief, if it is yours, you are welcome to it."</p>
               <p>Saunders's Defence (written). I stand charged before you with felony, but which charge I can assure your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am as innocent of as a new-born infant. I was going along Fleet-street and I saw a handkerchief on the pavement; I picked it up and put it into my hat, and was proceeding down Bouverie-street, Fleet-street, when I was accosted by the officer to know whether I had not got a handkerchief. I immediately answered I had, and that I had picked it up; but I said, "If it is yours, you are welcome to it." This said to the officer. I was not aware at the time he was an officer, he having plain clothes on; but was very much alarmed when he took me into custody. As for the other prisoner, I never saw him before he was taken into custody about the time I was.</p>

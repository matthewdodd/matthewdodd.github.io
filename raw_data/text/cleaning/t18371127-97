I have been in prison a fortnight to-day, and have made up my mind to undergo what punishment is inflicted, as I have been such a guilty wretch I would not plead for pardon, but hope when you come you will be as calm as you can with me. When I wrote you the letter I had made up my mind to drown myself, but my conscience smote me and would not let me do it; had I done that awful crime I should have been plunged into perdition. I have to ask you one favour, that you will not mention me to the young men, as I could not see one of them. I hope this will enable you to hear what I have to say with calmness. I mean to confess every thing—I would not omit one thing to save my neck from the halter.</p>

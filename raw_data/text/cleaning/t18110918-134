There were some people playing at drafts, the prisoner interfered with them; he said they were playing wrong; he shewed them which way to play. Then we came out, the corporal, me and the prisoner, all three together, we walked into Freeman-street; the corporal bid me good night, he returned to his own home. The prisoner would lay hold of my left arm. I have got a paralytic stroke in my right leg and my right arm. I can always walk better without assistance than I can with it.

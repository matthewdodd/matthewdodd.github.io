I was coming along Whitechapel between the hours of four and five, and the people walked very thick on the pavement, and there were two more lads walking close by the side of me, and a kind of a cheesemonger man catched hold of three of us, and called the gentleman back, and one of the other two dropped the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Alefounder. Was there any other boy with him? - I believe there were two other boys with him, but I am sure I saw it drop from him, and not from either of the other boys.</p>

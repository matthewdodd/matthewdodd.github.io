             sworn. - On Wednesday, the 11th of September, about ten minutes before eight in the evening, I had taken a place to go down in the Bristol mail; I called a coach at the London coffee-house, into which I put my luggage; when we got to Milk-street, opposite <placeName id="t17991030-5-crimeloc23">the Swan with Two Necks, in Lad-lane</placeName>

I then delivered him into the hands of the constable; I did not deliver the trunk to the constable, I ok it down with me directly to Bristol. The articles mentioned in the indictment were contained in the trunk and box. I did not see the boxes packed, but found those articles in the boxes which were taken from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he have got beyond the coach-office? - A. I suppose thirty feet from the door, and ten feet beyond the long window; he was between a run and a walk.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever give him authority to take parcels for your house? - A. Never, he was quite a stranger to me. On the 11th of September, Mr. Andrews brought the prisoner into our office, with the luggage in his hand.

             sworn. - I took charge of the prisoner, for stealing Mr. Andrews's luggage. When I came into the office, he said if he had done any thing wrong, he begged the gentleman's pardon. I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was standing talking with my sister, in Milk-street; Mr. Andrews came down in a coach, the door opened, and he asked me to carry the boxes for him, which I did till I got to the door of the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane, and then he charged me with wanting to embezzle his property: the clerk of the office swore, before my Lord-Mayor, that I was one of their porters, and had been in the office ten days.</p>
               <p>Parry. I had been informed by some people that he had formerly been in our service as <rs id="t17991030-5-deflabel24" type="occupation">horse-keeper</rs>

            . The prisoner came into my service on the 30th of December - in April, I had some calico lace, and a pocket-book - I missed the pocket-book about a month after she came into my service - I missed lace, three or four months ago, and several pieces of calico - in the course of my conversation with her, on the 21st of September, I asked her for the keys of her boxes - I found them in her pocket by her bed-side - I opened her boxes - I do not know whether it was on the same day, but I believe it was; and in the boxes I found some calico - she was not present; she was ill in bed - I saw the mistress of the house find the calico in a box in the prisoner's room - it was mine - there was my own mark on it - I had written eight yards" on one piece, and "four yards" on the other - I marked it myself - I found a cap of hers, made up, trimwith some lace the same as mine, and which I believe to be mine - I have part of the lace here to compare with it - it is the caul of a cap - I found the pocket-book in her bag, when I found the money - I am certain the calico is mine - I have the lace now - here is the cap I found in her box, and here is a piece of lace which was in my possession, and which I believe to be part of the same - I missed as much lace as is in this cap, and a good deal more - this calico has "eight yards" on it, in my handwriting; and here is the other piece, with "four yards" on it in my handwriting in pencil - this pocket-book is my property - I suspected my old servant - when I had examined the prisoner's boxes I went down to the prisoner and spoke to her - after telling her I would forgive her if she would give me my money back, I went up stairs and found these things - I then came down to her, and said, "Oh for shame, Fuller! how could you let me accuse the other servant of the things which have been found in your box?" - (I had frequently accused my other servant of it in her presence) - she made no answer to what I said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner.

I was formerly in the service of the prosecutrix - I left on the 30th of December - the prisoner succeeded me - I left, I believe, about an hour before she came - I was present when the prosecutrix bought some calico, but I cannot say I can swear to it - I was present when she bought some in Tottenham-court-road, and some at Swansea - I have been in the service of Mr. Twyford, the magistrate, ever since - I was suspected of having taken things from the prosecutrix - on my oath, I never took any thing from her in my life - I sewed some calico at Swansea for her - this piece is exactly like my work, and it is the same sort of calico, but I will not swear to my work - it is done in the same way as I sewed it.</p>

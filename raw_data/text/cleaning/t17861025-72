               <p>Had you time enough to be sure of the man and the woman? - I am certain sure of the man, because I have known him ten or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>As to this prisoner, are you sure of her? - Yes, I swear positively to her; I never found any of my property again.</p>

               <p>Did you tell any body of the loss? - All Chick-lane heard of it; I made noise enough; I went home and told my wife; I said I know all the prisoners; that night I went down, and the woman for my watch was taken that night; this prisoner at the bar was not taken immediately; but I applied at the publick office at Hick's-hall the same night about seven, and there I saw

               <p>Was the woman pointed out to you, before you pointed her out? - No, they asked me if I knew her; I then went close to her, and knew her the instant; I told the people about me, I am clear she is the woman.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that? - I will; she was not taken till the twenty-third; I think it was about the Friday following, about two I saw her.</p>

               <p>Was it before or afterwards that you stripped to fight the boy that picked your pocket of your handkerchief? - I never stripped to fight any body; on the 14th of September, at the Granby, I lost my handkerchief in the house; a good many women were in the house, and several at the door.</p>
               <p>Was you as sober then as you are now? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did nobody refuse to give you liquor, because you was so beastly drunk, they would not let you have another glass? - That was the landlord.</p>
               <p>He would not trust you with any more liquor? - Why, if he says it, he may say what he likes.</p>
               <p>However, he was wicked enough to say it? - You will hear it from the landlord.</p>
               <p>But I must hear it from you; did not he tell you, that you was so beastly drunk, he would not give you any more liquor? at the Rotation-office, the landlord being called up, he said you was so drunk, he would not give you any more liquor; is that true or false? - It was false; he did refuse me liquor at his house.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you? - He said there I was drunk.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder at the man's saying so? - Nor I neither, the man was frightened to death; he did not know what to say; I will prove whether I was drunk or no; I was no more drunk than I am now; I sometimes get drunk, but never till my business is done.</p>
               <p>I am told your character is quite reverse to that in general; you are generally drunk, but sometimes you get sober? - I do not know.</p>

             the next day, that he had lost his pocket book; I do not know how sensibly drunk he was, I thought him very drunk; I did not quit the tap room nor the bar for a considerable time after; he staid ten minutes in the tap room, and never made any complaint in the tap room.</p>
               <p>If any body for instance had seized him violently by the collar, and another person taken his pocket book, should not you have known it? - I never heard a syllable about it; I do not know much about this woman; her husband is an honest man I believe.</p>
               <p>Did any body strip to fight, or fight? - No, I heard no complaint that this man had lost his stick, nor his hat, or handkerchief, only that he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Will you say he was very drunk? - I saw him stagger.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This man said I came to his house the next day, and told him about my pocket book; I never was in his house the next day.</p>
               <p>(Harding and Seago confronted.)</p>
               <p>Court to Seago. You hear what you have sworn; that this man came to your house the next day, and told you that he lost his pocket book? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Harding. I never did.</p>

               <p>Seago. He was there the next day with a short man; I do not know his name; it was in the forenoon, I think before twelve; I think my wife was in the bar; she was unable to go out.</p>
               <p>And upon the oath you have taken, you will persist in this fact? - Yes, I will; the man that came with him, had his own hair tied behind; I have heard say he keeps a liquor shop near Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Did you ever go to his house at any time? - Yes, I went there with Phill. Brisco about a week after.</p>
               <p>Court to Seago. Are you sure it was not a week after? - No, Sir, he came only once, I really think it was the next day; I think I can swear it was not a week after; I am sure it was the next day, because I had just heard of his being robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel; I am so ill I cannot speak.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of George and John Henry Downing—we are floor-cloth manufacturers, and live at Nos. 6 and 7, Lowndes-terrace, Knightsbridge. On Sunday morning, the 31st of Jan., I went from my private house to my warehouse—my dwelling-house has no internal communication with the warehouse—I found it all in confusion, the letters and papers strewed on the floor—the iron safe was broken open, the lock of it hanging off—the desk was broken, and one cupboard and two drawers—the back door was left ajar—it opens into an open yard—I noticed a pane of glass in the window at the side of the warehouse—it appeared as if a gimlet or bradawl had been forced in, the glass taken out, and the window opened—there is a beer-cellar under a covered roof, which comes up to the warehouse—it appeared that the warehouse had been entered by that covered roof evidently—I could see marks of footsteps—there were some rolls of floor<lb></lb>cloth under the window, affording a means of descent into the warehouse—I missed a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a canvass-bag with two half-sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in it—the checks were payable to bearer—I have recovered the one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was presented, and the party stopped with it—this is it—it is a check of my partner's, and taken from the iron safe—the two half-sovereigns and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver belonged to the firm—the premises were fastened up about seven o'clock on the Saturday evening, and the keys brought round to me—there were evident appearances of the premises being opened in the way I have described—there must have been a breaking to get in.</p>

            . I live in Clements-lane. On the 3d of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming from the vestry of the Lutheran chapel, and just by the oyster shop, in <placeName id="t18210912-43-crimeloc236">Clements-lane</placeName>

I turned round and perceived the hand of some person taking my watch. I saw the watch come over my left shoulder, and at the same time, saw the prisoner with both his hands up - there was nobody near me but him; when he ran away, the case of my watch dropped, I picked it up with one hand, and laid hold of him with the other - I am sure he is the man who pushed me. I said, "Where is my watch?" he said "I know nothing of it, I am only just walking up." I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was about thirty yards off, when Mr. Woolf laid hold of the prisoner. I saw a man rush through Three King-court. I found the prisoner in Mr. Woolf's custody - he was taken to the watch-house. I fetched Bedford from the oyster-shop, she said she should know the party; she saw the prisoner among several others, and pointed him out.</p>

On the 20th of February last, about two minutes before six o'clock, I was coming down Crown-street, Soho, and a gentleman accosted me, and asked if I had any commands to Liverpool, he would take them - I told him No. I do not know his name - he was going to Ireland that way. I had seen him once or twice only.

            , on the 21st of February, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, with a search warrant. Mr. Huxtable, was with me. We found thirty-six mould candles in a bag, concealed in a back out-house, and some solder melted down; also some small pieces of wood with tallow on them; they appeared part of mould frames; there were marks of these having been chopped up on the threshold of the door. Martin was a dealer in marine stores.</p>

            . I am a mould-maker for tallow chandlers, and saw some pieces of the frames of moulds, produced on Martin's trial. I manufactured one of the frames. I selected twelve of the candles, which were made in my mould - the pieces of wood appeared to be part of mould frames, and some were greasy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he came into Court, to speak the truth and nothing but the truth, but that the multiplicity of questions put to him, so excedingly agitated him, that he did not doubt he had contradicted himself, but not wilfully.</p>

On the 18th of October, about 7 in the evening, I was in a little parlour behind my shop. The door between the parlour and shop was open; the shop door to the street was shut; the window-shutters were not up; I heard nothing of the window break, the coaches making such a noise. I went into the shop to serve a customer, and there saw the outside sash was broke; this was just after the shop window-shutters were shut up, by a porter that shuts up several of the neighbours windows; he had not observed the broken glass. I looked and missed three paste shoe buckles and eleven breast buckles.</p>

               <p>Symonds. I am sure it was whole when it was dark. A lad came to me the next morning, and told me he knew who broke my windows, and if I would go with him in the evening he would shew me the persons: so that lad, the constable, and I, went the next night where he had seen them about, and found

             at the play-houses lighting of links, and Rich used to be there every night with him. On the 18th of October at night, I was with them. I met Shields at the top of Fleet-market, about two o'clock that afternoon, along with another lad. We went down upon the keys in Thames-street, and staid till four in the afternoon; then we came to the Fleet-market again: there one of the boys broke a window, and a man took him and put him in Bridewell. Then we went to the Strand, and there met Rich about six o'clock. Then we went to the prosecutor's window. Shields broke it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any intent upon that particular window before?</p>
               <p>Brown. Shields told me about four that afternoon, he knew of a very good place where we might get some silver breast-buckles, and we told Rich of it when we met him. Shields broke a little bit of the window with a knife: then he pushed the glass in with his hand. He had a wire, with which he hooked out five breast-buckles. We went a little way. He gave Rich one: then Shields and I went back again, and got six more, and a pair of silver shoe-buckles and an odd one. Then we went to St. Giles's. I do not know where Rich went. Shields gave the buckles to a girl to put by for him all night. He broke the stones out of the odd shoe-buckle against a post that had iron upon it, and sold the silver for old silver to a silversmith near Leicester-fields for 1 s. He went to bed with that girl, and I went and lay on a bulk by Whitehall: and the next morning I went, as we had appointed, to him. He was in bed with the girl, in the Coal-yard, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the girl's name?</p>
               <p>Brown. I do not know. She gave him the buckles again in the bag, which he had delivered them in to her: then we met an old cloaths woman in Drury-lane. We shewed her the buckles. She said she would give 6 s. for them. She went towards Justice Fielding's, and we did not chuse to follow her. Then we went into Eagle-court to

No, said Shields, never mind that; they are not stolen: you shall have them for 5 s. so she gave 5 s. for them. She was a little in liquor. When I went to take some of them out of the window, Shields said, Stand away with your clumsy hands, you can do nothing. Shields desired a young woman that was with her to go and pawn some breast-buckles, and she pawned three breast-buckles for 7 s. and he gave me 3 s. 6 d. of the money. We bought some ham and bread with the other shilling which we had of the silver-smith. I did not see him afterwards till before Sir

             pledged these buckles with me (producing a pair of paste shoe-buckles) on the 19th of October; I think in the forenoon about 11 o'clock. I lent her 9 s. upon them. She lives in Eagle-court, and is a girl of the town. I have known her two years or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you think such buckles as these belonged to her?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110006"></xptr>Needham. There is hardly one in twenty of those sort of girls but what have such buckles.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my buckles; they are worth 20 s.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Rich's defence.</p>
               <p>I never had any of the buckles, nor offered to take any, only one that Shields gave me.</p>
               <p>Fleming's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming down Catherine-street. The boys met me. They asked me if I would buy a pair of buckles: they asked 5 s. for them, and I gave it them for them. I never saw them before nor after I bought them of Shields. I wanting a little money, went and pledged them for 9 s. I once lived servant with a stationer in the Strand, before I was a girl of the town.</p>

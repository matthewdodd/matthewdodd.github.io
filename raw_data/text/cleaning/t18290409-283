               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you, the minute before, had any conversation with him? A. Yes; I had asked him for snuff - he did not put his hand in his pocket, take out some tea, and say, "This is tea which I forgot to deliver where I was directed;" nor say, "My God ! I have the tea in my possession which I ought to have left at home;" he was taken into custody in about ten minutes - he was in custody before nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am assistant elder to the East India Company. Keys gave me information, and I called the prisoner; I took hold of him; he wanted to get his hand from me to get to his pocket - I took him into the counting-house, and there put my hand into his left-hand pocket, which was half a yard long, and had been made for the purpose; I took out this tea, and put it on a sheet of paper; here are from two to three ounces of it - I gave him in charge, and went to examine the chest he had been working at; I found the lead had been cut at the side, and there was an aperture made that the hand could go in, and take the tea out; the tea found in his pocket exactly corresponded with that in the chest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long has he been in the Company's service? A. Sixteen or seventeen years.</p>

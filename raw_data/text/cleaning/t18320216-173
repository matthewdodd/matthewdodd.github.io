The prosecutor came in there alone - two persons were sitting there, who were acquainted with him; they staid there till after he went out - Shore went out, and the prisoners, one on each side of him; I do not know what passed afterwards - the prisoners had both sat down in the box, and one of them got up and said to the other, "He has got a sovereign;" Thompson said to him, "I have got 2s., if you will give me 4s. to buy a pair of boots;" he made no answer; he said neither of them should pay for any thing - he would pay himself, and did so.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Forge's Defence. The sovereign a friend gave me in the morning; Shore sent to say if I would make up the money he would not appear; he boasts of having transported five more.</p>

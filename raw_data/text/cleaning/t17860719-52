               <p>The prisoner accompanied me as far as Kensington from London, on the 24th of June, I was going to Hammersmith, we stopped at the Dun-cow, it was in the evening, to the best of my knowledge I think it was between nine and ten; the prisoner was no acquaintance of mine, I met with him by a young man coming to seek after his father, and I went with the young man, and the prisoner went with us as far as the Dun-cow; I happened to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190089"></xptr> to sleep at the door, and when I awaked I found the prisoner gone, and my pockets picked of every thing I had about me; I was not sober when I went to sleep, I had a three feet rule, and five shillings in silver, and a pocket handkerchief, and several other little matters; I had a waistcoat in my pocket, I awaked about two in the morning, I was sitting on the outside of the door, I do not know what time he went away, I immediately went down to the house where I met with him, and the landlord persuaded me to stay, it was a little after eight, the prisoner came in, I took him up upon suspicion, there was an old pocket handkerchief and a sliding pencil, and some direction cards.</p>
               <p>Did you know the pencil to be yours? I had it the day before, and it was broke when it was found upon him, I did not know it by any particular mark, I thought it might be mine, the handkerchief was mine, I knew it by its being so very dirty, and two direction cards in my own hand writing, they had been in the coat pocket where the waistcoat was.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - He said he found the things in the necessary-house.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor came to this house, where they took me with a light-horseman, they had a pint of beer together, and they asked me to drink with them, and I did drink, the young fellow and me went away, and left the prosecutor, they persuaded me to go with them, and going across the park, he was determined to in-list for a light-horseman; we had some liquor, and stood and drank it, I came out of the house before Parsons did believe I fell asleep; I was rather in liquor; I got up about two, and went away, I found the things in the necessary; as for the waistcoat and the rule I never saw, but the handkerchief and the pencil, and the two cards I picked up in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in the necessary that night? - I do not know where the necessary is, I can positively say I never made use of one, since the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I had committed a robbery upon him, I should have been a great fool to have kept those things in my pocket, and to come back to the house.</p>

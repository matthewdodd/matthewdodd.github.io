This Back Shop stood empty; and the Prisoner now and then us'd to get in at the Window, and lie there; sometimes by himself and sometimes with a Woman. But the Prosecutor did not use to lodge in her Shop, except it happened to be a Rainy Night. On Saturday Night she heard a Noise in the Back-Shop; and looking out, saw the Prisoner getting out at his Shop-Window. She went home about 11 o'Clock, and left all safe; and on the Monday Morning following, she found Part of the Partition, betwixt her Shop and the other, broken down, and a great many of her Goods gone, to the Value of above 5 l. some of which she found in the Back-Shop, where the Prisoner us'd to lie. She met him afterwards, and secured him. The Prisoner, in his Defence, brought a Witness to swear, that he was not out of his own Lodging in Brown's Lane in Shoreditch, from Saturday in the Evening, till Monday Morning.

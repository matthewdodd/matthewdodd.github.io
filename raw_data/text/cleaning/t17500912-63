Accordingly we four got a boat and went to Summer's Key. Then Davie was on shore at Billingsgate in Darkhouse Lane near the wharf We gave him the usual notice with the call of Yolow. Then we all went and looked from the Key, and saw a watchman sitting in the lighter. Upon this we walk'd about an hour or two, and after that we got into our boat, and came along side the lighter. The man was awake and we could not meddle with any. Then we lay in our boat an hour or two longer; and between five and six in the morning we agreed that Davie should go on shore for a draught of purl, and call the watchman to drink Davie did so. Then we went to work, and got nine of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Penprise. It was a cloudy morning. But the watchman call'd out, what boat is that along side the lighter? We cry'd, damn him, what was that to him, and went away. We neither of us went out of our boat, we could reach them from the lighter as we stood. We row'd away to Hanoverhole, and landed them there at Roof's house. We left them and went to Roof's other house, in Shadwell, and told him we had landed such goods. Davie was not with us then. Roof told us, he would go over in the day, and look at them. We ask'd him 2 s. 6 d. a pound. He said, he could not give it. He agreed with us for 1 s. 6 d. Davie was not present at this agreement, there were only Watson and I; we went afterwards to see them weigh'd, there was about 400 pounds weight, the money came to 29 l. Faulkner and I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120031"></xptr> 20 l. We shar'd this amongst us, five persons. We went and drank either at my house or at the Fox in Fox lane, Shadwell. We had all an equal share. Parker and Davie went and received the rest of the money the next day. Roof told us, he had paid it them; Davie had got it, and did design to keep it all. We laid him down and hussled him, and took it away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Parker. How much of the nine pounds did you give me ?</p>
               <p>Penprise. I don't believe you had any. You had share of the other, for when we hussled the money out of his pocket, some got some, and some none ; but Parker was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you put Parker into the first information?</p>
               <p>Penprise. He is in the information. I never made but one, and that was before justice Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put him into the information?</p>
               <p>Penprise. Because he has been guilty with me in several robberies besides this.</p>
               <p>Parker. The reason, my lord, why he put me into the information, was, because I would not be concerned with him in shooting Roof.</p>

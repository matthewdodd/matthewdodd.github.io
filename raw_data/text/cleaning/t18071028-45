I was in the parlour; when he had done, I came out and turned the key, and left it in the door I saw one silk handkerchief at the pawnbroker's, and the next day the pawnbroker brought me nearly the remainder of them, within about three black silk handkerchiefs; I have seen the breast plate and the nankeen, and a yard of toilenett; there are some black silk handkerchiefs and some toilenett I have not been able to recover.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took up Cooper at the corner of Maiden-lane, were he was painting a room, on the 7th of October; he told me his name and residence. I searched him, I found nothing; I went to his lodgings. No. 3, Stuart's rents, in the back parlour; I searched the woman, they pass as man and wife; I said to the woman I suppose you are not married; no, she said she was not. I found this duplicate in her pocket of a black silk handkerchief, pawned on the 6th of October, for two shillings by Williams, I believe; there are four duplicates of one silk handkerchief, that had been pledged and redeemed. I told Mr. Hinkesman to bring the things forward, and the next time they brought these things forward to the prosecutor, Cooper was present. When I found this duplicate, the woman said first of all that she bought this ticket of the handkerchief of a sailor, he took a fancy to a yellow silk handkerchief and she changed it for a black one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bates. Is that the duplicate that you gave her for the black silk handkerchiefs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy these things. - A. The silver the prisoner Cooper offered to sell in our shop; Mrs. Hinckesman was in the shop at the same time, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Cooper brought the silver breast plate and offered it for sale in your shop, how much was given for it. - A. Three shillings; it was doubled up so that we could not distinguish what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was doubled up or not, you could tell by the weight that it was a great deal more. - A. The shop was being repaired; the things were put of one side; the scales were not handy.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the man who brought it, and to whom the money was paid. - A I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Hinckesman here. - A. No, it was not Mr. Hinckesman that bought them, but Mrs. Hinckesman; she offered three shillings for the silver as he was going out of the shop; he returned, and it was bought for three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not he order the person here that bought them. - A. He was not ordered by the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see me bring a thing of this kind. - A. Yes, the silver was brought by you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is every thing that is possible that that person is saying is quite false. I deny that the breast plate ever came from Mr. Pulsford.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of that breast plate. - A. I am charged thirty five shillings for it, with the engraving the silver thirty shillings; the silk handkerchiefs cost me three shillings and six pence each by the dozen.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. I never took any act or part in taking of any thing away during the time I was at work at Mr. Pulsford's house.</p>

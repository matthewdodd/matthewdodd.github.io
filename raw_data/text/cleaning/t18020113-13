               <persName id="t18020113-13-person167">Q. </persName>
            Who is your partner? - A. Mr. Boyce Combe, we are merchants and insurance-brokers; the prisoner was in our employment as a clerk, and had been three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 16th of October, entrust him with any draft, for the purpose of being presented to your banker's, and for what amount? - A. I did, for 4261. I have the draft here, (produces it); that is the draft, it is upon Prescot's house for 4261.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any directions respecting the application of that money? - A. I desired him to receive it from the banker's, and make a payment upon 5000l. scrip consols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the draft to him yourself? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect him to return that day into your service? - A. He did return, and the following morning he was not at the accompting-house, but I had no suspicion, knowing he had had a bad cold; I thought he might be indisposed.</p>
               <p>

            Did he ever appear again at the accompting-house till he was apprehended? - A. Not to my knowledge; I think it is three weeks to-day since he was apprehended.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-13-person169">Q. </persName>
            Was that instalment upon scrip paid by him? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. To which purpose he was to apply that 4261.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney Q. Of course, an instalment upon scrip is received by some person in the Bank? - A. Yes, the cashier.</p>

            From Mr. Morris, but not himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you sent him first of all to pay this instalment, you put into his hand a receipt for former payments? - A. Yes, they are all on one sheet of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask, if these scrip receipts in the City of London are not marketable? - A. I do not know that that unfortunate young man could have converted them into money, but any person that was known certainly might have disposed of them with the utmost facility.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe nearly 400l. had been paid upon these receipts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been in your service a few months? - A. Yes, I had the highest opinion of him.</p>
               <p>Q. And his friends are most respectable? - A. They are.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know of his having left his master's employ improperly? - A. Yes; I had not been in the boxes above five minutes when the prisoner came in; the prisoner, on seeing me, ran out of the boxes; I immediately followed him, and persuaded him to go along with me; I said, George, I am very sorry to see you here; I then called a coach and took him with me in a coach to the Ordnance-tavern, on the Surry-side of Westminster-bridge; we both remained there that evening.</p>

            When we came to the office, I explained to him, that I was acquainted with his having taken Mr. Bridgman's property; I told him, if, according to the advertisement that had appeared, in which Messrs. Combe and Bridgman wished to shew him lenity, if he would make all the restitution in his power, I would see what I could do for him; he then went and fetched the scrip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him to the place from whence he fetched the scrip? - A. I did not; he went by himself, and brought the scrip to me at my house, in Rood-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing besides this scrip? - A. Not at that time; I continually repeated to him to disclose the property if he had any left, and on the Tuesday evening he produced me a 20l. Bank-note, a 1l. note, and a 7s. piece; he laid, that was all he had left.</p>

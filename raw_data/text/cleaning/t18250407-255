On the 21st of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day-time, the prisoners came to the shop in company together, and asked to look at some printed cottons; the first four or five pieces which I shewed them, they would not allow me to open; saying they were not the description of print they wanted; I shewed them others, which I opened over the first; they bought a yard and a half, which Watson paid 2 s. 3 d. for; they all took part in the purchase; they then asked to look at some others, which I shewed them; they did not fix on any - Hill pointed to some on the shelves behind, and said they were more of the sort they wanted; I turned round, stepping a little back, so as to have my eye on them, and saw Watson and M'Kenzie endeavouring to get something from under the prints which were open; I shewed them several others - they at last bought fourteen yards; but, before that, Hill again pointed to the shelves, and I saw the other two endeavouring to conceal something under their clothes; after buying fourteen yards, they wished to see some more for aprons, and bought a small quantity; they then asked for stockings, which I left them to get; they then asked for Irish - I left them, to get it, and observed them again endeavouring to conceal something under their clothes. Watson handed Hill a 5 l. note to pay me; I had to take 34 s.; I asked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070092"></xptr>address to put on the note - Hill said,</p>

I fetched an officer, who took them; they were then all three in the middle of the shop, and Hill threw from her about three yards and a half of print behind her - I took it up and charged her with it; she said,</p>

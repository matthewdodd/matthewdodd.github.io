On the 2d of December, Mr. Watkins, my master, paid me one sovereign, one half-sovereign, and some silver money: I went to the Barley Mow public-house, and drank; I paid 1s. 6d. as my share of the reckoning - I was not quite sober when I left - I then went into the George the Fourth public-house, about two hundred yards from there; I drank more there, and when I came out, I was quite insensible - I found myself in the watch-house next morning, and missed my money from my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>

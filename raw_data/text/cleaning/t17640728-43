This was on the Sunday night; in the morning I lost one of my shoes; I found that under her head: about eight in the morning a man came in for some change, then I missed my money; I turned round to her, and said, Poll, give me my money; she began to treat me with ill language; a gentleman came into the house, and desired me to go to Justice Cox for a warrant; she turned out some rags and ribbons, and said, that was all she had about her; I staid 'till near twelve: she insisted upon going before Justice Welch; he ordered her to be searched, and the five and three-pence was found wrapped up in a ribbon, in one of her pockets; she said she had no more: then the justice ordered her into a room, and a woman to search her, and we found the rest of the money upon her; there is a particular half crown, which I could swear to; it has a scratch goes from the nose, on the head-side. The constable took all the money, being fourteen shillings, a French farthing and some halfpence.</p>

            . On the night of the 25th of March I met the prisoner in Drury-lane, we went to No. 5, <placeName id="t18110403-6-crimeloc29">Charles-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was there besides the watch - A. Two gold seals and a gold key. The next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was with Humphreys when he apprehended the prisoner; I saw her searched, the seal and key was found in her pocket. This is the seal and key; I know the seal and key to be mine. There is a notch I made upon the seal.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of your watch - A. About four pounds, and this seal thirty shillings, it cost me two guineas.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of March I went with the prosecutor to apprehend the prisoner. When I went in, I said, Poll are you here; she said, yes. I said, Poll, you know the thimble; she said she did not know what I meant.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the cant phrase, a thimble - A. That is the ordinary name for a watch. I asked her if she had the thimble; she said, no. She turned out her pockets, and in taking the things out she was longer than she ought. I said, stand aside. I heard something fall, I said what is that, she said a little rouge. I said, what you do your face with? she said, yes. I picked it up, it was this seal and key. The prosecutor said it was his; the prisoner denied ever being with the prosecutor at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor went with me into Parker-street, he paid a shilling for the room. He told me he had but one shilling in his pocket. I went down stairs, and he lit me down himself, and half an hour afterwards he met me again. He had the gold seal and key in his hand; he said, if I would go with him he would give it me; he would return and make me a compliment; I was not to make away with it; I did not. I know nothing of the watch, no more than you do. The prosecutor said he had given six shillings to a young woman that ran away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not give her the seal and key. She took the watch, two seals, and a key; the prisoner had six shillings and sixpence of me; no other person took a shilling from me.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JACKS. I live in Mary-street, Stepney. On the 14th of November I was returning home through <placeName id="t18301209-185-crimeloc1042">Old-street-road</placeName>

I took the prisoner - I found on her four half-crowns, some halfpence, and one farthing; the prosecutor seemed a little fresh, but perfectly sensible - before I searched the prisoner she said she had nothing at all but two or three halfpence; when I had searched her and found the half-crowns, she said."I did not think proper to tell you what I had;" she said the money was her own, and some gentleman, a friend of hers, had given it her - she said in Pitfield-street that she had seen the prosecutor, but did not take any thing from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at a distillery in St. John-street, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell. The prisoner had worked there, but was discharged about three months before—I had a work-box, and writing-desk, containing the articles stated—they were safe at three o'clock on the 6th of January, in the front parlour—they were both locked—I value them at £6, but there were papers in them of more value to me—they cost me a great deal more than £6, and I would give £6 for them—I was sent for at a quarter before four o'clock that day—the property was then gone.</p>

I was coming home a little before four o'clock, and saw the prisoner on the step of the street-door with the desk under his left arm—I saw the end of it—I did not say any thing to him, but I rang the bell, to ascertain from the servant whether the had given him the desk—he then ran off down the street—I am sure he is the man—I did not see him with the work-box, but they were both missing.</p>

On the 6th of January the prisoner came to the door—I looked up the area, and he asked for Mrs. Nicholson—I said she was not at home—he then asked for a blue coat—I went up and opened the door—he said he came from Mr. Nicholson for a coat, but he was not certain whether it was blue or black, but he would go and inquire—he went back, came again, and said it was a blue coat which was up stairs—I went up stairs for it, and when I came back he was gone—this writing-desk and work-box were both gone from the front parlour—another man might have taken the box.</p>

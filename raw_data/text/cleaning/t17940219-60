               <p>Q. Who was in the house at that time? - My wife, myself, and four or five children. Mr. Robins asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I did not know that I had; he then asked me if that was my pistol? I turned into my front parlour and looked, and saw but one, and about ten minutes before there were two laying there, one was gone, and that was the pistol that Mr. Robins brought. We were then going to take the prisoner to the watch-house, and we met with an headborough, who took charge of him, and he was immediately conducted to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find your house? - He must have lifted up the fash.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think so? - I am sure it must be so, it lay within a foot of the fash window a few minutes before, the fash was put down again.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it shut or open ten minutes before? - Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened at all? - There was a brass screwed at the side of the window, so as to let in a little air, so that nobody could get in, it could be lifted up about four inches, and admit a person's hand, but nobody could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was your outer door before that time? - It was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it when you looked into your parlour ten minutes before? - It was shut then, I think they could not come in at the front door.</p>

Then he puts down from his hand a pistol;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190136"></xptr>and I said don't put it down there, give it to me; I knocked at the door, and the gentleman came; I said, is this your's? says he, there were two of them, he looked into the parlour, and said, there was but one; when the prisoner got into the parlour, he downed on his knees, and was going to say something, but he stopped and did not, and we were going to take him down to the watch-house, but we met the beadle, and gave him into the beadle's hands.</p>

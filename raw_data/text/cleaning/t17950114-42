               <p>Q. When had you seen them last before? - About ten minutes before I lost them, they laid on the counter; I had not finished taking stock, I had been taking stock three or four days before, and had not finished; I was reading in the back part of my counting house, at the back part of my shop, I heard somebody, I did not know at the time but it might be somebody in the shop; I went afterwards and I saw a lad in the shop, with a man having hold of him, with a bundle of leather under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that lad? - The lad at the bar; the man asked me if I had given this lad these skins? I told him no, I had not, they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. This was said in the boy's presence? - It was. The man said he saw two of them go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You secured your effects? - Yes, I did, they are here.</p>

               <p>Q. You see them go in? - Yes, he and another; he went in, and the other held the door open while this lad went in; there was a bundle of loose skins all lay on the counter, and he took them up, as much as he could in his arms; as soon as he came out I took him up in my arms immediately, and carried him into the shop, Mr. Kirkham came forward, he had said the gentleman of the shop had ordered him to carry it somewhere.</p>

               <p>Q. You acquainted Mr. Kirkham with all you had seen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Produce the skins? Are these the skins that were taken from the boy? - Yes, they are, I believe, I have not looked at them since; they are here, I examined them before the constable took them into his possession; they have my shop mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are the goods that were taken from the boy? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the constable? - He is out at the door, his name is Bailey.</p>

I took them in charge; Taylor then gave me six duplicates, relating to the property, from his pocket; I put them into the watch-house, and went immediately to Liversedge's house, in Hot-water-court, St. Luke's - I found him at home, and told him I had taken the two soldiers - that I knew he had some of the things, and should take him; he then acknowledged pawning two shirts and other things, for 14s., near Cripplegate church, but he could not tell the name; I went and got the things from there, and they were also claimed.

I lost a gown and shawl on the 16th of November, from a room on the two-pair of stairs: the prisoner was in the house; I had seen my articles in their place on the Saturday, and missed them on Monday; I stopped Ferguson on the stairs, and said I suspected she knew something about my shawl and gown - they had been in a box, which was corded.</p>

               <p>Prisoner FERGUSON. Q. Do not you remember telling the Magistrate it was not me? A. No; I told him I believed it was you; I had some doubts about the other - two persons came, and one stood near the door.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNETT. The prosecutrix came to me, and said the two prisoners had confessed where the things were - I went and took them, but found no duplicate on them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>FERGUSON's Defence. The Magistrate asked if she could swear it was me - she said she could not; there were sixteen people in the same room; the pawnbroker said he thought it was a girl taller than me, and the Magistrate discharged me; I had not gone ten yards, when I was taken to Hammersmith, and locked up for fourteen days, and then the pawnbroker said, to the best of his knowledge, it was me.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNETT. I generally take my prisoners to Bow-street: the Magistrate asked me if one of the overseers were come - I said, No; he said I might take them to Kensington, which I did, but they were never out of my charge.</p>

On Saturday, the 11th of March, I left my counting-house about six o'clock in the evening, leaving my cash-box in one of the drawers of an iron chest in the counting-house—there were several bills which were over due, and seven that were not due, two cheques, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—the iron chest was not locked when I left, but the two drawers in it were locked—I saw it again next day, and both drawers had then been forced—the cash-box, documents, and money, were all gone.</p>

I am son of Mr. Green, Mr. Barrett's part<lb></lb>ner—I live in the dwelling-house, which is attached to the counting-house—my father is at present absent—the prisoner was in my service—on Saturday, the 11th of March, I was in the counting-house at six o'clock in the evening—at that time I locked the iron safe, which is fixed into the wall—I placed the key on the mantel-piece in the parlour, which is where I usually kept it—on Sunday, the 12th of March, I left the premises about half-past ten o'clock to go to church—before I left I gave directions to Wat<lb></lb>ford for my dinner—I did not state at what hour I should be back—no other person was in the house when I left it, to my knowledge—I returned about one o'clock or a little after, knocked at the door, but could not get in—I got in by the backway, and found that Watford was gone—after going through the house. I went to the counting-house, and saw that three desks had been broken open, which were locked at the time I left the counting-house the preceding evening—there had been 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in one of those desks, which was mine, and that money was gone—I found the safe locked—I went into the parlour for the key, and it was gone—in the coal-cellar I found this cash-box, which had been in the safe—I also found there several papers in a table-cloth, which I believe was the kitchen table-cloth—the cash-box was broken at one end and empty—I also found these two screw-drivers, hammer, and a pair of pincers—the pincers are my own—I had bought them the preceding evening, and had placed them on the parlour-table—I gave information to Taylor, the wharf constable, and he and sergeant Brannan came to the house—I then searched the house, and missed three silver table-spoons and three silver tea-spoons—I had used two of the spoons for breakfast—I missed a carpet bag which I had not seen for three or four weeks before—Mr. Barrett came to the counting-house about five o'clock that afternoon—he opened the safe with a duplicate key, and I saw that the drawers had been broken open—on the ground near the safe I saw Mr. Barrett find the tool part of this screw-driver.</p>

               <p>place, Tottenham-court-road. On Sunday morning, the 12th of March, be<lb></lb>tween eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoners came to my house, and took the one pair back room unfurnished—they did not sleep there that night—I went and engaged a bed for them—they came next day, brought some fur<lb></lb>niture, and put into the room—they remained there till the 17th of March, when Rourke was taken—I knew nothing of them after they took the room—I lived in the two pair front—I saw them in the house—they brought the things on the Monday morning—I suppose they staid there that night—I saw them in the course of the next day—I met them occasionally on the stairs from Monday to Thursday—I never was in their room, or they in mine—on the next Monday, Watford was brought to the room in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 193.) On Monday, the 20th of March, I saw Watford in the street, near the New Prison, Clerkenwell, between twelve and one o'clock—Rourke was then in that prison remanded—it was at the time when the friends of prisoners visit them—I asked her whether she used not to live as servant with Messrs. Green and Barrett, in the City-road—she said she did not know any such people—I asked her name—she said Rourke—I asked what she was, and where she lived—she said she was a dress-maker, and lived in Regent-street—I asked how she came to be there—she said she bad come to see her brother who she was informed was locked up for a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I took her into custody, and told her it was for robbing her employers, Messrs. Green and Barrett of a quantity of bills, and other articles—she continued to deny ever knowing any such people, or any such place—whilst going to the station she said, "It is no use denying it any longer; I am the person you allude to, and this is what I have come to through having a young man, but I am as bad as he, and he is as bad as me"—I was at the station, and saw Sergeant Brannan take from her hand the caddy spoon now produced—she said it belonged to her master—I afterwards went to her lodg<lb></lb>ing with Brannan, and found these bills in the hole in the floor under some oil-cloth—Watford said she had put them there to take care of them, and that she thought to have sent them back before.</p>

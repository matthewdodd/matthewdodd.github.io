I think he said, to bind a black petticoat; he would not let me wrap it up in paper; but slung it round his arm; on going out he opened a glass case; I went to shut it; and I went to the door, and saw two other boys at the door, a chimney sweeper and another; in about ten minutes he came back, and slid the glass case back, and very suddenly snatched a quantity of handkerchiefs; I jumped over the counter, and caught hold of his pocket, and tore it; some body pulled the door too, and pinched my thumb, that I could not hold him; he ran round a coach, and my master called stop thief: he was taken in Woodstock-street; I never lost sight of him till he got into a publick-house: he dropped the handkerchiefs as he ran round the coach, by the wheel; I saw them drop from his right side; I saw him go into the publick-house; he had a blue coat and black waistcoat on.</p>

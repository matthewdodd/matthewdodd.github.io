During the last year I cultivated a particular sort of onion, called the Globe onion - they are a very particular sort; I have not seen any of them in any London market - I had a number of them in a barn adjoining my house; and on the morning of the 14th of January I missed a great many; they were secured by boards, one of which had a particular mark on it; it has a notch in the middle of it - it was afterwards found in a cart; I can swear it was on my premises; I know it by its general appearance as well as the notch.</p>

            . I live at Fulham. I was standing at Mr. Metier's gate, on the 14th of January, and saw the cart of onions drawn by a donkey - the constable had charge of it; it was between four and five o'clock - there were four sacks of onions in it, and some loose; they left it in our place till the next day - it was put in our cart-house, and a waggon was put against the gate that no one could get to it; Kirby drove the cart - the next day they were taken away; I noticed two or three pieces of board in the cart on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you know the prisoners? A. Yes - it is part of their employ to go about the country, and buy bones, onions, and other things.</p>
               <p>MR. DEADMAN. I cannot swear to these other two boards, but I can to this one with the notice in it; here are some of the onions from the cart, and some from my stock- there is not a question, but they are the same sort; I do not know any man who grew such.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you grown that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180046"></xptr>kind of onion? A. Two years; I bought the seed at a seed shop in London - I bought all they had.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITH. I took the prisoners, and have had the onions ever since; these are part that were in the cart - these were taken from the bulk: and these are the boards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take the prisoners? A. Kirby I took at home, and George Abbott on the 16th- the other two I took at the Cock and Magpie, about three weeks after.</p>
               <p>EDWARD EDGSON. I assisted in taking the prisoners.</p>
               <p>JOHN SENDALL re-examined. Q. Why did you not have them taken when you saw them? A. They took the cart, and allowed Kirby to go, as he said he would send his master for the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know whose cart it was? A. Kirby said his master was Pendred - that he and Abbott bought them at Croydon, and he saw them; I said, "Your donkey could not draw them from there;" "Yes he could" he said.</p>

            , with a girl with them; the girl says, here is the watchman; damn the watchman, says the prisoner, if he speaks a word we will do him; I went ten after that; and at eleven I was standing at the watch-house door; and the two men and the girl were coming from the dancing school; so, says I, what you are come from the dancing school? yes, d - n your eyes, you b - r, says she, we are: I cried the hour of eleven and twelve; and at a quarter past twelve I heard somebody in the back lane; I put out my light, and came to Mr. Weatherall's door, very near the paling, up jumps Goodrick, with this rosemary, and the prisoner after him, both out of the garden; I knew them before: they had both rosemary under their arm, a good deal, an arm-full each; I followed them as close as possible; but when they came to the front I walked up sharply, and they made a bit of a run; and at the Cannon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130090"></xptr>they dropped them; that may be about ten or twelve houses from Mr. Weatherall's: I took up a bit, and found it the same as a bit I had picked up before, where I saw them come over the rails. They made off, and went up towards the town. I have known the prisoner seven years.</p>
               <p>Look at him: are you sure he is the man that came over Mr. Weatherall's pales with the rosemary? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man that went to the Cannon with Goodrick, and dropped some more there? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You had put out the light you know at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - Cloudy; very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Any moon at all? - I do not think there was; none to be seen.</p>
               <p>Then it must be pretty dark? - No, it was not over and above dark.</p>
               <p>Why did not you call out? - Because the prisoner knocked me down twice last year in the back lane.</p>
               <p>Was he punished for that? - No.</p>
               <p>How came the man to assault you, and knock you down twice? - We had a bit of a tussle, and three or four more women and himself came and begged my pardon; and I forgave him.</p>
               <p>Had you and he been very good friends at this time? - No variance. I did not see him during the week that he was not taken up; I waited to let my master know; I did not take him for this offence: he was in prison.</p>

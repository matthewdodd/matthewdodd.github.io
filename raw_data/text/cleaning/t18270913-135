On the 8th of September the prisoners came to purchase some print - we showed them several - none suited - they bought none; and as soon as they left, I missed a piece of cotton. I ran out, but not seeing them, came in again, and my sister said something. I then missed another piece, and ran out again and passed a street, and in returning met them coming out of that street. I told them I missed two prints; they said they would go back if I made no alarm, and as I got to the door, I stopped to call a neighbour - they got a little before me into the shop. I went in and saw the green-print go from Hurley's hand on the counter - the other piece was then on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. They gave you a good deal of trouble, did not they? A. Yes; there were several prints on the counter. I did not miss the green pieces first - one of them had a basket, I think it was Hurley - they offered to be searched afterwards; neither of them had a green shawl on, that I observed.</p>

            . My sister called me into the shop; she ran out, and I missed the green print; she ran in again - I said the green print was also gone; she ran out, and brought them back, and I saw the green print in the basket, before it was thrown on the counter; and, soon after, I saw both pieces on the counter; Hurley then said,"Search me;" I said, "There is no occasion to search you, you have thrown enough out of your basket;" she said, "Will you swear a person's life away in that manner! Oh! what lies."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had one of them a green shawl on? A. Yes; I am sure the prints were not on the counter a few minutes before.</p>

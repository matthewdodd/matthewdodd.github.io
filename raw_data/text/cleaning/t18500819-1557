                  </hi>. I live in Brook-street, Lambeth. On Sunday night, 11th Aug., Rigby stopped me in Pleasant-place, Lambeth—she asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand.</hi> something to drink—I did not do it—she still clung round me, and I missed my watch, which had been in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—there was a chain to it, which went round my neck, and through a button<lb></lb>hole—she broke the pin of the watch in pulling it—there was at that time a man a few yards off—he came past, and I saw his hand and Rigby's touch each other—he said, "Look sharp, Julia"—he went away, and Rigby was going away—I was following her, and the policeman came up—I know I had my watch two minutes before Rigby came up.</p>

            . I am a parish-constable. I heard of this business, and took the prisoner on the evening of the 11th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, in Cow cross- the moment I took hold of him, and told him of the business, he knocked me down, and another officer came to my assistance.</p>

            . I had information of this; on the evening the prisoner was taken I saw him knock Terry down; I went up to him; he said he would go quietly if he knew what he was taken for; I said it was for stealing a cask of white lead, and he must go to the station - he said if that was the case he must go to the Compter, not to the station, as that was a City job.(Prisoner's Defence, written.) On the 21st day of February last I was in Smithfield, when, from a cart which was passing. I saw a cask fall; I immediately took the cask up, and was about to heave it into the cart again, when the driver of the cart came to me, struck me a violent blow on the back with the butt end of his whip, and at the same time accused me with having stolen the cask; I, being fearful of the consequences of such a charge, certainly did, in my confusion, drop the cask, and make off as fast as I possibly could. About eighteen or twenty days after this, being present at a street quarrel, a constable who was there took me into custody, and the driver of the cart came forward to Hatton-garden Police-office, and preferred this charge against me.</p>

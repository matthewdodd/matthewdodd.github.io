I was sitting in the kitchen on the 19th of December, and heard a person sing out that a pair of shoes were taken - I ran up stairs, and saw the prisoner turning the corner of Shovel-alley; I went and took him with these shoes, which had been brought in about three hours before, and I had hung them up at the door - I missed two pairs, but one pair had fallen down.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found them on the pavement, more than two feet from the house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EAST. I took them from under his jacket, and he said that was just what he wanted; he wanted to go to prison.</p>

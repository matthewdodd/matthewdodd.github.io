               <p>Edward Carter. On Sunday morning the 6th of this instant, I was informed my house had been broke open; I missed the things mentioned. On, Tuesday morning I went amongst the brokers. I saw my stove standing at a door in Peter-street. I enquir'd how they came by it, I was told they bought it. I told them it was mine, and desired if the persons that brought it should come again, to stop them. I went to another place, and was sent for back; they had stop'd the two persons who came again, they were two women; we have them here to give evidence. I examined them how they came by them; they said their husbands gave them to them to sell, I had found a watering pot of mine at the other place, and ordered the people there to stop the person that brought it, if they came again; than I had word brought me, the person was stopt who brought that. I found all the goods, at different places.</p>

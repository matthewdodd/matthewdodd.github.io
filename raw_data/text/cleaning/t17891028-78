               <p>I am just turned of fifteen; I know the nature of an oath; if I speak wrongfully, I must suffer hereafter. On the 11th of September, I had a basket of linen delivered to me between twelve and one, at Clapton; I was going to Mrs. Hart's in Mansion-house-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280073"></xptr>a mangler; and the prisoner met me by the Mansion-house, in Mansion-house-street; and he asked me if I did not want Mrs. Hart? I said yes; he said she had removed down Leadenhall-street, and he would shew me where she lived; I followed him; and just as I got by the top of Leadenhall-street, I asked him if I was not almost there; and he got me down Creed-lane, by Creed Church; I did not know where it was; he took me down Hooker's-gardens; and another man met him; and the prisoner told the other man, says he, you take this to Mrs. Harts; and the other man said he would; and the prisoner said, make haste back? and he said he would; and the prisoner detained me five or ten minutes, and left me; the other man went the way to Leadenhall-street; the prisoner said he would go to get change for half a crown, and return directly, but he did not; I picked the man out among five or six more in the Poultry Counter; I swear that is the man.</p>

               <p>Are not you a jewess? - I am a widow; I live in Whitechapel parish, Dove-court; I know the prisoner; he lodged in my house two years; I have trusted him when I have been out of town for a month or two, and I always found my place as I left it; he was up at six in the morning in summer, and seven in the winter; I never knew him to keep any bad hours; I have no lodgers but him, being a lone woman: I did not choose to keep the house by myself; I know at that time, I heard some men come into the place; I asked him what was the matter; to the best of my knowledge, he was not out.</p>

               <p>What day was that? - The day of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the month? - No, I do not; I am a very forgetful person; it is about five week ago, to the best of my knowledge; he is troubled with the rheumatism in his limbs, and he will not work; he sits down in a chair, and says his limbs fail him; he is an engraver; he complained; I am obliged to go through their place (it is a bottom place) for water every five minutes; I did not sit with him all that day; about four o'clock I was down, and he was below drinking a little hot tea; and he was in at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>When did he go out? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>I thought you said he did not go out at all.</p>

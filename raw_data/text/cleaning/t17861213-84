               <p>I keep the Green-man Tavern, New-street, Covent-garden. On the 30th of November, the prisoner at the bar came to my house about two in the afternoon; and went out and did not return till four. I found Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Conn, two neighbours, in the parlour, drinking a pint of porter, the prisoner was asleep on one side of the fire place; as we had lost a parcel out of that room, they suspected the prisoner, and suggested he was not asleep;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130094"></xptr> they went out of the room soon after; and I went and searched in the cupboard to see if there was any thing I could lose; I looked in the cupboard, and saw nothing but a few brass candlesticks; I went into the tap-room; and I heard a lock shut; I went into the room, and saw the prisoner turning from the cupboard to the fire place; in about a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come through the room with a bundle under his left arm, he went thro' us all, and was taken with the bundle upon him; I saw him taken, it contained a great coat and a pair of boots belonging to the prosecutor, which were in the parlour.</p>

               <p>I looked thro' a sash door, and saw him open this cupboard door of Mr. Clarkson's, and shut it again, in consequence of which I went into the yard, to see if I could see it plainer, when I was in the yard I could not distinguish any thing in the room, then I followed after him; and he was stopped about fifty yards from the house; I was six yards distance, he had this bundle under his left arm; I asked him what he had there, he seemed very much alarmed, and said it was a great coat, I asked him if it was his, he said no, but he had lost one; it contained a great coat and a pair of boots, this is the bundle, I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>As to my swearing, that I saw him with these boots and things and bundle I did not, there was a curtain to the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am afraid I shall not be able to say as much as I could wish in my own defence; but however, as I am convinced I shall receive every indulgence, I beg my defence may be read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this is his defence, which he wishes to be read; and I can assure the Court I have not altered it, it is his own composition. -</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am well aware how much incapable I am of addressing myself to you, on so critical and so trying an occasion as the present; but as I am convinced you will afford me every indulgence consistent with my situation, I must request your attention, to what, I hope, will at least excite your pity, if not prove a mitigation for my punishment. The fact for which I am here arraigned, has been so very fully established, that I will take up but little of your time in animadverting upon the evidence received by your Lordship from the witnesses; that little, will be merely in observing, that as all the witnesses (except Inshaw, the owner of the property) have uniformly declared, that they watched me throughout the whole proceeding; I wish to suggest, that in consequence of their testimony in that respect, whether it does not do away the capital part of the offence; inasmuch as they might have prevented me from removing the property out of the back parlour, much less out of the house, as I had the tap-room to pass through, where the witnesses were in waiting, and the bar also to pass by; how far the construction of the law may in that case be in my favour, I leave your Lordship to inform the Gentlemen of the Jury: - My Lord, I have great reason to suppose (although I know not that it will avail me any thing) that the prosecution has been carried on at the expence of the Parish, in which the fact was committed; and that the matter would probably have been dropped, had that not have been the case: I have likewise to mention the extreme unwillingness of the owner to prosecute: He comes from Birmingham, and he much wished, I believe, to drop the prosecution; for, on being sworn at Bow-street the morning after I was apprehended, and, on entering into a recognizance for his appearance, he, unacquainted with his situation, and the necessity there was for attendance at this place, asked Mr. Justice Bond if he was at liberty to return, as he much wished to proceed upon his own affairs; he received an answer in the negative; but was at the same time informed, that if it was distressing to his circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130095"></xptr> to attend the trial, by an application to this court, he would be reimbursed his expences; from all which, I infer, that had Inshaw, the owner of the coat and boots, been left to his own discretion, the prosecution would not have been carried on, had the expences attending it, not been defrayed by the parish. My Lord, this being the first time I ever was brought to this, or any other bar, I hope will have its due weight with the Court: My friends, who attend in my behalf being numerous, and all men of excellent character, and approved integrity, of my former general character they will give you the best account: My Lord, five years (a great part of the late war) I served as midshipman in the navy, and I hope with credit and reputation to myself; I have here three certificates to prove my character, both as an officer and as a man; I have no doubt but that the Captain, by whom two of them are signed, would have willingly appeared, was he in town; but he is at present on board his ship; if, however, he had attended, he could not have said more for me, than he has already done in those certificates. My Father was formerly in a respectable, if not a capital line of business in the Strand; but by unforeseen misfortunes and accidents, is now much reduced; his friends, however, did not forsake him; and through their interest it was I got the situation in his Majesty's service I have mentioned; at present, therefore, it was not in his power to support me:</p>
               <p>I need not inform your Lordship that on the peace being concluded, I, with hundreds more of the same rank, was left destitute and unprovided; but I have to acquaint your Lordship, that since April, 1783, I have supported myself genteely, and maintained that character, which I have only to grieve I ever lost, embracing every opportunity of getting an honest livelihood, in hopes that my friends would at last have found out an eligible prospect for my getting a living; until about two months ago; when losing every hope, I was compelled to pledge most of my own books, wearing apparel, &amp;c. of which I had a good quantity, and at last to do that act for which I now appear at your bar: Among many other occasions of procuring subsistence was that of officiating as a <rs id="t17861213-84-deflabel439" type="occupation">clerk to Mr. Alderman Watson</rs>

            , to all of whom I gave entire satisfaction. My Lord, after the very humiliating and mortifying circumstance of appearing as a criminal in this Court, be my fate what it may, I cannot but think it an indispensable duty, to my numerous and respectable friends, to quit this kingdom; I have only therefore to request, that if it lies in your breast, I may rather be permitted to become a VOLUNTARY EXILE than leave my native country as a WRETCHED CONVICT.</p>
               <p>I beg leave, in the most unfeigned manner, to return my sincere and hearty acknowledgements to this Court, for the great indulgence I have received by taking up so much of your time, and for the attention that has been shewn me during the whole of my trial; assuring them, that I shall receive with the most profound humility, that verdict which a Jury of my countrymen shall think proper to inflict, at the same time acquainting them, I throw myself entirely on the mercy and lenity of this honourable Court.</p>

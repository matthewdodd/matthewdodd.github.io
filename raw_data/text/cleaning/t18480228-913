On Sunday morning, 20th Feb., as I was going home, through Strutton-ground, Westminster, Gentleman struck me in the face, and knocked me down; and Clark, who was with him, knelt on me directly, and put his hand over my mouth, while Gentleman took my money—Clark asked Gentleman if he had got it—he said, "Yes," and they ran away—my face was cut, and my pocket's torn out—I had a purse, with a half-sovereign, and I think 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I lost that—I knew Clark before—I am quite sure they are the two men—it was light—it was about two o'clock—I am brought here in custody—there is a charge against me, for which I am confined in the House of Detention.</p>

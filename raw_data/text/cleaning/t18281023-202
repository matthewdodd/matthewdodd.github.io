               <p>GEORGE WILDASH. My daughter, Sarah Susannah Wildash, is seventeen months old: on the 12th of October, while I was at dinner, I ordered my servant to take her out; she then had a necklace round her neck - the servant returned in about eight minutes, and asked for me; I ran down stairs, and she said, "Sir, here is a boy who has stolen the necklace;" I went out, and saw a person holding the prisoner by the collar - I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I took out the child on the 12th - the prisoner was standing behind us; he put his hand up to the baby's neck; she turned round, and said, Ah! I should not have noticed the prisoner, if the child had not turned round; I missed the necklace, and caught hold of the prisoner - I held him about three minutes, and he dropped the necklace from the bottom of his trousers; I knew they were the child's - I held him; he begged of me to let him go - he then threw off his shoe, and asked me to let him go, and put it on, but I kept him till the witness came and took him - there were several other persons near us, but not so near as the prisoner; he was close to us.</p>

            . I was at my door, and heard a scuffle; the girl said the boy had robbed the child of the beads - I took hold of him, and she went for her master; the prisoner begged me to let him go, or he should lose his place - he said a boy gave them him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

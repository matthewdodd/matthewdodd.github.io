                  </hi>. I live at 14, Lucy's-buildings, Laystall-street, and am a drover. The prisoner is my stepson; I married his mother—up to 8th Aug., when this occurred, we had always been good friends—he has three sisters, also the children of my wife by her former husband, Ellen is the name of one of them—I have no children—on 8th Aug. the prisoner came home about half past 6 o'clock in the evening—nothing of any importance occurred then—about half past 7 he came home again, and brought a female with him—I had not seen her above three or four times before—they had tea together at my house, and we had a pot of beer together—he was not tipsy then—he went out again, and returned between 11 and 12 alone, and very tipsy—he spoke very much against his sister Ellen, and called her names, and I took her part—she was in the habit of coming to see her mother—she was not there then, she had gone home; she was in service at Islington-green—I do not recollect what it was he said—I and my wife went upstairs to go to bed, and the prisoner remained downstairs—we occupied two rooms—I had got my trowsers off, and I spoke to him as he was below; he could hear me—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, you have taken your young woman home, then?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, just merely out of a bit of a joke, "I have seen that young woman in her <hi rend="italic">smock</hi> many a time"—he then began to call me names, and abuse me, and his mother spoke to him, and said, "Why, you foolish fellow, you don't suppose for a moment that he has seen her without one"—he began abusing me and calling me names, and I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, I won't have that noise there, I want to get up early to go to my work"—he still</p>

               <p>kept calling me names, and I got a little <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> out of temper—I said, "I won't have that noise there; I shall come downstairs, and see if I can't alter it" he replied, "If you come down near me I'll alter you"—I then ran down-stairs with my trowsers in my hand—he heard me coming and got out of the room into the court—I put on my trowsers, and went and saw him standing in the court with something in his hand, I could not see what it was distinctly—he said, "If you come out here, I will run you through"—I said, "You will? I ain't afraid of you"—my stick stood in the corner behind the cup<lb></lb>board door, and I took that in my hand and went out into the court—I cannot say whether I struck him or no with it first, but he came and flew on me and plunged an instrument into my side, I cannot say what it was—when I first went out at the door I recollect seeing my stick fall—we struggled together, close against my own window—I was clinging to him—he said, "Let me go"—I never answered, and when he found that I would not leave go of him, he gave me another desperate stab in the side—I then let go of him, and staggered to the opposite neighbour's window and fell on the ground, I bled very much—there was nobody there to part us—I laid on the stones for some minutes, and was then put on a barrow and taken to the hospital—I have been there ever since, and have come from there now—I did not, to my knowledge, strike the prisoner at all with my stick; I had it in my hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Edwin Nellis, of 24, Lucy's-buildings, nearly facing the prosecutor's. On 8th Aug., about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I heard cries of "Murder!"—I looked out of window to see what was the matter, and saw the prosecutor's wife in the court in her nightclothes—she was crying "Murder!"—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor wrestling with a stick—that continued some few minutes—the stick was then thrown on one side, and the prisoner left the prosecutor—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand, or whether he had done anything to the prosecutor—the mother fetched the prisoner back—he was running round the corner, as if he was going away—I believe the prosecutor bad not been stabbed then—the mother brought him back—she then went indoors, and looked out of window crying "Murder!" again—the prisoner and prosecutor were both in the court, and were struggling together under the window—the prisoner then left the prosecutor, and directly he left there was an immense pool of blood—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand—after following the prisoner a certain distance, the prosecutor came back, pulled his shirt off, and gradually sunk under the opposite window, and there was another pool of blood there—he was taken indoors, and his wife came out and said, "Some one has mur<lb></lb>dered him, will not any one come to my assistance?"—the prisoner was not there then—I went and saw one of the wounds, and tied a cloth round the place to stop the bleeding—that wound was in the left side—he appeared very much exhausted, but I believe he was sensible.</p>

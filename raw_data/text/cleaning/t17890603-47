             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 27th of May, I received information that Mr. Salt was in town with a cart with something in a sack, and that he had gone with his cart to Mr. Pellett's, an ironmonger in St. John-street; I went there to know what he had brought, and they said he had brought a quantity of lead; I desired to see it; I saw a quantity of lead laying wet and dirty, which the man said the prisoner had brought there; I saw Mr. Pellett, and told him my suspicion; Mr. Pellett ordered it to be marked and brought to my house, then I went to Barnet and enquired, and was further informed; I met the prisoner and the cart on Finchly Common; I secured him; coming along to town in the coach, he asked me if I could get him admitted King's evidence; the next morning he jumped out, and endeavoured to make his escape; and he endeavoured a second time to make his escape, and struck at me several times; he then asked me if I could get him admitted an evidence; I took him before Mr. Justice Trignet; the Justice asked him how he came by that lead; he said he had had it in his well a year and a quarter, that was the reason he gave for its being so wet, when he sold it; I then took the lead down to Mount House in the chaise, and in the presence of Mr. Lambert, and Butler the gardener, I fixed it to the place from whence it apparently came from; it is the same length and width as the premises, and the same nail-holes and hold-fast holes; upon a second examination before the magistrate, the lead was then again produced, Mr. Salt said that it did not come off of the green-house, and that he bought it, but refused to give any account to the magistrate where; I have the lead here.</p>
               <p>You knew Salt before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Fifty such men as he could not have caught me, if I had had a mind to run away; I want to ask him whether he did not swear wrongfully? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>- LAMBERT sworn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know him.</p>
               <p>I live near the spot; I was present when the lead was compared; I wish not to pay the same compliment to the prisoner, that he has to me, of knowing me, for I do not know him, but by hear say; I went to see if this lead did match; and it matched so particularly well, that in my opinion I have not the least doubt, but it came from that green house, in every particular; and sometimes, I know in a court where constables come to be examined, that their evidence is not always right; and I was determined to go and see, I took a ladder and went on top of the green house and measured it myself, and I marked it, and the lead is here, so far as I suppose, with a deal of modesty to the prisoner, I think it is the lead.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lambert. My Lord, I would not have mentioned it otherwise, but this man has been on board the ballast lighter before, and he says he never was tried before.</p>

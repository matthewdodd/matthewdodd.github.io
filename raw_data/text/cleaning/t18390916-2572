                  </hi>. I have been a seaman, but now work alongshore. On the 5th of September I was at a beer-shop in the Commercial-road—the prisoner Smith was with me—I know nothing of Loader—I had one sovereign, one half-sovereign, three shillings in silver, and some copper—I kept it in a tobacco-pouch, in my waistcoat pocket—I was the worse for liquor—I know I had the money when I went to the house—Smith sat by my side—I was in liquor and sleepy—I did not mist my money till I was told of it—I then looked in my pouch and it was gone—I have known Smith eight years—her husband worked alongside me eight years—the policeman same in and took the party that was in the house—I have had a sovereign back.</p>

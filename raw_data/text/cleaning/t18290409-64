            . I am an officer. On the 10th of March I was on duty in Whitechapel with Briscoe; I saw the three prisoners following four carts coming to town, loaded with hay; behind one of them there was a basket of poultry - I could not tell what it was, but I saw it attracted their attention; I watched them, and saw Mercer cross the road, and then return to his companions - they walked on a little farther, and were within a yard or two of each other; when they got opposite the hospital, Mercer crossed the road again; he went very near the cart, and again returned to his companions - they had some conversation, then Mercer and Presnall left Hilt, who continued to walk on the pavement; they went to the cart; Mercer cut down the basket - he caught hold of one end of it, and Presnall the other, and they went down Greyhound-lane, and I followed them - they dropped the basket, and ran; I overtook Mercer, and saw something in his hand, and on going to take it he dropped this knife on the pavement - I took Hilt about ten o'clock the same morning; I went to Stone, who was with the cart, and asked him if they were his ducks - he said they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known Hilt before? - A. Yes; and I went to his father's house afterwards - Hilt kept walking on; he might see me go up to the other men, I do not know - he did not attempt to touch the ducks; I cannot tell what conversation took place between them; it was about seven o'clock in the morning when I saw them - Presnall was taken afterwards.</p>

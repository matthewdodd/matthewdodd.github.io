               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he not been engaged in a great many concerns? A. It was our object that he should be so; but I believe he has been neglectful - I have in some instances been dissatisfied with him, but he has complained of the times - he has generally asked me on Saturday when I was drawing drafts for different persons, to let him have a sovereign or two, or what he wanted; I never refused him; and on every quarter-day he gave a receipt in his own hand-writing; but there was a balance against him in general; I should say that on the 6th of February, and on the 27th also, he was overpaid, or fully paid for his services - I will not swear that we were not indebted to him, but to the best of my belief he was always overpaid - I have often said to him, "If you do not take care you will overdraw your salary" - I had no particular confidence in him, but I considered him an honest man - he had to go round and receive orders - he might have been employed in our shipping concerns, but to a very small extent - he was chiefly engaged about town - he opened a small account at Greenwich, and at one or two other places; but they were extremely prejudicial to us - he may on some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280096"></xptr>occasions have bought at the docks but very little - he never brought money at the end of the week but immediately he had received it; if my own brother received money he would bring it to me directly - when the prisoner went to a distance he was allowed his coach hire - I do not recollect any sum having been paid by Mc Gee &amp; Co. to the prisoner about June, 1832.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not after the 17th of September, when you discharged him, send a message to him requiring him to settle his accounts? A. No; there was no negotiation carried on between us, and the prisoner's family respecting settling his accounts; his wife called on me and requested me not to prosecute him, and requested me to take this bond, which I said, I believe was useless, as it seemed to be out of date; I said, I would refer it to my solicitor; I forget whether I took it, or told her to take it - there was no other proposition made to settle his accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not content to refer this document to your solicitor? A. I put it into his hands to ascertain whether it was good or not, but certainly not to compound the debt - I never made any application to raise money on it - I think this bond was referred to our solicitor about a week after the prisoner was discharged - I never saw him in the docks before he was arrested - I never went to his home - I never said that a great deal of harm might occur to me from his leaving.</p>

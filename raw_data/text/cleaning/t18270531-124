This copper was fixed in the wash-house, which is in my yard - it is part of my premises - it does not join the house; the yard is mine, and the wash-house is part of the house; it was safe at six o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of April, and next morning, at six, I missed it.</p>

On the 7th of April, at a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw the prisoner coming down Nelson-street, with the copper on his head; I took hold of him, and asked what he was going to do with it - he threw it down, and got from me; I took him - he got from me again; I called Watch! and he was secured; I compared the copper with Mrs. Jones' wash-house - it fits exactly in every part.</p>

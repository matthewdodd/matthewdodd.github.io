On Saturday, the 27th of January, I went down to sleep there, and got there about six o'clock, and fastened the doors myself about half-past eleven o'clock. Mrs. Manton's two daughters, and one son, were at home. I got up at half-past seven o'clock next morning - it was light, and had been so about twenty minutes. I found the kitchen door open, which I had fastened the overnight, and a square of glass was broken out of the kitchen window, large enough for a man to get through. I looked about, observed a candle had been used, and saw the droppings of tallow where they had stuck it in the kitchen; I missed the linen from a basket, and the drawers were open. The linen was safe overnight. I found a hat left behind, on the dresser, some pieces of paper were in it, and concealed under the lining was a duplicate; the name of Parker was in the hat. I went to town to Lightfoot, and shewed him the duplicate.</p>

On Sunday morning we broke a bar in the kitchen window, and a pane of glass, got in, and opened the door of a room in a passage by the kitchen and saw a man in bed - he appeared awake, but never spoke. We found sixteen or seventeen shirts in the kitchen, two tablecloths, a pillow-case, and two glass cloths. We took a tinder-box and a candle with us, and struck a light before we got into the house. The man with me took a hut from the kitchen, and left his own. The moment we saw the man abed we made our escape, and returned to town; we went to my lodging, No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street, kept by Mrs. Thompson, where I lived with (

I asked her if she had any more shirts, or had pledged any? she said No. I then saw Williams in another room there, and shewed her a shirt, which I received from the pawnbroker. I asked her if that was the shirt she brought to pledge? she said Yes, and gave the same account as the other woman, and mentioned the house they went to - she said it was in Woodstock-court. I asked her if she had pledged any of the shirts before; she said she had not, and that she had no lodging. Jones heard her mention Woodstock-court and agreed that they slept there. I left Jones in the watch-house, and took Williams to point out the house; she shewed me No. 3, Woodstock-court. and herself asked the woman if she had not slept there last night.

Jones gave me her residence, No. 4, Simmon's-buildings, but said she had not slept there that night. I was present when Robinson and Powell were brought in, and the shirts taken from them. I searched Williams's lodgings on the evening of the 30th of January, and found a shirt, tablecloth, two napkins, and a towel - it was at No. 1, Baker's-court, East-street; she there went by the name of Jones. I learnt from her and Robinson that they lived together there by the name of Jones. I asked Powell when Wales took the shirt from him what he had done with the shooting jacket as he had one on yesterday; he said he never had one, and never wore any such thing. The same evening Wales and I went to M'Grath's, and found the shooting jacket. On the Thursday following, the 1st of February, I went again to M'Grath's, and she gave me a bundle.</p>

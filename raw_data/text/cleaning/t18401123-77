                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. I came to town from Shrewsbury on the 28th of October, and lodged at William Wells's, in Rid<lb></lb>ing-house-lane, Marylebone—the prisoner is the friend of a person who lived in the kitchen. On the 29th, I asked him to assist me in according my trunks, which he did—I unlocked my large trunk and took out a purse with twenty-eight sovereigns in it—I took out one sovereign, leaving twenty-seven, a ring, and sixpence—on Monday, the 2nd of November, I took out two more, leaving twenty-five, a ring, and a crooked sixpence—among the sovereigns was one split at the edge—I locked the trunk, and put the keys in my pocket—the prisoner was not with me then—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 5th, I went to the trunk to get more money, and found the lock broken off, and the money gone—I had only a farthing left—part of the trunk was broken—I had seen it over night, but not examined it, as the lock was turned against the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier. I was staying at this house, in Riding-house-lane, as I had come from the country—on the 3rd of November I and my wife called on Mr. Crow, who is well acquainted with the prisoner—I have known him fourteen years—they said they were all going out for a walk—the prisoner said, "Don't let us go out together; go out, and we will meet them at the corner"—we went round into Titchfield-street, to the Bell public-house—he said, "Come in here and have a glass of ale"—he threw down a sovereign, which I saw was split at the edge—the landlady objected to it, and showed it to a gentleman at the bar—he said, "It is very good, but I should be sorry to take it, as I could not change it,,—the prisoner said, "Well, then, here is another, and if you don't like that, here is another"—we then left, and met our other friends at the bottom of the street—we went down Great Titchfield-street—I waited rather behind the others, and when I came up to my wife, she said, in the prisoner's presence, "Robert has given me a sovereign"—I said, "Robert, I don't want that, I have just received my wages, and don't want it"—my wife did not return it to him—we went on to Oxford-street, and met Mr. Crow and some friends—the prisoner said to me, "Come with me into the City, I am going to see about a parcel; I have a letter, and am going to receive some money from my friends, and there will be a hare and things; you may as well cook them for me"—he took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I said, "It</p>

I have left it at home, I quite forgot that"—I saw him with four or five sovereigns—we dined in St. Martin's-le-grand, and then went to another house and had refreshment—he paid on all occasions, and treated the <hi rend="italic">cab-man</hi>—he seemed to be known by all the <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> men and hackney coach drivers—he said he had received the money from the country, that when he awoke up that morning he found a letter for him from the country—we went from St. Martin's-le-grand to Whitechapel, opposite the work-house—he told us to stop there half an hour—we stopped there two hours—he there gave my wife fifteen sovereigns to take care of, and one she had before made sixteen—I cannot say whether the split sovereign was among them—we stopped there till four or five o'clock, and then returned in the same <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was treating every body, <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> men and omnibus pro<lb></lb>prietors—he said he was going to see after his license, which they had in their possession, and on returning home he bought my wife a ring, un<lb></lb>known to me, which cost 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and bought the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> men two or three handkerchiefs—he bought several other handkerchiefs—I am not sure whether he spent 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we went on the coach-stand in Holborn, and had plenty of drink, nothing but port wine and brandy—he gave that to the coachmen—he then told the <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man to drive to a shoe-shop in Oxford-street, and told my wife to purchase a pair of shoes, which she did—we then proceeded to the stand where we had first met in the morning, and there met a <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man belonging to the same yard as we were at before—the prisoner said, "I owe this <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I must have it"—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the presence of another <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man—we then had some more brandy and water, and my wife and I went with him to the yard—I returned him the fifteen sovereigns, as he wanted it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On Tuesday afternoon, the 3rd of November, I met the prisoner and my husband in Titchfield-street—he gave me a sovereign—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I observed a chased ring on, the prisoner's finger—I do not know what became of it—it was not solid gold—we went to a public-house, and had something to drink, and in the evening, at one public-house, I saw him with a bent sixpence—he took it up again, and said he would not lose it for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the day after we were in a coach, he took his money out of his pocket, and said he wanted to get rid of something—he put his money on the cushion of the coach, and said to my husband, "Do you see any thing?" and at the same time threw something out, which appeared to me to be the bent sixpence—it went into the road and was lost—it was bent on each side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Weils, the housekeeper. On Tuesday morning I was washing in the back-kitchen, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner up and down stairs several times, and on Monday evening, the 2nd of November, as well—he was very tipsy—I had a great deal of linen about, and seeing the prisoner about I asked my husband for the key of the kitchen to lock it up, as I did not like his appearance—about half-past eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning he went up to the top of the house without any shoes on, and was gone about twenty minutes—Clifford lodges at the top of the house—he came down, put his shoes on, and went out of doors—I never saw him again till he was in custody—another man was taken to the station-house on suspicion, and I told them I had seen the prisoner go up without any shoes on.</p>

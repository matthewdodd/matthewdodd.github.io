               <p>JURY to MR. ELLIS. Q. From your missing your handkerchief till you saw the prisoner, what time elapsed? A. Not half a minute - a baker told me he saw the boy pick my pocket; he had not time to throw it away - I ran so fast, he was taken in about three minutes; the prisoner was the only one I saw running.</p>

Nash knocked at our door, and asked the rent of the house, No. 17, Gloster place. I told him - he then asked if he could have a sight of it. I said yes, and gave him the key - it was a little distance off. I followed him to the house - he had got in before I got there, and shut the door. I did not see him go in. I gave a double<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120092"></xptr>knock, and he came down - both the prisoners came out - he shut the door and gave me the key, and asked me whose house it was; I said Mr. Wallis's, (there was a bill up to let it) - he asked what time he could see Mr. Wallis. I said nine o'clock in the morning was the best time. He asked about the taxes - I said Mr. Wallis would inform him. He came out of the gate down the road, and crossed the fields towards Sommer's-town. I went into the house, and found a lock taken off the door, and laid on the drawing room stairs. I found the locks taken off all the doors, and put in a bag in the house - there were six in all. None were carried out of the house, but some of the handles were gone. They both went away together. I was in the house about a week before - the locks were all fixed then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The house was only kept single locked. - A. No: I had not shewn the house to anybody, as a family had just left - Mr. Palmer had it before. I got to the house in less than ten minutes after them. I sent a man after them on finding the locks off.</p>

            . Googh alarmed me, and desired me to follow the prisoners, who were about fifty yards off. I followed them near half a mile, and took them, with Fletcher's assistance - they were together. I saw Johnson throw a lock and some brass away.

            . On the 25th of October I was at work in my garden - heard a cry of stop thief - looked round and saw the prisoners running violently. When they came up to me, I saw Johnson throw several things from his pockets. I dont know what they were, one thing looked like a watch. I called out, "It is all over with you, for you may depend upon it I'll have you." He jumped over a ditch into my garden, and then over a hedge; - his foot slipped, and he fell. I saw him throw some screws from his pocket - I seized him, and Bittle took Nash - we took them to the watch-house - returned, and in the way they ran a bell pull was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fulwood's-rents, Holbom. On the 18th of November I was employed to conduct a sale of furniture in the Old Kent-road—the prisoner was standing about there, and I delivered him a dining table to take to a place—he returned, and said he was to take a looking-glass to the same place—I said I could not attend to him—I went up stairs, and when I came down, he had taken the glass down, I asked him where the bill was—he said it was all right, that he had given it to me—he had given the bill of the table, but not of the glass—it was the property of Mr. Hassell—it was sent in there from him for another person, and he has since paid for it—the prisoner took it out, and asked me to lend him a board to put it on, and said he should return in a quarter of an hour, but he never came back at all—I did not see him again till last Monday week, as he came out of the Compter.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Frederick Price, of Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street. On the 30th of Aug., about twelve o'clock at night, I was in High-street, Borough—the prisoner stopped me, and wished me to go to a house in King-street with her, which I would not do—she would not leave me—after refusing her several times, we went into a public-house, and I gave her a pint of beer, with an understanding that she was to leave me—that was five minutes after I first met her—we came out—I told her to go one way, and I would go the other—she would not, but kept hold of my arm, and followed me—she pulled me into another public-house by force, and called for some gin—I told her she ought not to do it—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—we came out—I told her to have me—we stood still together ten minutes, opposite the Town-hall—I</p>

This case had been laid out upon the counter for a customer. I missed it as soon as they were gone. I was going to pursue the prisoner, but a woman came into the shop; so I did not follow them. About half an hour afterwards the prisoner came back and looked in at the shop window. I went out and brought him into the shop; he said he had a pedlar's licence; he took one out of his pocket in a tin box, and laid it down; at the same time with his other hand he laid the case down upon the counter. I saw it the moment he took his hand up.</p>

I heard him say to my master, Sir, I am a pedlar: he put his right hand into his pocket, and took out a tin case; he threw it down, and bid my master look at his licence: then he put this case down upon the edge of the counter with his left hand; I saw him do it; then he draw'd himself away from it.</p>

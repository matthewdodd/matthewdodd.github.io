               <p>I am a constable; there was a coat delivered to me, and the rest by different pawnbrokers before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Nash. This is the coat lappelled cut out the wrong way by one of my journeymen in a mistake, I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What are you? - I am a taylor, woollen draper and salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your partner? - None at all, I never had any.</p>
               <p>Q. You met the prisoner in the street? - I saw him in the street, he was on the opposite side of the way, I crossed over to him, he said he had got shirts there, and other things his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he had them of a cousin of your's? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money have you given him since he was in custody? - What he demanded as his right, fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take two guineas from the prisoner? - I did not, I took it out of a chest; I gave him fifteen shillings of it, which he demanded as his right, he said the rest was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you gave him the fifteen shillings? - Nothing more particularly.</p>

            ? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make some promise to him if he would be a good boy? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing about the two guineas before the sitting magistrate? - I did not mention it, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take the two guineas out of the chest? - I did, I asked him whether it was his or mine, he said it was mine, but fifteen shillings that was his own. I asked him if he had any more demands on me? he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two guineas and fifteen shillings? - No, two guineas out of which I returned him fifteen shillings; I took out these buckles, neckcloth and stockings, and told them if they were his to take them; he said they were mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Was it before or after the promise you made him, that he told you that these buckles were your's, and this neckcloth? - I know nothing of any promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you made him no promise whatever, recollect yourself a little? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us understand what you mean by promise, perhaps you mean one thing by it and I another? - When I met him I asked him what property he had got? and where he was going?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him about confessing in the way of a promise? - Nothing to that purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems nothing passed about your cousin at all? - Very few word; nothing that I can bring against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he had received them of him? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

The prisoner Doyle offered this pair of shoes to me on the 29th of June—she had pledged a pair of shoes the day before—it was a pair of kid slippers—she offered them—I asked her whose they were—she said her own—knowing that she had pledged a pair of shoes the day before, I asked if she dealt in shoes—she said, "No"—then again asked whose they were—she said her son's—I then asked her where her son lived—she said, "No. 4, Duke-street"—she seemed much agitated, and I went to the door and called the policeman—she had pledged a pair of shoes before, in the name of Ann Smith, Jane-street.</p>

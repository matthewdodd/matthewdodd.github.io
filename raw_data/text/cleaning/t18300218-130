            . I am a Police-constable. I apprehended the prisoner yesterday fortnight in Old-street, and told him it was for pawning two clocks of the prosecutor's; he gave no answer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLEMENTS. I am an officer. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in - I found a parcel of duplicates on him, and one for this clock among them.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. This is the counterpart of the duplicate for this clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Carter did not request me to take the clock home that day - it was not in a proper state to take to the owner till properly repaired; I took it home for that purpose - Mr. Carter was holding my wages in his hands, and only paid me yesterday; as to my earning 15s. a week, I was in his employ from August, and all I have received from him was 5l. - I received the principal part of that yesterday at the Police-office; I desired his man to ask him for a sovereign, and he would not give it to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARTER. He asked me for 10s. on Saturday night, and I gave him a sovereign - I did not know what I was indebted to him; I repeatedly requested his account, and never could get it from him; whatever he asked me for, he always had.</p>

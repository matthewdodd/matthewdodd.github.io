I took him to the Compter, and them went with Mr. Cumberland to his lodging, where we found some copper-plates, cuts, and other things. When I took them out of his hat I asked what they were - he said waste paper, and he wanted to paper his room with them - I asked if his master allowed him waste paper, and he said No.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time had they money in your hands - A. They had considerably above sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that check your signature - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is the body of that check - A. Mr. Grose's, the prisoner; the filling up is in the hand writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you hold in your hand the check-book, with the counterpart of the check - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Read the counterpart - A. 8th of July, Rickards and Boller, sixty pounds, interest eleven shillings, and by the side of it is casting up the interest, which is usual sixty-six days interest, from May the 3rd; that is the prisoner's hand writing. I rather think I was engaged at the time that I signed it. The accompting house that I sit in is remote from the accompting-house to which persons come.</p>
               <p>Q. By the number of the checks signed that day, does it appear to be late or early in that day - A. There are but three checks signed that day. I cannot exactly tell by that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, refer to your books for the entry I have already alluded to; how lately before had you made your annual rest - A. I cannot exactly say; the time we finish is the nearest Saturday to Michaelmas day. June the 27th was he rest day in this instance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find any entry in the prisoner's hand writing which applies to this transaction - A. Yes; there is one through three of the books of his hand writing; this is the Trade Ledger; the entry that I fix upon there is Bollam and Company, on the debtor side, to cash sixty pound eleven shillings; that is the hand writing of the prisoner; on the credit side, 27th June, by stock sixty pound, and July 10th, profit and loss, interest, sixty pounds eleven shillings; these entries are in the prisoner's hand writing. The next book in which you find it is the Trade Journal; on the 10th of July, Bollen and Company, to cash paid them, sixty pounds eleven shillings. The Cash Journal, 10th July, Boller and Company, notes and interest, sixty pounds eleven shillings; I believe it is note and interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any concern with any such person as Bollam and Company - A. No, sir; nor Ballon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any concern with Boller, excepting Rickards and Boller - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these entries ticked off, as if they had been examined - A. Yes, in the New Ledger; I cannot say by whom the ticking is, the writing; except in the Cash Journal, the note and interest, one part is Mr. Howson's, and other part Mr. Thorton senior; that is a superscription from the back of the counter check.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these entries in the book, copied as they are from the counter part of the check, did they serve to prevent any detection until they made their next annual rest - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. That next next annual rest you made last Midsummer - A. As near to it as we could, and when we came to that we found a deficiency of sixty pounds eleven shillings; that caused a great deal of examination, and ended in this discovery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you had no connection with Bollam and Company, or Bollen and Company - A. No, our only connection was with Rickards and Boller.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank of England; I bring from the office twelve bank notes for five-pound each, they have come from the Bank, and have been cancelled; they are 5,189, to 5,200, inclusive, all dated 4th June, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Thornton. Take these notes into your hand, and tell me whether you find the prisoner's hand writing upon any of them; look at the 5,200 - A. I. H. Grose, the prisoner's name, and East Smithfield, and Goodwin and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the Ledger - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Howson. Look at these notes, do you find any entry upon the back of them - A. Yes, I do; 5,193, and 93, here is Mr. Grose's name, written by himself; I suppose I received them of the prisoner. I know no other person of that name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask the present witness whether he was in the habit of paying money for Messrs. Goodwin and Co. - A. I was; the prisoner and other clerks likewise did, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose business was it to make the entries in the Cash Journal - A. I have generally done it; it appears I was absent that day, and I suppose the prisoner put it in; there are three or four entries of mine before that, and I believe the prisoner asked me to put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that I asked you to put it in - A. No. I cannot; I suppose so. I should have entered it without. There was a counter part in the Check book.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no money paid but what goes through your hands - A. Yes, there is; I have been in the habit of paying cash, but not checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you put any date to the note that you received of me, or had it been endorsed before - A. That I cannot say; if it had I should have put the name of the person upon it that I received it of.</p>
               <p>Q. You received it as a private note, and not in the way of business - A. I can say I received it of you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not prepared to make any defence for myself; the gentlemen of the jury as well as your lordship, have heard the crime that I am charged with; the last witness has summed up the whole of it; he does not know when he received it of me, or whether it was in his possession before, and to the last question I put to him he gave a very evasive answer. I am perfectly innocent of it. I trust you have seen enough of the case.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; that day, after I had called round my heat at three, it is general with us to patrole the other quarter till the half hour comes about; I was walking along Bell yard, facing Mr. Carter's house, and I saw the handle of something sticking up through the pallisadoes; I had the curiosity to put my hand, and lift it up; it was very heavy; I found it was a hammer, and I put it down in the same manner; I could see nobody; I stood at the door and saw the name of Mr. Carter, book-binder, and I judged it to be a beating-hammer; I went my beat, and came back again, and thought, what shall I do with this hammer? I will put it down and hide it; as I was putting it down, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, through the window; I spoke to him; says I, do you belong to the house? he made no reply, neither did he wag or stir; I thought he might belong to the house; I saw the casement open, and I said, why don't you take the hammer in, somebody will steal it, or take it away; he made no reply, and I rather spoke louder, I thought he might be hard of hearing; he still made no reply; I did not know what to do with the hammer; I cast my eye round, and saw one of my partners, a watchman; then I let the hammer lay, and went towards the watchman; says I, a hammer lays here, and I have spoke to the people of the house, and they will not take it in I turned back to she him where the hammer was; one jumped out of the window, and jumped over the rails, a young lad in light coloured clothes, that was somebody that had been with the prisoner; I could not lay hold of him; I only saw the colour of his clothes; then the prisoner came out, very close after him; I saw him come out; then says I, I see what you are at, I will take care of you; he said, he was doing nothing at all, only getting down there to pick up a halfpenny; I alarmed the house and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are there any rails before the houses in Bell-yard? - Is was a wooden pallisadoe.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the hammer lay on the pallisadoes? - The hammer lay on the inside, and the handle was through the pallisadoes.</p>

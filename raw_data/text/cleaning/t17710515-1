Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150003"></xptr> Brownsword and I went up stairs together; there was a green cloth, like a wrapper, upon the ground, and a double breasted coat, two waistcoats, a petticoat, and a red cloth cloak, they were all put together upon the ground in Mrs. Brownsword's chamber.</p>
               <p>- Brownsword. I was alarmed by the cracking of the cieling over head, and I thought I heard feet in my room; I had been in the room and double locked the door about an hour before, and had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the green cloth and those things you found on the floor, lie there when you was in the room before?</p>
               <p>Brownsword. No; the green cloth was at the bottom of a drawer in the chest of drawers; when I had got up about three stairs I saw West coming down, he had lodged with me formerly; I asked him how he dare come into my room; he said, Bl - t your eyes, I don't care for your room. I endeavoured to secure him; I scuffled some time with him; he threw me down, and got from me; I turned about and saw the prisoner and Mr. Fisher down; he got up and left the handkerchief in Mr. Fisher's hands; I caught him in my arms; the rings were taken out of a little drawer in a chest of drawers. Fisher was in the passage, and the prisoner out of it. Fisher was drawing him up the step. I held him, and cried out, Murder! Mrs. Lester came down and helped us to secure him; he was never out of my hands; he had one shoe and stocking on; and a piece was tore off his cape; he struck me and beat me down to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lock broke?</p>
               <p>Brownsword. No; it was unlocked or picked; we searched him, and found this key, two pieces of wire, and some pieces of candle. ( producing them.)</p>

West said he lived at the prosecutor's house; a friend with him asked me to sup with him; I went in; West went up stairs and came down again, and asked if I was coming; I went with him; West cried out to the other along with him, and said, You rascal, d - n your eyes, what do you bring this chap with you for? soon after, this woman came up with a candle; I being the last, they stopped me.</p>

On the 24th of January, about four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop, she had a very large cloak on her, there was a man in conversation with her, he was watching of me apparently, to see whether I was attentive to them or not; the woman was standing by him with her arms under her cloak, she seemed as if she was creeping something down in her pocket under her cloak; I went over the counter and turned her about into the middle of the shop, and took from her a whole piece of gingham of twenty-five yards, which was under her clothes round her body; I sent for an officer to take her in custody, she then begged to sit down, and immediately dropped her pockets; in one of these pockets was found twenty-eight yards of cotton print (her pockets were large bags which she had by her side; the pockets shewn in court), and in the other pocket was twenty-five yards; she had taken two pieces of print, and one piece of gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her taking this. - A. No, I only saw her as if she was creeping something in her pocket; the man ran away out of the shop, he has not been seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in your shop. - A. I suppose about a quarter of an hour, I did not see her come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to prosecutor) I wish you to say whether you took it from under my petticoats. - A. No, I took it from round your waist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it in my hand, I had it not round me, he found me pregnant instead of any thing about me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to prosecutor) Where is your shop. - A. I live in Holborn, my shop is in Newgate-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190038"></xptr>the corner of St. Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

Yes, she came up to me as I was at the bottom of the shop, she said she wished to look at some prints; there was a man with her; I shewed her some, and went to the bottom of the shop to get some others; before I came back again, Mr. Clarke took the gingham out of her apron, he then sent for a constable, I stood by her and saw her pockets drop from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these goods been before she come in. - A. On the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left these goods which you found afterwards in her pockets on the counter. - A. Yes, the goods were left there while I went to the bottom of the shop, and when I came back they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop. - A. The shop was nearly full.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the gingham. - A. Two pounds eight shillings, and the value of the print is three pounds ten shillings.</p>

            . I noticed the prisoner lurking about some time, and watched him: I saw him go into the passage and draw the boots; some persons were passing at the time, and I could not take him at the moment - he went up the court - I ran and took him; he threw the boots down and fell on them - I took him and them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said you did not see me take them at the office. Witness. I saw you drawing them, but did not see you finish taking them; I did not say I saw you take a boot, look at it, and put it down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

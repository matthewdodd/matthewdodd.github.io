The prisoner came into my shop on the 24th of September last, to look upon some ribbons. My niece call'd to me immediately, and said, she had missed some ribbon; I look'd in the prisoner's pocket and saw it there. The prisoner took it out, and laid it on the counter, and said what have I done? ( produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. How much is there of it ?</p>
               <p>Harison. There are a eleven yards and half. I sent for a constable, and took him to the Mansion House.</p>

            . The prisoner came into our shop the 24th of September, and desired to look at some ribbons. I took down the drawer with ribbons in it, and set it before him. He look'd at a good many pieces, and kept a piece in his hand; he pitch'd upon some, and desired me to cut off one yard. When I was cutting off the yard, I missed the piece out of his hand. I look'd for it, and saw it in his pocket, as he stopped down. I said, there it is, to my uncle that stood by me. After that, he himself took it out of his pocket, and laid it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was always a hard working lad. I am innocent of the thing. I pick'd it up off the ground, and gave it to a fat gentlewoman that was in the shop.</p>

I went down on the Monday, and found the roof much disconcerted, the gutters taken away, and the flashing of the windows - upwards of three cwt. of lead was gone - I saw it afterwards at the watch-house, and the size of it corresponded with the spaces on the house - it had been cut, and torn off - the edges appeared bright, as if fresh cut, but in a haggling manner - the prisoners were in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the parish of Christ Church - this house is on my beat. About twenty minutes before three o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise in the house; and knowing that it was uninhabited, I fetched my partner Lewing, and another watchman. I knocked at the door of the next house; we went in, and got over the pales. I heard some persons whispering in the house. I came round again, and the prisoner Lackey jumped out of the window; I laid hold of him in the yard - my partner sprung his rattle - the Whitechapel watchman laid hold of one of the other prisoners, and Powell and Brown secured the other two. They were taken to the watch-house, and I returned to the house. The roof was much damaged, and a quantity of lead laid in the garret; it had been cut, except one piece, which had been drawn from a gutter, and was hanging down; here is the piece that was hanging down; it is gutter lead; I then found a smock frock, which the prisoner Wilson said was his, but Cook put it on. After I left duty I went again to the house, and found a knife, which Hurling claimed; the lead was afterwards claimed by Mr. Story; it weighed 320 lbs.</p>

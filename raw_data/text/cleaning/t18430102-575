                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Stoneham, a butcher, in Swan-lane, Rotherhithe. On Saturday, the 31st of Dec., I was in the shop, and turned my back to get a shovel of sawdust—I saw two boys pass the window at twenty minutes before eight o'clock—in about five minutes I missed two breasts of mutton, and a brisket of beef cut in two, from the board out<lb></lb>side the shop—I did not see the boys' faces—one was a stout one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rotherhithe. Last Saturday evening I was sitting in a room opposite the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner take two pieces of beef off the board—there were three more with him—he was by himself when he took it, and the other three were under our window—I had seen him with them before, standing under a paling—he went over by him<lb></lb>self, and took the beef—he brought it across under our window, and tied it up in a handkerchief, and went down Adam-street—I was up stairs at the time—I ran down, went over, and told Mrs. Stoneham—I then ran after them down Adam-street, and caught a little boy who he had given the meat to—he</p>

               <p>dropped it, and then the prisoner hit me—he was in the middle of Adam-street, with the other boys—I had seen him give the meat to the other boy—I went up to him, and said, "Where is the beef you took off that board?" and they dropped it—I took hold of the little boy who had it, but the prisoner hit me, and I let go of him, and they all ran away—the policeman caught the prisoner on Monday—I saw him on Monday at the station—I have known him for the last six months by sight, and have heard him called Ragan before that.</p>

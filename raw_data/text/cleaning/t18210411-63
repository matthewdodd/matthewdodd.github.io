The windows are about twelve feet from the ground - there is a grass plat at the back, leading to the river. Mr. Courtenay usually leaves the office about four o'clock - it is my duty to shut up Mr. Bathurst's room, which is below Mr. Courtenay's. I left the shutter unclosed, and at half-past seven o'clock next morning, the 24th of February, I went to the room, and saw somebody must have been there. It was a white frost, and there were prints of the feet of a grown person on the grass plat leading from the window to the river, and finger marks on the window frame, and marks on the grass, as if a bundle had been laid there. About three years ago, the male prisoner was employed at carpenter's work at the building for about a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Whoever came must have got out the river way - A. Yes; They must have escaped by a boat. I missed the things on the 25th. I had seen them on the 24th.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On Tuesday, the 27th of February I examined the drawers, and found they were forced by a small gimblet and a chisel. I saw the mark of the worm of a small gimblet and chisel - there were finger marks, as if they had got out at the window, and closed it after them. They could then get through a wharf, as there were craft laying there. I searched the prisoner's lodging, pointed out by Pace, and found a chisel and gimblet there, which I compared with the drawers. They exactly fitted the impressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not any chisel of that size make those marks - A. Yes; but there were notches in the chisel which corresponded with the marks.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. In consequence of information I went to Hyam's shop, and apprehended the female prisoner. She took me to her lodgings, No. 16, Duke-street, Westminster. I found her husband on the 15th, at a house in Crown-court, St. Giles's. They acknowledged each other as man and wife, and he claimed the things found at the lodgings. I found a number of duplicates there, relating to the prosecutor's property - and when I took him, he had a pair of grey pantaloons on, which are Mr. Courtenay's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to his lodgings - A. On the 7th of March. The duplicates were in a small pocket-book, in a drawer.</p>

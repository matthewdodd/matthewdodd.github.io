            . I am thirteen years of age. I was with my grandmother taking some clothes home, last Saturday week - they were tied up in a bundle, which I had in my hand; we were near Bloomsbury-chuch when a person came and snatched them from me. I saw who it was, and ran after him crying Stop thief! I am sure I did not lose sight of him, till he was taken - the prisoner is the man; he threw the bundle behind him while running; it was picked up and given to my grandmother.</p>

            . I am a gentleman's servant. I was at the corner of Bury-street, about eight o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm come out of Little Russel-street; he ran, and as he turned into another street he threw it down. I pursued, but the watchman stopped him before I came up - I never lost sight of him.</p>

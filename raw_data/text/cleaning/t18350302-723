I lost a mare-pony from a field at Hackney, on the 21st of January—I fed it the night before—it was worth four guineas—I found it in the possession of a boy, at Romford, the same day, rather be<lb></lb>fore twelve o'clock in the morning—it was twelve miles from Hackney—I had a communication with Smith about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the King Harry's Head public-house, Mile-end—I deal in horses, and any thing live or dead. On Wednesday, the 21st of January, I was going by the Rabbit-stables at Ilford, and was asked to go and look at a pony—I went and saw the prisoner—he said nothing to me particularly—he rode the pony—a person had asked me to look at the pony for him, as he was about purchasing it, but he had not money enough—I asked who the pony belonged to, and he called the prisoner out of the public-house—he came out, smoking his pipe, into the stable—I said to the man, "Get on the pony and ride it," which he did—I went on my business, and afterwards going along the road, I bought the pony of the prisoner, and paid him 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, except 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was spent—I gave him the money—I asked him why he sold it—he said it belonged to his father, who had bought it at Smithfield-market, and was taken in with it—that it was not strong enough for him; and he had come from Bethnal-green—I said, "Go to the public-house and write your address, and I will pay you for it"—he said he could not write, but would make his cross to the paper—I suppose the pony might be worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was lame—after paying the prisoner the money, I said, "Are you going to Romford?"—he said no, he had no business there, he should return home—I gave the pony up to Trindal when he claimed it in the market—it was detained a week at the Golden Lion at Romford, for me to find the person—the pri<lb></lb>soner put his mark to the paper in my presence—the landlady gave me the paper—the bill says (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) "Bought of John Green, a brown mare, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., lives at Thomas-street, Bethnal-green"—I gave the pony up to Trindal, who claimed it in the market—the prisoner put his mark to the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Rabbits. I saw the prisoner there this day six weeks, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, with a mare pony—he asked me if I was ostler—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to give the pony a feed of corn—Smith came in about an hour afterwards—before he came, two young men came up, and wanted to buy it—Smith was coming by, and the young men called him to look at the pony—it was taken out of the stable, and rode by the prisoner, and afterwards put in the stable again, and shortly after they went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Type-street, Bethnal-green. The prisoner worked for me more than twelve months—he carried my sand sometimes—he was a very honest person all the while he was in my employ—I know Smith, and recollect his coming to my house to inquire for the prisoner, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner—I told him Smith and another one had been down there to inquire after somebody who had worked for me, about horse-stealing—he said I could tell <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Smith, if I saw kim, that he could have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Tuesday night, if he could settle it—I saw the prisoner in Whitechapel again on Monday morning—he asked me if I had seen Smith; I said no, that I was going that way, and should very likely see him—I saw him that afternoon.</p>

               <p>Fletcher was at my house on the 26th of July in the evening drinking out of a silver tankard, I went over the water, and when I returned about eight he was gone. The tankard was not missed till between eleven and twelve at night, at going to bed. About eleven the next morning I was sent for to the Mansion-house, there were the two prisoners at the bar and my tankard; they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175409110006"></xptr> examined by Mr. Alderman Cockayne, one was committed to Newgate and the other to the Poultry counter, upon Fletcher's confession.

             Clark. This tankard was brought to me; (I am a dealer and chapman) and offer'd to sale the very same night a little before nine o'clock. I have seen both the prisoners before. Taylor came to me at my window, and said he had got a friend that had a silver tankard to sell : I asked them both to walk in; then Fletcher pull'd the tankard out and gave it into my hand to sell it to me. I ask'd him what he ask'd an ounce for it; he said 5 s. and insisted upon my buying it that night. I said I never buy any thing by candle light; I stop'd it and lock'd it up, and said I would buy it by day-light if I could, and would give them more than they asked. The next morning Taylor came and demanded the money for it; I refused paying the money and sent for an officer; but before I sent for the officer he told me Fletcher was either gone or going on board a vessel at Gravesend; then the officer came and I gave him charge of Taylor; then he directly said that Captain Fletcher (the Name he went by) was over the way in some court. Then I said to the constable, Am I safe to keep Taylor till I take Fletcher? he said, yes; then the officer went with my maid, and she shew'd him Fletcher, and he took him, and they were both carried before alderman Cockayne at the Mansion-house; there I carried the tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Clark. Fletcher confessed the thing and was sorry for it; I can't say his exact words. Taylor said, he met Fletcher in a place in Bishopsgate-street and he persuaded him to come to me with the tankard. The tankard produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. from Taylor. Did you ever see the tankard in my hand?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Fletcher's defence.</p>
               <p>I used to go to the prosecutor's house to see a friend from Norwich; I had been there that night and went away about six at Night. I returned again about seven upon the key. Going away I saw this tankard standing under the gateway, I took it, and being a little poverty-struck (or I should have advertis'd it.) I met my brother-prisoner in Bishopsgate-street; I asked him where I could sell it; he said, let us carry it to Mr. Clark, we did, and he stop'd it.</p>
               <p>Taylor's defence.</p>
               <p>I did not know that the tankard was stolen.</p>
               <p>To Fletcher's character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradley. I have known Fletcher about three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He has spent 14 or 15 hundred pounds; he has been too and again at my house; I never knew any ill by him.</p>

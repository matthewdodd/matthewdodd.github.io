I refused; she insisted upon it. I pulled my watch out to see what it was o'clock, and she snatched it from me and opened the outside case, and tried to open the inside, but could not. I went to take it from her, and she cried out, bloody murder, and the other girl came in to her assistance. I secured this girl; the other got off: she was searched, but the watch was gone.</p>

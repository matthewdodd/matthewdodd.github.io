                  </hi> I am shopman to William Kingston, of West<lb></lb>minster-bridge-road—on Wednesday, the 22nd of Sept., at half-past three in the afternoon, the prisoner Mason and another woman came to the shop and asked to look at some black edgings—I showed them some of different widths—there was some lace in the same box—I took out several cards of lace and edging, and laid them on the counter—Mason and the other woman looked at them—Mason asked for a yard and quarter of black edging—it was 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I served her—I then went and got some other goods to show them—I was away a very short time—long enough for a person to go out of the shop and return without my observing it—I then sold something to the other woman—the officer came in and told the foreman not to let the women go—I think Mason heard it—the foreman then spoke to me—I looked at the goods at the door—I did not miss anything—in a quarter of an hour afterwards Laylan and I went to the station—I there saw three cards, con<lb></lb>taining 48 yards of lace, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew them to be my master's property—I had had it out while Mason and the other woman were there—this is it.</p>

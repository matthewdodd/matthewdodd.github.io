No, far from it, she was very much intoxicated, Mrs. Witts went out and came home again, and then went out a second time, and left Betsey Clarke and Poll Weston; I went out with Mrs. Witts, she was going to look at another lodging; I saw Poll Weston take the keys out of her pocket as she lay asleep on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took the keys out of her pocket what did she do with them. - A. She put them under the bed till she found an opportunity of opening the box, and then she put the keys into Mrs. Witts' pocket again; after Mrs. Witts had her nap, she got up to go out, I went with her, I returned and found them both coming down stairs with the property in their laps; I went with them to Charing Cross, and we drove to the bottom of Holborn, there the coach stopped, and Poll Weston went out and pawned two watches.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you take in such a pot as that without suspecting her. - A. I did suspect her, but she evaded my questions by saying her brother and she had a few words, and the name that she told me corresponded with the cypher, she was better dressed, and looked a respectable person; she only asked two guineas, she seemed to know the worth of it; it was certainly an error of judgment, I confess.</p>

             sworn. I am constable of the precinct of White Friers. On the 20th of March the son of the prosecutrix came to me to take Clarke into custody; I took her into custody at the house of Mrs. Witts, in Water-lane, Fleet-street. In searching of her I found seven pennyworth of halfpence, and three duplicates, one for a pair of pattens for fourpence, the other a petticoat for half a crown, and the third was the duplicate for that handkerchief which the pawnbroker has produced. (The tea pot identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. That is my own hankerchief, and the hat is my own, I had fifteen shillings given me the night before, I gave thirteen shillings for the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Blake) Look at that hat. - A. This is the the same hat which we bought, each of us had one of these hats.</p>

Mrs. Witts desired me to pledge the tea pot; I have lived with Mrs. Witts ever since I was twelve years old; she was obliged to quit her house, a gentleman lost his gold watch there, she then removed to the lodgings in Drury-lane; since I have been in trouble she was obliged to remove again to Clement's Inn.</p>

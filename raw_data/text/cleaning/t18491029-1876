On Friday evening, 21st Sept., I and my niece were in the shop, and a friend of mine, Mr. Roberts, was in a small room leading out of the shop—the prisoner came in a little after ten o'clock, asked my niece for half an ounce of tobacco, and tendered a half-sovereign—she laid it on the edge of a cigar-case, and pushed it along to me—I took it up and gave change—I showed it to Mr. Roberts to see if it was good—the prisoner then said, "Is this Maryland tobacco?"—my niece said, "No; Maryland will be 2¼d."—he said, "I never give more than three-halfpence, I had better not take it, for it is for a gentleman in a cab outside; I will take my money again"—I gave him his half-sovereign back—I am positive it was the same—I put it into his hand—he said, "Will you promise to change the tobacco if it is not approved of?"—we said we would—he then took the tobacco, and put a half-sovereign into my hand—I put it on my finger and said, "This is not the one you gave me just now"—I am sure it was not—I bent the half-sovereign on the counter—Mr. Roberts came out directly and stood against the door—I handed it to Mr. Roberts—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, and tried to get away—Mr. Roberts tried to prevent him, while doing so two men tried to come in, one appeared to be tipsy—he said, "I want some tobacco, let me come in"—he pushed by Mr. Roberts—he was served with some tobacco ready weighed and put up—the</p>

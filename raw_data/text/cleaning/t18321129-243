On the 26th of November, at twenty minutes after nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Whitechapel-road - she was a stranger; she asked where I was going - I said to Stepney; she said she lived there herself, and we walked on together - it was rather dark at the time; I had been taking a glass with a few friends - all on a sudden, when we got to <placeName id="t18321129-243-crimeloc1366">Hanibal-street</placeName>

             (Police-constable K 50). I was called, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner - she wanted to get away; it was about half-past eight o'clock - he accused her of stealing his money, and she denied it; my brother-officer searched her - I heard a sovereign drop, and picked it up; I found the purse after she had gone to the station, about two yards from where I first saw her - it was empty; seven sovereigns were found tied in her shawl.</p>

             (Police-constable K 173). I took off the prisoner's shawl at the station, to search her, but the inspector said he would send for a woman - the shawl was then on the table - the inspector took it up, and found seven sovereigns, tied up at the end of it; this is the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He accosted me first; the sovereigns are not his - he offered me 1s.; the purse fell down, and I took it up.</p>

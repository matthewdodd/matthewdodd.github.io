                  </hi>. I am barman at the White Hart, in Hoxton, about four minutes' walk from where Flaxton and his wife live, about a hundred and forty yards—in going from their house to the Red Cow, they would pass our house—I remember on a Sunday night Flaxton and Sumner calling there—I do not know exactly the day of the month—I attended the police-court on the following Saturday—it was the Sunday before that, that they came—Flaxton's mother called on me next morning, and inquired whether her son had been there overnight—I had seen them the night before—she called at twenty-five minutes past seven o'clock—I have known Flaxton personally about sixteen years, and Sumner about three years; they have borne good characters—I served them that night with half-a-quarten of gin and a pick wick—they did not remain long; they went away.</p>

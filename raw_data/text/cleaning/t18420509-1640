                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Harvey, of No. 94, New Gravel-lane, in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, and occupy the house. My children brought the prisoner to my door on Easter Saturday—she seemed in distress—I gave her some victuals and some old clothes to wear, and promised to try to get her into some place—she staid three weeks with me entirely on charity—on the 20th of April she lighted a fire in my room—I fell asleep after that, and on awaking she was gone—I went to my box in my room—it was open—the key had been in my daughter's pocket during the night—I found it on the table—I missed from the box five sove<lb></lb>reigns, four shillings, and one penny, which the prisoner had seen me put there the Saturday before; also a pair of boots, a shawl, four silk handkerchiefs, an apron, and a white petticoat—she was afterwards apprehended, and the shawl, bonnet, apron, and boots were found on her—I had not given her any of them (<hi rend="italic">the apron belongs to Mary Ann Brown</hi>) she had told roe she had no friends at all, but I found her aunt in Chapel-street, who said she had been gone away three-quarters of an hour, but I went and found she was getting over the yard at the back of the house—I caught her, and said if she would give up my property I would not give her in charge; that she had taken all I had to maintain my children—I gave her in charge of a policeman in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Prictor, of No. 3, Chapel-street, St. George's. My sister married the prisoner's father when she was about five years old—she nursed my child for eighteen months, and was a very good girl then—she came to me on this Wednesday morning, about twelve o'clock, and said she had left her place, that her mistress had sold her things and gone to Liverpool—she had a parcel, containing print enough to make five aprons—she asked if I could tell her of a place—I said no—she said, did I think her father and mother would take her home again—I said she might stop at my house till I went to inquire whether they would—she had run away from them about eight months ago—she had a pair of cotton stockings and some cotton, which she said she had bought in the Highway—in half-an-hour after Mrs. Harvey came and asked for Caroline, which was not the prisoner's name—I told her I did not know such a person, and asked if she was married to a sailor—she said no, she was a girl—I said, "There is a girl here, Amelia Fletcher"—I sent the prisoner down to answer the door—she was frightened, and got over the pales of the yard—she put 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on my table—she did not pro<lb></lb>duce any more money to me.</p>

            . I live at No. 63, Ossulton-street, and was a watchman. On the 8th of February I saw the prisoner go into No. 61, Ossulton-street - I knew her before; I had received information of this robbery - I followed her into her own room, and took her, as she answered the prosecutor's description; I told her she was the person I wanted, as I had information she had stolen a watch from a gentleman - she came down stairs with me, and gave me the watch, begged me to hand it to the gentleman, and request him to say nothing further about it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TEASDALE. I was constable of the night. I produce a watch, which I received from Turner; I took the prisoner to the watch-house, but found nothing on her - I only know from information who the house belongs to.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

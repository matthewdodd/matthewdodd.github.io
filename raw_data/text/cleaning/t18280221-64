            . On the 10th of November the prisoner was in my employ; he never gave me an account of 13l. 15s. received from Frost and Co., who dealt with me - they owed me a few shillings more than that sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Mr. Dodson? A. Yes; he is here - this money was taken in November; my son left me about October; he worked in my shop, and occasionally made entries in the journal when the clerk has been out; he never entered in the cash-book, for I kept that locked up for the last six months - I may have left it out occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, in several instances, received money from the prisoner, and then sent him into the factory, before he had time to make entries? A. Never, on my oath - I always said, directly I received money, "George, be sure you enter it:" I always allowed him time to enter it. My son was my journeyman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you did leave your books about, could an entry be taken out that was once made? A. No; if it was entered it would appear: my son had left me when this was received; the prisoner left in January, and never told me of this sum, nor paid it to me: I sent my son-in-law for the money after it was paid.</p>

            . Here is no entry in the cash-book of 13l. 15s. 6d. being received from Frost: the only entry on the 10th of November is 2s. received from Mr. Richards; that is in the prisoner's writing: there is no entry of this sum at all - the highest sum in this page is 25l. received from Mr. Wood, on the 17th of November: twelve of the entries here are my writing: I received no money of Frost's account - the prisoner never told me he had received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at this page, whose writing is that? A. One line I do not know about; here is one by myself; the rest is the prisoner's: here is one entry of Mrs. Buckle's, but that is money paid - the book is kept locked up; she never enters money received - if she receives money, she tells me, and I enter it. I know there have been quarrels between Buckle and his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the quarrels because that she had received money and not brought it to account? A. I believe the principal quarrel was because the books were not properly looked after - there is no entry of here of money received for six months past - the book was occasionally left out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever heard Mr. and Mrs. Buckle quarrel about her receiving money, and not entering it? A. No; it was, that neither she nor the son had properly looked after the books; as he was unable to do it himself.</p>

            . My father dealt with Buckle. I produce a bill and receipt for goods delivered and paid for- I paid the prisoner the money on the 10th of November, 1827 - it was 13l. 15s. 6d.; I paid it into his own hands, and he wrote this receipt (read.) Another bill was sent in for the same goods, in January, after the prisoner had left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say, I have been frequently teazed by Mrs. Buckle to give her money, and she has promised to account for it to her husband - they were always quarrelling.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUCKLE. I am the prosecutor's son. I left my father's house about three weeks or a month before Christmas - the prisoner had a great deal to do when he was there; he was not always busy - my father has, at times received money from him, and sent him into the factory before he had time to enter it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When was that? A. I cannot state any particular time; I never knew the prisoner keep money back. I left my father in October - it is less than twelve months ago that this has happened; it was more than once - I cannot say how often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not, in October, discharged from the factory, and employed at 5s. a day to collect debts? A. Not to my knowledge; I left in October.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and live in Bishopsgate without. I saw Porter at my shop window - the prisoner and two others were about three yards from him; Porter stooped down to speak to my brother, and I saw the prisoner take a parcel out of his trouser's pocket, and walk out; I laid hold of him and said "You took that parcel out of that boy's pocket" - he denied it; I turned and saw it on the ground close by him - nobody but him cluld drop it.</p>

                  </hi> I am living in Queen-street, Ratcliff, with my mother who keeps a shop for the sale of nautical instruments—I became acquainted with the prisoner by his coming to the shop—I married him at Christ Church Rotherhithe, on the 26th of Oct.,1845.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you married privately, that your friends should not know anything about it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes; he wished it to be private, and I consented to it—he came to me as a single man—his sisters told me that he had been married, and that he had been tried—I am not now engaged to a gentleman—a gentleman paid me some attention, but when I told him this circumstance it was dropped directly—no one knew that I was married, and therefore it was likely that any one might pay me attention—I was married before, and was a widow without children—the first time I married, it was without my friends knowing anything about it—I told them of if about twelve months afterwards—I made my brother acquainted with my having married the prisoner about three months afterwards—my friends knew of my acquaintance with the prisoner at first, and they were against it—I went to the prisoner's sisters to inquire about him, one sister sent me to another, and then they told me about him—I think I married him about six weeks after they gave me that information—he was just on the point of going to sea when I married him—he told me that Judge Cress-well, who tried him, told him he was a free man, and when he went to get the license the proctor told him he was all right—I did not take his sister's advice, I took his advice—I lived in the same house with my mother when it occurred—I went out to be married, and returned to my mother's</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the library of the Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land.

Q.</hi> Your notion was, that if a man were very warm in love a sea-voyage might do him good? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me he thought he, could legally marry; he thought his first marriage was done away with, but I thought not—before we parted, he was inclined to my opinion, that it was better to wait—this was said on board the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Manchester</hi>, the vessel in which he had just returned form the West Indies—Mrs. Wells sent me down there to see him—I do not know that he had got any legal advice then—I am not a lawyer—I spoke my opinion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mary Guy, who lives in Farringdon-street. On the 29th of Oct., about five in the evening, Jones gave me information—I ran out and saw Ralls with a piece of calico under her shawl—there was no one with her at that time—I sent Jones for a policeman, and gave Ralls into custody—the calico was Mrs. Guy's—I had seen it safe half-an<lb></lb>hour before—this mark, "3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard," was on it at the time.</p>

               <p>HARRIET DREW. On the 24th of September I had been to Bethnal-green, and was coming home in the evening, about ten minutes or a quarter past seven o'clock, with my mother, my aunt, and a friend of hers -I had a bundle in my hand; I do not know what it contained: a man, who I did not see, snatched it from me, and ran away - my father's name is William; it was my mother's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. It was dark - I had a friend with me; my mother and aunt were three or four yards before us: it was so dark, we could not well distinguish them - my bundle was snatched on a sudden, and the person was gone in an instant; there was no opportunity for any one to see him scarcely - my friend was in conversation with me; I believe she saw three men as we passed, but not at the time the bundle was snatched - they had not offended us; there was no reason to notice them particularly.</p>

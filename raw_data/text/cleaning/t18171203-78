They came about six o'clock on the 7th of November. Corbin asked to look at some lace - She went up the shop. While I was showing it the young man said that the other prisoner had stolen a shawl - I took it out of her pocket. Corbin said she was positive it was no such thing, as she was her servant, and had lived seven months with her. I sent for a constable-an officer secured Cotelin, Corbin made her escape. I asked her to walk in till the officer came-she spoke some French to the other woman, and went out. I could not detain her; she did not look at the lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. She did not leave her direction with me.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BALDWIN. I am shopman to Mr. Birt. The prisoners came into the shop; Corbin asked for some lace, and Cotelin stepped towards the window - I saw her take a shawl, and put it in her pocket. I told Mr. Birt, who detained her. Corbin said Cotelin had lived some months with her, and was an honest woman. Corbin made her escape out of the shop; she was desired to stop; I went for an officer-as I went out, I saw her walking about; she went up to the door, and spoke some French to Cotelin. When I returned she was gone.</p>

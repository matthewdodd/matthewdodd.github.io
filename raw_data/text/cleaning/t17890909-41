               <p>Court. It was light then? - It was as light almost as it is now; so his companion knowing something of me declined the job; the prisoner went to Mr. Good's door, and went in, as if he lived there; now I do not take upon me to say he broke the door open, the door was closed, it was under a catch latch; I was too distant to hear a latch move, I was thirty-six yards off; the prisoner shut the door to, and came out into the street, and brought out a pier looking glass, it appeared to me to be a yard in length, and about twenty inches over; by the distance I was, I took him to be the servant of the shop; if he had had other clothes on, I could not have sworn to him, at that distance; I do not go by his face, only his clothes; I never saw him before, in my life; he had on a pair of crimson breeches, two buckles in his hat, a flapped hat, and a red coat; when he left the house he went up a new road, about forty yards off, when I went to the office, the prisoner was precisely dressed the same way, I think; but I am sure the breeches was.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the two buckles in his hat; I did not observe it; as to the coat, I made no further observation, but I think it is the same he had on at the office.</p>

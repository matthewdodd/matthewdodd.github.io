Bank of England note—I looked at it—I walked between him and the door, and said, "You know where you got this note from, I suppose, and can account for it?"—he said, "Yes, I can"—I said, "You must come with me, if you please, to Mr. Packer's, in the Quadrant"—he said he would go, and walked towards the door—I said, "I must take your arm, if you please"—we then walked down the street together—I said, "Do not consider yourself in custody, because we are only going to have it explained"—I was fearful of going too far, and having an action brought against me—he said he would not consider himself in custody, but if that was the case, he thought that he could go without being held—I did not let go of him—I went with him to Mr. Packer's, who said he was the same man that had passed a forged <hi rend="italic">five</hi> on him on the Saturday—the prisoner did not say anything to that—I never lost sight of the note—I had it in my left hand in my pocket till I gave it to my brother.</p>

On the 11th of November my gates were made fast about ten o'clock; on the morning of the next day, between five and six o'clock the watchman came up my yard and said the gates were loose; he told me he had stopped a man with harness on the outside. I went to the watchhouse and saw the harness; I knew the harness well, it was mine. The prisoner had been in my service five days, no more; he had left me about four or five days.</p>

            . I am a watchman, Mr. Wootton's yard is in my beat. On the 12th of November, about half past five I was crying the hour; I tried the wicket of Mr. Wootton's gate, it was fast then; I went on to the further end of Cock-lane; I returned; before I came to Mr. Wootton's yard the prisoner passed me with the harness; it was not light then; I had suspicion that it was stolen; I did not stop him then, I went to Mr. Wootton's gate, I found the wicket open, that made my suspicion stronger; I went after the prisoner, I overtook him by the Saracen's Head in Skinner-street, I asked him where he was going with the harness, he told me to his master's house; I asked him where he had brought the harness from; he said, from the other side of Smithfield. I told him I must detain him and take him to the watchhouse; he said he would give me the harness if I would let him go. I took him to the watch-house and went to Mr. Wootton, he came and claimed the harness.</p>

               <p>- WORRALL. I was constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, I found the long rein and the kicking strap in his pockets. I produce the harness.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my own property. I have had them about six months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to work in the morning in Smithfield, I took up the harness, I did not know who it belonged to; the watchman passed me and came back after me, and when he called after me I stopped; I told him I found the harness in Smithfield, I was willing to give it to any body it belonged to.</p>

            ; I met the prisoner in Broad St. Giles's on the 20th of September, and I asked her how she did, she said, indeed Mrs. Groves I am very bad, I am just come out of gaol, I am in great distress; I asked her to drink something, she said, if you please; I had known her three months before, I took her into a publick house and bid her chuse her own liquor, and she chose a quartern of rum, I paid a great for it, I I gave her six-pence to get her some meat, and I called for a pot of porter, and when she came back, I said, Mary here is sixpence, I am sorry for your distress; she said, indeed I am, for this old bed-gown is my shift; then I gave her a shilling and took the six-pence, then I got up to come away and it began to rain, I said Mary if you have a mind to come home with me and have a good dish of tea it may refresh you after your trouble; she came home with me and sat on the foot of the bed, and I took and tied the nine and six-pence in the corner of my apron in a hard kno, she saw me do it; I went and unlocked my box where my clothes were, and I put my apron and my money in the box, and I shewed her the trimming; I said I had bought it for that gown, and pointed to the box; she said it would look very neat; after a little while I said I was very poorly with a pain in my side, I would lay down if she would make the tea, she said do my dear, she covered me up, and I believe I fell asleep, and I missed her and there was no fire, and I went to light a candle, and I was locked in.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About one in the day-time, I thought she was gone to buy an old gown, I was not surprised, I made my bed and swept my room out afterwards; I found my box stripped of every thing, I missed my bonnet, I opened my window and called out, and a neighbour made answer, if any body has robbed you it is that woman in the white wrapper, for I saw her come down in your bonnet and a great bulk under her petticoats, she stood under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190010"></xptr> the gateway and pressed it down then I begged that somebody would go to my landlady, and see if they could open the door, and they got the door open, and I pursued where she said the prisoner was gone, I looked every where for her, and about seven or eight I met her; says I, Mary what an ungenerous creature you are, to treat me in the manner you have done, she was a minute before she spoke, she took the pipe out of her mouth, and said, I was just going to send to you; says I, Oh! you ungenerous creature, was you a going to send me my clothes again, and my money, and where is the key of my room, she put her hand in her pocket and said d - n you here is your key; says I, I will not leave you till I know where my things are; she flung her pipe down in the street and said,</p>
               <p>"by the Holy Ghost I will score you like pork, if you do not loose me," and she clinched her hands as if she had been going to strike me, but she did not: says I, I will forgive you the money if you will tell me where my things are, but if you do not I will fetch a constable; so then she downed on her knees in all the muck, and said,</p>
               <p>"bad luck and a sudden death attend you Mother Groves, if you do not fetch a constable"; so then I did fetch a constable, or else I would not have troubled my head about her; nobody was in the room but her when I laid down.</p>
               <p>When you found her had she any of your clothes on? - No, she had a very handsome gown on, which she had taken out of pawn that very afternoon.</p>
               <p>How long did you sleep? - I cannot recollect, but it was more than an hour, it was about twelve when we came in together, and it was almost two when I awaked.</p>

               <p>I have a lower apartment; I was having some breakfast with the woman of the house with my children, and the prisoner came to the window and asked for the prosecutrrix, I told her I did not know such a person by name, with that she went away, this was about ten in the morning; she was gone about an hour and a half, when she and the prosecutrix returned together, and they went up stairs together, and she might be up stairs for an hour and half or an hour and three quarters, I cannot say which, along with this said Mrs. Groves; when she went up stairs she had neither hat, cloak, nor gown on, and when she came down she had the contents under her petticoats, a kind of bundle, and she stood under the gateway and was stroking down her hips, and the prosecutrix's bonnet was on her head, which I had seen on the prosecutrix before, I thought the prisoner was gone out of an erand, she seemed as if hesitating, and then she turned to the right hand towards St. Giles's; I afterwards told Mrs. Groves which way she went as soon as she made the alarm; I am sure to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come down again in two or three minutes and leave the house intirely? - Upon my oath she went up along with this said Mrs. Groves, and never came down with the contents till an hour and half, or an hour and three quarters; she came down also with the bonnet on her head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see a bundle with me? - Yes, I saw a bundle under your petticoats, and a bonnet on your head.</p>

I have tried other keys, it is a great court, and all women of the town in it, there is not one honest person I believe in the court, I have no witnesses, for I did not think the woman would be so wicked to fetch me up.</p>

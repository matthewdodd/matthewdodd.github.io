As soon as I met them, I said, "You are my two prisoners, you have broken my house open"—I took bold of them—they denied it, and declared that they had just come from Layton-terrace—there is no such place—I took Raw<lb></lb>line—he held his hands out, and said, "I get my living by hard work"—I delivered them to two officers, and when we returned, the policeman in searching, found a stock, and centre bit by the elder-trees, in a line with where the bed laid—the stock and bit were on the dresser the night before, where my other tools laid—belong to Mr. Richer, who had lent them to me—the copper had been confined in a cloact, with a door in front—that door was open, and the lead torn up all round the copper—the value of the articles I lost, altogether, was more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a good feather bed—I value that at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I have just come from Layton"—I said, "Never mind, I shall take you as my prisoner, "and I did so—after delivering them to the policeman, a stock and bit were found, which I had lent to Bird a day or two before—I was three or four yars from the prisoners when I first saw them—I saw them again, coming back, in about five minutes, after, walking after them—I am quite sure they are the two men I saw by the bed—they said they had passed English's cart agianst Layton church—they appeared coming away from Layton church.</p>

I did; he had a bundle on his shoulder, and another on his arm; I asked him what he had got, I told him I was an officer, I must know what he had; he said he had got it, whatever it was, of a watermam and fireman, it was sugar; I asked him if there was any thing but sugar; he said there was not; I searched the bundle, I found it contained six cakes of soap; I asked him where he worked; he said he was out of employ, he got work where he could, he said he was a scavenger; I told him he did not look like a scavenger; he said then he worked at Hounslow; I asked him if he was not a servant to a grocer; he said he was not.</p>

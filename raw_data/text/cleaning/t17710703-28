            . About the 17th of May, I am not certain to the day. I was coming home about ten at night; I came to the sign of the Beehive, in a lane going down to Wapping, at the top of Nightingale lane; going past the door the prisoner and some other women asked me to treat them with a pot of beer; they said they would join with me. I went in with them; then they asked me to treat them with some lobsters; I had got a little drop and was merry; I paid 6d. for three lobsters; then she called in a friend of hers, who she called Carraty Sall,

Carroty Sall went out for a pint of beer; I took my watch out, and said I could not stay long: she asked me if I would not stay all night; I refused it, and said I would not; at last I agreed to stay all night; then Carroty Sall walked out, and said, Strip, and go to bed; upon which I did; I had not been in bed above two minutes when the prisoner came to the door; she knocked at the door; I said, Who is it? she said it is me; her partner let her in; when they came in they fell making their fun about me; in two or three minutes they walked out of the room, not thinking they had been robbing me, for they had been tickling me in their funny ways; after they had run out of the door I ran after them; thinking they were making their game of me; not thinking they had robbed me; I ran out after them, and this prisoner had got my waistcoat; I run out several yards from the door after her; I catched hold of her; bringing her in again, I heard the rattling of the halfpence I had in my pocket; I said, What are you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030033"></xptr> about, you have took my cloaths? she said, I was only going to dress myself in your cloaths: then she said, I wonder what is become of the other girl, she has gone off and left us; I said, I don't suppose she is; then she put down my waistcoat and went off; then I suspected they had stolen my things. I examined my breeches, and found my things were stolen. I cried out, I was robbed; one

I was afterwards in the watch house; I being anxious after my watch, said, Pray return my watch, if you have got it, and keep the rest of the things and welcome; upon which they called me Scotch bougger, and said they wished it had been twice as much.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 66.) On the 6th of February I was on duty, about seven o'clock in the evening, in Northampton-street, Cambridge-road, and saw the prisoner Sims in company with another, who it not here—Sims had this hamper containing these shoes—I followed them into Cambridge-road—the one not present fell back—he walked back—I followed Sims into the Whitechapel-road—I came up to him and asked him what he had got—he said, "Boo-shoes," as if he was going to say some other word—I asked where he was going—he said, "to Mr. Solo<lb></lb>mon's, in the Old Change"—he said, "I have got not bill"—I asked him if there was many address on the hamper—he said, "No"—I asked him where he came from—he said, "From the Octagon factory"—I asked him who gave it him—he said, "The master of the factory"—I then laid hold of him and the hamper, and was assisted by another policeman down to the factory, and saw Mr. Emsley—Sims was present—he was quite close—I asked Mr. Emsley if he had sent him out of an errand—he said, "No"—I brought him round to the centre of the room, to where Mr. Emsley was, and Steel was called by Mr. Emsley to open the hamper, and Mr. Emsley said to Steel, "Is not this my property!"—Steel said they were.</p>

I have no partner; I live in Norfolk-street, Bethnal-green, and am the proprietor of the Octagon shoe-factory—that is my dwelling-house—it is in the parish of St. Metthew, Bethnal-green—Steel had the entire management of the shoe department, and had to take care of the places containing the shoes—I employed Sims for about nine months—Steel introduced him—I remember the policeman bringing him to my house on the evening of the 6th of February, with this hamper and shoes—Steel was called up to open the hamper—I asked him where Sims lived—he said he did not know—I said I was quite certain, that at three different periods, he had told me he knew well where he lived, that he could not give a direction, but he could show any person—he said, "Oh, I recollect, I can show the place"—I had complained to him ten times at least before this, that the racks were getting very light, considering we were making a large numbers of shoes, and sending out but few—he said he did not think so—he</p>

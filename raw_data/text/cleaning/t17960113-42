I thought he was the proprietor of the shop; there was nobody else in the shop, the door was open a-jar; I went for the coach, and when I came back again, Mr. Hales asked me, in the presence of this man, whether he was my master; I told him no, he was not; then the prisoner asked me if I was not his servant, I told him no, I was not; I asked him if he did not tell me he would give me a shilling, it I fetched him a coach; he said, he did offer me the shilling, and he gave it me, and asked me if I was not his servant again; I then told him no, I was the King's servant.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. He undertook to take care of this portmanteau for you till you came back? - A. I don't know whether he did or not; I thought he was the proprietor of the shop; I would not have given it him, if he had not taken it.</p>

               <p>Q. For what you know, he might have given you the bags again as he proposed? - A. And he might have run away with them.</p>

               <p>Q. You know it was put out of his power to return them, by being detained by another person; where did you find the bags when you came back? - A. Behind Mr. Hales's counter.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a stationer in Fenchurch-street; On the 22d of December, about twenty minutes before seven, I just came down stairs, and sent my shopman up to tea; I went into my counting-house at the back of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut the door? - A. The shop-door was shut, having no light; I saw the prisoner at the bar come in with a portmanteau in his hand, and put it on the counter; I saw him take it off the counter, and put it on the ground; at the same time, I saw the sailor run from the door, with the door open; I immediately came forward out of the counting-house, and came up to the Jew, (the prisoner at the bar), and took hold of the portmanteau, he had held of it likewise; I asked him who does this belong to? his reply was, it was his property. I then asked him what was in it? he said, he could not tell, but his servant, that was gone for a coach, would be back in five minutes, and he would tell me what was in it; I thought it had been cut from a hackney coach, or a post-chaise, because I saw the sailor run away. I then told him he should not have it till I sent for a constable; and he should tell me what was in it before he had it, both him and his servant; I instantly called down one of my shopmen, who has been with me fourteen years, and sent him for a constable; and then I called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130084"></xptr>another shopman, who has been with me seven years; I wrangled with him about the portmanteau, He wanted to take it away, I said he should not take it away till the constable came, and he told me what was in it; presently after the sailor came, who I suspected was a thief with him; having got the portmanteau in my possession, I brought it round behind the counter; when the sailor arrived with the coach, I asked him if he could tell me what was in the portmanteau? he was very much frightened, and said he could; he began to relate, there were so many shoes, so many pair of stockings, flannel drawers, and shaving things; I then asked him if he was the prisoner's servant? he said no; he then looked round, and said, damn you, I believe you are a thief; I said I thought so too, and had sent for a constable; and if he chose to give charge of him, I would appear as an evidence for him; before he arrived he began abusing me, and bullying me, and said, if I detained him, he would prosecute me with the utmost rigour of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the portmanteau when you first came up to him? - A. He had it on the counter, be brought it further into the shop; when he saw me, he seemed confused; he had a pair of spectacles on and no glasses, he had no hat, he was quite disguised; he looked more like an emigrant priest than any thing else; he offered the sailor half-a-guinea to let him go.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever see the sailor before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you first thought it was a portmanteau cut from a chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your mind was full of suspicion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought it afterward further into your shop? - A. Yes; more out of sight, under the shaving-box.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your suspicion? - A. From the manner of his coming into my shop, and taking possession of it, neither with my leave, nor by my leave.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of which, you took the portmanteau, and prevented him having it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From that circumstance, you cannot tell whether he would not have given it the man when he returned? - A. I know he wanted to go away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. He had hold of one end, and you the other? - A. We both had hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He used no kind of violence? - A. No; he would have carried it away if I would have let him.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried it behind the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but he meant to give it the man when he returned? - A. Because he threatened me if I detained him a minute after the man came back again, he would prosecute me with the utmost rigour of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Except for the suspicion you had, how do you know but what he meant to give it the man when he came back? - A. According to the best of my belief he would have taken it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When the young man came back, you had it safe behind the counter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not prevented from giving it up by your putting it behind the counter; could not he have returned it if he had been so disposed? - A. I know he would have gone away with it if he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pay for any part of this prosecution? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you given any instructions in the business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered to send for some tradesmen to give him a character? - A. He gave a false direction.</p>

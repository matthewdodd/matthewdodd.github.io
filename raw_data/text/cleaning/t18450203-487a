                  </hi>. I am a barrister-at-law; I have chambers at No. 2, Middle Temple-lane, and sleep there; it is very near to Fleet-street, just below the stationer's-shop. On Sunday evening, the 12th of Jan. I was tired, having taken a long walk, and went to bed earlier than usual, at a few minutes after nine o'clock—I had distinctly heard the clock strike</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184502030094"></xptr>
               <p>nine before I went to bed—my chambers are on the first landing-place, fifteen steps from the bottom—there is an outer door to my chambers, which opens outwards, and fastens with a latch-key, and immediately in<lb></lb>side that an inner door, which opens inwards—I locked the outer door before I went to bed, and went again to see that it was fastened—these two doors open into a lobby—there are folding-doors which open from my bed-room into the sitting-room, and they were quite open—the outer door, which was locked, is easily opened—this is the key which opens it—after I had been in bed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I heard a noise at the outer door, as of some one trying the lock—no suspicion passed my mind, for, having been out of town the previous evening, I thought it pro<lb></lb>bable my laundress was coming to see that the fires were laid, or to bring something for me the next day—I listened, and presently the outer door opened—I then heard the inner door open—there is no lock on that; still no suspicion crossed my mind, it being so early in the evening—I then heard in the lobby, which is on the same level with my bed-room, a rust<lb></lb>ling noise—supposing it was the laundress, I called her name, Mrs. Bant<lb></lb>ing—no answer being made, I instantly concluded it was some person attempting to come in improperly—I jumped out of bed, crying, "Stop thief!"—I went through the door at the bottom of my bed, so that I had no turning to make—I rushed through the doors, which were all open, and followed the noise of persons whom I heard going down the stairs, hallooing at the top of my voice all the way down, not having stopped for a second to put on my slippers or anything—my impression was that there was more than one person—at the bottom of the staircase is a lamp—I turned my eyes towards Fleet-street gate, and it was shut—it is always shut on Sun<lb></lb>days—I stood at the bottom of the stairs till Mr. Gingell and Mr. Green both came up—I am confident that no person could have gone out at the Fleet-street gate without my seeing them—the prisoners were brought back in a short time into my chambers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of the Middle Temple. On Sunday night, the 12th of Jan., I was on duty in Brick-court, which forms part of Middle Temple-lane—I heard a cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter-past nine—I am quite sure it was after nine—the cry proceeded from the top of the lane near Temple-bar—I looked up the lane and saw two persons running down the lane towards me, from the top of Temple-lane—I went across Brick-court to meet them—in coming along there are two lamps—in crossing I got near to them, and could see them plainly—they went across Brick-court into Essex-court—along the top passage, from Essex-court to another passage into New-court (there is in New-court a small wicket-gate which opens into Devereux-court, which a per<lb></lb>son might get out at if it were open—it is open on Sunday morning till eleven, but it is shut afterwards—it was then locked, and no person could get out) I followed them to the end of the passage, and saw them returning from the gate—knowing they could not get out, I came back to Middle Temple-lane, and went round by the Hall into Garden-court, where I saw the prisoners coming up the steps, walking separately, one on one side, the other on the other—I laid hold of both of them—I can swear that they are the boys I saw come down Middle Temple-lane, and whom I had been chasing—the prisoner George had an open collar on, the same as he has now—Haddon, another watchman, was with me—he went through the lower passage into Brick-court—Gingell, the head-por<lb></lb>ter,</p>

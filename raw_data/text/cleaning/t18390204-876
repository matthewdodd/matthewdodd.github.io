                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. William Kingston, we are linen-drapers, and live in Westminster Bridge-road. The prisoner was our porter—be came on the 1st of December, and, as I understood, he was in very bad circumstances—we received information which lad us to sus<lb></lb>pect him, and on the evening of Monday, the 4th of February, I placed myself at a skylight from which I could have a view of that part of the shop where he and the other porter slept together—I went about eleven o'clock at night, and when I had been there some the minutes, I saw the other porter leave his bed-side, and go down stairs—I then saw the pri<lb></lb>soner go to a distant part of the warehouse to the shawl department—he returned with something under his arm—I saw the black fringe on his white shirt, and it appeared to me to be shawls which he had—he stooped down, folded up the shawls, and seemed to have great difficulty in getting them in somewhere, I fancy it was into a pocket—I went to the station-house, and requested the assistance of an officer, and at seven o'clock the next morning the officer came to our shop, and took him into custody<lb></lb>Mayor, our clerk, went down, and fetched up the prisoner's coat—I asked the prisoner if it was his—he said "Yes," and if he had had it that morn<lb></lb>ing—he said "Yes"—the policeman took these two shawls out of the pocket of that coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bradley, a butcher, who lives at No. 11, Grafton-street, Soho. The prisoner lived in the same house, in the back attic, at the time of this robbery—I remember his coming into the house at seven o'clock in the morning, on the 14th of July—I was going out to sweep the stairs, and met him coming up stairs with several rolls of linen on his arm—when I got down to the passage, which is on the ground-floor, I saw two boxes in the passage, and two men with them—I went out, and fetched my husband, and told him I thought there was a case of bankruptcy, or robbery, coming into the house—my husband came, and spoke to the two men who were in the passage—the prisoner was at that time up stairs—one of the men fetched him down, and the prisoner told my husband that it was his property, and it was all right—my husband wanted a policeman, but we could not find one—the prisoner and the other two men then emptied the boxes, which con<lb></lb>tained Irish linens—the linens were put into the prisoner's room—the pri<lb></lb>soner and one of the other men then went away with the empty boxes, and my husband followed, and gave them in charge.</p>

I am the witness's husband—I am a butcher—I re<lb></lb>collect my wife calling me that morning, while I was in the slaughter-house adjoining my premises—I came into the passage where this pro<lb></lb>perty was standing—I saw two men there, and the prisoner was fetched down—I had seen a cart at half-past six o'clock that morning draw up to the door, and saw a man undo the tail-board of the cart, and drag out a large wrapper, which appeared to have something very weighty in it, and also a small wrapper, and there were then two boxes left in the cart—after the prisoner had been brought down, I questioned him as to what property that was—he said, "It is all right; it is mine"—I said, "Take it out of the way, I rather doubt about its being all right," and I told my wife to get a policeman—she could not get one—I then went out myself, and was gone nearly half-an-hour, but I could not get one—when I came back one of the other men was gone—the prisoner and the other ran who remained then went off with the two empty boxes—I followed till I got across the Seven Dials—I then saw a policeman—the prisoner and the other man then went to a house, and put down the boxes—the other man got away, but the prisoner was taken—we questioned him about the goods—he said two men had come to him the night before, and asked him if he would take in some goods, and he said yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being there on the 30th of April, when some coals were delivered? - A. There were coals brought there, but I cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180101"></xptr>Q. Do you remember there being two persons that brought them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Deakin there at the time the coals were brought? - A. He was not, that I am very positive of.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he carrying on at that time? - A. A chandler's shop in Wentworth-street, about a hundred yards from my mistress's shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were you when the coals were delivered? - A. I was in the cellar, and helped to trim them, as I always did.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you were all the time they were delivered? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could not see any man that was standing at the side of the horses, you being in the cellar all the time the coals were shot? - A. I was in the cellar all the time they were shot; the waggon was there a quarter of an hour before we suffered them to be delivered; my mistress said, certainly it was a mistake.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are servant to the pipe-maker? - A. I was at that period.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being there on the 30th of April, when a waggon load of coals was carried in, when that man was there (Crew)? - A. I saw that man there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Deakin there when the coals were delivered, and you saw that man there? - A. He was not there; I was at work in the shop when they came to the door; I came out to carry some work into the air to dry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there the whole time the coals were delivered? - A. I was not there the whole time the coals were delivered; I came up and down several times; he was not there at all, I did not see him the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were not there during the whole time the coals were delivered - he might be there for what you know? - A. God knows, I did not see him; if he had been there, I must have seen him, because there were glass doors.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have been at the horse's head, and you not have seen him, you were not there during the whole time - what occasion had you to come up and down so often, when coals were delivering - do you do your work as you walk up and down stairs? - A. No; when the work gets too dry, it is a great loss to a man, I came to look at it.</p>

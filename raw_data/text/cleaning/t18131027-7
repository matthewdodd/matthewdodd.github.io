            . I keep an oyster-shop in Giltspur-street. On the 18th of September, the two prisoners came into my shop; they asked for some oysters; they had eighteen-pennyworth of oysters, and a pint of porter; no other people were in the room but the prisoners. My daughter came out, and said she had lost her bag; I came down the Old Bailey; I mentioned the circumstance to two officers; they said, they had seen him in the yard. I went home. They came to me about a quarter of an hour, and said, they had found the prisoners; they had searched them, and found my daughter's property on them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of Mr. French, that his daughter had been robbed. I apprehended the prisoners at the Pitt's Head. On Condall I found a smelling-bottle, and on searching Montague I found the remainder of the property, except the bags and keys. Condall acknowledged that he had done it, and said, he was very sorry for it. Montague said, that Condall gave her the property; she did not know that he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>- SMITH. I am an officer. I was in company with Eldridge. As Eldridge found the property he gave them to me. I produce them.</p>

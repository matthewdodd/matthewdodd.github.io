                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Law Wood. We have a warehouse at No. 117, Bishopsgate-street Within, in the parish of St. Martin Outwich. On Monday morning, the 29th of March, I went there, and missed the articles stated from the pattern-room, they are worth more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were safe on the Saturday pre<lb></lb>ceeding—this case of pistols, this case of gun-cleaning instruments, and other articles now produced, are our property, and are part of the things which were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ, and live in George-street, Shoreditch. On Saturday, the 27th of March, I locked up the pattern-room and the back premises—there are three windows to the pattern-room which look into the garden of the City Chambers—I believe the windows were all down—Brown was with me at the time—we locked the doors, and went away together—after locking the warehouse, I gave the keys to Brown to fasten the outer door, which has a patent lock—I left the workshop at six o'clock—I went to the warehouse again on Monday morning, about half-past nine, or a quarter to ten o'clock—I opened the front door, and when I got to the pattern-room I found the door ajar, and the windows open—I ran and informed the clerk, who came up and missed property—I looked out of window, and saw some ladders in the garden, placed against the warehouse, two or three yards from the window—they would enable a person to get in at the window of the pattern-room.</p>

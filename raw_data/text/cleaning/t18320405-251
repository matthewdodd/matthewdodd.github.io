             I am a Police-officer.

            . I was going down Pollard's-row, about half-past six o'clock, and saw Perry driving a little chaise cart, with the flour in it; I walked alongside of him I suppose, five hundred yards; an elderly man followed the cart, and crossed the way - I cannot swear to him, but I can to Perry.</p>

               <p>Perry's Defence (written). On the evening of the 16th of February, as I was standing in Cammomile-street, Bishopsgate, a respectable looking man came and asked if I was not the person who drove Mr. Smith's horse and cart; I told him I was; he then told me that he wanted me to remove a few goods for him on the following morning, at six o'clock, which I said I would do - he came the next morning, got into the cart with me, and told me to drive to Bethnal-green-road, which I did; when I came to Pollard's-row, he told me to drive down there, and stop under a loft window - he then, with two other men, who were in the loft, loaded my cart with five sacks out of the loft; he told me to follow him, which I did, till I was about half-way down Fashion-street, Spitalfields; he then told me to stop while he went over the way - he almost instantly returned, and said that the person the goods were for had removed, and I must wait while he went back to get his direction; while he was gone I got up on the cart to tie up one of the sacks, and three Policemen came up and asked me where the owner of the sacks was; I told them he was in the house opposite; they went in and brought him out, but let him make his escape.</p>
               <p>Creamer's Defence. Two men came to inquire for a baker who had lodged with me; I said he was gone, but I could give them a direction where to find him - I was about doing so when the officer came and took the man who was waiting for the direction; they let him go, and then came and took me - the cart stood opposite my door; the baker had instructed me to give any one his direction who might call for it - I did not know what the sack contained; I did not come outside my own shop - the shutters were up; I did not say the flour was my property - I have the shop and parlour, and have no communication with the rest of the house.</p>

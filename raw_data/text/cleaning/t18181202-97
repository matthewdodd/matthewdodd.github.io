On the 6th of November, in the night, some of the lead-covering of the stable was stolen. The stable is about five hundred yards from the dwelling-house. On the 12th more was taken, and more on the 22d. It was all taken from the same outhouse. I saw the last quantity on the day before. After we missed that stolen on the 12th, we thought proper to watch. On the morning of the 22d of November, between five and six o'clock, Wood was watching, and called me. I went round into the main road, and met the prisoner with the lead on his shoulder, about a quarter of a mile from the road. I laid hold of him, and told him to stop, or I would blow his brains back. He surrendered. We took him out. The lead produced was taken from the coach-house; it appeared fresh cut. We took him to the constable's.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Hobson. We were watching on the 22d of November, and about five o'clock I saw a man on the top of the stable, taking the lead off. I told my fellow-servant; he went into the main road, and came upon him close by it, with the lead on his shoulder. It was not light. He gave no account of himself. We had not seen him before.

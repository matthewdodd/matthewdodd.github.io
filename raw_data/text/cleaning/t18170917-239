             was building. On the 17th of July, I was set to watch on the upper warehouse, and saw the two prisoners, on the roof between twelve and one, there was a carpenter on the roof at the time, when he left, I saw the prisoners walk to and fro several times, I saw them together in the gutter, employed in laying the gutter, they were plumbers; I saw Rowe pull up his breeches, I remained in my place and saw them come from the roof, Durant came first and the other followed him, I thought Rowe looked bulky; I followed them down from the upper warehouse to the wharf, when I came there, I found Mr. Oliver on the wharf, and the gates locked; the prisoners went towards the gate and found them locked, they returned to the entrance of the first-floor above; Durant went to the ladder and called to Rowe, and said "there is a road this way we have no occasion to wait;" as Rowe was going up the ladder, Mr. Oliver took him - He resisted - I assisted - We searched and found forty-three pounds of lead concealed under his waiscoat, supported by a leather nailed to the lead; when I saw him pull up his breeches Durant was close to him - He must have seen what he was about.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The lead was not fixed to the gutter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 12th of De<lb></lb>cember, I was on duty about one hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house, and met the prisoner in St. George's-road, with a basket on his head, with bed-clothes shoved into it, and part of them hanging out over his shoulders—I stopped him and questioned him—he said he was remov<lb></lb>ing from a court in Wellington-street to the New Cut—he was not in the right way for that—I said the New Cut was in the way to the station-house, and I took him there—as we went along he said, I had no occasion to take him to the station-house, he was going to his sister's, who lived in the New Cut—I took him to the station-house, and found in the basket the blan<lb></lb>kets, merinos, oranges, and other things—he then said the things were given to him by a man in St. George's-road to carry—I found a key on him, which he told the Magistrate was the key of his mother's door—I examined it with the prosecutrix's door, and found that it both locked and unlocked it quite freely, but it would not act with the lock of his mother's door.</p>

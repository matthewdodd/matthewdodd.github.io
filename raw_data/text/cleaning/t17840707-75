               <p>I am a ticket-porter; on the 16th of June, about half past eleven, I saw the prisoner with another in company with him, both their hands were together near the gentleman's pocket, they were close behind; I saw one of them take it out of the gentleman's pocket, but which it was I cannot say, I think it was out of this gentleman's pocket; I immediately saw the prisoner take the handkerchief in his left hand, he clapped it in the side of his waistcoat, in his bosom, and he went off, I followed him and laid hold of him, and pinned his hands down, so that he could not very well get it, but he some how or other dropped it between his legs.</p>

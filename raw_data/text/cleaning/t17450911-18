            . These goods were in a warehouse belonging to Mr. Carne, I had not room to put them in my warehouse, so he gave me leave to put them into his, till I could get a chap to buy them; and when I came to look for them, there were only thirteen bundles out of 47. I discovered it first by this; my wife sent a pair of muffatees to Mr. Avery to be died, and they were sent home in some of my paper. I enquired how he came by that paper , and he said he bought it of one Mr. Roberts .</p>

            . The Prisoner worked with me two years, and when Mr Blayer brought this cargo, which was a very large one, I told him, I had a large warehouse to put it into, and I did not think any of my men would take it; the front of the pile always remained whole, and they had taken it away behind, and had as it were scooped it. Mr. Blayer said, Mr. Carne here is but very little paper left, here are but thirteen bundles; I said to the Prisoner, you had better confess the fact; and he said, he had sold between four and five hundred weight to one; I have three hundred, three quarters, eleven pound and a half , which he had sold to Mr. Ninn . When the Prisoner worked for me, he always behaved very well. I paid him a guinea a week, and when he worked piece work, I have paid him 25 or 30 l. a week. I would employ him again if he was at liberty, to make any work at home.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My acquaintance with her begun by our coming both in one Ship from Scotland. She told me, she was acquainted with great Men, and could do me Service, and expected I should do her some in return. She said, she ow'd a pretty deal of Money, and knew a way to pay off all her Creditors, which was to leave Goods with me, and pretending she was gone to Scotland, would send them word, that she had left such and such Goods, which if they would take in full for what she ow'd them, and give me a Discharge they might, otherwise they might get their Money how they could. Thus she sent me to Mr. Hayward, a Wine Merchant, with 15l. tho' she ow'd him 70l. He thinking that she was gone to Scotland, and left me to act for her, took the 15 l. in full for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173212060011"></xptr> the 70. So she compounded with Mrs. Avery, to whom she ow'd 20 l. for less than half the Money. It was upon this Account that she desir'd me to lye in her Room, and if any of her Creditors enquired for her, to tell them, she was gone to Scotland, tho' it was all a Trick. Before she left me, I told her, I had no Money for Necessaries. She said, I need not want, there were Goods enough in her Closet that I might dispose of upon Occasion, for I had her Keys.</p>
               <p>F. Naw Sir I last my Keys in my Drawers.</p>
               <p>P. She trusted the Keys and Goods too, to my Care, for she and I were very familiar, I have lain with her many a Time.</p>
               <p>F. Upon my Oath he never did, why, does your Loardship think I was lye with such a Jackanapes as he is? The Goods I trusted him to give to Mr. Hayward and the Brewer, was before I went out of Town.</p>
               <p>P. Here's Mr. Grub, the Pawnbroker, will give an Account of her.</p>
               <p>Grub. I know this Woman by the Name of Hamilton. A Piece of these Goods was pledg'd with me. I have dealt with her several Times. She has a very indifferent Character. She would cheat or defraud any Body. She brought me false Plate for good, and I lent her 20 l. upon it.</p>
               <p>F. I own I did; but you know it was my Lady Cassells, and it is in her Dining-room now; I was deceiv'd in it, and so was you.</p>

            . Before Justice De Veil she deny'd that she writ any Letter till he produc'd it. The Prisoner said, he had been very free with her, and sat up with her many a Night. He was ask'd hereupon, if he had lain with her? And he hum'd and haw'd, and at last said, No. 1 and 3 or 4 more went to see her Drawers, there was ho Violence done to them.</p>

            , again. He was very ill with a Pain in his Ear 4 or 5 Days after she went out of Town. I got him something to eat, and ask'd him, if he had a Porringer and Spoon? He said, No, for she had lock'd up every Thing.</p>
               <p>- Douglas, again. He told me so, and said, she had left him nothing but dirty Sheets.</p>

               <p>Mr. De Veil. When he was brought before me, he said several Things that intimated he had lain with her; upon which I put the Question to him, and he said, that he had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I had not lain in a Bed with her, and did not then say any more, for fear of being prosecuted by her Husband. But I say now, that I have lain with her several Times, and she told me, if her Husband dy'd, she would have no Man but me. I heard there was a Warrant to take her up for a Cheat.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Veil. No; it was only for deluding a young Woman, but she appear'd, and upon Examination was discharged.</p>
               <p>P. And she had deluded me too. She's a Woman of a vile Character; she brought a Lawyer with her to a Tavern, and he drew up a Confession, and she promis'd, if I would sign it, that she would not appear against me, but speak to the Jury, and the King in my behalf.

               <p>I live at No 7, in the Strand; I keep a shop for ready made linen.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of the prisoners? - I know none of them, I saw one of them take up the things at the counter, I was at the other end, and I ran after him and called out stop thief! this was on the 17th of December, one came in, but they were known by some neighbours to be all of a gang, he took the handkerchief up so, and ran off with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the door? - Very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop besides yourself? - Not a soul. There was a boy came in and asked for a pennyworth of something I did not deal in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the boy at the bar? - I really cannot say, I saw but one; he went away, and he left the door not shut to, for it makes a deal of noise, and I was standing looking at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you saw the person come in and take the things? -  It was all done in three minutes, and the things brought back to me by this gentleman, one of them came in in a minute after the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the person that took the linen, did you see him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Russel. Have you had the care of the things ever since? - The constable has.</p>

               <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday the 17th of December, I was going to the Savoy, I saw the prisoner Ginks and the boy Low in deep conversation as they were walking along before me; the boy, Low, turns sharp on one side and went into a haberdasher's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mrs. Russel's? - No, further on, I crossed the way and watched them, I followed them till they got beyond Mr. Russel's shop, then they turned about and there were three in company, Tilley, and Low, and Ginks, I saw them within twenty yards of Mr. Russel's shop, there came by at the time two or three coaches and carts; I did not see either of the prisoners go into the shop, but I presently heard the cry of stop thief! at that time I see the prisoners all run down one street, Adam-street, I saw them the minute I ran down after them, and I met Low and Ginks walking away, I stopped both and gave the prisoner Low into Mrs. Russel's hands, and defired her to bring him back and Tilley agreed to go back to the shop; he said he knew neither of the other two; they were all taken back and detained till the officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ginks. I would wish to know how near he was to us together? - I was close to them, I heard them say something about a shop, but what it was particularly I could not hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Low. I asked this young man which was the nearest way to the Savoy.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Russel. They are the only unmade goods in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tilley. I had been up to Paternoster-row, to the Gazette office, to know if a Gazette was out, I was going back, and I thought I would call at a customer's in the Adelphi, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and a sailor man came up to me and said, I must come back, for I had robbed the shop of some linen, and I was delivered into two or three peoples hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is your master? - Mr. Canton, he lives at No. 38, Charing-cross, he keeps the Gazette office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Low. I went to see if I could find out my sister that lives in the Savoy, and I was coming along and I met this man, and I asked him which was the way to the Savoy? and he said he could not tell me, and I went into a shop and they directed me, and then I went strait on and I heard somebody halloo out stop thief! and I went to see what was the matter, and as I was going down that gentleman there came and laid hold of me, and said, I was along with them that robbed the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ginks. I work at chelsea, as I was coming from work Mr. Hicks came up to me and laid hold of me, Low had before come up to me and asked me the way to the Savoy, I told him I could not direct him, but the best way would be to enquire in at the shop; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150130"></xptr>have no witnesses, I had people to appear for my character all the day, but they are just gone home to dinner.</p>

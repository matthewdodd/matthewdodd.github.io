            . I have no great matter to say against the prisoner. I was walking along the street very fuddled, and met with her, and she directed me to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go along with you?</p>
               <p>Walker. She did; I believe I was just able to walk along, and up into her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there?</p>
               <p>Walker. I cannot justly say whether she was by herself or not at first, but presently after there were two more; they asked me whether I would give them any beer. There was some beer drank.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010014"></xptr>Walker. I cannot tell where; it was down the Strand, I cannot justly say where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Walker. I never saw her before in my life. I had nothing to do with her, I only gave them liquor. I was not capable of getting out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the room?</p>
               <p>Walker. I cannot tell; they called for something of a dram, and that dram and the other liquor together finished me.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you about you?</p>

               <p>Walker. I thought I had about 25 s. the prisoner confesses to 23 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had it from?</p>
               <p>Walker. From out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she confess this?</p>
               <p>Walker. This was before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take her up?</p>
               <p>Walker. After I had slept awhile, and recovered myself, I got out of the room and went away, and was persuaded the next day to take her up, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of the money again?</p>
               <p>Walker. I did some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Walker. I did not stay above two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room when you awaked?</p>

I was coming up stairs, and the prisoner came out, and said, there is a young woman has got a young man in the room, and sat down on the stairs; by and by she blow'd out the candle, and put some money in her lap. Whether she had got the man's breeches, or not, I cannot tell, the candle being out; but, after that, she went and threw something on the bed, she went down stairs immediately and paid her rent.</p>

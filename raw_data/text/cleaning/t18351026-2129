                  </hi>. I am a private in the Scotch Fusileer guards. On Monday afternoon, the 5th of October, I was opposite the New Post-office, at about a quarter before five o'clock—the male prisoner came up to me, and said something about the Queen of Spain's service—we had a few words together—I cannot say what—his wife came up, and said, "Never mind, come on, let us go and have a pot of beer together"—we went into the King William, in Noble-street—the man was in a black frock coat, all in rags—he called for a pint of four-penny ale—he drank a glass, and gave me a glass—I took it out of his hand, but I felt quite sick, and did not drink it—I sat down on the seat, and felt quite sick—I then came on my side, and then on my back—I was not intoxicated, but I had had no dinner—I laid down, and this handkerchief was in my cap—the woman took it and placed it over my face, and I being a married man, thought it was my own wife, as I was laid down, and got stupified with laying—she unbuttoned my waistcoat partly up, so with that I went off into a sleep—when I awoke, I missed my watch, and have never seen it since—I had it when I went into the public-house—I felt it in my fob, and the ribbon was outside—the guard was round my neck, which was cut: this is it—this part was down to the watch, and it was cut by a shoemaker's knife—there was a ribbon and key attached to my watch, and a silver penny of George III.</p>

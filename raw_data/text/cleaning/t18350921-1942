                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Frederick-place, Hampstead-road. I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Royal William,</hi> a steamer, which was going to Margate, with Margaret M'Henry—she had a carpet-bag—I saw it safe on board—I saw it deposited safe—I took the ladies to show them where it had been placed, and it was then gone—I had placed it there about five minutes before—the lady desired me to search for it immedi<lb></lb>ately—I looked over all the carpet—bags in the fore part of the vessel, and</p>

               <p>on looking up in a few minutes, I saw the prisoner in custody—I saw the carpet—bag and claimed it—the lady went to Margate, and has since gone to Paris—I know the bag—It contained money and jewellery; and a pad<lb></lb>lock which is here.</p>

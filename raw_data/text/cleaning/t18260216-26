The prisoner was nearly two years in our service. On the 19th of January, about eight o'clock at night, as he was leaving work, I stopped him at the gate, and said he must be searched, but nothing was found on him; I accompanied the officer to his premises, leaving him behind; they brought down two yards and a half of linen; he immediately said "This is my master's property"- the officer said "We do not want you to implicate yourself." I could not identify it myself - he was employed the day before in cutting linen of this description, and in a book, in his own hand-writing, he has entered forty-eight garments cut from this duck, which three pieces would make, and by cutting them rather small he might leave two yards and a quarter over - it was of the same quality as the garments cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you two or three different firms? A. No; the names of Favel and Bousfield are over our door, but the first is only there by courtesy.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge, but found nothing on him; I then went to the second floor front room at No. 47, Duke-street, Aldgate, and found three pieces of Russia duck - I took them to Mr. Bousfield's, where the prisoner had been detained; he said "They are my master's." I cautioned him to say nothing that would hurt him.</p>

               <p>JURY to Mr. BOUSFIELD. Q. It is usual for you to expect so many garments from a piece, and for him to have the rest? A. No; we allow no perquisites - the remnants should be used up in the next quantity cut - we allow nothing to be taken off the premises; I had cautioned him against taking any thing.</p>

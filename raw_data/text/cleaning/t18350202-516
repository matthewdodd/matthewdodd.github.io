                  </hi>. I live at North Brixton. I was at Hammersmith on the 19th of January—I recollect being near the post-office that morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, putting a letter in—I heard the cry of, "Here is the procession of Mr. Hume"—there was no crowd near me, and I thought I would stop to see the procession, but in a minute or two there was a large rush of men at the head of the procession, which inclosed me—they came all round me—I felt some motion at my watch—I imme<lb></lb>diately put my hand down, and felt my watch was safe—I immediately felt another sensation of something going forward—I put my hand down that moment, and found it was drawn out of my pocket—I seized the man immediately, it was the prisoner—I seized hold of his left arm—I was to squeezed up—there was no struggle between us, till I caught hold of his arm, and called out, "He has got my watch"—he struggled very hard, and put his right hand out, clenched—I thought the watch was in it, but I can<lb></lb>not say it was—the carriages were coming by, and I found I should be under the wheels if I remained—I let him go—a witness ran after him, and he was brought back in custody—I am certain he is the same person as I had seized—I did not recover my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Hammersmith on the 19th, in the crowd close to the prosecutor—I heard him say, "I have lost my watch," and saw him immediately lay hold of the prisoner's left arm—I am certain he is the man—I laid hold of his right hand, which he held out, and tried to feel what he had got in it; but I could not, a carriage-pole hit me, and I was obliged to let go—but I swear he is the man—I did not see any</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Hammersmith on the 19th—I saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor take hold of the prisoner—the prisoner, and three more men before that, surrounded Mr. Champion—one of them had hold of his arm, and the prisoner knocked his hat over his eyes with his left hand, and drew his watch out with his right—Mr. Champion caught hold of him, and said, "You have got my watch"—the prisoner knocked his hat off into the road; and after that, one of his companions came up, got the watch out of the prisoner's hand, and ran away with it into the crowd—I saw him take it out of his hand—I had seen the prisoner take it out of Mr. Champion's pocket—he kept it down in front of him.</p>

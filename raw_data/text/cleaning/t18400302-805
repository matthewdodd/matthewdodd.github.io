                  </hi>. I live in Norway-place, Limehouse. About half-past two o'clock, on the 24th of February, I was in Leadenhall-street with a lady and the witness Larkin—there was a crowd round an omni<lb></lb>bus—I felt a hand in the right-hand pocket of my dress, which contained a green silk purse, with one half-crown, four shillings, and two fourpenny pieces—I endeavoured to lay hold of the hand, which belonged to the prisoner Hart—I am sure of that—she dragged her hand away with the purse—I turned round, and laid hold of her cloak; she thought I was alone, and began abusing me—when Larkin spoke to her, she turned round and walked away—I am quite sure it was her hand that was in my pocket.</p>

I live with my father, in Norway-place, I was with the prosecutrix—I heard her say to Hart, "You have picked my pocket, you have taken my purse," and Hart called her an impudent <hi rend="italic">hussy</hi> for saying so—Hart went way—I followed her, and told her the young lady accused her of taking her purse, and desired her to return—she refused to do so—Cooper came up, took his hand out of his pocket, and put his hand to Hart, and she passed the purse to him directly—I could not see the colour of the purse, it was passed so quickly—a gentleman took hold of Cooper—he knocked him away, and ran away directly.</p>

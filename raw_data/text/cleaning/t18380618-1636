                  </hi>. I am servant to William Dicker, a pawnbroker, in Lambeth Marsh. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 15th of June a young man called me, and said something—I directly ran out, and found the window broken—this scent-bottle was outside the window, and this watch-chain lying down, which had been inside, attached to it, but both had been removed from their places—abroad knife was found upon, the pri<lb></lb>soner.</p>

On the 15th Of June, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the sale-shop door, hanging up things, and saw the prisoner walking up and down, with a looking-glass under his arm—in a few minutes I heard the chains falling in the window—I ran out, and saw him walking away—there was nobody near the wiadow bat him—I ran and secured him—I am rather deaf, and had not heard the glass break—I had seen it whole two hours before—I saw the bottle out<lb></lb>side the window, and the chain hanging down inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of a canal boat, called the <hi rend="italic">Pro<lb></lb>vidence</hi>. The prisoner came to me at Box-moor, about the end of Oct.—he applied to go with the boat to Brentford, and proposed to work for his victuals—he joined the boat, and went with me to Brentford—on the 4th of Nov. I left him in the boat, against Brentford-lock, near the bridge—I came back about nine o'clock in the evening, and found I had lost a new velveteen jacket, a sovereign and a half-sovereign, and a cork-screw—the prisoner was absent—he had not told me that he should not stop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boatman, and was employed by Mr. Mullett. I left the boat on the 4th of Nov., and left the prisoner in charge of it while I went to look after a horse at Brentford—I returned to the boat in about half an hour—the prisoner was gone—I went into the cabin—I found one cupboard with the lock broken off, and the other cupboard was un<lb></lb>locked—I missed two waistcoats of mine, a pair of trowsers, a shirt, my stockings, my silk hankerchief, a half neck-handkerchief, a watch, and other things—I took the horse, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, but could not find him—he had left his own waistcoat in the cabin, which he had on when I left him—it was worth very little—my clothes were gone, and have never been found—when I saw the prisoner again he was in custody of the officer at Berkhamstead—he called me to his bedside and asked if 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would make it up—he was then in bed in the constable's house—I said I had nothing at all to do with it.</p>

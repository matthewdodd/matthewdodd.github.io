               <p>I am a foreigner; I went out in company on the 26th of May, and liquor overtook me; I got astray, and some strange body picked me up, I cannot tell who it was, I was so much in liquor; my company left me, we were somewhere in the outskirts of the town, playing at skittles, and we all got a little groggy; the next morning I found myself in a strange room by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you were picked up? - A. I was in a strange place where I never was before, and I could not come there by myself; I laid down in a sort of a bed, the door was open, and the key sticking into it; when I awoke it was about six o'clock in the morning, when I searched, I found my breeches were gone with all that was in them, there was a purse in them with sixty-three guineas; misfortune had been preparing me for bad luck, it was my own money, I brought it from abroad, and I lost a silver watch with a gold chain, and a silver seal, three dollars of the Zealand coin, and a Portuguese piece, and some shillings, I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Q. And you got dead drunk with all the property in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last observed this property in your pocket? - A. When I was at play in the afternoon; I made an enquiry who rented that room where I found myself in, and they all agreed it was a young woman, not very tall, a Scotch woman; I went and informed the constable of the parish of it, and he went and gave some notice of it; I don't know any thing of the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. We wish to ask him, if, when he left his friends, he was sober enough to know that he had his money then? - A. Yes, I am sure I had it then; but coming in the air, I was very hot, and the liquor overtook me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay any thing when you came away? A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what was in it? - A. No, I never opened it; I put it into a cupboard; she came back again about eight o'clock, and I gave it to her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint any body that she had given you this parcel? - A. No; I did not say any thing to any body.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Hatton-Garden: On the 27th of May, the prisoner at the bar came to the office, and said, she was robbed; she was very much in liquor; she said, a coachman had robbed her of fifteen guineas; the coachman was examined before the Magistrate, and was committed to be brought up the next morning; I went with her to tell her landlady to keep her sober till next morning, it was in East-Smithfield, in a court full of lodgers; I don't know whose house it is, I went only to take her home, as she was so much in liquor; I had no suspicion of her having robbed any body, she told me, first of all, she lived in Hermitage-street; going along in the coach, she asked me where I was going with her, I told her, I was going to see her home; she told me she had robbed a foreigner, she was very drunk at that time, and she told me she would give me a watch and two guineas to go back with her to the Rose, in Hatton-Wall; I said, I thought you told me you had no money; she said, she had got some at that house; when we came back to the Rose, in a coach, she went backwards; I saw the girl, the last witness, hand a parcel across to her, so I sprang in, and said, I insisted upon having that parcel, I brought it out into the tap-room, it was rolled up in a dirty handkerchief, and I told out forty guineas, two half guineas, and a watch, and I think 18s. in silver, three dollars, and a Portuguese piece; I asked the Magistrate to put the office seal upon it, which was done, and it has been there ever since, (produces it).</p>


               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I know it by the seal and the string, it is an English made watch, and a Dutch paper in it, where it was cleaned, in Amsterdam; the gold was in a purse; these dollars are the same sort that I lost; these are my purses, one of them was broke, and I know it by the colour.</p>

               <p>I was sent for by the prisoner to take a coachman in custody, who had robbed her of fifteen guineas; I went to the Rose, in Hatton-Wall, and there the coachman was, and upon searching him, I found eleven guineas and sixpence, and three-pence in halfpence, (produces them); I took him down to our office, and I was bound over to prosecute the coachman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coachman confessed he took the money from me, and offered the constable five guineas to let him go.</p>

               <p>Witness. There was something similar to that; the coachman said, he would give me five guineas to let him escape.(The prisoner, in her defence, said, it was given to her by a country woman of her's).</p>
               <p>Brown. My Lord, she told me, when I was taking her down to Bridewell, that if she could find out this man, she would give him the money again, for it would do her no good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had it from another person? - A. No; she said it was a foreigner's money.</p>

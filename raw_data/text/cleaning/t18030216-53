On Wednesday evening, I looked at my notes, there were five, four Bank-notes, one country note, and a five-pound Bank-note; when I went to put my coat on, on Thursday morning, I looked at my pocket-book the first thing I did when I went up after having my hair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160050"></xptr>dressed, which was about ten o'clock, I then missed another note; I came down, the prisoner was at breakfast in the kitchen; I said to Mrs. Adams, who was in the kitchen, you have not touched my pocket-book this morning; she said, no; I said, there is another note gone this morning, that makes two; the prisoner immediately said, if you have any suspicion of me, I have no objection to stand search; I told her I had very great reason to suspect her, and that confirmed my suspicion; I went for an officer; when he came, she said, she had no objection to his searching her, and if he thought fit, he might search her box; I desired the officer to search her box; he went up and searched it, and came down again; he said he had found no notes, but he had found five guineas in gold; he produced the guineas rolled up in an old pair of gloves; I asked her how she came by that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Had not you made some promise that you would be lenient to her? - A. None, at all; she said she had received them from her sister on Sunday night, to send into the country to her father to pay for nursing her sister's child; the sister living in the neighbourhood, I sent the officer for her, and asked her if she had given any money to her sister, and to what amount, on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of the prisoner? - A. No; I said I was not satisfied with the account of the five guineas, I would have her before a Magistrate; she then went down on her knees, and said, if I would forgive her, she would fetch me the notes; I asked her where they where; she said she would fetch them; she ran up stairs, and I followed her into my daughter's bed-room, and from between the two mattresses, the straw and wool mattress under the bed, she took out a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you were in the room? - A. Yes, and the constable with me; she took out the handkerchief, which contained several other articles, among the rest, a small purse, which contained two notes; the constable has the notes in his possession, with some other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. As a gentleman, you would not have taken a girl without a character? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you miss? - A. Two, one on the Tuesday, and one on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for you to remember the numbers of the notes? - A.Certainly.</p>

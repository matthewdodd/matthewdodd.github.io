On the 28th of August I went with the craft to take in these sixty bags; but before I went I left word that the bag-menders might be sent to repair the bags, which is the usual course; when I had got along-side they began, and gave me a great part of the cotton before the bag-menders came; Cripps and Jones came on board<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140074"></xptr>came on board, the greater part of it was in the lighter; such as was necessary. I pointed out to them, that they might attend to them; I saw a great deal of cotton fall from Mr. Dixon's bags, and I desired Cripps and Jones to make a bag and collect that cotton, which they did, and it was filled; and finding that was not sufficient, I took a bag which contained the wrappers that they brought, and put the remainder into it, and chucked it to them on board the lighter, and we went to <placeName id="t17960914-16-crimeloc89">Wiggin's Quay, near Billingsgate</placeName>

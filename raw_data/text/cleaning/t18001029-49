                  </persName>
             sworn. - I live in Fox-court, in a parallel line with the brewhouse: On the 26th of September; I saw Jones carry a great deal of timber out of the brewhouse; I have seen him and Clarke repeatedly, times without number, carrying wood away, and have reproved them many times; I did not take any particular notice when I saw them together; but I have seen Clarke on the premises on the 20th of September; they were joists, and large pieces of girders.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mr. Wade.) Mr. Wade, you have charged this as a joint taking, whereas the evidence is, that the one has taken at one time, and the other at another; you must now make your election against which you will go -</p>

               <p>Mr. Wade. I will go against Clarke, then.</p>

               <p>Evans. I saw Clarke, on the 20th of September, carrying timber out,of the brewhouse; some person inside handed it out, and he carried it away.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to have him apprehended? - A. There was nobody came forward to prosecute, nobody took notice of it; it was nobody's business.</p>

               <p>Q. The fall you speak of was accidental, was it not? - A. No; the girders were all sawed off close to the wall, and so let down by villainy.</p>

               <p>(Styles produces one of the pieces of timber found in the house in which Clarke worked.) I am certain this is one of the pieces that I marked; Clarke has claimed the horses that he cut the wood up upon; and that he tied the bundles up with; he claimed them himself at Hatton-garden, and had them from us.</p>

               <p>Clarke's defence. On the Ist of October the boys in the brewhouse were throwing stones, and to prevent their breaking my windows, I went into the brewhouse to drive them away (it is an open place and has been for these two years) when this gentleman came and laid hold of me; I have lived twenty-one years there, and never had a stain in my character.

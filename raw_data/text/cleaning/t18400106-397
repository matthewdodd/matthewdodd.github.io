                  </hi>I am an excavator, and live at Mersham, in Surrey. On Friday, the 29th of November, about ten o'clock at night, I went to the Nag's Head, on Tower-hill, with a man and two women—I asked Richard Holt to bring me a pint of ale—he brought it, and I gave him a sovereign to pay for it—he was to bring me the change back—he came back, and said I should have change directly—I waited for five or seven minutes, but it did not come—I then followed him out, and he made a statement to me—I did not get the change from him.</p>

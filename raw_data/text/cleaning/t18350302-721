                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called into this house by Mrs. Gale—I found the landlady and the prisoner at high words—she would not let the prisoner go out, which she wanted to do—she said she expected the man had a deal of money, and she wished to know if his mo<lb></lb>ney was right before the girl went—the prisoner was dressed then—I asked her if the man's money was all right—she said, "Yes"—I awoke the man—he examined the bag, and said his gold was gone—the prisoner produced a sovereign, and said, "Here is your gold"—she put it on the table—he said he had more gold than that—I searched the prisoner, and found eight sovereigns and a half, and one shilling, in her bosom, and in her hand a purse with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Gale—our house is in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell. Kelly and the prisoner came there for a bed—I showed them to the bed-room—Kelly paid me, and I could see, by the weight of the bag, that he had a quantity of money—I could not tell whether it was gold or silver—I locked the door outside—some time afterwards there was an alarm at the door—I went in, and asked what was wanted—the prisoner asked me to walk in—I walked in, and asked her pleasure—she said, "There is a sovereign, will you go and fetch some spirits?"—I said no; it was not a thing we were accustomed to: and if the money belonged to the gentleman, she had better place it in the bag again, which she had in her hand—I left the room, and locked it again—I went to the room again—she said she had a key to take to her friend, to let her into her room—I said, she should not leave till I sent for an officer to see if the gentleman's money was safe—my</p>

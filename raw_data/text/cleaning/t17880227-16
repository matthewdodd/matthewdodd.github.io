               <p>Which of them said that? - I cannot be positive; I turned round and looked the prisoner in the face; when I was at the door of the Rose Tavern, in Bridges-street, the prisoner and the other man came by again; at that time, this gentleman and lady came directly out, and the prisoner and two others pressed them very much, particularly the lady; they pushed her up against the wall, and she cried out; while the gentleman was handing the lady into the coach, the gentleman's hands were both up, and I saw the prisoner take the watch; I immediately told the gentleman; the prisoner attempted to run away, and I pointed him out among the coachmen.</p>
               <p>Did he get out of your sight? - No, he was never out of my sight, from the time he took the watch till he was stopped.</p>

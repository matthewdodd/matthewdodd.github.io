            . I am an officer. I was coming along Charles-street, and the cab drove up at the end of the mews; the prosecutor got out, and this young woman went up to him - he was trying to get her away; she would not go, but kept hanging to him - he appeared quite sober, and when she was gone he said she had robbed him of his money - he told me the same story he has told here to-day; the prisoner had turned to the right when she left the mews -I followed, and took her by the Royal-hotel, in St. James'-street; she had her pocket off in her hand, but I found no money on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He stated that he went up stairs, took off his coat, and then missed the money; he came down, and thought he had dropped it - I know nothing of the money, and never saw it - I am innocent.</p>

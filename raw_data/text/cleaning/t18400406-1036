                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Fore-street. On the night of the 27th of March I came home about a quarter before eleven o'clock and found two men in my shop packing up my goods—the door was locked against me—I had left it locked about half-past nine o'clock—the lock had been picked apparently—I lost a good many boots and shoes—there were four parcels ready packed up in the shop—on, my opening the door one man came out on me, and the other bounced out against my wife and knocked her down—the prisoner is one who came out—I pursued and took him without losing tight of him—the value of the property is 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the door was left on the catch lock, and as soon as I put my key in it opened—I am quite certain I left it locked.</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief on the 27th of March, and saw the prisoner running across Fore-street into Milton-street, about ten yards from Mr. Land's shop—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him and saw him put his hand in his right hand pocket, about fifty yards up Milton-street, and throw away something which jingled—I afterwards received from a boy, named Fry, in the street, a bunch of pick<lb></lb>lock keys—I saw the prisoner secured.</p>

I understand there are large locks on the doors, and it is not likely such small keys would open the locks. I was never in prison before in my life.</p>

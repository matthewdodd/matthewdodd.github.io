               <p>Court. Do you recollect whether that window was shut or not? - No, I do not; I had a black boy, and I took him into custody on suspicion, and upon something I heard respecting this prisoner, I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him at your house with the black boy? - Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - The same afternoon; I took him right facing my door, at the eating house; he had the watch and shoes upon him: he said before the Magistrate that this black boy conveyed them out of the window to him; he owned to fourteen guineas; he had changed my buckles and bought a new pair, and a new chain to my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I suppose your first suspicion was, that the boy had robbed you, and thrown up the window by way of trick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the boy tell you any thing about it? - He denied it.</p>
               <p>You did not find any part of your house broke at all? - No, I cannot tell whether the back window was broke open or not.</p>
               <p>Before this poor fellow had been before the Magistrate, had not he been told that he should be hanged? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you, or somebody else in your hearing, say to the prisoner over and over again, that if he would tell all he knew, it would be better for him? - I never heard anything of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you hear somebody say to him, if you will tell all about it you shall not be hurt? - They might say so.</p>
               <p>But did not they? - They might.</p>

He followed no kind of business; he has been in the sea-faring life.</p>

This was about twelve o'clock: as soon as he was gone, I missed a stone gold ring: the prisoner returned between four and five: I watched him then, and saw him take a gold ring and a gold shirt-buckle set with garnets: after he had done this, he was going, as he pretended, to fetch the thirty-six shilling pieces; I immediately stopped him, and then he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and dropped the ring and shirt buckle; I saw him drop them; the other gold ring I took out of his waistcoat pocket; when he was searched he had but one shilling and six-pence and a few half-pence in his pocket.</p>

               <p>I met with a man who asked me to drink with him, he pulled out a thirty-six shilling piece, and asked me if I knew where he might change it; I told him at a silversmith's he might get it weighed; when we had drank a pint of beer together, he said, he had been in the gentleman's shop before, and asked the gentleman to buy the piece of him; he would not give any more than twenty-nine shillings for it; I went into the shop; I had a pair of silver sleeve-buttons, I asked the gentleman to mend them; I went out, and returned in the afternoon to the gentleman's shop for my sleeve-buttons; he said, they were not done; he said, I stole a ring; he put his hand in my pocket and kept it there some time; he told the people in the shop he took the ring out of my pocket; I did not know that it was in my pocket.</p>

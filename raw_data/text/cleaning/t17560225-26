               <p>Midleton. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winter. Where did you see her?</p>
               <p>Winter. I saw her at the Royal-Oak, near Newmarket-Street, Wapping, just by Edward-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Midleton's house?</p>

               <p>Winter. It is. The prisoner at the bar brought the child in, and call'd for a pint of beer, and then drank to me; I thought she had been some lady's servant in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the child before?</p>
               <p>Winter. I had seen the child before many times, but did not know who were its parents. The prisoner went out with the child, and I saw no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there?</p>
               <p>Winter. She staid a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did she go with the child?</p>
               <p>Winter. I did not see which way she went.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Harding's, at Spring-Gardens, Stepney. This child (pointing to it) came last Wednesday was fortnight to our house, along with the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner ask'd me if I had any new buns, and said, Sally will you have one? the child said yes. She had her gold necklace on, and her wires in her ears then.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this ?</p>
               <p>A. Vesper. This was about eleven o'clock. Then she said, come, now we'll go and have a pint of ale; then she had a pint of two-penny; after which she went out at our gate, that goes towards the church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>A. Vesper. I had seen her several times at our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. He lives in Ratcliff-Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. I live in Falmouth-Street, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your child?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. She is ten years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she on when she went out ?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. She had a jacket, petticoat, and a scarlet cloth cloak on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she go from you?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. About seven at night; but I did not see her till between nine and ten, when the neighbours brought her home. She then had not the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it afterwards ?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. I found the prisoner at the bar, and she own'd she had the cloak, but had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find her?</p>
               <p>S. Craggs. In Norton-Falgate, where she lived. I went there by five o'clock in the morning and found her mother; I then ask'd for the prisoner, but she told me her daughter was not at home. I look'd about and saw her lying on the floor, and by the description my child had given me, there lay her hat and cloaths by her. I said young woman get up, and let me have the cloak you took from my child such a day, or I'll charge an officer with you. She got up, and told me my child gave it her, and she had pawn'd it. Her mother said, Madam, if you will not make a disturbance, you shall have the cloak. I insisted the prisoner should go with me to the pawnbroker's. She went with me to a pawnbroker in Bell-Yard, Whitechapel. She there told the pawnbroker's wife she brought it herself on Saturday morning, the cloak was produced there, and this is it ( holding one in her hand.)</p>

               <p>Clawson. She is at home; we could not both leave the shop together.</p>

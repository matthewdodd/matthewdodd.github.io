Some moulds were missed about the time he left, and while he was there, and some since, but they might have been taken before. I made these moulds, their value was from 3 l. to 3 l. 10 s., but they are not worth that now. He worked their ten or twelve months, we missed none till he came.

            . I am a printer, and live at No. 3, Redcross-court, Barbican. I work for Mr. Macdonald, of Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. I have known the prisoner four or five months - about that time ago, he told me he had some printing materials to sell, which were the remaining stock of his business, as a letter-founder at Bristol - he gave me a sample of the type as a specimen to sell for him; and shewed me some in a box, but I did not understand them - he said one Williamson was his partner - I offered the type to Mason, six or seven weeks ago, and shewed him the sample, and in consequence of what he said, I brought him the rest of the type. I got it from Hughes's, the prisoner helped me to carry it - it was 56 lbs. It was weighed at Masons; the prisoner did not go into Mason's with me, he brought it to the door, I said I would take it in myself; a mould was with it, like those which printers use - I told the prisoner to write a bill, he wrote it in the name of Williamson and Co., and asked me to copy it - he said Williamson was more known in the trade as a letter-founder, as he was the principal workman - he gave that as his reason for having the bill in that name - I copied it to alter the price, as I was to have a profit on the sale - I delivered the bill to Mason, and after that, called several times for the money, as he was busy; I told the prisoner from time to time that Mason was putting me off, but as he was poor, I gave him 1 l. in advance. The last time I went, which was the 18th of August, Mason told me he had his suspicions, and that Figgins had claimed it. I immediately went to Figgins (no charge was made against me), this was on a Saturday - I arranged with Figgins to meet him at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, Clerkenwell-green, on Monday - I told the prisoner of it, he said he would be there at one o'clock - I returned and told Figgins the hour appointed; I went, according to appointment - Figgins, Mason, and a man named Williamson came, as his name had been used, but I did not know him - we waited an hour, then Williamson and I were taken up - I was in custody a fortnight, and then admitted to bail - I had seen the prisoner at times, at his lodgings at Hughes's, and think I remember his taking some type out in a pocket handkerchief to be weighed, opposite to where he lodged - I was to ask 18 d. a lb. for the type; I agreed to sell it to Mason at 1 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer it to M'Donald first - A. Yes; and told him I had it from one Hopkins, who had been in business at Bristol, and said I became acquainted with him through my brother - I never said I took it for a bad debt; I told Mason that I had it from Hopkins, I did not say at the office that I had it from Williamson, I said he was in the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate send you to the House of Correction for prevarication - A. He committed me, I do not know what for; I might say the type weighed about 51 1/2 lbs.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell Mason you had it from Williamson - A. No; I copied the bill which was in that name - As soon as the prisoner was in custody, I and Williamson were discharged.</p>

On examining of the type, I suspected it was not honestly come by, as there was none of some letters, and very few of others - I made enquiry, and sent to Figgins, and appointed to meet him, and Bass (whom I had told that Figgins claimed the property) at the Lamb and Flag - I went on Monday, Figgins, Bass, Williamson, and Read were there; the prisoner did not come - Bass and Williamson were taken into custody. I was to give 1 s. a lb. for the type, and 10 s. for the mould - Bass had worked for me about a year and a half ago; I told him it was Figgin's; he was willing to go to him - Read took the type.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did Bass say he had it from Williamson - A. At first he said from Williamson, and then from Hopkins.</p>

            . I am a letter-founder. The prisoner left my employ about last January - on Saturday, the 18th of August, Bass called on me and made a communication about the type; I attended at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, and sent for Williamson, who was in my employ at the same time as the prisoner - the prisoner did not come, the others did - the type is my manufacture, and was never sold in this state, the mould has been altered since it was stolen, but it is mine.</p>

            . I was formerly in Mr. Figgins's employ. I was never at Bristol in my life, and was never in partnership with the prisoner, except that I did some work for Mason, and the prisoner and I parted the money which the mould earned, that was before Christmas, 1819, This is the mould we used; he brought it to me; he was at that time in Figgins's employ; it was not in this state when I had it - it was in a stereotype state - I have used it both before and since it was altered - that was before Christmas, 1819; also, I put this board on it - I believe it to be the mould, but will not be certain.</p>

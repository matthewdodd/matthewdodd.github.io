               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you go to Mr. Sykes's house, in Gray's Inn lane? - A. On the 12th of March, Mr. Sellon applied for a warrant to enquire of Mr. Sykes; Mr. Sykes <rs id="t18040411-65-deflabel385" type="occupation">keeps <placeName id="t18040411-65-crimeloc386">the Sun, in Gray's Inn lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the casks are Mr. Sellon's? - A. Yes; they have the mark of Mr. Sellon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Does it not frequently occur that casks belonging to one <rs id="t18040411-65-viclabel387" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

               <p>Q. With a publican who deals with four or five different brewers, it frequently occurs that mistakes happen, in a fair regular course of trade? - A. It certainly does.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Meux's casks may get along with Mr. Sellon's, and vice versa. -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does it happen, in course of business, that these casks get exchanged, suppose Mr. Meux takes the cask, and sends it out with beer? - A. A man may get one cask by way of another, by way of mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Meux takes Mr. Sellon's cask, and fills it again, does it happen they fill it again? - A. It does happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these casks, a small beer cask or what? - A. They may be used either for strong or small.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. It was some time within a fortnight after I was there; I had been there a few days, I have forgot the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Sykes was a customer of Mr. Sellon's or not? - A. I do not know any customer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you came to Sykes's house, there was one left there - who did you see when you left it? - A. I do not remember seeing any body when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man in the house, or any of his family? - A. No, there was a door that goes out of the street into a stable-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the house before? - A. I cannot say I did, I never was in that quarter before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or he roll it down? - A. I helped him; he said, we will leave this here till another time, or day, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in it? - A. I cannot say whether it was full or not; there was something in it, but I cannot tell what was in it.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see any body there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know now who keeps the house? - A. He had a fustian jacket when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether that is the man? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn. - I am one of the Police officers of Hatton-garden; I went with a warrant to Sykes's house; I went with Mr. Evans, and in Mr. Sykes's cellar I found a cask of beer, and an empty cask, said by Mr. Evans to be the property of Mr. Sellon; and after Mr. Evans went to fetch the dray to take the beer away, Mr. Sykes was left in my custody; during the time he went, Mr. Sykes behaved very well; when Mr. Evans returned to take the beer away, during the time they were loading the dray, Mr. Sykes being then in my custody, withdrew into the back kitchen; at that time I did not know there was a door that leads into the yard from the back kitchen, I knew there was a window that came into the yard; Mr. Sykes went out of the door into the back kitchen, and got over the water-but and over the wall; I said nothing at the time, but rushed out of the door, and turned to the left up a stable-yard, and caught Mr. Sykes by the jacket; Mr. Sykes told me, when I laid hold of him, it was not his intention to escape, and desired that I would not hold him; I told him I was obliged to secure him, in order that he might not escape; I told him he was very much to blame, and we went into the kitchen again, nothing more passed; then I took him to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Sykes told you he did not mean to escape - did not the Magistrate take his word for his appearance? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was admitted to bail, and he came here and surrendered himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that at the request of Meux's house that he was admitted to bail? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>(The casks produced, and identified to be the property of Mr. Sellon by Mr. Evans.)</p>
               <p>WILLIAM-MARMADUKE SELLON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Sellon, have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Sykes any customer of your's? - A. No, he never was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner, Jackson, was a servant of your's - how long has he been so? - A. About ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no orders for beer without your knowledge? - A. Whatever directions are sent to my brewhouse cannot be sent to the customers till I have set my initials on the margin; they cannot send from my brewhouse till I have set my regular mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What beer is that? - A. It is small beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Publicans cannot have small beer in their cellars? - A. They are liable to an information if they have.</p>
               <p>- ROADS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you apprehend 
               <persName id="t18040411-65-person696">Jackson</persName>
             the same day? - A. Yes, I was sent for to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at the time? - A. He said that the man that had turned against him ought to have something said against him, because he was to have part.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the expression? - A. He ought to have suffered with him, or instead of him; he ought to have suffered, because he was to have part.</p>
               <p>Jackson's defence. That beer, your Lordship, was my property, I will prove it, which all dray-men have; it is the bottom of the casks that all draymen have.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever know instances of their taking beer home, the drains from different barrels from different customers, to the master's house, and then fill it into the master's barrels, and take it out and sell it; I will take it down in writing, if you will swear so? - A. No, not sell it, but they take it home; I always understood it was their perquisites.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not understand any such thing; you only come here to perjure yourself.</p>

               <p>Are you positive sure that you saw the basket at the time that you took in the box? - When I undid the rope, I am sure the basket was on the cart, I did not stay in the house above a minute or two at most; there were sheets and table-cloths in the basket, this is the basket; upon missing it I looked up and down Chancery-lane, I could not see a soul, I had not seen the prisoner before, I turned up Carey-street, there I saw the prisoner turn the corner to go down Bell-yard, I took him and brought him back, and asked him where he was going with that basket; he said he was going to carry it; I said then he should carry it back again; in about ten yards a man came up in a green coat, and asked what was the matter, I told him; he bid me not tear his shirt; I told him I would tear his flesh if he wanted to go away; this is the basket.</p>
               <p>Do you know that these things were in the basket? - Yes, because we opened the basket when the thief was taken, I saw it opened, and my mistress and me packed them up over night, they are all marked; it was as full as ever the basket would hold.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A person gave them me to carry, he promised me a shilling to carry them to the Adelphi in the Strand, and in two or three hundred yards I was stopped; the man was not six or seven yards before me, I told him to take that man that was before me.</p>
               <p>Court to Warner. How far from Carey-street is Mr. Vaughan's house? - Just opposite.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner running or walking? - He trotted along, there was nobody else in the street; after I took him, a man in a green coat came up, he seemed to come from Temple-bar way.</p>
               <p>Then supposing the man had gone on with the basket, this man would have met him? - Yes, that man came to my master's, and staid there a good bit, he pretended to assist, but I did not give him any encouragement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had the parcel given into my hands to carry; a person was with me, he is here, but I cannot rightly say his name.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

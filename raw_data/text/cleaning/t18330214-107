Previous to January the 20th we had sustained considerable losses, and in consequence of that, on the evening of the 1st of February, I was concealed in the warehouse, between five and six o'clock, behind the door at the end of the warehouse; the prisoner was in their employ in the hosiery warehouse - the door has two squares of glass in the top of it, and I had a view of where he was; we usually drink tea between five and six - I had scaroely got concealed before the prisoner came out of the hosiery warehouse below, up into the haberdashery warehouse, and seeing nobody there, he went up stairs to the top warehouse, came down again, and called Jem; nobody answered, and he directly went to where the black silk stocks were, which was about the middle of the warehouse - I could see him through the glazed part of the door; he took up one parcel of stocks and laid them down, then took up another, twisted them up in his hand, and put them into his hat; the first he took up appeared spotted, those he put into his hat were black - he immediately went down stairs into the hosiery warehouse - I left my concealment, and was going to follow him down, when he came back to me and had his hands in his pocket - he asked me if I had any snuff - I said No; he then asked me if there was any more goods coming down to be entered; I said, I believe a small parcel was coming down after tea; he went down stairs - I met Nicholson coming from his tea, and told him; he told my brother of it; I was sent up to tea, and left it to them to watch. The prisoner went up to his tea; I could not see how many black silk stocks there were; an officer was sent for, who took him - he had no business in the upper warehouse at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What do you call these stocks? A. Opera ties; the top warehouse is the store-warehouse for haberdashery - he had no business there, nor in the other warehouse; his business was on the ground floor, at his desk, where goods are called over to him by the entering-clerk - I met him coming up a second time as I was going down; he was not in the habit of inquiring if more goods were coming down - he frequently came into that warehouse while the young men were at tea, and sometimes he had business there; he has been in the employ three or four months - I have been there six; goods are brought down to the ground floor in baskets to be packed - we carry them down; the entering-clerk has sometimes come up and taken a thing down in his hand; Mr. Sawer is the entering-clerk - the prisoner is the clerk to write the invoices; another clerk books them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many are there in your employ? A. Between twenty and thirty - the prisoner had a particular seat in the warehouse, and had no business to leave it.</p>

            . I am the brother of James Wickens. It is my duty to mark the black stocks among other things- they were kept at the end of the counter in the warehouse on the first floor; the prisoner was employed on the ground floor, near the door - he had no business with the stocks in the upper warehouse; I know there ought to have been five dozen and a half of stocks in the place - I received information, counted them, and half a dozen were gone, and were found under his desk - they had no business there; they appeared to have been rolled up - I did not touch them, but fetched the officer; they were worth 9s. 6d. - half a piece of ribbon, measuring eighteen yards, was found with the stocks; that was kept in a drawer in the first floor warehouse - the prisoner could have no business with that; the sales were bought from our warehouse and entered by him; nobody could have any business to deposit these articles under his desk - the ribbon drawer was directly under where the stocks were; it could easily be taken, for we generally have the drawer open on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were these stocks kept? A. On the counter, tied in half dozens - the prisoner's only duty was to make invoices; another clerk entered the goods - we have about six clerks; he had no business to touch the goods - a person called a "giver in" calls over the goods while one enters them, and another writes the invoice at the same time - these goods were found under his desk; they were not covered, but were behind a box which he puts his feet upon - we had to move it before we saw them - I counted the stocks when my brother gave me information, and know six were missing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had the prisoner any thing to do with handling the goods? A. No, my brother was placed behind the door, in consequence of suspicion.</p>

            . I am a partner in the firm of Messrs. Rawson and others. The prisoner was in our service - his occupation was to make out invoices under the desk of the person who enters them; the entering counter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140056"></xptr>is directly opposite the desk - the giver in comes there, and calls the goods over - that is the regular system of business; the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with meddling with the articles of trade - we began to miss goods shortly after he came to our employ; I have seen the stocks - they are our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he has been up in your warehouse while in your employ? A. I have seen him there several times - he had no business there, but having no suspicion at that time I did not rebuke him; his duty could not lead him there - he might have gone to talk to the people there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you without hesitation where he lived? A. Yes; his wife was out, but on her return, she gave me every facility in searching, and said, she always told her husband not to bring things home, but he told her he had bought them as jobs; I never heard of his being in business for himself - I found other things there claimed by other people in whose employ he had been, and there was table-linen and other things in wear, in the same boxes; the lace was concealed at the bottom of a box of trinkets, and a paper carefully laid over it, so that it appeared the bottom of the box - you would not suspect any thing was under it.</p>

            , a pawnbroker, No. 34, High Holborn - the prisoner occasionally came to the shop. On the 22nd of October he pawned with me three pairs of black silk stockings for 10s., in the name of

            , No. 16, Brownlow-street; this is the duplicate I gave him - they appeared new stockings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common to pawn in a false name? A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERT WALLS STEPHENS. I am one of the firm of Edward Rawson and Co.; we had missed several things; I have looked at these stockings - they are the manufacture of Mr. Gibbon, whose son is a partner in our firm, and they have my hand-writing on the paper - I can swear to them; I have looked at the different articles, and believe them to belong to us - I could swear to the greater part of them, and some corresponding with our stock I believe to be ours - there are about ten gross of shirt-buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any doubt but the property must have been taken at different times? A. It must have been taken at several times - we had missed stockings, but not black ones; our stock is so large, and so many goods lay about the counter - Mr. Gibbon does not make entirely for us, but these are a particular description of stockings, which had been re-dyed, and were in three pair parcels; we should sell them with the mark on, but then there would be the entering mark in addition.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If you sold the whole parcel the paper would go with them? A. Yes; we never sold the prisoner any goods, and never had an idea of his dealing in such things, or I should not have employed him.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutors, as warehouseman. Among these articles I see a pair of worsted shoes, which have my mark, and are my masters' property - I never sold them to the prisoner; they are worth 3s. 10d.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD BEESTON. I am one of the firm - here is a table-cover among these articles, I believe to be our property; when it was produced I could not swear to it - we have articles of this description; the prisoner had 70l. a year and his board.</p>

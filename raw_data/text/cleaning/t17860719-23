               <p>On Monday the 26th of June, I lost a bag with money in it, there was eleven guineas in it as my wife told me; I am a <rs id="t17860719-23-viclabel110" type="occupation">painter</rs>

               <p>Did he see you give your wife the bag of money? - It was in his presence.</p>
               <p>Did you stay in the house while he went for the colours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after his first return with the colours was it before your wife went out? - A very short space of time; I continued in the front room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. You had a good opinion of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you stay all that time in the middle room? - Yes; I went out and was gone about half an hour or three quarters, the prisoner was in the middle room when I went out drying a brush by the fire, I heard of the loss as soon as I got home; I shut the drawer; it was not locked.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer; I had the prisoner in my custody some time, I searched him, and found a guinea in his mouth, he begged that Mr. Pugh would not prosecute him, and he would give him a draft for the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a runner to an office I understand? - I do not know what you mean, I very seldom run.</p>
               <p>That will not content me; I ask you upon the oath you have taken, whether you do not understand the meaning? - I do not go by terms of runner; I do not understand terms.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, do not you understand me? - What do you call a runner, I cannot answer you any such question, I tell you, Sir, I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Do you understand me, Sir, when I ask you if you are not a runner to some office? - I have heard them talking of runners and walkers.</p>
               <p>Do not you understand the meaning of a runner to an office? - Upon my word you ask me such a question that I cannot answer, you tell me and I will tell you.</p>
               <p>With that answer I am not contented; now I ask you what office do you belong to? - I attend Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>How long have you so attended? - For these six years.</p>
               <p>The last session when you was here what office did you say you belonged to then? - I attended Justice Walker's.</p>
               <p>How long have you attended Justice Walker's? - Bow-street and Justice Walker's I have attended six years, I am an officer belonging to a parish.</p>
               <p>That is a little different account you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190040"></xptr> know to your being an officer belonging to Bow-street: to what parish do you belong as an officer? - The parish of Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>What office did you attend at last? - I attend now at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You say you have attended at Bow-street six years? - At Bow-street and Justice Walker's six years.</p>
               <p>Have not you within the knowledge of the gentlemen within my eye given an account of yourself as attending at all the other offices except Bow-street? - There and at Bow-street for six years.</p>
               <p>Have you never from this place been committed to Newgate by this Court, though not prosecuted, for perjury? - No, Sir, nor never will.</p>
               <p>Can you say so, Sir? - I tell you no, nor never will be for perjury.</p>
               <p>Have you not been committed by this Court within these two sessions for some offence in the face of this Court? - No, Sir, never in my life.</p>
               <p>You stick to that? - Yes, Sir, I scorn any person to bring a bad matter upon me.</p>
               <p>Have you ever before this session given an account of yourself as an officer attending at Bow-street? - I attended from my first beginning at Bow-street six years, never at no other, only at Justice Walker's and Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You have never given an account of your attending at any other office? - Never, I never gave an account of attending Justice Blackborow's.</p>
               <p>Are you employed by Sir Sampson Wright? - I go there as a constable, no further than to serve a warrant, or any business that comes in my way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent over to this man yesterday knowing that he had money belonging to me, he came over to me, I said, Frank, it is a hard thing for a man to lay in gaol with only gaol allowance, give me a part of my property, give me a shilling; says he, if you say any more, if you do not slash the matter, says he, I will do you.</p>
               <p>Court to Umpage. Did you say so? - Says I, Bob, the guinea I must produce in Court that I took from you, you have had eight shillings, and I cannot give you any more.</p>

               <p>Court to Pugh. Was it in your presence that the prisoner offered to give him a note? - It was in my presence, voluntarily offered.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

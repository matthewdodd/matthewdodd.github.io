                  </hi>. I came from Cork by the Ocean. I came up the Thames, and got on shore at St. Katharine's Dock on Wednesday morning—the prisoner came with me—I never saw her before—she said she had three sisters and a mother in Whitechapel, and that she carried on the laundry business—I was coining here to look for a situation—she said that she would befriend me, and take me to her mother's place, and that she hired persons sometimes, having more work than she could do—I depended on her, and thought she would befriend me—I had a trunk—it contained a night-gown, a gown, caps, some calico, and the other things mentioned in the indictment—we went together to a public-house—I paid for her crossing in a small boat—I paid her passage, and she told me to put the trunk in a. public-house while we went to see for lodgings—she got away from me—I afterwards found my trunk was fetched from the public-house—cried and screamed, and did not know what to do till the policeman took me.</p>

            . I live at the corner of Strutton-ground, with Mr. Hulsey, a pawnbroker. On the 22d of September last, the prisoner came to our house, with this watch, (producing a Pinchbeck metal watch) and asked fifteen shillings on it. I was told there was another man came with him to the door, but I do not know who he was. I heard that man say, Don't take less than fifteen shillings upon it. I had read the hand-bill from Sir

I sent the boy in the shop for an officer. The prisoner said, You may keep the watch, but I shall go. He went away, and went down Strutton-ground, and I after him. He walked till he came to the bottom, where there was another man waiting for him. They looked back, and saw me, and immediately they ran towards Tothill-fields Bridewell. They found I got ground of them; then they parted. The prisoner asked me what I wanted with him; he then was walking on. I then went immediately to Mr. Wright, at Bridewell, and said, Here is the watch, and there is the man; pointing to the prisoner: Then he, I and another person went and took him upon the Green. He made some resistance. We took him into Bridewell. There we examined him. He was very resolute. We found this pistol loaded in his pocket ( producing a flat pocket pistol): He said, he bought the watch of a journeyman baker. He was examined afterwards before a magistrate, and confessed he had it of Lambden.</p>

            . I keep the Red-Lion alehouse, Christopher-yard, Southwark. I have known the prisoner three years. I never saw Lambden but twice in my life. He came to my house the 14th of last September, and asked if I could lodge him. About ten minutes after that, the prisoner came in. They drank together, and then they and two others went all up stairs and lay in one room, where were two beds. I do not know whether they were bedfellows or not; they both lay in one room. I saw Lambden and the prisoner together. Also on the 16th, Lambden had about a pound and a half of beef-steakes dressed in my house. The prisoner was in my house before he came in. Lambden asked him to eat with him; he did, they had a pot of beer and a glass of brandy. This was the very same Lambden that was tried at Chelmsford. I was also there upon the trial.</p>

I said, I had it of a young man to pawn, who was at the door, at that time. When the man said it was advertised, and shewed me the bill, I went out of the shop to the young man, to clear myself, but he was gone up the street. I followed him, and the pawnbroker came after me.

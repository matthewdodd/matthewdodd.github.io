He darted back, on seeing me, and then rushed on, as if going to pass me. He seized my chain, which broke - he got two seals and two keys, with the chain. He ran up Lamb's-passage, a young man got behind him and pursued him; being lame, I missed him. I am certain of his person - it was just under a gas-light. I informed the officer in about half an hour. I never saw the young man after, and suspect he was one of the gang. I saw the prisoner about three quarters of an hour after, among a famous gang of them, in Chequer-alley, in a coffee-shop. I knew him directly, and pointed him out from above ten others.</p>

            . I went to the coffee-shop with Wheeler, - I directed him there. He described the prisoner accurately, and I knew him from the description he gave me. He pointed him out the moment he went into the coffee-shop. While I was securing him, some of the party left the shop; and as I brought him down the steps, he struggled to get away, and, with the assistance of the gang, he got away. Several then rushed out of the shop. I secured him within twenty yards of the shop - some seized my arms, and others shook and beat me most horribly.</p>

               <p>Are there many many houses thereabouts? - Yes, it is a street, I pursued them about two hundred yards, and just as I got up there was a man said, they are taken into this house, I went in and the landlord pushed me out of doors, and said, nobody came in there; I then went to Mr. Green's, and desired they would send somebody out with me, but as I had not been robbed of any thing they would not, then I took a gentleman with me, and we saw the landlady, who said, she did not know us; and I stood in the tap room, the prisoner was there, and I went and laid hold of his collar, and said, this is the man that stopped me first, he stood by the fire side; I am sure that is the person that stopped me, because I caught him for half a minute; when I had hold of his collar, he said to me directly, it was not me that cut you, it was the other; a gentleman that was with me went for the constable, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

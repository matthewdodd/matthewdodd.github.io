On the 17th of September, Singleton came to Rood-lane, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, which was Friday; he said his name was Singleton, and brought this letter in his hand and gave it to my brother, but not in my presence; my brother handed it to me; I do not know the hand-writing - Singleton was present when my brother handed it to me, as having received it from him.(Letter Read.)</p>
               <p>The following is all that I know concerning the unpleasant business which has just taken place: - Mr. Latham called on me at the Tower, I think last Tuesday, and in the course of conversation, and in the presence of another young man, said he had thoughts of taking a trip over to France for a short time walking towards his home, he made a proposal to me, saying, that if I would come over with him for a few days, he would bear the expenses. I saw him again the next day, when he renewed the subject, and I agreed to go with him as far as Boulogne. Not having had leave from the Office, and as he said he had also not got leave, he said that it would be necessary, for fear of being found out, and thereby be disappointed in going, to do it as privately as possible. He requested me to leave a feigned name for him at the French Ambassador's - I gave my own name and address. I took no things with me, except a change of linen; for, as I intended to be such a short time away, I did not think it worth while to take more. I met him at eleven o'clock in the City, when he said, that as he had not taken any clothes with him, he would buy some things, which he did, and even made me take the loan of some. We got the passports about two o'clock, and left London for Dover in a postchaise, at seven: we got there about five o'clock; and when we got up in the morning at seven, he took out his pocket-book. Up to that time I had not the least suspicion, nor had not the least idea, that he had so much money with -. He then took from his pockets a quantity of sovereigns, and gave me between seventy and eighty to put into mine, saying they were too heavy to carry altogether. I then asked him how much he had altogether; when he told me nearly 600l. (I think it was he said) I was very much surprised. From what he said afterwards, I had no doubt remaining but that it was all his own. Previous to this, he had written a letter to his uncle, and, to my astonishment, he said that he had told him in it, that he did not intend coming back to England. I begged of him to come back to London directly, and give up the money he had taken, which he refused to do. He then pressed me to accompany him; and on my talking to him of the madness of doing so, he only flew into a rage. Directly after that, and seeing plainly that nothing I could say would induce him to give up his mad scheme, I kept him under pretence of going to see about the packet, and took the first conveyance to London. Not being able to get a place in the coach at that time, I came nearly all the way in a post-chaise, and have only just arrived. From any blame attached to me in this unfortunate business, I trust I shall be able to clear myself. I have got 71l. in sovereigns, ready to give up directly. I fear, as it is so late, that I shall not be able to see any of your Gentlemen this evening, nor do I know in what name to address this.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SINGLETON:</p>
               <p>To the Senior Clerk, 23, Rood Lane.</p>
               <p>Upon this I sent for an officer, who took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Latham is your apprentice, is he not? A. Yes, he has been with us nearly seven years - our general way of business was for him to make entries in the general cash-book of what he drew, and he kept a petty cash-book himself - it was the course of our business for him to make up his accounts every evening - he made entries in the book of what money he took, and settled every night; he enters the amount of cash he takes out, and the parties he pays it to - he has no business to take out more than he wants, his duty is to say what he wants before he takes it; it never happened to my knowledge that he had to return any cash - he has entered the 416l. 5s. 6d. only. Latham was my apprentice individually, and was clerk to the firm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When Singleton brought you the letter did he give up 71l.? A. Yes.</p>

I asked if that was all? he said, all, except what Singleton had got. I asked him who Singleton was? he said, a young man who came down with him, and he believed he was gone on board. I inquired for an officer, who took Latham in charge; we then went to the packet, but it was gone; I then went with Latham on board a vessel to go to Calais, but we could not make Calais, and we got to Boulogne, and travelled from there to Calais; we found these two portmanteaus at the Custom-house at Calais; Latham pointed them out; I brought them up to London with Latham; the money I received from him was 564l., and he said he thought 705l. was the whole he had taken, but he could not account for the rest.

            . I am waiter at the Hyde-park Hotel, Oxford-street. On the 15th of September the two prisoners came there in a hackney-coach, about a quarter before three o'clock - they had two portmanteaus and a few paper parcels - they asked for dinner, and a room to wash and dress in; the porter took the articles out of the coach; I took hold of their portmanteaus, and found they were empty; I told my master of it; our coffee-room is not a public room, we have only some gentlemen who dine in it, and the lodgers; they washed and dressed, and then dined in the coffee-room about four o'clock; immediately after dinner Singleton went away in a hackney-coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to Charing-cross - he returned in about an hour and ordered the bill, which I took him, and he paid it with a 10l. note, which he took from a roll of notes which he had in his pocket - I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five notes - I took the same note to my master, and he gave me change; I gave the change to Singleton; I think the amount of their bill was 1l. 15s., and they told me to deduct the amount of postage to Dartford, which was 1l. 7s.; they left in a post-chaise, at a quarter before seven o'clock, to go to Dartford.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did they sit in the coffee-room the whole time? A. No; they went to a room to dress before I saw Singleton take out the roll of notes - Latham asked if I could speak French - I said I could not - I did not see Latham hand any notes to Singleton, nor did I see Singleton hand any to him - he put them into his left-hand trousers pocket - I did not count the notes he had in his hand, but I think there were from fifteen to twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Can you undertake to say that there were several notes in the roll? A. Yes; my attention was so directed to them that I can speak to the circumstance positively.</p>

            . I am in the Ordinance-office in the Tower. Singleton lodged with me, and left my house on a Wednesday, in September - I did not see him again till I saw him in confinement, which was four or five days afterwards - I had no knowledge of his going away - I do not know whether he took his clothes, as they were in his room. I know Latham by sight, but I do not know that I ever saw him with Singleton; my son was unfortunately acquainted with Latham - I have seen him in the Tower, parading about, and he has come to my house to see my son, but mostly staid at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time you saw Latham lately, has he been in deep mourning? A. Yes. I believe Singleton left his property at my house; I never looked at his wardrobe; but I believe he was well equipped as a gentleman - he was as respectable and correct a young man as I ever knew - he lived with me six or seven months, and I loved him next to my own child - he is in the Ordinance-office, in the same situation which I first held, and now I am second clerk there - he had no temptation from poverty to have committed a bad action - his salary is 90l. per annum.</p>

               <p>SINGLETON'S Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen. I will not attempt to assert that I have not acted very indiscreetly and incautiously, but of the crime I am accused of I am perfectly innocent, and, when you hear the evidence my counsel will bring, I feel confident you will be of the same opinion - this young man had asked several other persons to go with him before he asked me, and, when he asked me, I unfortunately agreed to go with him, but I had particular motives for going, as that part of my family, to which I am most naturally attached, live at Boulogne - the prisoner had given out that he was to receive a legacy at the death of a relation, and, a short time after, he appeared in black, and I supposed his relation was dead, and yielding to his solicitations, I accepted his invitation to go to France, free of expense - he stated that he was going away without the leave of his uncle, and he would not wish me to go back to the Tower - so he was to purchase some clothes for me, as he said, I could give him the money when I returned from France; I got a passport for him in a fictious name, as he wished me; but for myself, in my own name, which I should not have done, if I had known how he got the money; I did not hear a word of that till I got to Dover, and when I did, I resolved on returning immediately - for this purpose I came by the van to Canterbury, leaving every thing behind me - from thence I took a post-chaise, and arrived in London on Saturday evening, too late to go to Latham's employers; but I forgot to mention that on my arrival at Dover, I wrote a letter to my uncle, excusing myself for leaving my office without leave, and saying, I was going to Boulogne, and should return in three days: the moment I got to London I wrote to a young friend, requesting to know the name and address of Latham's employers; he came to me on the Sunday morning, at the coffee-house, where I was, gave me their names, and walked with me to their residence; I wrote to them the letter which has been produced, but I wrote in great agitation, and very hastily - I fear there may be some errors and omissions, and it may not be so explicit as I could have wished; I returned and wished Mr. Warner to hear what I had to say, intending to give a full explanation, but he would not hear what I had to offer; I met his brother, and a friend, who behaved in the most gentlemanly manner, but Mr. Warner ordered his warehouseman and another person to stand between me and the door to prevent my going, and sent for an officer, had me taken into custody, and ordered the officer not to allow me to have communication with any person, and that injunction was so strictly carried into effect, that a letter which I wrote to my father, was returned to me unopened - how far Mr. Warner can reconcile this unfeeling and unjust treatment to a person like myself placed in this situation, and denied the means of defence, I do not know, but I am innocent of the charge, and have been anxious from the first, to stand forward and clear myself.</p>

I am father of the prisoner; I recollect his writing to me from Dover, to state that he was going to Boulogne, and he should be back in three days; he has an office under government, and if he were in any want of money I always supplied him - when he returned to London, I saw him the same day.</p>

            . I recollect Singleton wrote to me to procure him the prosecutors' address - I went and accompanied him part of the way to Mr. Warner's; he told me he had a part of the money about him, which he was gogoing to restore - this was on Sunday, the 17th of September, about twelve o'clock - I have frequently seen Latham at our house, and have heard him talk of what he expected, in the presence of Singleton - I have heard him say he had an uncle.</p>
               <p>JURY to BENJAMIN HOE. Q. At what time was Latham apprehended on the pier? A. About nine o'clock in the morning - I did not make any application at any office at Dover, or raise any hue and cry that Siugleton might have heard.</p>
               <p>COURT to H. BIGNOL. Q. When did Singleton return to town? A. On Saturday night, as he told me; I saw him on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Latham a good character, and five deposed the same on behalf of Singleton.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired at a quarter before five o'clock in the after noon - after sending several messages to the Court, (who sat all night to receive their verdict,) stating that they could not agree in averd ict respecting Singleton; - at half-past ten o'clock next morning they were sent for by the Court; they stated that eleven were determined upon a verdiet of Not Guilty as to Singleton, but that the whole twelve could not and were not at all likely to agree.</p>
               <p>JURY. We find LATHAM - <rs id="t18261026-255-verdict1400" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>But upon Singleton's case we are not agreed.</p>

               The Jury having been twenty-four hours in attendance, and near twenty-two hours charged with this case, the Court feel they may exercise that discretion which in extreme cases is vested in them: we have the power to summon a new Jury, and this is now discharged
            </rs>.</p>

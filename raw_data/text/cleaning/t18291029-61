The prisoner came to the yard, on Monday, the 5th of October, and asked for the owner of the yard; I asked what he wanted - he said he had a door to sell, and it was at the gate; I looked at it - it was on a truck; he wanted 15s., for it - master was not at home, and told him to come another time; he came twice, and was detained.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . Pocock called me to the prisoner on Tuesday, the 6th, when he came for the money for the door, which was in my yard - I detained him, and asked where he got it; he said it was his own - I sent for an officer; he then walked out of the place, and said he would show me his master, who it belonged to - I followed him, and in King-square he made a blow at me, knocked me down, and ran round the square; I followed, and took him in a minute, and am certain of his person.</p>

            . I live in King's Head-yard, Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On Monday, the 5th of October, the prisoner borrowed a truck of me, and brought it back again - I did not know him before; he gave me a reference.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, who said he had a door and a bedstead against the wall: he employed me to get a truck, and carry them to Old-street - when we got there, he said, "Take this door, and sell it at a broker's, and meet me here by the turnpike," and said, "Get 15s. for it, if not take what you can get;" I went to the yard - this man offered me 7s., and gave me 2s. - I was to call tomorrow for the rest, as his master was out; I went for it in the morning - he said his master was out, and the man said I was making a fool of him.</p>

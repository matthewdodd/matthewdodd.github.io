            . I am watch-house-keeper - the prisoner was charged by her master with an assault on Saturday, the 1st of March, and on the next day a person came and represented himself as her brother - he spoke to her, and she gave him these duplicates - I would not allow him to bring them away but took them from him and the prisoner was taken before the Magistrate.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had pledged the property by the prosecutor's desire, in order to procure articles for the house; that she could not get her wages, and the prosecutor beat her unmercifully on her asking for them.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDERSON. She got drunk on the Saturday night. I had two ladies at my house, she quarrelled with them and struck them - I said, if she did not be quiet I should give charge of her. I then examined the house and missed the property; she had no authority to pawn any of the things; I did not owe her a farthing for wages - she was paid beforehand; I have reason to believe her father pawned some of them.</p>

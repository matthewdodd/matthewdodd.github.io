             sworn. I am an officer On the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was walking down the Minories, and while the carman was unloading at the shop out of the waggon, the prisoner at the bar took this basket of Malaga raisins out of the waggon, I let him go with it about forty yards; as he was going down a turning I stopped him, we had a struggle together, and he threw it away; I asked him how he came by it, he told me he found it; I gave him into the custody of another person, and I went and took care of the fruit; I saw the waggoner, I said this is what you are looking for, come along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take it out of the waggon. - A. Yes, he was taken to the watchhouse; I produce the basket of raisins. (The property identified by Wilson.)</p>

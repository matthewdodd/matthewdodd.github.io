               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received did you cause him to be taken into custody - A. We did, on the 28th of June. I was present when his boxes were searched in our house, he was an in door servant. In his boxes there were found two pair of trowsers, two pair of drawers, and three waistcoats; in a cupboard not locked by his bedside, in a hat box, were found thirty shillings in penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your house keep any quantity of penny pieces for the purpose of paying your work people - A. On account of the scarcity of specie, we have lately paid them in copper; we have from ten to thirty pound at all times in the house in a box, that box was locked and deposited in a warehouse, that he and the other servants had access to; that warehouse was in the lower part of our premises, where we generally take in the work; and I can verily say that the prisoner was not paid in copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was there no other servant lodged in this room in which this property was found - A. Yes, his name is Spooner.</p>

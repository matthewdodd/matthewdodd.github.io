He took hold of one of her, hands and I the other, we led her to the watch-house, he searched her but found nothing on her. I was asked if another woman had not passed or been with her, I said there was, the watchman desired me to wait a bit, he would go in search, he expected she would be waiting about the door. The watchman went out, he shortly after returned with the prisoner Barnes, who immediately recognised to be the same person that was in company with the prisoner Steadman, the watchman searched her, found two guineas and a one pound note which she had dropped, I told the watchman I had lost nine pounds in bank notes and five guineas, the watchman went and searched the place where he had taken this woman and brought back a purse with eight pound and three guineas in it which I knew to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Barnes is the woman who was in company with Steadman. - A. I am positive. It must be Steadman that took it out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find her - A. At the corner of St. Paul's Church Yard, of the Tobits side, I took hold of her she said I had no business with her, I got her to the watch-house passage, there she made a stop, I called out to my partner, he came, and then she came easy. We searched her, there were two guineas and a one pound note dropped from her person, I took a candle and lanthorn and went over the ground where I had taken her, when I came to the corner of the passage where the struggle was, I there found this purse containing eight pounds in notes and three guineas. The gentleman wanted the purse and the money, I said no, you must not think of that before we go before the Alderman, the money that I found in it the Alderman gave to the gentleman, and gave me the purse. This is the purse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am positive it is my purse, I lost nine bank notes and five guineas, the whole that was found made it the complete sum.</p>

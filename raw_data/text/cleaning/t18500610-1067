On 12th May, about a quarter or half-past five o'clock in the morning, I missed a clock from the foundry wall, which was locked up, and some leaden patterns, which I had seen safe the previous evening, about half-past eight, in a cupboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Agar town, about 150 yards from Mr. Wood. On 12th May, about a quarter or twenty minutes past five o'clock, I was passing his foundry, saw the door open, and Slaney inside—Matthews was outside, and he asked me to give him a light, as I was smoking a pipe—I gave him one and walked on—he called me back, and asked for another—I gave him another, walked on about a hundred yards, looked back, and saw Matthews watching me—I saw Matthews give Slaney a bag while he was inside—I gave information to the police, I afterwards went to Cambridge-crescent, and found Matthews behind a cottage and Slaney in a water-closet—Matthews was taken.</p>

               <p>Where had you been? - In Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-Fields; I was going home.</p>
               <p>How came you to lose your way? - Because I am not used to be out at night; I was going home; nobody was with me.</p>
               <p>Had you a bundle of things with you? - No, they were the clothes I had on.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon losing your way? - I was coming down Long Acre, and I lost my way into Crown-street, Hog-lane; I asked the prisoner at the bar; I never saw her before; she told me, if I would go along with her she would shew me; but instead of shewing me the way home, she took me into Parker's-lane, to Mr. Robinson's, an ironmonger's shop; when I got to the door, she asked me to go up stairs, which I refused several times; she asked me to drink with her; I had no objection; with much persuasion I did go up stairs.</p>
               <p>How did she persuade you? - She said, if I would go up stairs with her while she poked down her fire, she would see me home; when she got up stairs, she asked me to treat her; I put my hand in my pocket, and gave her a shilling to get some beer; she was gone about an hour, and returned again, and said it was too late, and she could not get any beer; there was another girl with her at the same time, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180063"></xptr>kept me in talk, and staid with me; she asked me if I would have any gin to drink; I told her I was not fond of spirits, and she went and got some raspberry, and they made me drink a tea-cup full; the prisoner came in again, and took a bottle, and was gone three quarters of an hour, and made me drink a tea-cup full, or else they would throw it over me; I drank it; I was afraid of having my white gown stained; they made as if it was red port, so I drank it up; then they made me go to bed; one of them undressed me, while the o the put her back against the door, and said I should not go out.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you drank the teacup full? - About half an hour; it was getting very late.</p>
               <p>Did this raspberry affect you? - Yes, I suppose it did, or I should not have done such a thing; it was about half an hour after two; I was not so bad but I had my understanding about me; I laid there about ten minutes; I dropt asleep, and I was awaked by the prisoner moving my head, and taking my pockets from under my head; the prisoner and the girl made a sham to undress themselves, when they undressed me; I suppose I fell asleep directly upon getting into bed; it could not be above ten minutes before I was waked; I folded up my gown in my handkerchief, and pinned it in another, on a chair at the bed-side; my petticoats were loose, my pockets were under my head; then I was awaked by their taking my pockets; I looked round, though I pretended to be asleep, and I saw the prisoner and the other woman, with my pockets and the other things; the prisoner had my gown and apron, the other took the other things, and blew out the candle, and poked out the fire; I did not speak to them while they continued in the room, I was afraid, as it was a strange place; as soon as they were gone, I got up to look for my pockets; I found nothing but my hat and shoes, and shift that I had on; I went down in my shift, and a man came up; I called Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him before? - No, Sir, I did not know his name then; I went down stairs, and knocked at the door; he came up, and desired me to make myself contented, he should find the person out; on Monday night Mr. Freeman took her; I stopped till about half after six in the morning; Mr. Robinson went and got me some things, and Mr. Freeman went to a relation's of mine, and got me some clothes.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was this? - It was on Sunday night, the 4th of March.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - Not till Tuesday morning, before Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>Now, my girl, be positively sure the prisoner is the person. - I am sure of it; I never saw her before; there was a candle in the room till I went to bed; I am positive to the woman; as soon as I saw her, I knew her.</p>
               <p>Have you got the things here? - The pawn-broker has got them.</p>
               <p>Who do you live with? - I live by myself.</p>
               <p>Who do you lodge with? - Mr. Burgess.</p>
               <p>How do you get your livelihood? - I work, and earn nine shillings a week, making ladies hoops and hips.</p>
               <p>Who had you been with that night? - With a young woman that was going down to Bath.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking any thing before? - Nothing but some beer to my supper.</p>

               <p>Did the prosecutrix describe her to you? - Yes, she said she should know her from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180064"></xptr>a hundred, she was so particularly marked in the face, and I knew the prisoner living in that house, I went to the prosecutrix's friends, where she directed me, and fetched her sister to her, to bring her some clothes, and take her away; after that, I took a description of the clothes she had lost; as soon as the pawn-brokers opened, I went round, and searched many of them; at one pawn-broker's I found a gown and cloak, and an apron; some of the things are not found yet.</p>

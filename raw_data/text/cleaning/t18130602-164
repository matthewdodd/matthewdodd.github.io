On the 26th of May, about half past eleven at night; I met the prisoner she was in company of two other young women; I was passing by when the prisoner ran up to me; she left her companions; she walked with me an hundred yards to where there is a passage that leads into <placeName id="t18130602-164-crimeloc889">Dover-yard</placeName>

I only went with her to the end of the passage, and stopped there with her three minutes, not exceeding that; at the expiration of the three minutes she ran curiously away from me, up this passage, into Dover-yard. I had a watch with me in my fob. My purse was in my left pantaloons pocket; in it was a ten-pound note, a five-pound. and two ones, and a silver coin that I brought with me from Spain. On her running away from me I observed by the light of the lamps the seals hanging below her hand, not knowing that she had taken my purse. I immediately ran after her, and lost sight of her in a moment. I did not see any thing more of her that night. I then went to the spot where I met her, and saw her companions. In consequence of what I heard from them I did not proceed any further that night. On the morning of the 27th I went to my late employer; he gave me the number of the ten-pound note. On the 28th I went to the Bank to stop the note; and on the 28th, in the evening, I found the prisoner in the Three Compasses public-house. She was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you perceived your purse was gone - A. When I lost her. The ten pound note has been traced.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only from Mr. Brett's account that you can prove the number of the note, is it - A. There is nobody here that can prove that was the number.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of your watch - A. Twelve pounds. It is a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. One hand could not take the watch and purse at one time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her hand about your person - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a ten-pound note correspond with the number that Mr. Brett gave you - A. Yes, at the Bank.</p>

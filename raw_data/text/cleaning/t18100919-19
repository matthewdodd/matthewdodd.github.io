            . Escombe lodges with me. On Monday morning he came home near one o'clock; he told me he had been robbed, and described the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the person that robbed him of his watch - A. I did; we found the prisoner on the 31st of July, between nine and ten at night, she and another was walking before us; he said, here she is; she went into a public house, and we followed the moment she turned round from the fire-place and saw him, she was very much confuse, and whispered to the other girl.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she confused - A. She looked very pale, and was quite struck, and whispered to the other girl. I asked her whether she knew that young man; when I came into the passage with her, the landlord came out and touched her on the arm, and while I was talking to her about this young man, she ran away and spanked the doors after her; I pursued her into Short's gardens, I there saw her go into a house; the watchman sprang his rattle; we went and searched the house, and on the first landing-place on the stairs I apprehended her. I then said to her, why, if you are innocent, did you run away. She said, she would not come down; I pulled her away, and took her to the watch-house, and searched her the next morning; I found nothing but two letters.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

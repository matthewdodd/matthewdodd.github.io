I said, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the prisoner was the person who gave me the order; it being rather dark at the time, by his general appearance, I conceive him to be the man - I took notice of his voice, which is one reason why I speak to him; he has a peculiar accent.</p>
               <p>MR. ARCHDALE. Q. What did you do in consequence of that letter? A. I selected the goods, except one piece, tied up part of them, and took them over to H. and G. Woods, Red Lion-court, and left them with Sutherland; this is the parcel, (looking at it) - it is directed "

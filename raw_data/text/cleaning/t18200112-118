Owing to the improvements going on there, he had moved into another house; we were in the habit of resorting there for water. On the 19th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I went there and observed nothing; I went again about ten o'clock, and observed half the skylight broken away. I got outside the cistern to see what had been done, and found the leaden pipe, which led from the cistern to the water-closet, torn away, and the gutter adjoining also taken away. I found the pipe in the gutter and other sheet lead which covered the framing of the skylight on a shed adjoining the house. I went and informed my father, and we returned with Hurst; I shewed them the lead, and remained there while they went up stairs; in a moment or two they called me, I ran up, and found the prisoner in their custody - the lead appeared to be fresh cut.</p>

            . I am messenger to the Office of Woods and Forests, and live in Scotland-yard. On Sunday, the 19th of December, my son fetched me and Hurst to the house, where we found the lead as he has stated - it was quite fresh cut; I had seen it safe the Wednesday before. I went up stairs into the first room where the butler's pantry was, and pushed the door; it was twice pushed against me, but I made a third attempt, pushed it open, and found the prisoner there with a chisel in his hand. He attempted to get out of the window, but I collared him - he said nothing; the sink was half prized up - it was quite fresh done. I matched the lead, and it fitted.</p>

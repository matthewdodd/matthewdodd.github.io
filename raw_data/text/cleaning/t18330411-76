I let a lodging to Johnson under the name of Bolton; he took three rooms on the second floor, ready furnished - he took it for himself and another person, but I do not recollect the other; he came on the 19th of December and left on the 26th - I saw a person go up stairs with him the day before Christmas day, but did not notice him; I heard something from my servant, then went up to their rooms, and missed the articles stated from the lodgings - I did not see Johnson again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Johnson. I took the lodging for my cousin; he absconded and I left out of fear.</p>
               <p>ELLEN MORIARTY. I was in the prosecutor's service on the 19th of December; I recollect Johnson coming there, and the same evening Miller and another came with Johnson - they went out presently after; I have not seen the other since - Miller came again the third night, and remained there; I saw him three times in the room - I waited on them with the tea; Johnson went out on the 26th, and called to me to get his breakfast ready - he did not return till half-past ten; I then took up his breakfast - he said, "I cannot have my bed made to-day, in consequence of my cousin's illness," (he called Miller his cousin,) but I did not see him there at that time; I went down and told my mistress of it - when we thought it time for them to ring for tea, we went up; they were gone, and we missed these articles - we saw no more of the prisoners till they were taken; I had seen Miller there the night before as late as nine o'clock - I do not know whether he went out after that or not; I think he slept three times in the house - I saw him two nights and one morning; I was going down St. James'-street afterwards - I saw the prisoners and Spaul, and had them taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long was Johnson there? A.Seven days; three persons came on the first night - I should not know the third person, I only got a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110040"></xptr>glance of him; he was tall - Johnson said he took the room for himself and his cousin; the two prisoners are the only persons who slept there.</p>

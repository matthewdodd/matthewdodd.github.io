On the 14th of July, about three o'clock, I was employed by Mr. Gibson to fetch a bale of silk from Mr. Brandon's in Leadenhall-street. I brought it as far as Bread-street, and between <placeName id="t18200918-7-crimeloc33">Bread-street</placeName>

I threw my bale down, and he immediately ran away, leaving the silk on the cill of a door. I called out stop thief, he ran about twenty yards, and was taken; I went up, and knew him to be the same man. The parcel was a sample of the bale.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Black, in Bread-street. I saw the prisoner come suddenly up to our door, with his face against the glass, as if he was hiding from some one; he folded his arms, and then he put his hand to his pocket, and almost at the same instant he started from the door; I heard a cry of stop thief, opened the door, and ran after him. He was stopped by Taylor. I found the parcel of silk and the bale near our door.</p>

            . I was standing at the gate in Bread-street, where I live, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running violently, and crying stop thief most lustily, I caught hold of him, suspecting he was the thief; he said I was mistaken, for the man who stole the parcel had ran into Cheapside. I held him till Grant came, he immediately said he was the man, and he could swear to him. Grant desired me to take care of a knife which he had in his pocket. I fetched the officer, and while the officer was searching him I saw him pull his hand from his breeches pocket - I seized it, and took the knife from his hand.</p>

            . I live in Mitchell-street, just behind St. Luke's church, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 7th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I was crossing Goswell-street, and saw the female prisoner with a large bundle; I went into the Hat and Feathers about twenty yards distance, and saw the male prisoner come in company with her into the house - they had something to drink and went out - they separated; I watched the woman to Hatton-garden, and gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you one of the Police? A. No, but I thought proper to watch her.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the female prisoner, and have had the bundle ever since; I asked what she had got - she said blankets, and she was going to take them to the Borough; I said I thought it was unreasonable to take a bundle at that time - she said she lived at Euston-terrace; I did not like her manner, and took her to the watch-house - I went to the place she mentioned and no such person was known there; she afterwards said where she got them from.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was the male prisoner discharged? A. Yes, on the 12th; I took him again yesterday week - he went to a public-house with his brother, who gave his word that he would not let him go.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Goswell-street. The male prisoner lived with me as <rs id="t18300114-231-deflabel1231" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a person here named Duffield? A. No; I succeeded him in the business; he was in the habit of dealing with me - the prisoner might enter any thing he purchased - there has been an entry in my book in the name of Duffield, but it has been scratched out by Mr. Duffield, because he did not order the goods; he lives about four hundred yards from me - the male prisoner left my shop about two o'clock in the afternoon on the 7th of December, and I did not see him again till he was in custody; he was not discharged by me, but he was let out of custody on the 12th of December, and was taken again last Monday at his brother's in the City, because I had fresh evidence from a person named Crute, a green-grocer - I knew Crute, but he told me nothing of this till Monday week: my book is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Are you able to say whether the male prisoner was at your house on the morning of the 7th of December? A. Yes, about seven o'clock in the morning - I saw Duffield scratch out the entry, which had been made by

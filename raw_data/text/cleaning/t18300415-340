On the 7th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I was in the street with a tin box in my side-pocket, containing two sovereigns and 9s. - as I crossed the street from a coach, there was a crowd, and before I could get in among the crowd, I felt a hand at my pocket and missed my box; it was picked up with nothing in it but a ticket - I took the prisoner's hand out of my pocket; he ran off - I followed him, and he was taken without getting out of my sight; I did not see him throw the box down.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of April, I saw the prisoner running very hard and looking very agitated - the prosecutor was behind him calling Stop thief! I said, "What have you lost?" he said a tin box - I called out, Stop him! and a man stopped him: two more ran away down Old Gravel-lane, behind Houndsditch, and the box was found thrown over a yard in that direction.(Box produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>, of Hamburgh, and lodge in Bluegate-fields, Shad well. On a Sunday night, at the end of Septem<lb></lb>ber, I was going home about eleven o'clock, and as I came down from the Angel public-house I saw four men coming towards me on the other side of the street—I never saw them before—the prisoners were two of them—Marphy said, "Give us a bit of tobacco"—I said I had none—Nelson came up, pulled my right arm, and struck me in the face directly against my mouth—it knocked my tooth out, and made it bleed—Murphy put his leg between mine, and tripped me up on my back directly—when I was down Nelson put his hand to my throat, and kept me down—they held me down for a quarter of an hour, and Murphy took my shoes off my feet, and my hat oft my head—I was hurt in my mouth, and they squeezed my throat, and made it sore—I lost a jacket, with a half-sovereign in the left pocket—they went away down Gravel-lane—I got up and went after them—I saw the officer was coming, and he asked me what was the matter—I had called out for help—I and the officer went on together—he caught both of the prisoners together—Murphy had my shoes under his jacket, and my hat on his head—as soon as the officer took him he dropped my shoes—I picked them up, and he shook my hat off his head—the jacket was brought to my landlady by a woman next day—the money was not in it then—I had seen the money in the pocket at the Angel public-house, where I had taken a glass of gin just before.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock, on the night in question, I was going down Ratcliffe-highway, and saw the two prisoners, with two others, run out of Palmer's Folly, in a direction from Bluegate-fields—they ran towards Old Gravel-lane—the prosecutor followed them in about two minutes, without hat, jacket, or shoes, bleeding at the mouth—in consequence of what he told me, I pur<lb></lb>sued and overtook the two prisoners and the other two together, in Old Gravel-lane—just as I got up I saw Murphy drop a pair of shoes from under his jacket—I laid hold of him—he shook his head, and the bat fell off—I told Russell to take it up and take care of it—I also seized a man named Leary, who was one of the four—I took Leary and Murphy to the station-house, and Nelson followed close behind—I lodged the two prisoners at the station-house, then came out and apprehended Nelson—the fourth made his escape—Russell said Nelson was the one who ill-treated him di<lb></lb>rectly I took him—he denied it—Russell was sober.</p>

On the 10th of March, at eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming out in company with Wheeler, at the great gate - the prisoner went towards Charing-cross - he had this handkerchief under his left arm, with something which appeared more weighty than victuals; I followed, passed him, and returned; and by a sudden gust of wind, I saw the top of a leaden weight out of his pocket - he turned up the Haymarket; Wheeler left him at the top of Panton-street - I followed the prisoner to the house of Mrs. Wellington, a dealer in marine-stores, in Crown-street, Soho - I stopped at the door, heard a rattling at the seales, went in, collared him and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "What is that to you;" he took this leaden weight from his pocket, and made a desperate blow at me with it - I caught it, or it must have killed me; he made a desperate struggle, and threw me down against a chair; I got up, and threw him down; he took up an iron sash-weight, and struck me with that; I got the poker, and secured him - I saw him throw some other pieces of lead out of his pocket; I took him to the office - I got Elizabeth Grant to collect the lead; it was brought to the watch-house; I went to Carlton House, and compared the lead with some on the premises - this piece of pipe matches a piece which was fixed to Carlton House; here are several pieces; what he said at the office was written down.</p>

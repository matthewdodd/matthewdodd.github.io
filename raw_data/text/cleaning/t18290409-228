On the 26th of March I was cleaning the window, and saw the two prisoners in company; Gray laid hold of a cord which secured this gun - I told the young man in the shop I thought they were going to steal it, and immediately I saw Thomas pass with the gun in his possession - I pursued, and caught Gray in the road; he slipped from me, and ran up a court- he was stopped there by two or three persons, but got away from them; I tried to stop him as he returned, but he struck at me - I stooped, and he struck his hand through a square of glass; he ran into Holborn, and was taken.</p>

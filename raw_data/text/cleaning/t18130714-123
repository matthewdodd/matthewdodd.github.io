            . I am a seaman. When I went out of the London Docks I left the prisoner on board the ship; in two hours afterwards I saw that he had plenty of money; he had not a copper for three or four weeks before; he had the waistcoat, and trowsers on, and Falkland's watch in his pocket.</p>
               <p>- JACKSON. I am an officer. On Sunday evening, the 4th of June, the prisoner was given into my custody by Burton, and another seaman; I searched his bundle; I found this waistcoat on him, and this waistcoat was in the bundle; the watch and the trowsers were handed over to me by another seaman, who is not present; the pocket-book was in the bundle, and the trowsers. I found out where he paid away three pound out of the notes.</p>

When we came down, we found the Man stamping and making a Noise for his Watch; and before we were admitted, the Man cry'd out Murder: We made them open the Door, and he charged 4 Women with robbing him (Anthill was not then in the House:) We carry'd them to the Compter, and the next Morning before Sir

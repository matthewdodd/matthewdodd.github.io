               <p>Prisoner. He says he saw me take it. I saw a person come from the shop and drop it - I picked it up; he said,"What have you there?" I said a handkerchief; he said,"What shop have you been robbing?" I said None - he took me to two or three shops, and asked if they had lost the property. Witness. A gentleman stood at his door, next door but one to Mr. Middleton, and as I went by I asked him if he had lost any thing, as I had seen him go to several shops; the other two had separated from him, when I disturbed them from another shop.</p>

He went out the next morning with my leave, soon after breakfast; returned to dine at one o'clock, and went out about two, having leave to be out two or three hours; but I always told him to be home to his meals - he returned at half-past nine - I asked him where he had been; he said he had been to see a friend; I wanted to know where that friend lived - he hesitated, but in the morning he told me he had been to No. 3, Temple-street, but gave me no name. I went round to several pawnbrokers, but found nothing - I called at Temple-street about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw

The prisoner came to my house on Saturday night, and brought a box - he opened it to put his purse into it; I looked into it, and saw that there was clothes in it; a little boy assisted him to bring it about eleven o'clock at night. He called on Sunday afternoon, but said nothing about it; I had known him for about a month, and have known his brother for years; he said his master was so strict that he could not mend anything for his brother; and asked if he might bring his box, that he might come and mend them early of a morning. The officer searched the same box.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. I heard some people on this building, and I stopped a little while, and I heard them say now. I drew my cutlass, and took two of them into custody. The lead was on the ground, in the passage, and the two men were close by the lead. I called to my partners, but they did not hear me; and the two men refused to stay, and the prisoner came up at me with a stick in his hand. I said, you rascal keep away, or I will do for you, for I know you well. He then began to strike, and I was obliged to let the man go, and him too. They all ran away. I took the lead to the watch-house. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, knowing him: we knocked at his landlord's door, and I heard somebody frisk down. I took the prisoner before four o'clock; when I laid hold of the other two men, one or two others rushed away, when I heard somebody say now, I heard a great noise, and I suppose the lead fell.</p>

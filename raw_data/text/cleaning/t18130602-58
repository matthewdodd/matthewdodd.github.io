When I went into the back drawing-room I found the window nearest the Bow window open; the Venetian blinds were half down, and the sash quite up. There is some leads underneath that window; I there saw one of these ink stands and a gold cup tied up in a pocket handkerchief. I afterwards examined that room; I saw the drawers open, and the papers about the floor. I went into the adjoining-room; the cabinet was open, and all the boxes.</p>

            . I am porter to the Marchioness. On Tuesday morning I was called by the last witness; I went first into the anti-chamber, and then into the front drawing-room. Nothing was broken open in the front drawing-room. This was a little after seven o'clock. I then went into the back drawing-room; I found the cabinet broken open, the table drawer, and some boxes that were in the room were broken open. There were papers about the room. There were things gone out of the cabinet and drawer.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Marchioness. Was it in this cabinet and drawer that you kept your valuable things - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. 
               <persName id="t18130602-58-person477">Pooley, Q.</persName>
             to Brian. Did you look out of the window of the back drawing-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It adjoins the bow - A. Yes. There are leads under that window, the back drawing-room. That window was open. On the leads was a bundle tied up. I went down to it; there I found a bundle containing two ink stands, and on the top of the bundle some small ornaments of silver. I found a gold cup quite in the corner of the leads, under the window. It was pressed quite flat to make it portable.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020028"></xptr>Q. The ink-stands and cup you found there were the Marchioness's, I suppose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the persons got in the window - A. Apparently by what I saw by a frame tied to the rails, and a lamp-lighter's ladder; the frame was used, and the ladder; the ladder upon the frame. That frame had been there perhaps for years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards procure the ladder which the lamp-lighter used to use - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ladder long enough to have got in the window without the frame - A. No; so it appeared by the tying of the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the frame that morning was it tied - A. It was tied to the rails in three place.</p>
               <p>COURT. What rails - A. At the back part of the house. That old window frame had been brought from the lumber-room, and fastened there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you see where the ladder was found the next morning - A. No; I did not see the ladder found. On my going up the area steps on the landing-place the lamp-lighter came; he asked me if there had been anything the matter. I said, yes. He said, because I found my ladder there this morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room how was the door between that and the stair-case - A. That door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the back drawing-room door fastened - A. I cannot tell. I did not go there last at night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hazard. How was the back drawing-room door at night - A. It was shut, but not locked. I shut it a quarter before one; the time that the Marchioness went to rest. I shut both the doors, but not locked them; I am sure of it. I shut the back drawing-room door, and the front drawing-room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the anti-room door was that night - A. I shut it at the same time. I think I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BIGNELL. I am a lamp-lighter; I light the lamps for the Marchioness of Downshire; I fasten my ladder behind the rails of the stable wall with a padlock and a chain. It was a strong chain, like a brewer's chain.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of the 29th of March, do you recollect fastening your ladder there - A. I did, about six o'clock in the evening. In the middle of the night, about two o'clock, I go about for the purpose of re-lighting the lamps, and when I went to relight the lamps, the ladder and the chain were gone. I found the ladder about eight o'clock; it was standing upon the area steps of the Marchioness, inside of the rails.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Richardson see you - A. By his actions it appeared he did; by his turning down a street, and then running. He slipped off two great coats in running. I came up to him, and apprehended him in Little White Lion-street. I secured him. He asked me what I wanted. I told him not to talk to me in that way. He appeared as if he did not know me. He said, Mr. Beckitt, I shall be hanged. I took him into a back-room of a public-house, and searched him. I took from his person five hundred and twenty-three pounds in bank notes. He then asked me to get him a coat. He had not a coat or hat. I sent for a coach, put him in, and then he offered me the money to let him go. He said, I might keep the money for my own use, provided I would let him go out of the coach. In about ten minutes after that, in our way to the House of Correction, he acknowledged to me of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire; that he had been very lucky in respect of robbing the Marchioness of Downshire of a large property; he said he was one of the party that was concerned in it. I then declined having any further conversation until we got to the House of Correction. I then took him into the office in the Governor's house, to the Governor, and there I believe he made a confession to the Governor of the robbery. After that, me and the Governor and Richardson went to

            . I am the Governor of the House of Correction. I know Richardson. On the 6th of April, Richardson was brought to the House of Correction by Beckett, one of my turnkeys; Beckett brought Richardson immediately into my office. I said to Richardson, I was very glad to see him back again; Beckett said he had taken a great deal of money from him; I said whatever you have taken. I said let me take an accompt down before Richardson; I then said to Richardson, from the manner in which the Marchioness's house had been broken open I had no doubt he was one concerned in it; he sat about a minute, and then he said, sir, I will not tell you an untruth; he said, I was concerned, and his part he sold to Simons's, meaning Simons and his wife, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the Simons's, did not you - A. Yes. I asked him if he could give me information where I could find Simons; I meaned the father and son; he told me he could not tell me where they were at that time. I then asked him if he thought there was any chance of recovering any part of the property; he told me there were two rings, which he had given to a Mrs. Joseph, and that I might recover them again, for he was certain that she had got them; he then told me that old Simons and young Simons had lodged at Joseph's house, and by going to Joseph's house, I was likely to find some of the valuable boxes that had been stolen; he had seen them in a drawer in a bureau in a room in which the father and son had lodged; in a chest of drawers I believe; I am not certain whether he said in a chest of drawers, or a bureau; he then said that Joseph could give me the information where to find old Simons. I asked him the name of the street in which Joseph lived; he said he did not know the name of the street, nor the number of the house, but if I thought proper to take him in a coach he would take me to the place; I sent for a coach. I went with Richardson,

               <p>Q. Before you got to Joseph's house was anything said by Richardson to you, how he came by the five hundred pounds in notes - A. I omitted that in taking down the number of the notes, I asked Richardson if that was the produce of what he had stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; he said part of it was, about three hundred pounds. Richardson took me to a house in Chandler-street, No. 13, he told me the house door would be open; I found it was, that Joseph had a shop and parlour. Richardson said, you had better knock at the door, and when Joseph comes, say it is Joe; Richardson's name is Joseph; I understood he meant the shop door; I did so. Joseph came and asked who is there; I said Joe. He opened the door, and when he found there was more than one, he then attempted to shut the door again; however I bursted it open again and got in; Joseph and his wife slept in the back parlour; they were both undressed; it was near twelve o'clock. I said to Joseph, do not make any resistance, it is of no use; I want two rings of your wife; Joseph said have you got two rings, give them to the gentlemen if you have got them; Wheeler then brought a light; I then said to Mrs. Joseph, I want two diamond rings of you, which have been stolen from the Marchioness of Downshire; she said she had got no rings, nor had she had any. Richardson then went up to her, and said you had better give them up, because you know I gave them to you. She positively denied knowing anything about it. We then proceeded to search the two rooms belonging to Joseph below, and found nothing. I then went upstairs to the second floor where Richardson, understood, had lodged. Richardson had described old Simons and young Simons had lodged there; I saw the drawer that Richardson had named to me, and found nothing. I came down stairs; I then told Joseph and his wife, that unless they gave up the rings I should take them in custody; said that she had not got them I took Joseph of oneside, I said do you know where old Simons lodges to night; he said he did not know. I told him I should take him to the House of Correction, and I should leave his wife at home with Wheeler; We got into the coach, and went to the

On the next day Richardson wished to speak to me; he told me that he had got two rings which were taken out of the Marchioness's house, and a pocket-book at his lodgings, No. 13, in the Colonade, Brunswick-square; he gave me two keys, and said if I would go to a chest of drawers, I should find two diamond rings, and a pocket-book. I went according to his direction and found the lodging; his wife was bed, this was Thursday the 8th, about eight or nine o'clock in morning. I there found two rings in a pocket-book, and this black silk purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find anything else there - A. No, except this iron crow; it is a new one, it has never been used; it is what they call a jemmy.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marchioness. Look at the rings, and tell me whether they are yours - A. Yes, I know them; they were in my house at the time the robbery was committed, and I know the purse; it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Frankil lived there - A. I found him there. This is the box that was found under the bed, on the side that Frankil was laying. Frankil said that Simons had only come there for a nights lodging. I have known Simons a good many years; he lived in Crown-street, with his wife; he left his home about eleven or twelve weeks previous to his being apprehended. The wife remained in Crown-street until she was apprehended.</p>

I found they were. The prisoners then were taken to Bow-street. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket. My brother went with the prisoners to the house of Correction, leaving Frankil. I waited until he returned, and when he returned we went back to Seymour-court. As soon as we got there we searched the room.

There is an area, and there are pallisades, and a sash was tied with three strings to the pallisades. The ladder was put on the top of the sash. There were the marks of the sash upon the ladder. In the evening I got the ladder, and the ladder reached the window within four or five inches; any person so disposed, by the assistance of the sash and the ladder, might very easily get in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what was the appearance of the room where you supposed they had been in - A. The first room I went into was the anti-room. As soon as I went in I observed a kind of a writing desk with a drawer for paper and pens; it appeared to have been cut by a knife, and to have been wrenched open. Upon this writing-desk I observed drops of a wax candle. Upon the floor I found the knife which is in that trunk; a clasp knife. This is the knife. I then went into the back drawing-room where they had entered. I found there the cabinet broken open, boxes broken open, paper and every thing throwed about the floor. I found an iron crow upon the floor and a small centre-bit, and a piece or two of dirty candle. In different parts of the room I found some spots occasioned by the droppings of a wax candle. I then went into the bow-room; I found that room in the same state; the sash was up. That is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did any of them go away - A. I was not present when any of them went away.</p>
               <p>Q. After you came home did you go out again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you see any of them - A. About eight o'clock, or a little after eight, I saw old Simons and young Simons; after that, old Simons came in before ten o'clock, and young Simons came in; his father asked him where he had been. He looked rather out of breath; he had been running or walking very fast. He said he was going up; meaning up stairs. His father said he was going to bed. That is all I saw of them that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. His father asked him where he had been - A. Yes; he said as far as Russel-square or Bedford-square. I said he could not go that distance in so short a time. He said he had seen the prison, the house of Correction. I went to bed about half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How early the next morning did you see or speak to either of the prisoners - A. About seven o'clock in the morning young Simons took the wash-hand bason. There was water in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go up stairs for the bason - A. Yes, up to Simons's room on the second floor. When I went up stairs I saw young Simons and Richardson. I asked Richardson what brought him there at that time in the morning; he said, nothing particular, and looked with his head down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of the water - A. Not that I saw. The water had been used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Richardson take any thing out of his pocket while you were there - A. Yes, something like that box. I afterwards saw the inside of it. There was something parted off at one end; it was a musical box. I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Marchioness. Was that box, before it received a damage, a musical box - A. Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she been there frequently in company with Richardson - A. Not frequently. She knew him seemingly, and they were familiar together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did they all come down and breakfast after this - A. Yes, and Richardson shewed the musical box again. When he produced the musical box he wound it up by the key, and made it play. He put it on the table; he said Simons had offered three guineas for it, (I understood, old Simons) and from that to eighteen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you understand eighteen guineas - A. Yes. He said he would not take it. Richardson also took out of his pocket a gold watch; he asked me what it was worth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did Mrs. Simons go away that morning - A. Yes. She came back again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day did old Simons produce any thing - A. Yes, a black purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of that black purse did you see him take any thing - A. Silver coins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Richardson give your wife any thing - A. Yes. I did not see him give it her; he told me a chain he gave her. I sold it to Mrs. Simons. The chain was something of gold, and pearl hung to it, and some stones on it that looked white, enamelled with blue.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you sell it to Mrs. Simons - A. I cannot say whether it was on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when you sold it her - A. Only young Simons; old Simons was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her at the time you sold it from whom you had it - A. Yes. I told her I had given Richardson twelve shillings for it, and she gave me thirty shillings.

               <p>Q. Do you remember on that Tuesday young Simons shewing you any thing - A. Yes, a pocketbook with a clasp to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it like this - A. Yes; he desired me to smell it, it smelled like his father's prayer-book. He asked me if the lock was gold. I said I believed it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about Richardson that you had not seen before - A. Yes; I observed two gold seals hanging to Richardson's watch that I had not seen before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the Monday, the day before the house was robbed, of any matches being bought - A. Yes, by old Simons, of a boy in the street.</p>

               <p>Richardson's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, a just sense of horror at my present awful situation, and being unwilling to attempt to justify my conduct, I plead guilty; which guilt originated in the dangerous acquiescence of most dishonest practices. Pardon my presumption; having only attained my twenty-six years, bred to a stonemason. I cannot be supposed to have transgressed the laws of my country, to that extent as I humbly acknowledge to be the case without wicked advice, by characters whose chief dependance were to trace the steps upon various mansions, for advising me, and other unfortunate persons like myself, to rob and plunder every thing to themselves, they acquiring the property; to such characters I have fallen a prey. I can assure you that my actions have never been that of a self-premeditated thief, and it is the only reparation I can make. Sorry I am to make my own condemnation, justice makes me do it; I never carried any offensive weapon about my person, and so far from doing violence on these occasions, upon the least noise or alarm sooner to risk violence I ran away rather than by violence endangering the lives of valuable subjects. I have too frequent fallen into and adopted the mode of systematical house-breaking. Mrs. Simons and her family, who are now indicted with me, they have been the chief persons that I have been connected with since my being in London three years, who have informed me what houses to break into, and when and what part the most valuable property was contained, which property I was obligated to sell to them at the sixteenth part of the value, and when I have so done there have been persons in the street to rob me of the same. My escape from Cold Bath-fields prison is too notorious, it is well known I escaped from there; when being moneyless I went to Mrs. Simons; Mrs. Simons then mentioned the robbing of the house of the noble Marchioness. I have pleaded guilty, and am therefore determined to tel of the Simons's family. They gave me instructions about the house; which after their giving me several times, they set me to rob the house, which I humbly beg pardon for the same. On my apprehension I acknowledged my guilt and contrition. I have been the chief instrument of restoring the property back again. Pardon me, my wife is only seventeen years of age, entirely without any protection by the recent loss of her father. I humbly implore your mercy; spare my life; I have transgressed in the extreme, yet as I have endeavered to discover the present robbery and to restore all the property in my power, I humbly hope you will save my life. Banish me wherever you please; I implore mercy, for which I and my family will for ever pray.</p>

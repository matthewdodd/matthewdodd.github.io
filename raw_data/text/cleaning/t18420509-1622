                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Charles Davis, of Mount-street, Lambeth. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning of the 12th of May, I was in Paternoster-row with my master's cart—the prisoner was there with a cart also—he came up to me and asked me if he should carry the fat out to Mr. Cuthbert's—I told him no, I had a man that did the work regularly—he then took the tail-board of the cart down, and said he would carry one sack out for a pennyworth of gin—I said, "No"—I went to market, and when I came back to the cart, about 30lbs. weight of ribs of beef was gone—I went and asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of it—be said no—I then went into Mr. Cuthbert's and made inquiry.</p>

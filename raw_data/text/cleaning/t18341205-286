                  </hi>. I reside at Halstead, in Kent. On the night of Saturday, the 29th of November, or the Sunday morning, I had three aviaries broken open on my lawn, and, among other birds, a white Chinese pheasant was taken away—I think it had been safe on the Saturday, but I am not sure that I saw it—it was the property of my daughter, Sarah Jane Atkins—I have seen it since; it was discovered in London—it was a tame pheasant, and is still alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Rosier, a poulterer, in Leadenhall-market. On the 1st of December, a man came and asked me if I would buy a white pheasant—he went and brought up the prisoner, who had the pheasant in his pocket—this is it—it is a silver white pheasant, with a long tail—I asked him the price—he said 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked where he got it—he said, at East Grinstead—I had received information that one of that description had been stolen from Alderman Atkins, and I sent word—Mr. Lane came and identified the bird—the prisoner and the other man ran out of the shop—the prisoner was overtaken and brought back—I am quite sure he is the man who had the pheasant in his pocket—I took it out myself.</p>

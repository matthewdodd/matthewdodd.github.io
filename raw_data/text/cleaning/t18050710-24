                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100034"></xptr>Q. In consequence of information that you received, had you occasion to put in your accompting-house any marked money? - A. Yes, I put some half-guineas and seven-shilling pieces, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many of each? - A. I do not recollect the quantity; I put then in the till-box in the drawer in my desk, where I usually keep all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark all of them the same? - A. No, there were different marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that accompting-house in Eagle and child alley? - A. Yes, it is a room in the printing-office, it does not join the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you put the marked money there? - A. About a week before the 20th of June, when I first received the information; on the 21st of June, at five o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by one of my apprentices; I got up immediately, and went into my accompting-house, I found the only four drawers that had locks taken out, the locks had been forced, the till-box on the floor, and all the money gone, and the papers that were in the drawers scattered about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any trunk there? - A. Yes, that was broken open, the staple was broken in two; it contained books and papers.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of finding this what did you do? - A. I went to Trott.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To what amount was the money in the till? - A. Somewhere between one and two pound were gone, I am sure there was more than 1 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where was Trott? - A. He was at his lodgings in Hatton-wall.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave information to Trott, and went with him to Stanton, the other officer, what then? - A. Then Trott and Stanton went into a cellar at Brooke's-market, Holborn; I waited in the street about two minutes, and then I went into the cellar, and there I saw Osland; I waited while they searched the cellar; the cellar did not seem to communicate with the house; I saw them find some crows and some picklock-keys and two papers of bad money; there was a woman and a man and a girl about eight or ten years old, all in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Osland to the watch-house with the officers? - A. I went with the officers to the office, at Hatton-garden, and there they lodged Osland, and the man and woman too in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the little girl? - A. They left her in the cellar to do as she pleased. We then went to a court in the neighbourhood of Mutton-hill; I waited in the court, and the officers went in a door at the end of the court; in about two minutes one of them put his head out of the window, and said, that he had taken Molton; I then went in and saw Molton and the woman dressing, and a little boy, and the girl that we had left in Osland's cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the space of time, between the time that you had left the little girl in Osland's cellar, and the time that you were at Molton's? - A. Half an hour, I am not quite sure; they took Molton, the girl, and the boy, in custody to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that was found there? - A. One of the officers shewed me a crow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you did not know the prisoners before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They had not been in your house nor about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the office did you deposit the marked money? - A. In the accompting-house, on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You marked your money - I suppose you suspected some of your workmen? - A. No, I had information.</p>
               <p>Q. You suspected somebody from information that you received from the officers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How late before this morning when you found your accompting-house had been broken open, had you seen any of this marked money? - A. I saw it every night before for a week to the best of my recollection, I am sure I saw it the night before, on the 20th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How many half-guineas had you marked? - A. I had marked more than one half-guinea, I had marked some silver, and there was one shilling marked; I left the accompting-house on the 20th, about nine at night; I examined the money before I went, and locked the accompting-room myself.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp, I am an officer belonging to Hatton garden Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information to Mr. Taylor previous to this robbery being committed? - A. Yes, about a week before; Mr. Taylor came to me about half past five in the morning, on the 21st, I then proceeded with Stanton to Brooke's-market, to Osland's cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is that cellar? - A. The corner of Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a cellar that is used for a habitation? - A. It is a habitation; when I unbolted the door in the cellar that communicated to the house, I knew some of the people in the house to be honest people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Osland before, whom you had found there? - A. I had seen Osland several times before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Tell us exactly what past when you got to this cellar? - A. I saw Osland in bed with a woman, in the cellar, and a little girl in the same bed, and an old man sitting on the side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100035"></xptr>of the bed; I told Osland, he must get up and dress himself, we were officers, and were come to take him into custody; he got up, and I tied his hands; I then struck a light, there was no light in the cellar only from the door; while I was looking about one part of the room, I saw the woman get out of the bed, and go towards a rabbit-hutch, she was stooping down, I asked her what she was going to do; she said, she was going to feed the rabbits; I pulled her away; sometime after I saw Stanton pick up a bag, I looked at it, and saw two iron crows, and several skeleton keys in the bag; I searched all the house, and every person in the cellar, and found nothing that was suspected to be Mr. Taylor's property. I asked Osland how the iron crows, and keys came there; he said, a young man that was gone to sea left them there sometime back, I searched Osland, I found nothing on him; I found a great quantity of bad money that had not long been in that state; he said, the same young man had left those sixpences there; we took them all to the Office, but the little girl, and locked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the old man? - A. Yes, I searched them all and found nothing on them; then we went to a court in Vine-street-hill, near Mutton-hill; I went to a house up one pair of stairs, and I met Molton on the top of the stairs without his stockings and shoes; Stanton was close behind me, I told him to return into the room, I was going to take him into custody; I saw him come out of the one pair of stairs room, he begged I would let him put on his shoes and stockings; I told him, by all means; I found his shoes and stockings were in that room, I then searched him, and in his watch-pocket I found a half-guinea, a French half-crown, and I think there were four shillings altogether, one of which is marked, the half-guinea and the half-crown are marked; he said, oh dear, do not take my money away, it belongs to my wife; I told him if it did belong to his wife, I should take it; there was a little boy in this room, and his wife, the boy was laying on a box on the left hand side of the bed; I turned my head round and saw Osland's little girl sitting on one side of the room with a bonnet on, knowing her, I told my brother officer not to let her go down stairs, till I had searched the room further; I sadly wanted the woman to get out of bed, she was very unwilling, she put on her under petticoat, and sat on the bed: I saw her doing something with one of her hands between the bed and the sacking; I went and pulled up the bed and there lay this crow wrapped up in this cloth; I then locked them up after I had taken them to the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Mr. Taylor's house with this crow? - A. No, Stanton took the others, they were broken open with the other crows.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the little girl at the other place did you take her into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce to Mr. Taylor that money you now produce? - A. I did, as being found on Molton: I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found nothing at Osland's but crows? - A. Nothing but crows and skeleton keys.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You went with Osland to this cellar? - A. I did; I produce the crows and the skeleton keys I found in this bag, very near a rabbit-hutch in this cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman near the rabbit-hutch? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. These two crows appear to be fitter for drawers than doors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They appear to be fit for the inside of the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some keys in the cellar? - A. I found all in that bag. (The keys handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These keys are for the inside of a house not for doors? - A. They are; I tried these small crows to Mr. Taylor's drawers in the accompting-house, three or four days after the prisoners were taken into custody; they were broke open with an instrument of a like width, they corresponded with the dents, Mr. Taylor was present when I tried these crows.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did they fit with the dents in your judgment when the officer tried them? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that one of the half-guineas that you saw the night before in the till-box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the half-crown and the shilling? - A. These were also part of the marked money that I had put in the till-box; the shilling and the French half-crown and the half-guinea I am sure of, (the money shewn to the Jury) the half-crown is marked on the edge with a waved line, the half-guinea has the dot between the C and F cut off, the shilling has J P on both sides and a fleur de lis, those are the marks I observed on the shilling the night before, and the nights preceding, since I had the information; there were marks on the drawer of a large crow as well as the small ones.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Had you parted with any of that money that you had marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- GUNNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an apprentice to Mr. Taylor; I came out of the dwelling-house about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning; I unlocked the office, and went into the accompting-house, and I observed the drawers were broken open.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the sash had been up? - A. Yes it was up, it is on the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100036"></xptr>Q. Could any body get in there but through the assistance of a ladder? - A. I do not think they could; the workmen had been at work, and the ladder and scaffolding were about the premises.</p>
               <p>Osland's defence. All that I can say, I went to-bed that night between ten and eleven o'clock, and in the morning, about seven, Mr. Trott and Stanton came and called me out of bed; I got up, and went with them; they took that bag, and those things which were left with me (I do not disown) by a man that went on board a ship; they took me and the woman, and the man that came out of the hospital the day before; he met me; I asked him to come home with me, he had broken ribs; they took the mother of the girl, the girl did not belong to me; the girl did not know where to go, and as this boy and girl went to school together, she went there, as far as I know, to Molton's.</p>
               <p>Molton's defence. I have got to say, as I came home from work in the evening, I purchased a couple of mackerel; I had no change; I gave a one-pound note, and that is the way I came by the money; I know no further about it.</p>

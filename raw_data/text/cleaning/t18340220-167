               <p>JOHN CUTMORE. I live at No. 107, Bunhill-row - on Sunday evening, the 26th of January, between eight and nine o'clock, I was crossing <placeName id="t18340220-167-crimeloc966">West Smithfield</placeName>

            . I was walking with my husband across Smithfield - I heard a footstep behind me - I suddenly turned round, and saw two men - the prisoner was one of them - the other had one hand at the tail of my husband's coat, and the other hand in his pocket - he immediately took his hand out, and handed the snuff-box to the prisoner, who ran away - I held the other one for about twenty minutes in the street - an old gentleman came behind me and shook me, and compelled me to let go of him - I should know that man again, because, after the man had got away, he stood and talked to me a long time, and said, I ought to have been taken in charge for holding the man; and, if a policeman had been near, he would have given me in charge- I explained it to him, and gave him my address - I waited about ten minutes - my husband did not return - I have not described the old man to the police, for I was not able to go out for a long time afterwards; for the man bit my hand, and trod on my foot - I could not get my shoe on.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is my first offence, I beg the mercy of the Court.</p>

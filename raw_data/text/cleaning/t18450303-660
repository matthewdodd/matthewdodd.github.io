                  </hi>. I was formerly a confectioner, living at No. 203, Oxford-street. I am now messman to the Royal Artillery at Wool<lb></lb>wich—I have known the prisoner three or four years—in July, 1842, the prisoner was in my debt 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in that month he produced this bill of exchange to me to be discounted, or to give him the difference of it, and take what was owing to me—at the time he brought it me I said, "You must leave this for inquiry, I cannot part with my money in this way; I must know who this Samuel Roberts is"—I had discounted for the prisoner before, but never for an acceptor of the name of Roberts—I said, "Who is the bill from?"—he said, "A gentleman residing at Stafford, who resides on his own estate"—I said, "Is it for money or goods?"—he said, "For wine I have sold"—I first advanced him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bill, for which he gave me this "I O U—he left the bill with me—I wrote to Stafford, and received an answer—I wrote a second letter to Stafford—this is the letter—it was returned to me as it is now by the post—I received an answer to this letter—before the bill became due I gave the prisoner the difference of the bill—I gave him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more after I received the first letter—he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previous to that—he received in all 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I took for discount—the bill was presented at Cox and Bid<lb></lb>dulph's, where it is made payable, but was not paid—in consequence of that, and of what I learnt at Cox and Biddulph's, I applied for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner, and offered a reward for his apprehension—in Dec., 1842, about three months after the bill had become due, I received this letter—I have seen the prisoner write, and had communications with him, and have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting—I can swear to this letter being his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another letter</hi>)—this is the letter I received in answer to that I wrote to Stafford—I do not know the writer of that, nor this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—it is a <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> of the other—I can form no opinion of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) I heard nothing more of the prisoner after the receipt of that letter till Aug., 1843—in consequence of what I then heard I came to Newgate. and saw the prisoner there—he was therein the name of William Smith—I lodged a detainer against him about three or four months after, and on the 4th of Feb., when he was about to be discharged, he was taken on this charge, taken before Mr. Rawliuson the Magistrate, and committed.</p>

               <p>ascertained there was no Mr. Roberts, after the bill was returned into my hands—I then began to be diligent to know what had become of Casey, and I found he was in Whitecross-street—I took steps to find him—I looked for the drawer—the acceptor was of no use to me—I looked to the drawer—one was a man I did know, and the other I did not know—I cannot tell how long it was before I wrote to Mr. Roberts, of Stafford—it was no use to write to Stafford, because my other letters were returned—my letter that was returned was written on the 13th, and it was a fortnight before it came back to me—I wrote to make inquiries at Stafford, about a fortnight after the receipt of this, perhaps a month after the dishonour of the bill—this letter was returned after I advanced the money, before the bill was dishonoured—at the time of the dishonour of the bill I had reason to believe there was no such person as Roberts at Stafford, from my letter coming back—I believed, at the time the bill was returned to me, there was a person named Roberts at Stafford, who could pay the bill—I did not apply to any person at Stafford to pay the bill—I made inquiries at Stafford—I could not find the drawer—I continued to look for the prisoner up to the time of his coming here—I did not desire that his wife should pay the money—I applied to her to know where Casey was, that I might get the money—I did not threaten criminal proceedings, in the event of her not telling roe, but in the event of my not finding him—if the money had been sent, I should probably not have enforced proceedings—it is not unusual, when persons do not honour their bills, to grant a little indulgence—I have granted two or three months, and longer—I do not know where the Mr. Roberts, who I saw in the Queen's Bench, is now—I have not been looking for him, or in<lb></lb>quired at the Queen's Bench for him—I had never seen him previously, and have not seen him on the turf since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now out of business—I was a publican, and kept the Prince Albert, in Albert-street, City-road—I knew the prisoner before he went to prison—he frequented the house I kept, and lived in the same street—I knew a person named Roberts—the prisoner used to call him <hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, when they were friendly together—I have often seen them to<lb></lb>gether—Mr. Roberts used to come several times, and leave notes for Casey, and I have seen Casey give him money, but what about I do not know—at one time I saw Casey give him fifteen or sixteen sovereigns, and he thanked him, and all that sort of thing—I do not know what has become of Mr. Roberts—I have not seen him lately—the last time I saw him was two years and a half ago, for what I know—I did not keep it in my mind—I knew nothing about this till the day before yesterday, and then I came in here just by accident, as I did to-day, hearing the case was coming on—I have not been examined by any attorney for the purpose of giving evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know Roberts' handwriting at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see any notes written by him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have seen him come when Casey was not there, and I have taken pen and ink into the parlour to him—I have no recollection of his handwriting from that—it was a smallish hand, a good bit of a hand, accord<lb></lb>ing to what I have seen of it—I have no judgment or belief about his handwriting to swear to it—I could tell very near, I think, to the best of my recollection, but it is a long time ago—the acceptance to this bill of ex<lb></lb>change (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is something like it—it is a small hand, as I say—it is something like it, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen enough of Roberts' handwriting to form an opinion what is or is not his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word I cannot say—I dare say he has left twenty or thirty little notes at our house—I have not looked at them—I had no occasion to have my attention directed to them particularly, to see what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I to understand you to have any belief about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, as I said before, it is a very small hand, some<lb></lb>thing like it—whether it is it or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were you sent for to come here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not sent for at all—I was at my old house last Wednesday, and heard the parties in the room speaking about this, a public party—I was sitting by the attorney just now quite by accident—I am out of business now—I have got money enough out of my business to keep me at present till I can get another house—I left it last Tuesday three weeks—I think you know how long I was there, for you were counsel for me in opposing the beer-shop at the corner—I have been there four years.</p>

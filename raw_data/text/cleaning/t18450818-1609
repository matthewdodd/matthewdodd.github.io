                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pash, and live in a cottage in Green-lanes, in the parish of Hornsey; he is a toll-collector. On the 9th of June I locked the cottage safe at a quarter-past nine at night, and went to my husband at Hornsey-gate—I returned about half-past niae next morning, and found the house<lb></lb>door as I had left it, but, on entering, found the back room window opened—it had no shutter—it had been buttoned inside—(he button was undone, and the window forced open—the window was broken, and the articles now produced all gone—I know the prisoner—he was once a toll-collector—he was never at my house but once.</p>

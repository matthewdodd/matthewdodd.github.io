               <p>Q. How near was he to that hogshead you say was broke open?</p>
               <p>Shaw. He stood at the next hogshead but one to it. He desir'd I would let him go, and not expose him, and confess'd he took it. There was no other hogshead open in the ware-house, and this was at that time. I don't know who it belongs to: I weigh'd it, and found it had lost one hundred, three quarters, and odd pounds.</p>

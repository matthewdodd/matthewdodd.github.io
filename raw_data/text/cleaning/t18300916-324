               <p>Davis. Q. Did not the gentleman say he could not swear to it? A. No, he said he would not have the trouble.</p>

               <p>Davis' Defence. It is my own; I was going to the coach rank to see for my brother - I met this young man; I know no more of him than a stranger - I have seen him once or twice among the hackney-coaches; he said he would go with me, and we went to get some water - the Policeman came and took us; he took off my hat, and found the handkerchief - the gentleman said it was impossible to swear to it; I had it clean in my hat - my sister washed it for me.</p>

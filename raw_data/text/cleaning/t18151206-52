In consequence of evidence, which they gave before the Lord Mayor, a suspicion fell upon somebody else. In consequence of that, two persons were apprehended, and from information they gave, the prisoner, Wilson, was apprehended. A dispute took place at the examination of the prisoner, between himself and a person named Joseph, who was apprehended as a receiver; it was a dispute as to the price which Joseph gave, and the prisoner received for the stolen hats."Joseph said, he paid ten shillings a piece to the prisoner for them, and the prisoner said, he only received eight shillings for each hat."</p>

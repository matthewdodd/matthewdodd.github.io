            . I live at No. 134, Hoxton-town. On Sunday morning, the 23d of December, I was returning from the watch-house, as I am a headborough, and when I got to my own door I saw the prisoner and another man, the other had gone by with a bag on his shoulder, which appeared heavy, and the prisoner crossed over with something on his head - I followed him about a hundred and fifty yards, and asked what he had got - he said, "A piece of lead;" it was then on his shoulder, with the corner of his jacket pulled over it - I called to a man to stop the other, but he dropped the bag and got away - I compared the lead with a house of Mr. Nias', near the Rosemary Branch public-house, and it matched exactly - the nails went into the same holes - there were three dormers stripped - he was about five hundred yards from the house.</p>

            . I am a plumber. I went with the officer, and compared this lead with Mr. Thomas Nias' house - it appeared to have been fixed there - the nails are now in it; I had put it down, and know the houses to be his - he has three houses there - the lead weighs about 130 lbs.</p>

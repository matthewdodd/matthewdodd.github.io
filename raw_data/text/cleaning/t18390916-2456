                  </hi>. I am a whalebone-bristle-cutter, and live in Green Anchor-court, Fore-street. I was at the Duke of Bedford public-house, in Golden-lane, about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, on the night of the 13th of August, with my wife—the prisoner was sitting there when I went in—I was standing opposite the bar—I had not been in the house above two or three minutes when a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced between two men—the prisoner was not one of them, but he had a stick in his hand, and was going to strike a blow over one of the men's heads—I caught hold of the stick to prevent his striking the blow—we were scuffling for two or three minutes, and in the struggle I felt a pain in the lower part of my belly—I was then pushed out of the house by the barman—I saw a police<lb></lb>man outside, and told him what had passed—he went and examined in the passage of the next house, and I found I had been stabbed with a knife near the centre of my belly, alongside the navel—I had on a pair of mole<lb></lb>skin trowsers—the stab was lower than the waistband of the trowsers, on the flap—I had never seen the prisoner before—I went with the policeman and gave the prisoner in charge in the public-house—Mr. Leeson's assis<lb></lb>tant saw me the same evening, and dressed my wound—I had blood on my shirt, which was cut through, as well as my trowsers—I was not able to do any thing for four or five days—I saw nothing of the knife before the scuffle.</p>

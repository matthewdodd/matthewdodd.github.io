I am servant to John Brown, on Harrow-hill—I saw his ducks all secure on the 7th of November, about half-past five o'clock—I locked them up in the duck-house, in the farm-yard—the yard is paled all round, and the duck-house was locked—I went next morning, about half-past six o'clock; the duck-house was broken open, and 21 ducks gone—there was a duck and a drake which I knew well and can swear to—I saw them again about half-past ten o'clock, and knew them—the prisoners are labourers, and live about a mile and a half from us—I traced the foot-steps of two men from the main road to the duck-house and back again—a sack had been taken over the pales and left a mark—here are the heads and feathers of the two ducks that I can swear to—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-patrol—I heard of this, and went to Stacey's house—I found the two prisoners sitting by the fire eating herrings—I said I wanted them for sheep-stealing—Stacey said, "You are welcome to search my house"—I went to the bed-room door, and saw 15 ducks tied in bunches and hung up—I said to Stacey," Where did you get these geese?" (which I thought they were)—he said, "They are not geese"—I then found they were ducks—he said he had bought them at Brent<lb></lb>ford, but he did not know the person he bought them of—I said, "Should you know him again?"—he said, "I don't know that I should"—I also found a shoulder of mutton and some fat on a shelf—there have been several sheep lost in the neighbourhood—I then handcuffed the prisoners and brought away the ducks—I sent for Long, and he identified them.</p>

               <p>I am a plaisterer's labourer. The prisoner was a lodger of mine; I keep a house; he took my clothes the same night he took the other; I had not seen my property for a month or six weeks: on the alarm given by Cook, I went up stairs, and found all the drawers pulled out, and the box wrenched, and the property gone: I missed the things mentioned in the indictment: (repeating them): the two cloth coats are here; I saw them at the justice's: (deposed to): the taylor made one of them with hooks, but not with eyes; and buttonholes to the pockets, but no buttons; the other coat has a rent on the back.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of these two coats? - I cannot justly say; I gave four pounds.</p>
               <p>They would not sell for four pounds now? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>How long have you had one of them? - Five years; and the other in August last.</p>
               <p>Can you fix any thing what they are worth? - I do not understand them; this waistcoat is mine: I went to a club burying; they said the person died of a putrid fever; and I got a bit of rue, which I tucked in. The breeches I had in August; I gave twenty-five shillings for them; I know them by the size and the make.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see the things after they were missing? - In five weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where do you live? - No. 9, in Northumberland-street, Mary-le-bone; I keep a house, and pay twenty-two guineas a year.</p>
               <p>Let a good part of it out in lodgings? - Only one front door and back door; no part of the lodgings are divided; nobody joins with me in the rent of the house.</p>
               <p>For aught you know, they might have been taken out separate? - I cannot say.</p>

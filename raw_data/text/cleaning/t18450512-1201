On Friday night, the 18th of April, I went to bed at ten o'clock—my house was quite safe—the back parlour window and all the others were fastened at the top with a bolt—I saw they were all fast—next morning, between seven and eight, I found I could not get into the room—the bolt was shot inside—I had to go into the yard to get in at the window, which is nine or ten feet from the ground—I then found the window open—the spring was broken—I found all my silver gone off the sideboard—it was safe at ten o'clock the night before—the cruet-stand produced is mine, and was left in that room that night—here are four table-spoons, one gravy-spoon, a mustard-spoon, and the tops of the cruets—they all belong to me—the glasses are gone—a box, in which my wife</p>

               <p>ELLIS'S Defence. I sold my brother a horse the week before, for 3l. 10s., and on this day I met him in Fenchurch-street, and asked him for 30s. which he owed me - he said he would pay me in the morning, for he had bought a cart cheap at a sale, and was going to Smithfield to sell it; I said I wanted one, but his would come to too much - I went and offered it to Ewing, he would not buy it; my brother then said he would take off the springs, and make it come cheaper, and agreed to let me have it for one sovereign, besides what he owed me; we went to the King's Head, and had a drop of beer; I took the name off, and put my own on.</p>
               <p>BOYDEN'S Defence. I took the rails off the cart by Ellis's direction.</p>
               <p>GEORGE EWING re-examined. He did bring the cart to me - he had worked for me nearly twelve months, and was very honest.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KEYS. I got the springs of the cart three days afterwards from one Brown; there was the name of Ellis on a tin plate in the cart.</p>

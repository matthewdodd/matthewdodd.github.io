            . On November the 21st, in the evening, I stopped the prisoner carrying this firkin of butter, in Rosemary-branch-alley. I asked him what he had got there. I am an officer. He told me it was a cask of olives, he was taking it to Duke's-place. I took it into a shop, and borrowed a hammer. I knocked the hoops off, to see what it was. He then said, it might be other pickles. On finding it to be butter, I asked him where he brought it from, or how he got it. He would not give me any account whatever. I told him I must take him in custody. He resisted. I took him in custody by force. On the head of this cask was these directions; two pieces fastoned by three tacks. I made enquiries, and found it belonged to Mr. Leslie. This is the cask.</p>
               <p>- . I am a clerk at Hoare's wharf. This is one of the firkins that we had on our wharf. We sent the casks to Botolph wharf about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

            . I am a carman. I took these casks to Botolph wharf. I lost one at the bottom of Crutched friars, in the broad way; that is where I supposed I missed it. I believe this to be the cask.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my cask. This is one of the two that I wrote directions, and put it on the cask. A. L. is on the cask; an ink mark, with a brush.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living by portering. A man asked me to carry it for him to Duke's-place. I have witnesses that saw him put it on my shoulder. They are not here now. They would be here next sessions, that is the reason I wished to put my trial off.</p>

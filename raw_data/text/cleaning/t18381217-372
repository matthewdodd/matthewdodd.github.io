On the 6th of December the prisoner was brought to the Poplar station-house in custody—he had a cap on—I did not speak to him about it then, but at the office I did, and he said he met a man on Monday, the morning after the robbery, in Ratcliff-highway, dressed like a stoker—he had a very good cap on himself, and the man asked him if he would sell it—he said he had no objection, and he exchanged with him, the man giving him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took off his shoes on Monday, the 10th, and made an impression by the side of one foot-mark, which was left in the prosecutor's garden, and found it corresponded—I then put the</p>

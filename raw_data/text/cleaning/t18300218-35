On the 9th of February the prisoner was brought back to my shop by the Police-officer; he asked if I had lost any brushes - I said I did not know; but I looked, and missed these brushes from my shop.</p>
               <p>DENNIS HERON. I was in St. Martin's-street, between six and seven o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner and another pass the shop - the prisoner stepped in, took a bundle of brushes, and gave them to the other man - I went to follow the other man, and the prisoner ran after me, to prevent my following him; he ran after Pimro, struck him, and the other man got away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What part of the shop did I take them from? A. From the left-hand side of the shop - I was about half way between Mr. Dell's shop and Leicester-square.</p>

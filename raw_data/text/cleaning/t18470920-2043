                  </hi> I am a looking-glass manufacturer, and live in Coleman-street. On Friday, the 27th of Aug., about half-post ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Edmonds came to me and selected a chimney-glass and a mirror, for Ralph Harrison and Co., shipping-merchants, Finsbury-chambers, Blomfield-street, and said if I brought them down as soon as I could, I was to have a check for them—I took them down about half-past one o'clock, and saw Edmonds—he asked me to fix them up—when they were fixed I asked him for my money, and gave him the bill—he said Mr. Harrison would be in directly, and I should have a check—I waited about twenty minutes, he had not come—Edmonds told me, to save me trouble, he would send the check up before four o'clock—I went again at a quarter before three o'clock and saw Edmonds—he was taunting me all the time, and saying, "Were you afraid of your money?"—I went to take my glasses if I could not get the money—I took my tools in my pocket to get them away—Edmonds said they always gave Mr. Harrison half an hour's grace when he was down at the docks; he was tasting the wines—I did not go away till half-past five o'clock, they wanted to lock up the place, I could not stop any longer—I was to come again at half-past ten o'clock on Saturday morning—on the Saturday morning, at a quarter before ten, Harrison came to me, and said he was perfectly satisfied with the fitting-up of his counting-house, with the glasses I had put up, and if I could let them be where they were till the Monday, I should have the money by three o'clock—I went there at half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning with a policeman—I had let the glasses be at the place in consequences of what these men had said to me—supposing Harrison had not paid me on the Monday, I should have taken them away, but they</p>

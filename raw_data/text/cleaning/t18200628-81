In 1817, I knew the prisoner as a broker, he was recommended to me, and bought stock for me; two or three times before this transaction. In July 1816, I had 950 l. in the Navy 5 per cents. On the 1st of February, 1817, I saw him in the Rotunda, at that time I had 1,000 l. stock - we had some conversation respecting the price of the stocks, or what they were likely to be, and he advised me to sell out my 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents; and buy in 1,000 l. in Exchequer-bills, as it would be advantageous.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day did this transaction take place - A. Yes; he gave me this memorandum of the sale, (read) and paid me 36 l. in money. I had a letter from him on the 1st of June, 1817, which is destroyed; the purport of it was to recommend me to come to town before the 4th of June, saying, the 4th would be a proper time for me to replace the 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents, with the Exchequer-bills he knew I was in possession of. I came to town on the 3d, and saw him in the Rotunda, and asked him to replace this 1,000 l. in the Navy 5 per cents; he said, if I would come again in an hour and a half, it should be done - he asked if I had got the bills, I showed them to him, and said I would give him them when the stock was bought. I returned in an hour or two, and found him in the Rotunda - he immediately told me it was all ready, by which I understood the stock was bought - he again held his hand out for the bills, and said, let us go and do the business. He went with me into the 5 per cents. office, and when I got up to the counter, I thought I was justified in giving him the bills, and did so; it was a 500 l. and four 100 l. bills, and were the very same he had purchased for me before - be took them in his hand, and said, if you will stop here a moment or two, I will return. He was absent about ten minutes, and on his return, he wrote on a piece of paper and gave me, calculating the amount of the bills, and making me a debtor of 92 l. 6 s. 6 d.; then adding his commission, which was 25 s. for buying the 1000 l., and 9 s. for selling the Exchequer-bills. I gave him this draft for 94 l. (looks at it) - it has been paid by my bankers; as he was going out of the office, I said, I beg your pardon Mr. Simpson, but this is not the sort of receipt I have been used to have when I have purchased stock - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is all right Mr. Offin, you must be here on the 22d of July, when you will sign the transfer, and receive your dividend" - He turned to the counter, and wrote</p>
               <p>"22d of July," and said you will be sure not to forget to be here on that day. I never saw him again till I saw him at the Mansion House. I have never been able to get a dividend.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by. MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had he done much business for you - A. He has sold 1,400 l. for me in the 3 per cents.; he never made but one transfer except this. I was introduced to him by Mr. Harvey, of Brentwood; I have blamed Mr. Harvey for introducing him to me - and showed him the paper on the day after the transaction, and said, I was afraid I should lose my money. Mr. Harvey said, if it was 100,000 l. it would be as safe as the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you trusted entirely to Simpson to lay out your money, and you was without a remedy - A. No; I merely asked if he thought it was safe, I never said I employed him to speculate with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the first transaction you had with him a purchase for the day, or time - A. For the present day, he did not tell me this was a purchase for the opening. I believe the 22d, was opening day.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You sent a letter for him to come up on the 3d, and purchase Exchequer-bills - A. Yes; I never knew anything of buying for time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were you doing in the public-house? A. I was with a friend, but he went out before me - we went into the house between eleven and twelve o'clock, and left it about one; I was not drinking all the time - we had a little beer; it might be three pints - we had nothing but beer till the prisoner came in, and asked for gin, which I gave her, but I did not take any more than one glass; there had been no freedom between the prisoner and me - I wanted to get rid of her in the street - she was not drunk.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew, Holborn. I was on duty, and saw the prosecutor and this woman struggling - they were both down; I heard him say, "You have got my purse;" there was a crowd round them - I got in, and asked what he had lost; he said, "She has got my purse;" I wrenched it, with a great deal of difficulty, from her hand; I took her to the watch-house, and found two half-crowns and one sixpence in it - she seemed to have been drinking, but he was quite sober - she said at the watch-house that he had agreed to go home with her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she not claim the purse as her own? A. Yes.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

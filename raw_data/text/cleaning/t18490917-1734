I was on duty in Basinghall-street—a person named Hammond came to me, and as we walked towards London-wall he pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is the man"—the prisoner was then standing on the other side of the street, and the moment Hammond pointed him out he took a pistol from his right-hand jacket pocket, and before I had time to advance an inch, he pointed it towards me and said, "Stand off, for your life! one step and I will fire"—I rushed on him, and when I got about a yard, or a yard and a half from him, he pulled the trigger, but it missed fire—I heard the click of the lock—I did not see the priming burn—I seized him, threw him down, held him on the ground, and Hammond took the pistol from him—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "It is a good job for you that it did not go off, or else you would have had it"—on the way to the station he said he would have his revenge—when we got to the station I searched him, and he took a bullet-mould from his trowsers pocket and threw it on the desk, and I found on him some gun-powder, two pieces of iron, and a comb—he was quite sober—I afterwards took the pistol to Mr. London, a gunsmith, of 51, London-wall—the charge was there drawn in my presence—it consisted of this powder and ball—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards conveyed the prisoner to Newgate, and going down Newgate-street he said he wished he had shot me; he would rather be hung for me, than have fifteen years' transportation, for he knew he should have that—I asked him what object he could have in shooting me, as I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Lovell, a clothworker, of Basinghall-street. On Tuesday, 4th Sept., I saw the prisoner in Basinghall-street—I knew him by sight before—he was ten or twelve yards from Mr. Lovell's house—I also saw Shipton about four yards from him—I pointed out the prisoner to him, and said," That is him"—I should think I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear, and I said there was a warrant out against him, and to take him into custody—we went up to him, and when we were within a yard and a half or so of him he took a pistol out of his jacket pocket and presented it, I should say, at Shipton—I cannot say exactly which of us it was meant for—I was alongside of Shipton—when he presented the pistol he said," But another step, and I will fire," or" take your life," or words to that effect—I should say he said that to Shipton—we were both together—Shipton had his police dress on—I suppose he spoke to both of us when he said" Stand back"—he looked at Shipton—he then pulled the trigger, and it flashed in the pan—I went to lay hold of him, but the policeman darted at him and threw him down, and I took the pistol from him—I did not go forward to him before the pistol went off, but Shipton did—I did not notice him pull the trigger, but I heard the cock and saw the flash—I afterwards gave the pistol to Shipton—Shipton took him into custody, and took him to the station-house—in going along I endeavoured to assist Shipton, and the prisoner said," I will do for you and Mr. Lovell before long."</p>

Shipton brought this pistol to me—I unscrewed it, drew the charge, and it contained powder and a bullet—I gave it to Shipton, folded up in this paper—this bullet-mould would make bullets to fit this pistol—I do not think the pistol had been fired, although it had been pulled—I do not think there appeared to be any soot on the pan—I think it was clean as it is now—I do not think it had been primed, or if it was, it was with such poor powder that it would not act as the best powder would—if it had fired it would have blacked the pan—I do not think it could have flashed in the pan—I did not hold the pistol in my hand while I unscrewed the barrel; I put it in a vice, so that I took no soot off the pan—when I saw it first of all, I think it was clean.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday morning, the 9th of January, I met a young man in Charles-street, Drury-lane; he turned two or three times, and looked towards Drury-lane, from where he came; suspecting something, I stood a moment or two, and saw the prisoner on the opposite side, looking down Charles-street - he saw me cross towards him, and he crossed directly opposite Short's-gardens; I stopped him, and asked him what he had in this bundle? he said it was some things for his sister, and that he brought them from his mother. I found they were three wet petticoats. It was about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two young men in the Newroad; they told me to come with them; the prosecutor's daughter called one of them in - He came out with the bundle, gave it to me, and old me to go on, and said he would follow. When we came to Oxford-street he said it was stolen.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILD. I am a hair-dresser. On the 9th of January, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I saw two lads come out of the house; they had nothing in their hands - I did not see the prisoner.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 11th of July, my servant conveyed me, in my phaeton and pair, from Portal ay to Brighton—I went to London by the early coach that day—I returned on Saturday the 13th—I heard in London that ray stable had been broken open, and, on returning, I missed my horse—the stable-doer had been repaired—when I got back I published handbills of my loss, and re<lb></lb>ceived a communication from Mr. Haddon—on the 25th of August I went down to Ickworth, in Suffolk, and saw ray horse—I knew it directly—it was in a very poor state indeed, and had its tail cut square—when I lost it it was in very excellent condition, and had a switch tail—I attended be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate, and after I swore to it they allowed me to take posses<lb></lb>sion of it—a man named Manning is now in Bury Gaol, charged with re<lb></lb>ceiving it—Cousins saw my horse on my road back, at the Windsor Castle public-house, Purley Green, and Johnson, Mr. Batty's carman, has also seen it—I found the horse's neck very sore, as if rubbed by the collar—it is a remarkable horse, and had lost a tooth in the under jaw—it is a bay gelding, rather dark.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 29th of August, I saw the witness Manning at the station-house—he gave me information—I have not heard him examined to-day—I had appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner on the 28th, at his own house, which is a beer-shop in Page's-walk—I asked him if he knew old Manning, of the Spa-road—he said he did—I asked him if he had ever lent him a horse and cart at any time to go into the country with—he said he had not—I then said young Manning had told Mr. Cordy, in my presence, that the horse his father had gone into the country with was his (Chapman's) horse—be said he could not have said so, for he never had a horse, nor any thing to do with one—young Manning was taken about half-an-hour before Chapman and he gave me some information about the horse.,</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper to Mr. Stanbury. My station is at the Windsor Castle public-house, where Cousins is ostler—I remember a man and a horse coming to the Windsor Castle one day while Cousins was gone down to Mr. Gosling's to fetch some hog-wash—the man and horse one about half-an-hour before Cousins returned—it was a bay horse, it seemed to sweat very much—after Cousins came he attended to the tone himself—I attended to it before he came—the man and horse were at the Windsor Castle public-house, it might be an hour and a half—I cannot say exactly—as far as my oath, the prisoner is not the man, for he had larger whiskers and a darker complexion—I do not think he was quite so tall, and rather stouter in proportion—I do not know the prisoner at all—I saw him last Thursday—I have had no acquaintance with him—some Policeman came to the Windsor Castle soon after—Mr. Vickery, the landlord, had an opportunity of seeing the man—I cannot say whether Mr. Cordy took Mr. Vickery to Union-hall—I was there, and saw Mr. Vockery there—I talked to the man, it might be, nearly half-an-hour—he was there nearly an hour and a half.</p>

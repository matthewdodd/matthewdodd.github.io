On the 1st of October the prisoner came to my shop with another person, under the pretence of buying a pair of shoes; the other bad an old shoe in his hand, and asked me if it was worth mending - I said No, it was worth nothing; I asked if they had money for a new pair - they said they had not; they tried on an old pair, but did not like them - they said I must make a pair for them the next week; I had a watch hanging on a nail in the shop just before they came in, and when they had got about a yard from the door I missed it - I started after them, and saw it in the prisoner's hand; I caught hold of him - he put his hand behind his back; I attempted to draw it forward, and I saw the watch in a pool of water, about two yards from where he stood - I did not see him throw it away; an officer came up, and I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you really mean that you saw the watch in his hand? A. Yes, I did.</p>

I know this property to be my husband's - the prisoner came home with him on this evening, and I put the things under the bed - my husband afterwards went out, and I stepped over to my brother's, leaving the prisoner there - when I returned he was gone, and we missed them - I went with my brother, between nine and ten o'clock, and found the prisoner in a public-house with them under his arm - I took them from him- he attempted to hit me - I dropped them, and my brother picked them up, and gave them to me - I went out with them; the prisoner ran out after me, and cried Stop thief! and gave the watchman charge of me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother, and am a brass-finisher. On Tuesday, the 26th of December, I was spending the day with my mother; and when we came home in the evening, Boyce came and tapped at our window - I let him in; we had some porter; he said he had bought a shirt and a pair of breeches for 1l.; his wife came soon after, and we had some beer and spirits; she then went to fetch the things; she returned, and said they were gone - I went with her to the Horse and Groom public-house - she saw Clarke there with a bundle under his arm - she seized it, and it fell - I took it up, and came out with her - the prisoner came out and called Stop thief! after her; I took it home, and soon after Johnson and an officer came, and I gave them the things; they marked them.</p>

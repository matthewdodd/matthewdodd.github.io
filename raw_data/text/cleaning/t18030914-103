             Sworn. - I am a stonemason; I was at work next door to Mr. Dallas's: On the 25th of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoners, and Whalley, loitering about backwards and forwards, and looking down the area of Mr. Dallas; I saw them again about five o'clock, and saw White go down the steps, the other two were against the railing that forms the square; White brought something up, but I cannot say what, and gave it to Bygrave; I made an alarm, and they ran away; I pursued them, and saw Bygrave throw his hand out, but whether he threw any thing from it, I could not tell; the servant got over the rails afterwards, and I saw him pick up a china bason, and a boy take up the silver basket, and give it to the servant; the boys escaped them, but I saw them the same evening come round to look for what they had thrown over the rails; I went to call one of the servants, and when we came up again, they were gone; they were taken the following Monday, and I know them to be the same lads.</p>

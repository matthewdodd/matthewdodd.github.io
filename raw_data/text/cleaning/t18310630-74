On the 6th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners come into the shop in company, and from their manner and appearance, I was induced to take them from the young man who first served them; I showed them several pieces of goods - they asked for prints, and said they each wanted a gown; after showing them several, Ebbs made two or three attempts to draw a piece of print off the counter, without effect, and during that time Darby endeavoured to draw my attention to some goods at a little distance on the counter - at that time I saw Ebbs draw a piece of vprint off the counter; it fell on the floor, vbetween her and the counter - she then sat down on a chair, put her hand down, and drew it up under her clothes; she then said it was only an apron that they wanted, and they would come another day - they bought nothing; I went between them and the door and stopped them in the passage, close to the door - Ebbs let the print fall from her; it was thirteen yards of printed cotton in one piece.</p>

I cannot say I saw either of the prisoners there, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an Irish woman, and travel about with your character in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in place? - A. Yes, in Mrs. Goodwin's service, at the corner of Portland-road, as a servant of all work.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the note? - A. I had received it only a day or two, I had seen it in the morning before I went out, and the money too.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you lost it before you got to Portman-square, or after, you cannot say? - A. I know I could not lose it only where my pocket was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know in what place or time it was cut? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the note, or number? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I produce the pocket-book, money, and note. On the first of May, I had been up to Lady Montague's; there were a great many people; I stopped there till about three o'clock; I and Mr. Perry went down Portman-street, and overtook those two persons, in company with another man; I said to Perry, there is old Razor; I stopped him, and put my hand into his(Cosby's) right-hand coat-pocket, and pulled out that book with the note in it, we took them to a public-house, and searched them, and found some silver about them; I have not got the silver, I returned it to them again; I have got two-and-sixpence marked that was not sworn to; Perry searched the other man, and a knife was found upon him, and some silver; it was a very sharp cutting instrument; they were all talking together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.This cutting-engine is what is vulgarly called a knife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A pen-knife too? - A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is nothing unusual for a man to have a penknife in his pocket? - A. No, if they are not open as this was.</p>
               <p>Q. The silver was produced to the woman, and not a shilling sworn to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.How far were you and these men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190050"></xptr>from the rails of Montague-house? - A. About two hundred yards; there was nobody in Portman-street when we apprehended them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, I was in company with Croker; I examined Strudd, and found some silver upon him, and these two knives; they were in a slash pocket, by the side of his thigh, open as they are now. (The purse was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Strudd's defence. I met this man, I had not seen him for some time; we were going to have something to drink, and all of a sudden these people came up, and said, we must go with them; they took us in, and searched us, and took the money and knives from me, and they gave me the money at the Justice's, but kept the knives; as to the rest, I know nothing about it; I never saw the woman, or knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Cosby's defence. I had been to Paddington; I was coming that way home, and had not been near where the woman speaks of.</p>

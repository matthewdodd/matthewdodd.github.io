I am certain there was more when taken out of my shop. I described the particulars of the till before I saw it; I know nothing who took it, the prisoners did not own the taking it.</p>

            . I live in Shore-ditch, and was sitting at a publick-house door at this time: I saw Burling go into Mr. How's shop, the other lad was not with him; he came out with the till under his arm, and walk'd on in the middle of the highway as unconcerned as could be; I thought it to be a log of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Elsigood. No, my Lord. I never saw him before I saw him at the alehouse.</p>
               <p>Wilkinson Glover. I saw the two prisoners and another person together on the 7th of March last, about three or four o'clock as I was at my shop door, Burling had the till under his arm at the corner of George yard within a door of my house, I was not quite near enough to hear what they said. I went up to them to see what they had got, they had got two hats put into the till over the money to hide it, the till having a partition in it, and as they walked along neither of the prisoners had a hat on. I took hold of Burling, Bowles ran away; I took off one of the hats and saw it was money. Somebody called out stop thief, then Bowles was stop'd; then I sent my boy out to know who had lost a till, and the prosecutor came, there were in the till four shillings and eight pence half penny in half pence, and one shilling and six pence in silver.</p>

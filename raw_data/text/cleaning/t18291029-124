On the 23rd of September the prisoners came into the shop with another - Scroof asked for a pair of shoes, and tried two pairs - one fitted; they came to 2s. - she said she had not enough by 4d.; the other two had left the shop before I finished trying them on; she said she would go over the way to the young woman who had gone out first and borrow 4d; the one not here had gone before Hopper - Scroof did not return, but in two minutes I missed two pairs of shoes; I shut my door and ran out, but could not see them; I returned and stood at my door - shortly after I saw Hooper going along Shoreditch - I ran and caught her by the arm and brought her back; she denied having been in my shop; I told her she had, and asked who the other two were; she said she did not know them, and had never seen them before, but merely came in with them; I then gave her in charge; I described Scroof to Johnson, who took her in a few minutes and brought her to the shop - one of them must have taken the shoes.</p>

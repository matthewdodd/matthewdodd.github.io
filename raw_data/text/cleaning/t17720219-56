            . As I was going down Ludgate-hill, in my way home, on January 14, I met the prisoner following this gentleman; he walked a great peace, so that sometimes the prisoner was on a trot just before I got to Ave-Maria-lane, above Ludgate-Church, I saw him take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket. I did not stop the prisoner, for fear I should loose the prosecutor, but went up to the gentleman, and told him he was robbed of his handkerchief, he said he should have three handkerchiefs; he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out two, and said he had lost one. I told him if he would go along with me I dare say I should catch the person that stole it before he got to Temple-bar; soon after that I heard the prisoner in the coachway hallowing out Tom. I took him to the salop shop; there was a woman at the door, she took up a handkerchief which she said the prisoner dropt; the prosecutor said if it was his handkerchief, it was tore at one corner; upon examining it, we found it was tore at the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor would not sweare before the Alderman that it was his handkerchief,</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it to be mine; I did not sweare positively.</p>

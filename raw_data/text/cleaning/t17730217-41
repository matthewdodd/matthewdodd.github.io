            . I am one of the constables: going into the watch-house opposite Mr. Holmes's I saw a man stand in the passage, which I did not like; I went past Mr. Holmes's house; when I came back, I saw the prisoner come out of the house, as if he had something under his arm; he and another man crossed towards me; I looked at them; I knew they were not Mr. Holmes's servants; they were going towards Cheapside; they turned about and went down St. Martin's-le-grand; then the prisoner gave the cheese to the other man; I followed them down St. Martin's-le-grand, and saw the prisoner take the cheese from the other man again. I followed him to Maiden-lane and looked him full in the face; he said, D - n your eyes, why do you look at me; I said is there any harm in looking at you; he said, D - n you, yes; I said I believe you are a thief, and insist on knowing what you have got; I laid hold of his collar; I said you have been robbing Mr. Holmes in Panyer's-alley; he gave me a blow on the temples and ran as fast as the could; I called stop thief, and he was stopped.</p>

            . On the evening of the 17th April I was placed in a garret belonging to Mr. Pretty, in the house adjoining that in which the prisoner lived - Mr. Bales lives in the house - between nine and ten o'clock at night I saw the prisoner come from his house, and cut the lead from the gutter of the house which I was in; I ran to my master, Mr. Tanner, and told him immediately - he came and placed me at the back door in case the prisoner should come out there, but he did not; he was taken shortly afterwards, but I do not know by whom - the lead had been all right before, and fixed in a proper way.</p>

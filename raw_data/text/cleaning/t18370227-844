Leonard is my porter—on the 24th of February I had the parcel brought into the parlour, and being directed to the coun<lb></lb>tess D'Burke, Wynford, Suffolk, I suspected it to be fictitious—I opened it, and it was hay and dirt—next evening the prisoner came to the yard, and presented another parcel to me—I said, "What have you there?"—he said, "A parcel," and produced one directed to Henry Cooper.

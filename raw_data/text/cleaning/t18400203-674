                  </hi>. I am in the employ of James and William Simp<lb></lb>son, who are engineers, in the Belgrave-road. They have copper similar to this in their store-room—on the 28th of January I and another person</p>

               <p>received directions to be in their store-room in the evening, in consequence of having made a report of some being lost—the prisoner was in their employ, and had been so nearly three years, as a private watchman—there are two store-rooms—one of them has three doors, one of which leads into the counting-house, but it was locked—when we went into the store-room the foreman locked us in, and put the key where it was usually put, in a drawer in the counting-house—this was about seven o'clock in the evening—about half-past eight o'clock I heard some one unlock the door, and the prisoner came in at the door which led to the lobby of the small store-room, with a lantern in his hand with a lighted lamp in it—he went direct to the place where the copper was deposited, and took one piece, as I ascertained afterwards—he returned in the same direction, locked the first and second doors, and went out—I got out of the place where I was concealed, and opened another door which has no lock on, went out, and detected him a few yards from the last door—Chivers came up while I had hold of him—he had this piece of copper with him, which is 15 1/2lbs., and it worth about 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—I collared him, and said, "I want you, old fellow; I am very sorry I have been obliged to watch to detect you"—he did not know who I was—he was in a kind of stupor, but afterwards he asked who I was, and begged me to say nothing about it—Chivers came up, and took the copper from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Messrs. Simp<lb></lb>son. On the 28th of January I was set with Robert Needham to watch the store-room—I heard some one unlock the door, and saw the prisoner enter, walk deliberately to where the copper was, take a piece, put it under his arm, and walk out, and I heard him lock the door after him—I saw Needham go after him—I followed, and came up with him—Needham collared him, I took the copper from under his left arm, and his lantern from his hand—I took him to the lodge, and Needham went to Mr. Simpson—I saw something shining in the prisoner's hand, and took this key of the store-room from it, which he had let himself in and out with—I asked what could possess him to do it—he said he did not do it for himself—I said, "You must be a foolish man to do it for others"—he said, "There is no knowing what you may do before you die, Fred."—I gave the policeman the copper—it is Mr. Simpson's.</p>

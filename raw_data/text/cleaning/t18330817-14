            . I am a policeman. I was in the Edgeware-road on the 22nd of May, about a quarter to eleven o'clock - the prosecutrix told me what had occurred; I told her to go with me - we went to Cato-street, Soho, and found the prisoner in bed - I found a basket there containing two glasses, a cap, and a collar; and the prosecutrix had found a handkerchief and duplicate, which lead us to the pawnbroker - I asked the prosecutrix, if the prisoner was the girl, she said, she was; she denied having robbed her; I told her to dress herself, and brought her to the station-house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH ROSE. I am a widow. The shawl is mine - I lost a basket and the collar I have on; I found the collar in the basket - she said, she was sorry she had done such a thing, and would never do so again.</p>

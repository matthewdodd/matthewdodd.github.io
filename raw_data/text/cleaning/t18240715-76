I heard of the robbery the day after it was done, which was the 11th of June - the lead had not been removed away, but was cut up in pieces - it had been taken off the dormer window, and appeared bright at the edges, as if it was fresh cut - I think there was about 60 lbs. weight of it, but I have not weighed it - it exactly fitted the place, and was all there. I have seen these prisoners about there several times.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Allcroft, copper-plate printer, Oxford-market. I did not know the house which was robbed till these young men shewed it to me - I had known them before. On the 10th of June, about half-past six o'clock, I was standing at my mother's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150032"></xptr>door, in Peter-street, near Wardour-street, when Castelow came and asked me if I had seen Cronin - while we were speaking Cronin came up, and asked Castelow if he would go with him to Upper Harley-street - he agreed to go, and I went with him - Cronin said he wanted some money, and he would go and get some lead off those houses; and asked me to go with them - I went, and we got into the house about half-past nine o'clock; Cronin took us to the back of the house, and went up the ladder first, Castelow and I followed him - when Cronin got on the second floor he saw some carpenters' tools, and said he would have some of them - we then went on the third floor, and Castelow said he did not know how we should get to the top of the house; Cronin said he would find a way, he got a little ladder, and we all got to the top of the house. Cronin then pulled the nails out of the lead, and rolled it up - I believe it was new lead. He then cut a piece off it, which might weigh 14 or 15 lbs. - we heard the watchmens' rattles sprung, and Cronin said the watchmen had got into the house, for he could see their lights, it was then dark - Cronin then got away, but I do not know how - Castelow told me to follow him, which I did, and we went along the tops of the houses to the end of the street - Castelow then pulled off his shoes, and slid down the rain water-pipe - I tried to do so, but I fell down into a gentleman's yard; I laid there a great while, I do not know how long - a gentleman's servant came and asked me if any body was in the house; I told him no - he asked me how I got there, and I told him; he called the watchman, who took me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CRONIN. Q. You said, at the Police Office, that it was in Baker-street - A. I said I did not know whether it was in Baker-street or Harley-street - I did not know the street.</p>

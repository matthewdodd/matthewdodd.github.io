               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming down the Minories; I saw some people running along Whitechapel; I went into the mob and saw some stockings lying in the mud; I picked them up and laid them over a post at the end of Houndsditch; as soon as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170023"></xptr> put them across the post the prosecutor came, and said if I cannot find the right person I will take you up on suspicion. I know no more of it than the child unborn; what they have sworn is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Was the man running?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes, close by me; they were both running.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Could you be mistaken in the person of the man?</p>
               <p>Porter. No; he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing?</p>

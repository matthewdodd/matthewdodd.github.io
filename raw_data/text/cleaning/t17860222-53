               <p>I live with Mr. Ward at Great Ealing, I am his apprentice, he is a carpenter, his shop does not join to his house, but it is in a court-yard surrounded by a wall intirely; on the 27th of January last, I shut up his shop, it was locked and fast about five o'clock, I kept the key of my master's chest, that was locked; one of the doors of the shop was fastened with a bolt, the door I went out at was locked and fast, the third door was fastened with a staple; I went to the shop in the morning about seven, I took the key out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the shop? - I got in at the window, and opened the two doors, there was a pane of glass to the window broken, and a board nailed up, and that board was pushed down, that hole was large enough to get the prisoner's body in, when that board was torn down; these two doors were both fast; when I shut up shop I locked the door next the kitchen: my master's chest and Margisson's chest were both open, the hinges were off Margisson's chest, and some of the tools were taken away; I had put my master's into the chest the night before, and the things belonging to him mentioned in the indictment were missing, I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court to Young. How came you to search the lodgings of the prisoner? - Because he told me where he lived, he was stopped with three oil stones, and a hand saw which are not claimed at all, some carpenters who had lost their tools, were going after their tools to different shops, and he run out of one of the shops as they came in.</p>
               <p>Jury to Young. You say nobody owned this stock, and bit, and plough.</p>

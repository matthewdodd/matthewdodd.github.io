            . I live at Mr. Burford's, in Ratcliffhighway, and look after horses and chaises. I was returning from the stable after doing up my horses, a little after ten o'clock, and going down Old Gravel-lane, to our back door, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked round, and saw the prisoner the first person running; I stopped him, and heard a person say, "I have lost my watch;" I then saw a watch in the prisoner's hand - I caught at it, and got the chain in my hand, but he held the watch in his hand, and began to kick in a manner I could not bear, so that I was not able to hold him; he got the chain from me, there being no seals to it, I could not hold it - he ran off, and threw away the watch: I took it up, and was going to pursue him, but two young women stopped me as the watchmen came up, and accused me of the robbery; I stated how I came by the watch, and he took me to the watch-house; I got there before the prisoner, and when he was brought in I recognized him as the person who threw the watch away; he was then taken and locked up; it was a darkish night, but I knew the prisoner well - I have seen him pass my master's house scores of times.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110120"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Burford? A. A paper-stainer - he has three horses and two chaises, and a chaise-cart, and another gentleman has a horse and chaise in the same stable; I quitted Mr. Burford on Monday - I was a regular servant of his for nine months, and had 16s. a week. Mr. Burford, Jun. and myself had a few words, and I left them - they did not accuse me of anything; I never was here but once before, that was about a man getting into the stable; I never said to any one that I had a job here which I got three guineas by, and I should like to have such another; I got my expences at that time, which were above a guinea; I have seen the prisoner buying and selling fruit, and serving master with fruit - there were other persons running, but he was the first; there were others running after him - I stopped him; I did not take hold of the chain till I had hold of him; a person(who is a bricklayer) saw him throw the watch away, and saw me pick it up, but he is not here - neither of the young women saw me pick it up; I cannot tell how they came to accuse me of the robbery - perhaps they might be confederates; I knew the prisoner's name was Cohen; neither of the young women are here - if I could have found them I should have given them into custody; I did not state that the prisoner's name was Cohen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you had hold of the watch-chain did you know the prisoner? A. Not at that time, but when I saw him at the watch-house, I knew his name was Cohen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then, when you had hold of the chain you had doubts about who he was? A. I knew his face very well indeed; I was then taken to the watch-house, and in consequence of my stating it was Cohen I was discharged, and he was kept; my master and two respectable gentlemen came to the watch-house, and stated where I had been.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the watchman came up to you and took you? A. Yes; I pointed out the person in the mob to him - he took me to the watch-house, and in going along I saw Cohen in the custody of another watchman and a bricklayer; when I saw him I said that was the man; the watchman is not here, and I do not know his name.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. George's parish. I was at the watch-house - the witness was brought in, in about three minutes before the prisoner, and had the watch in his possession; the prisoner was then brought in, and the prosecutor came and said he had lost his watch - the witness then said he stopped the prisoner with the watch in his possession - he gave the same account he has to-day: the prisoner was given in charge for stealing the watch; there was no charge against the witness - there was a gentleman came forward to say he knew him; I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then when Rainer first came in he said nothing about how he came by it? A. There were no questions asked him till the prisoner was brought in - the person who brought in Cohen brought in a piece of watch-glass, which was picked up near to where he stood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who was that? A. I forget his name; he said he would attend if we wanted him - he is not here, nor the watchman who took Rainer.</p>

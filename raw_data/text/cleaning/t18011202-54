             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a waterman, employed by the Thames Police Office? - A. I am: In the night of the 18th of November, about a quarter before three in the morning, I saw the prisoner taking some hemp out of the lighter belonging to Mr. Lucas; there was another man with him; he put it into a boat that was lying along-side; I had seen the prisoner before that, a little after two in the morning; they saw the Police-boat coming, and they ran across the boats to the shore; we pursued them, and overtook them; we brought them back to the boat they had left, and found in it seventy pounds weight of hemp; I knew the prisoner before, I am sure he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At what distance were you from the wherry at the time you suppose you saw him? - A. About six or seven yards.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you told the men with you who the man was? - A. I told the man that sat next to me that there was Whitehead stealing hemp from the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell all the men that that was Whitehead; I thought it was sufficient to tell the man next me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the Thames Police surveyor? - A. I am; I was with the last witness; I saw the prisoner between two and three in the morning; we looked into his boat, but he had nothing in it, and I let him go: about a quarter before three, near the Hermitage-stairs, Rogers called out, there they are stealing hemp, and then said, there is Jack Whitehead; I saw two men run from a wherry, in which there was a quantity of hemp in a mat; the boat laid along-side Mr. Lucas's lighter; the prisoner was apprehended the next day at the Waterman's Arms; he had sent word by Mr. Isaacs, an attorney, that he should attend at the Office; he did not deny my having seen him the first time, but denied that he was the person that I afterwards saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't know that the man you afterwards saw was the prisoner? - A. I took notice of his dress; he had a blue jacket on, with white buttons, and the man with him had a brown jacket, a pair of thickset breeches, and white stockings; I did not see their faces.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you any doubt of their being the same persons? - A. I have not.</p>

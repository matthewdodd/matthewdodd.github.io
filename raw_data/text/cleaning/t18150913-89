The nett weight of the thirty, was nine thousand five hundred and ten pounds. They were delivered to the prisoner to be conveyed to the Custom house. The nett weight of a bag No. 16, was three hundred and seventeen pounds when delivered to him, and he had the charge of the whole, as a <rs id="t18150913-89-deflabel502" type="occupation">Custom house officer</rs>

I still followed on, and observed him very busy, and in about twenty minutes I got up into the waggon, and observed him sewing up the seam of bag 16, Seeing me get up into the waggon, he swore at me, and demanded, did I come to plunder it? I told him no; but I was a police officer, and I should apprehend him for doing so; and I told him, I had been observing him all the time. He besought me to desist, saying, he had a large family, and it would be the ruin of him. I then examined the bag when we came to the London Dock, and found that a hole had been cut in it, large enough to admit this tin tube; that would be a very convenient tube for conveying the pepper out of bag 16 into his own bag, and it is the same size as the hole.</p>

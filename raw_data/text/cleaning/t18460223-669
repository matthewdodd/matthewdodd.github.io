On Wednesday evening, the 11th of Feb., a little after six o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to the bar with another man—I had never seen him before—he asked for change for a sovereign—he offered me a good sovereign—I noticed that it was good—he laid it on the counter—I gave him a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I am sure the half-sovereign I gave him was a good one—I had noticed it that afternoon—the prisoner then asked me for a glass of porter, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave it him—he asked his companion to pay for it—he did so—he then turned to me and said, "Then will you give me my sove<lb></lb>reign back again?"—I gave him the sovereign, and as I took up the half<lb></lb>sovereign and threw it into the till, it fell lightly—I knew it was a bad one—I took it off the counter—I did not see how it came on the counter—he had plenty of time to change it while I turned my back for the glass of porter—I did not see him touch the change—when it fell into the till Mr. Mackwinnie, who was standing by me, instantly took it up, and gave him in charge—there was no other half-sovereign in the bowl—there are three separate bowls—I marked the half-sovereign at the police station.</p>

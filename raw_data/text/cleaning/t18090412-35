The entrance to my house is through the shop only, I rent the house and shop myself, it is one and the same occupation. On Monday the 6th of March, about six o'clock, some men came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them did you - A. I did not see them; I heard them talking at the door, in the mean time my young man came from the kitchen with two lamps; a man came in and asked for an ounce of coffee, and while the young man was weighing the coffee I heard a chest rattle; I was in the middle of the shop, a board had given way, I was putting a board there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the chest - A. There were four chests placed by the door, one on the top of the other; this chest was on the top of the pile; they stood on the floor; when I heard the chests rattle I did not know whether it was at the stairs or the door; there were chests also placed at the stairs; I called out to the servant to know whether she had gone up stairs; I turned round and missed the chest standing within the shop, by the door; I run out of the door and crossed the street and went into Francis-street; when I had got two or three doors up I heard something which I thought to be a chest pitching; I had gone beyond him; I turned round and saw the prisoner standing with the chest before him in Francis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he holding the chest - A. I am not certain; the chest was on the ground. I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, I said you rascal you have got my chest; I throwed him against the wall and kept him till Mr. Goding chanced to come by the corner, I called him to assist me; we took the prisoner back to the shop; a man coming by, we desired him to bring the chest of tea back. I am sure it was my chest of tea; it contained about twelve or thirteen pounds of tea; the cost price was about six shillings and eight pence a pound. The prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the chest stand from the door - A. Close to the door; inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your young man here - A. No.</p>

            . I live in Titchbourne-street, Golden-square. I was crossing Marylebone-street at Francis-street, Mr. Crofts was calling out for assistance, he had got the prisoner; I saw the chest there; I took the prisoner back to Mr. Crofts' house; I asked the prisoner how he could do such a thing; he said he had found it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you weigh the tea - A. On the Saturday before I went to Marlborough-street the second time. I kept the chest of tea in the shop ever since; the chest is the same now as when taken from the prisoner; there is the same quantity of tea in the chest now as when I took it from the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120029"></xptr>Q. When you took it from the man you did not weigh it - A. No; I weighed it on the 10th of March, it weighed about thirty nine pounds, chest and all; I took twenty five-pounds off for the fare.</p>
               <p>Q. But you took no pains to secure the chest, so that no more could be put in it - A. I put it up just as it was, the top was broke as it is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The offence was committed on Monday, and you did not weigh the tea till Saturday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What any body else might do you do not know - A. I never suffer any body to meddle with the chests. I had not taken any notice of the chest for some time; I am sure there was tea in it when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more of it than a child unborn, I was coming by when I saw a man chuck this chest off his shoulder; I thought he had chucked it away. I am a person that drives a chaise at Turnham green; I keep rabbits, I thought it would make a good rabbit hutch; I did not know where his shop was till he took me back. Had the chest been full I should not have been able to carry it.</p>

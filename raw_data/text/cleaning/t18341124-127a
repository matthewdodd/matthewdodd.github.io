                  <hi rend="largeCaps">CHARLES NOVERRE</hi>. I live at Kensington, and am a professor. The prisoner came into my service about the 14th of October, and on the 21st of November I missed two brooches, four rings, a locket, and a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief—they were taken from a small cedar-wood box, which was locked, and put in a cupboard which was locked—the prisoner was at home when I missed them—I went to the office, and got an officer, who went with me—we examined the boxes belonging to the prisoner and the other servant, but found nothing—the officer found on the prisoner a duplicate, and we went to the pawnbroker's; and while we were gone the prisoner ran away—I owed her 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found this property at the pawnbroker's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 21st of November, I received information of this, and on the following day, I saw the prisoner in George-street, Chelsea, talking to her mother—I suspected she was the person, by the description of her dress—I said to her, "Your name is Underhill"—she said, "No, I do not know such a person"—I said, "You are the daughter of Mrs. Isaacs"—she said, "No"—I said, "You must go with me"—she resisted very much; but when she found I was resolute, she said she was the person, she had done the robbery, and she begged for mercy—I found the duplicate of a silk handkerchief in her pocket, with seven keys, and the duplicate of a brooch she had pawned that day.</p>

            . I was with Bertrand, and saw three young men going along, apparently drunk, I went forward, thinking they were going to strike him; I went up, the woman said, "he has got your watch;" the prisoner passed me - I saw something bright in his hand; he turned round and I followed him into Fleet-market; he said, what do you want of me? I took him back, and gave him in charge-it appeared a complete hustle. The three brushed by him, and the prisoner is the man who was against his breast.</p>

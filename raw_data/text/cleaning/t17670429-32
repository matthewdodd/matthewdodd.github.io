            . Going by the prosecutor's shop, I saw two lads run out of the shop; I called, and Mr. Thompson came out; he missed the cannisters. We went down the street, he one way and I the other; I met the prisoner; I clapped my hand upon him and said, I believe you are one of the lads that robbed Mr. Thompson of some tea. I felt about him, and found the cannister under his coat; Mr. Thompson came and took it of me. (Produced and deposed to by a mark under it, which the prosecutor put on it when the exciseman took it last.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Pearce. I met the last witness; he told me what he was after, and desired me to assist. (The rest as Toler had deposed.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never was guilty of such a thing in my life. I was brought in by seeing two or three lads in Whitechapel; they got me to drink with them, and they gave me the cannister.</p>
               <p>Q. to Toler. Do you know whether the prisoner is one of the boys that came out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Toler. I am not sure of that. When I stopped him, and told him he was one of the lads that robbed Mr. Thompson, he said it was two boys that are gone that way, pointing; I looked, but saw no boys.</p>
               <p>Pearce. After Mr. Thompson had taken the cannister, the prisoner said, God bless me, I kicked it before me.</p>

             picked me up again, and carried me into the shed, from the dust-hole, where the others were; then John Taylor came up to me, put his two hands round my month, and his two knees against my shoulders - Flood asked somebody who stood round the pailing to lend him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120096"></xptr>a knife; one was handed round into the shed to him - I could not see by whom, but I saw it was a white-handled penknife.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You must have got rid of 5s. out of the sovereign? A. I paid for eight pots of beer for them - I gave the landlord the sovereign, and he took for the eight pots; I cannot tell how much it came to, as I am no scholar - I was quite sober all the time - the waiter was in the house; I was carried into the skittle-ground against my will - I called out to the waiter; he did not hear me - I was crying as loud as I could all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the waiter? A. After I was in the shed. I was laying down in the shed- I have been a sailor about two years, and have been round the Isle of France; I was a sailor in 1830 - this is the first time I have been in a Court of Justice; I was never here before in my life - I was in the other Court about twelve months ago, accused of stealing some hay; I had fetched it for a man who had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. You forgot all that when you swore you never was in a Court of Justice? A. I did not rightly know what a Court of Justice was - I am sure that was the only time; I lived once with a gentleman named Tuck; I did not go from his service to the House of Correction - I was put there for climbing over a hedge; it was for breaking the hedge down.</p>
               <p>Q. And taking some wood, I believe? A. No, I had none of the wood - I was with the party that had it, at least I was in one field, and they in the other; I was in the House of Correction two months on that charge - that is the only time I was ever in trouble; I was not in the House of Correction three weeks for stealing potatoes - I have told all the trouble I have been in; I was cast away in the North Seas, and shipwrecked; I was acquitted on the charge about the hay; the jumping over the hedge was twelve months before that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure you were sober when you went before the Justice? A. Yes; that was on the evening it happened - I changed the sovereign to lend

            , ESQ. I am a Magistrate, and live at Edmonton. On the evening of the 9th of April the prosecutor came to my house - I think it was about six o'clock; he was sober then.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUGHES. I am a pork-butcher, and live at Edmonton. I was at the Three Tons on the 9th of April, about half-past four o'clock; I saw the prisoners there, and saw the prosecutor there - I saw Taylor, Budd, two Sawyers, and Flood there; Grimes was laying on the ground in the shed of the skittle-ground (I do not think he was drunk), and Taylor had his hands over his mouth - Flood was cutting off part of his waistband and the pocket; they got it off; Sawyer did not interfere at that time - when they had cut off the pocket they both walked away; Grimes got up, said he was robbed, and they all walked out of the yard - I followed them, and Grimes followed me- Budd was sitting on a form in the skittle-ground at the time they were cutting the pocket off; it was done with a white-handled knife.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If Grimes has sworn that when Flood was cutting off the pocket, Budd was holding it out for him, is there a single word of truth in it? A. Budd was not there then - he had nothing to do with cutting the pocket; I should suppose he was nearly twenty yards from Flood at that time - I was sober- I went there, as Gapps' son was going in, and called me to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How many persons were in the skittle-ground besides these men? A. I saw nobody besides Gapps' son and the prisoners - we were not looking on; Gapps' son went to the shed to look for the ball, and could not find it - I went to look for it then, and saw this happen; my mind was not directed to a robbery at first - I never saw men lark in that way; Grimes was on the ground, he was not asleep - I do not think he was tipsy; I will not swear he was sober - I heard him say he was robbed; he did not appear to have been drinking, I am no particular judge of a drunken man - he walked out of the yard very straight.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK SMITH. I am pot-boy at the Three Tons, On the 9th of April Grimes was at the house; I saw

             in the skittle-ground, also Taylor and Budd I saw William Sawyer go to Grimes, pull out his knife, and attempt to cut off his pocket with the knife; I did not see Taylor do any thing, but he was in the place - I did not see Budd, only in the skittle-ground; I saw the waistband about an hour after it was cut off - I was not present when it was cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose, like an honest man, you went instantly for a Policeman? A. No. I thought it was a mere lark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Where did you see the pocket? A. I saw it picked up down in the skittle-ground - there was no money in it then; one of our little girls picked it up.</p>

On the 9th of April, between six and seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120097"></xptr>o'clock, I saw the prisoner Taylor in front of my father's house, which is between the Three Tuns and the White Horse - he was following Grimes; he was with Grimes - they appeared to be both together, in company - I could not hear what passed; I saw Taylor strike him a blow in the face, and then William Sawyer came up - I saw him(

            ) trip up his heels, and throw him on the ground; Grimes got up, and came up to me - I was asking the reason of the disturbance, when my father came up, and by our advice he went to Mr. Mores - I should say he was sober when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Whether they were quarrelling or larking you cannot say? A. It did not appear a lark - he appeared perfectly sober when he came to me, and quite overcome with grief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. So sober, it must be impossible but he could tell whether a man was twenty yards from him, or cutting his pocket? A. I know nothing of that - he gave me a very good description of the manner he was robbed; I saw nothing of Budd.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WICKS. I belong to Latimer's charity. On the 9th of April I was at Edmonton - I know William and Thomas Sawyer, Taylor, Flood and Budd; between six and seven o'clock that evening I saw all those persons in Water-lane, Edmonton, about a quarter of a mile from the Three Tuns - I saw them dividing something; I could not see what it was - I heard nothing; I heard some money sound while they were dividing it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been at school? A. Five years - I was between twenty and thirty yards of the men; I could hear it sound - it was silver; I can tell the jink of silver.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you speak accurately as to distance, or to the best of your belief? A. To the best of my belief; I am not much of a judge of distance.</p>
               <p>Sawyer's Defence. I was at the Three Tuns - Grimes came in very much intoxicated, all over mad and dirt; he called for a pot of beer, and asked me for my brother Thomas, who was sent for - they sat drinking together, and I know nothing more.</p>

I was at the Three Tans, between ten and eleven o'clock that morning, when Grimes came and called for a pot of beer, and asked me to drink; then he asked William Sawyer for Thomas, who was fetched from home - they sat drinking there till between twelve and one o'clock; I went out of the house, and never saw him any more.</p>

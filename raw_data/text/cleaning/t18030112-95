             sworn. - I live next door to Mr. Carey, and Thompson lodged with me: One morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw him standing upon some rasters in my yard, by which he could get into Mr. Carey's lost; there had been a chamber there, but the boards were off. I asked him what business he had there; and he said he was getting a bit of dry wood. I never knew any thing amiss of him before.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden, and examined the premises belonging to Mr. Carey, where I saw, that by pulling one of the boards up, which swung like a swinging partition, a man could get into the lost from the rasters; that afternoon I also searched Bentley's shop, which is an old and new shoe-shop, in Dorrington-street, near Brook's-market, and found four pair of shoes in the window, for sale, which Mr. Carey owned; I asked Bentley how he came by them; he paused some time before he could recollect the description of the man he bought them of; at last he said he bought them of a mulatto man, to whom he paid one pound and sixpence, for five pair, near three months before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH WHEELER sworn. - I am servant to the prisoner, Bentley: About two or three months ago, Thompson came to sell five pair of shoes, of which these four pair are part; he asked if Mr. Bentley would buy five pair of shoes, that he need not be afraid of buying them, for that he had been on board a ship two years, and could not get any money of the purser, but he let him have the shoes to make money of; then Bentley gave him one pound and sixpence, which he said he knew to be the full value of them, and said, he hoped Thompson came honestly by them; I saw him afterwards sell a pair for four shillings and sixpence, so he got four-pence three farthings by that pair. (The shoes produced, and identified).</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence. I was going to work, and found five pair of shoes in the place where I used to get a bit of dry wood, I picked them up, and sold them to Bentley. As for going into Carey's shop, I did not know which way.</p>
               <p>Bentley's defence. This man offered me the shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120064"></xptr>for four shillings and sixpence a pair; I said I would give him four shillings; he was going out of the door, and I offered him sixpence more, which he took; and I immediately put them in the window for sale, not knowing they were stolen.</p>

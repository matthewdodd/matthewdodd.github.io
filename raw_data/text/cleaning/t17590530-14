            . About two months or nine weeks ago, or thereabouts, the two prisoners, Guest, Mason, and I, met at the London Factory, and went to the house the prosecutor has mentioned, and broke it open with a chissel and pinchers, which we carried with us; and we took out four or five chairs with cane bottoms and backs to them, a stove, a fender, a pair of tongs, and a wooden shovel, and some crockery ware.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>

               <p>Q. Had Henfield ever received any goods of you before this?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; he knew a great many things were stolen that he receiv'd, and had talk'd with me about things we had stole several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry them at night or in the day?</p>
               <p>Child. We kept them in my cellar 'till they were sold, and they went altogether by day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Henfield know of your going off?</p>
               <p>Child. He did; he was one that advised me to go off about Stepney church affair.</p>

               <p>Child. No, I do not; I remember Henfield offer'd me thirty-seven pounds, before I went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hemsworth, and another person, coming after you, in order to take you and Guest, at a house in Field-lane?</p>
               <p>Child. No, I never came to Field-lane; it was to Clerkenwell; Hemsworth came himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to you for?</p>
               <p>Child. He came to me, and said; whatever you do, get off; for if you do not, we shall come into bad bread; for they have found the lead; and if you get off, they will make it up cass.</p>

            . I was sent for by the evidence Child, to fetch Mr Henfield, or any other broker, to buy his goods: I being acquainted with Mr Henfield, went and fech'd him; and he bought the goods of Mr Child; and they remain'd at Child's house, from the twenty-seventh of March, 'till Easter-Monday: in that time, Mrs Child was to have had the goods again, in order to let the rooms out in ready-furnish'd lodgings: but when Mr Child was taken at Stafford, and in goal, he sent for her to come down, and also to bring some money: Henfield had paid 6 l. and was to give fourteen; she wanted the money, and was forc'd to part with the goods; so he paid her the remainder.</p>

            . Yes, I did; that was on Easter-Monday, at night; the goods were fetch'd away that same day; he advis'd Henfield and me, and said, he would put us in a way that we should act with safety: for his having paid the woman part of the money before, for the goods, he paid the rest of the money on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards; but the Justice order'd him not to pay her; I imagin'd he thought he had bought them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Henfield know that Child was a thief?</p>
               <p>Tasker. No, I do not know that he did; there was a report of some mahogany being stole, and sold; that was the reason that Henfield ask'd advice of the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to bring Henfield to buy the goods?</p>
               <p>Tasker. Child himself did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did Child follow?</p>
               <p>Tasker. In Field-lane, he follow'd the business of a Broker; but these goods were his own houshold-furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the goods distrain'd for rent?</p>
               <p>Tasker. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom?</p>
               <p>Tasker. By Whitton, in the house of Child.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Child, when his goods were distrain'd ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He was then in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sending for Henfield to buy these goods, before or after the distraining?</p>
               <p>Tasker. It was before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know one Mr Blake?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I do; he was landlord of the house where he then lived; he collected rents f Mr Cheslyn: I believe Child had been in the house about three weeks or a month before this happen'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was due for rent ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. There were 2 l. due for rent: Mr Henfield paid it to Mr Blake; there was an order to pay the rent, before the goods could be taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the money paid?</p>
               <p>Tasker. To the best of my knowledge, was on Easter-Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any particular order to keep it a secret?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I was to go to Mr Henfield, or any body else: I said, as Mr Henfield is one of your acquaintance, he might come to you; which he did, and took an inventory of the things; and there were two receipts given by them both to Henfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Both who?</p>
               <p>Tasker. From Guest and Child; each had one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Child any earnest?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I believe he had a shilling earnest; and Guest's goods were fetch'd away the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did Guest sell?</p>
               <p>Tasker. His goods in his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw, did it appear to you that Henfield was buying goods, that he knew to be stolen?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300023"></xptr>Tasker. No, I did not think he did; because he had ask'd Child if the goods were honestly come by? and he said they were: Child came to me on a Saturday night, and said he dare not go home; for he and Guest had bought some lead, and he was afraid it was stolen; and that the Plumber's man had seen a man with a paper in his hand; and they suspected something, and went away instead of going to a publick house where they were going: and then it was that he sent for Henfield to sell his goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell Henfield that ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He did, he told him the same story he told me; I thought he had bought the lead as he had said.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say Guest and he bought it of?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He said, they bought it of two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the Plumber's man advis'd him to run away?</p>
               <p>Tasker. No, he did not; he said Guest and he had been asking about for the two men; and if they could not find them, they must be tried themselves.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of these goods, no more than your Lordship does.</p>
               <p>Mason's defence.</p>
               <p>I had no manner of concern in it; neither was I ever seen in Child's company, any where whatsoever: I ask'd him before the justice, wherever I was in his company; he could name no house; at last he named a little house in Holy-Well-lane; but I never was in that house with him.</p>

             to buy Child's and Guest's goods, to a publick house in Whitechapel; there sat Child and Guest: said Child, I am going to sea: What is the matter, said I? said he, I have bought some lead of two men that are rope-makers, and I am afraid it is stolen: I said, I wonder you will meddle with lead; said he, we have been hunting about after them, and cannot find them: I ask'd him who he sold it to? he said, to a Plumber in Bishopsgate-street; and they were going in at a publick house to drink, at the next door; and they saw a man with a piece of paper in his hand, and they went away, and would not go into the house: that is all I know of the matter.

               <p>Coker. I know nothing more against them, more than what I have heard from Child the evidence; only I have Guest's receipt for them to Willoby. Mr Fielding sent for me, to know of me, whether I had lost some wainscot boards. I had miss'd them about a month before. The justice told me the case which he had had from Child, and desir'd me to go to Willoby's. I went, and his workmen were at work upon my boards. I ask'd him where he had them boards; he said, he bought them of one

               <p>Coker. I never heard him say he did.</p>
               <p>Guest. I sign'd that receipt.</p>
               <p>Coker. We brought Willoby before justice Fielding, and he bound me over to prosecute. I went to the person that I bought my wainscot of; he went with me to see them: he was as clear as could be that they were my boards.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had they upon them?</p>
               <p>Coker. They had R H</p>
               <p>Q. Where about in Willoby's yard did you find them?</p>
               <p>Coker. They lay backwards in his warehouse. There were no other boards when I went first but my own; and when I went to fetch them away in the evening, he had been and bought a parcel of such sort, and put them amongst mine, and put me to some difficulty to find them, they being six feet inch and half boards; and they were plaining their boards over; and put me to destance to know which was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he plain them ?</p>
               <p>Coker. All mine had red marks on them, done by the merchant in Holland. Willoby came at ten at night, and brought a man along with him, and said, he could make greater discovery with regard to the loss of my things.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men had he at work?</p>
               <p>Coker. He had three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention the words he said, as near as you can recollect.</p>
               <p>Coker. He came to my door, and said, he would be glad to speak to me; and said, I can make some discovery with respect to your yard being robb'd. I said, go to justice Fielding, for I have nothing to say. In the receipt which he told me, he himself wrote, he says, received of Moses Willoby 3 l. 8 s. for wainscot and deal boards.</p>
               <p>W. Terrett. I went to Willoby's house, to see if these boards appear'd to be the property of the prosecutor. I examin'd them, and they appear'd most clearly to have been my property. I can't take upon me to say, they are the very boards that I sold him. I know I sold him such, and I have great reason to think they are the same.</p>

            , and myself, took away them wainscot boards from the gentleman's timber-yard, near Wood's Close, about two months ago; I can't justly tell the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you take away?</p>
               <p>Child. We took away upwards of sixty.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day or night?</p>
               <p>Child. At night.</p>
               <p>Q. At how many times?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300026"></xptr>Child. In two nights; one night we had done about four in the morning, the other time about two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry them to?</p>
               <p>Child. To an old house; after that they were sold to Mr Willoby, and carried to his house in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you carry them to the old house?</p>
               <p>Child. On our backs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that old house?</p>
               <p>Child. It is on Clerkenwell-Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Willoby first see them?</p>
               <p>Child. He first saw them in that old house; then it was uninhabited.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Willoby know how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Child. I can't remember that he did; but he knew how we came by several parcels that we had sold him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Carpenter?</p>
               <p>Child. No; I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Guest ever any great stock of boards?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said before Willoby, from whence they were taken ?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he had of you before?</p>
               <p>Child. He had had deals of us before.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these wainscot boards sold to him for?</p>
               <p>Child. For three pounds odd money: Mr Guest gave the receipt for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sign it?</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutors. Did Willoby say where he bought these boards?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he bought them in an empty house, and pretended to find it, but went up one way and down another, and would not find it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day were they carried to Willoby's house?</p>
               <p>Child. It was by day-light in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>
               <p>These boards were three weeks in Child's own yard before I laid my finger on them: I believe he had four or five cart loads in his yard: he said, he did not know what to do with them, he believed they would be wet, and was afraid they would be spoiled; and he said, let me put them into your old house in Cow-cross, and I'll pay half the rent. I was going to dinner, I carried one load; they were all carried there into the old house by day-light; after that he came to my house in Bartholomew Close and said, his mind was changed, I wish you would sell them for me, and I'll satisfy you for your trouble; I went to Shoreditch and brought Mr Henfield up; I ask'd, and Mr Henfield bid; I look'd to Child and Child look'd angry at me, saying, he would not let them go for that money; but wish'd I would go to Mr Willoby, for I do not like to deal with that rogue, he said, meaning Henfield, Willoby will give you more than he will. I went on Willoby, and told him there were a few wainscot boards in such a place; he said, he would come and look at them; I do not think he came in two or three days. At last he called at my house; I bargain'd with him for them likewise; I hired a cart in Smithfield, and took them to his house in open day-light; there were forty of them all but one; he paid me for them; there were twenty-six wainscot, and thirteen or fourteen deal; he gave me three pounds eight shillings for them, which was about the honest market-price; I brought the money to my own house, and paid it down to Child, and he gave me two shillings for my trouble; Child and Hill a Carpenter, carried them to that house; Hill lives on Saffron-Hill; Child has been a rogue all his life-time; he is a thief and a robber, all the world can tell that; he told me he had a very large estate in the Isle of Wight; I would have gone through fire and water to have serv'd him. If any man in court can give me a bad name let him speak it boldly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300027"></xptr>Mason's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know no more of it than the child unborn; I never was concerned with Child, or ever seen in his company.</p>
               <p>Willoby's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have sufficient evidence to prove I never bought them in hugger-mugger, but afterwards put them in publick view; they lay about a month in the open yard, close up to the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What are these boards worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave two shillings and one penny a piece for them: I lost between sixty and seventy; Mr Willoby produced this receipt, and said, he bought a great parcel of deal boards of Guest; I ask'd him how he could think them honestly come by out of an empty house, of a poor journeyman frame maker; I ask'd him also, whether he had such a receipt from every timber yard where he dealt; he made me no sort of answer, but said, he did not like it at the time he bought them; and he believed Guest was a rogue, or something like it.</p>

            . I have work'd for Mr Willoby about ten months; he has about five journeymen; I remember the wainscot was brought in about two o'clock at noon in an open cart, and placed on each side the gate, not a yard from the street, and we did not work up any or remove them 'till about a month or two or better after; we had no order to conceal them, nor no such attempts made; we work'd up some of them, and removed them into the dry place, fearing the wet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Willoby?</p>
               <p>Plowman. I have known him about two years; he always bore a good character; he carries on business publick as other people do, and has a great trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at work when Mr Coker came to see the boards ?</p>
               <p>Plowman. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they lie then?</p>
               <p>Plowman. Some were working up, and some were lying by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come a second time?</p>
               <p>Plowman. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they lying then?</p>
               <p>Plowman. In the same manner as before, when he came first.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there none mixed among them?</p>
               <p>Plowman. No, there were not, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Are you sure there had been an alteration betwixt the first and second time of your seeing them there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There had; some of them were moved from where I first saw them, and other boards of the same sort put amongst them, and the men plaining them over; Willoby said, they were boards that he bought of a man in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Plowman. There were none at all mix'd with them; Mr Coker said, they should not be touch'd, and they were not touch'd nor stirr'd 'till he came again; but when he found we were planing the other boards, he said, you rogues you ought to be taken up for plaining my boards, all these boards are mine; when the others had been come in not above two hours.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were plaining their own boards, and mixed some of them with mine in order to puzzle me, and make me swear to some that were not my own.</p>

            . I work with Mr Willoby; I remember these wainscot boards that Mr Coker challenged; I handed them out of a cart, and up to the gable end of the house; they were brought about two o'clock in the afternoon, and placed on both sides the gate, and remained there several days. We removed them because of the wet weather coming on; I remember Mr Coker pitching upon some of them; there was no other oak along with them, and the second time of his coming there were none mixed with them; the other boards came from Shoreditch; I went and brought some of them home.</p>

            . I am a Plumber: on the twenty-third of March last, I was sent for to the shop of Mrs Smith in Bishopsgate-street; by order of Mr Alderman Cokayne; he told me Stepney Church had been robb'd; and desir'd me to look at that lead, and give him my opinion of it: I saw it, and said, it certainly came from off a flat place; I measur'd and weigh'd it; there was eleven-hundred, one quarter, and eleven pounds of it; twenty-eight pieces in all. Then I went to the Church and measur'd there; and took a remarkable piece to compare; I found it of the same thickness with that on the Church; there was one spike in it, and holes where four had been; I found where it was taken from, and observed the spike in the lead exactly fitted to a hole in the timber; and the four holes answered to four holes in the rasters; I compared one of the small nails, that I took out of Mrs Smith's shop, with one remaining on the Church, and they answered exactly in size, shape, and demension; I observ'd a spike-nail remaining on the Church, which had not been drawn when the lead was taken up; it tallied with the lead when we came to put it on, as well as two indentures could; there was no room to doubt, but that the lead came from that place.</p>

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that lead?</p>
               <p>Walker. If it had been brought and offer'd to me, and honestly came by; I should have given 13 s. per hundred for it, as old lead to melt down; I had given more than that, at that time.</p>
               <p>Counsel. We have now prov'd the lead found in Mrs Smith's house, was the lead taken from off the church at Stepney: we will next mention a circumstance of finding tools and mussatees on the Church; and the prisoners meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Hammel. What did you find on the Church?</p>
               <p>Hammel. I found this rope hanging on the Church, (producing one) and this knife upon the Church; ( producing a case knife, which had the blade doubled back, proper for cutting; or as by a drawing, will plough a gutter in ) I found also this mitten (producing a knit glove ); these I found the next morning after it was robb'd.</p>

             came to me about a week before it was taken off, and desired me to take a walk with him to Stepney, saying, he had seen something that he thought would answer; we went there to a publick house, and drank pretty freely of twopenny and beer, about two hundred yards from the church. I was not agreeable to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was mentioned?</p>
               <p>Child. It was to take the lead from the church. We left a shilling to bind us to come again, and take a dinner; so to take a better view of the place the first fine day. They would not get a dinner for us if we had not left that. In two or three days after we went again?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest, and his two women; that is, his wife, and another woman; she lives in his house, and is big with child by him. There was also my wife and Mrs Gillingham; she is a Broker's wife on Clerkenwell-Green. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300030"></xptr> had a dinner there. The women did not know our business; they went only for pleasure.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner?</p>
               <p>Child. We had some pork. After we went into the church-yard all of us; we walk'd round, and took a view of the church: when we came at the back-part of the church Guest toss'd up a stone upon the church, and said, he wanted to know whether the lead was found; which Mrs Gillingham took notice of, and got some wind of it. In a day or two after that, all sides were agreed. Guest lived in my neighbourhood, within about three or four hundred yards of me; Henfield and Mason lived at a distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever talk'd to either of them about taking this lead?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; it was talk'd of, and agreed to by all. I met Guest and Mason at Henfield's house. Henfield was there also. There was only the maid-servant at home besides; but she heard nothing of what we talk'd about.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of the conversation.</p>
               <p>Child. We appointed to meet in Stepney church-yard, and fix'd upon the time, which, I think, was the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were to meet?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest, Henfield, a servant of Mrs Smith's, Mason, and me; but Henfield was not to come 'till three o'clock in the morning, and we were to be there by between nine and ten at night. We were to get a ladder, and get upon the church, and get as much lead as we could 'till it came to grow light; and Henfield was to come to us by three in the morning, to help us as much as possible in carrying it away, it being a hard job. We had agreed this at Henfield's house, to carry and bury it in a dunghill (about a quarter of a mile from the church,) 'till such time as we could get it away to Mrs Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any conversation with Mrs Smith about it at that time?</p>
               <p>Child. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of Mrs Smith's servant?</p>
               <p>Child. I do not know. Guest and I went there together first, and I got a ladder. Mason and Mrs Smith's servant came at the time. We set the ladder, and

            , Mrs Smith's servant, and I, went upon the church, Mason stay'd below to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the ladder ?</p>
               <p>Child. I got it at a new building. We had this knife, that is here produc'd, and another knife, a pair of pincers, and a chissel. This knife that is here was made by Mrs Smith's servant; but it did not do well, so we throw'd it by.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the other knife, chissel, and pincers.</p>
               <p>Child. Guest did. I had another knife in my pocket, which I used.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead do you think you took away?</p>
               <p>Child. I did not think it to be so much as it prov'd to be: I took it to be about a thousand weight.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you let it down.</p>
               <p>Child. There was but one piece tried to be let down by that rope; all the other pieces where toss'd down; it was soft ground, and the fall made no great noise. Guest had on a pair of mittens; that is, knit gloves, and a pair of green mussatees.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this mitten here produc'd.</p>
               <p>Child. He takes it in his hand. This is one of Guest's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these green mussatees. He takes them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Child. These are the same he had on.</p>
               <p>Mr Darking. I found this odd mitten, and these mussatees, on the top of the church, the day after it was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Henfield as good as his word.</p>
               <p>Child. He was. He came about three in the morning. We had then just got the lead down, and begun to carry it away to the dunghill; and Henfield assisted us in carrying it away, where we covered it over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Child. It was star-light; we had no lanthorn; we had finished when the people were going a milking, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the lead lie in the dunghill ?</p>
               <p>Child. It lay there two days and one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you all come home?</p>
               <p>Child. We all parted as soon as we came into the road, and went to our homes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the next meeting?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300031"></xptr>Child. That was at Henfield's house, the same day, in the afternoon Guest and I call'd there; (Mason was not there ) Guest and I went to the dunghill, to see that it was cover'd safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was I the taking it away from the dunghill ?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest and I got a cart in Old-street; and we went and fetch'd it into Bishopsgate-street to Mrs Smith's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the ladder afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Child. We took that away, and carried it within about twenty yards from the place where we had it; and some people were coming down the road, so we laid it down and left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the lead carried to Mrs Smith's ?</p>
               <p>Child. We got there about seven in the morning with it. She paid me for it, and I gave her a receipt. The money she gave me was five 27 s. pieces. The receipt was for 6 l. 15. and I carried the money to Henfield, as was agreed upon before, and there it was divided by him. He made the charges out, and when they were paid we had about 24 s. each; that is, Henfield, Guest, Mrs Smith's servant, Mason, and me. I had 6 s. 6 d. to pay for the horses and the cart, and the rest was all spent, 8 s. 6 d. I believe. The rope we tied to an iron bar in the window of the church to get down by, and the last person that came down could not untie that, so we left it hanging: that was

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the first time you were examined before Mr Fielding you did not say, that Henfield and Mrs Smith's servant went out in the afternoon, the day before the lead was sold, to show you where the lead was hid.</p>
               <p>Child. I was ordered what to say. I would never have told the truth; I would sooner have died, had I not been told by Henfield's brother, they were striving every way to throw it upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Plumber's man one in the consultation about going?</p>
               <p>Child. He was one in the consulting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your ever give any account that you bought this lead of some rope-makers.</p>
               <p>Child. No; we did agree if it should be blow'd to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you divide the money?</p>
               <p>Child. I can't say the day: I think it was on a Friday. It was the same day that we brought it to Mrs Smith's.</p>
               <p>Mr Hammel. I remember Henfield's being apprehended; I can't tell the day of the month, I think he was before Child was brought from the country, and Mason's son was apprehended instead of the father, we at that time did not know there were two Masons father and son; when we came before Justice Fielding, young Mason declared his innocence, (he and Henfield were brought there together) the Justice was going to commit young Mason for farther examination; Henfield desired to be heard, saying he had something to say by himself; when the room was cleared of the common people, Henfield said, they had taken the wrong person; let it turn how it will, the suddle ought to lie on the right horse, for that it was not young Mason, but

            , the father of him. I and two others that are here were by and heard this. We endeavoured directly to get the father, and he was taken and brought in about a couple of hours. After he came into the room I went up to Henfield, and thank'd him, for leading us out of the mistake. I ask'd him, if he could say any more; he said he could, and he would, and seem'd willing then; but the next morning he would not say any thing.</p>

            . I live upon Saffron-Hill; I am a Weaver; I dined with Guest and Child, on the twelfth of February, at the sign of the Cherry-Tree at Stepney, on the Green; it was agreed upon before to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company?</p>
               <p>Taskr. There was Guest's landlord, I think his name is Ashbourn; Guest and his wife, Mrs Gillingham, myself, Child and his wife, and another woman that belong'd to Guest; she was big with child by him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. We had pork, part boil'd, and part roasted; after dinner, we took a walk into the church-yard; in walking round among the tombs, Guest threw up a stone upon the church; I heard him say, let us see if the lead is found; or words to that effect; there came a person out and said, Don't throw up stones to break the windows, for you will not be willing to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mason?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I never saw him, 'till I saw him in Westminster Gate-house; I have heard Child speak of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation between Child and you in March.</p>
               <p>Tasker. I was in bed, he came to me on the twenty-fourth of March, between eleven and twelve at night: I said, what makes you be here at this time of night ? he said, because I dare not go home; I said, what is the reason of that? he said, there was some lead that he and Guest had bought the day before, and he imagin'd it was stolen: I ask'd him how he came to know it was stolen? he said, the Plumber came and said, Mr Child, was there not two shillings betwixt my wife and you, about the lead? he ask'd him to go and drink together at the next house, and he would go before and call for the beer? and he imagin'd they had an officer in the publick house to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say this was ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He said it was in Bi shopsgate-street; he said he saw a man at the door with a paper in his hand; and they set off, one, one way, and the other the other way, and would not go into the house: he told me he bought the lead of two men that appear'd to be Rope-makers; for they had hemp about their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>
               <p>I'll tell the whole truth; I was at work at Child's house; I cannot tell the day of the month; as I was going away, about three in the afternoon; said he, I wish you would go along with me to-morrow morning; I have bought some lead as far off as Stepney, and I shall want a hand to help to get it home: said I, I will go with you with all my heart: said he, we may as well step to Old-street, to see if we can get a horse and cart; I believe I must have two horses: when he came there; said the man, so you may, but you must pay more money; said Child, I shall not stick for trifles; said he, I shall want them between two and three to-morrow morning; and if I shall not want them at that time, I'll send this man to forbid it: he call'd me at three the next morning out of my bed; and said, it was half an hour past two; I got up, we went to Old-street; and it was a quarter past three before we had the horses and cart ready: we went to a dunghill in Whitechapel; and got the lead; he told me he had it from an old house belonging to a decay'd gentleman in Stepney; and that it was carried there by two Rope-makers for him; we were seen by some Bricklayers that were going to work; we loaded it and carried it to Bishopsgate-street; and he gave me three shillings for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Henfields's Defence.</p>
               <p>I beg you would ask Child what time of the day it was, that he declar'd he paid me and others?</p>
               <p>Child, to the question. I cannot tell the day of the month; it was on the same day that we brought the lead to Mrs Smith's, in the afternoon; I deliver'd the money to Henfield as I went by with the cart about eight o'clock; ( the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300033"></xptr> lead was sold about seven); and it was not divided 'till the afternoon on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. from Henfield. What time did you meet in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Child. I cannot justly say; it was betwixt one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; this is the receipt ( he takes it in his hand) that I gave Mrs Smith: It is read to this purport.</p>

            . I have known Henfield six years: I had a suit in the Marshalsea-Court, which was tried on the 23d of March, being a Friday, he was at my trial there; he went over there, I believe about nine o'clock, and staid in my company 'till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Sibery. I live in Shoreditch: I keep a house there, and am a Butcher; we din'd at the Bull in the Borough after the trial was over.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you dine?</p>
               <p>Sibery. It may be between four and five when we had din'd; then we went to a house over against my house, and he never was out of our company for a quarter of an hour together, 'till ten: he is a very honest endeavouring man; I have bought and sold to him, and never found a farthing amiss; I went also to Mason's house that morning, and desired him to come to my trial; he went with me and din'd with me, and staid with us 'till past dinner-time; he bears a very good character.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said he had the trial with one Davis; that Davis was plaintiff; that it was occasioned by his indulging Davis at Hicks's-Hall for robbing him, and that bill was not found; so Davis brought that against him; that Mr Wilson was his attorney, and Mr Taylor Davis's; that neither Mason nor Henfield were examined on the trial; that he got his cause, and Davis got out of court and ran away.

            . I was servant to Mr Henfield for about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there on the 16th of March last?</p>
               <p>Mills. I was, there was no other servant besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose business was it to shut up the house?</p>
               <p>Mills. That was my master's business.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to bed last?</p>
               <p>Mills. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your master being out any night you was there?</p>
               <p>Mills. No, I do not: he never was out one night while I was there; he keeps constantly with his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his going to the Marshalsea-Court on a trial?</p>
               <p>Mills. I do, it was on the 23d of March; I had been there just a week then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Child at Mr Henfield's house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300034"></xptr>Mills. No, he never was there: I never saw him in my life 'till this day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attended the shop?</p>
               <p>Mills. I did: master taught me: he staid at home the first week in order to teach me.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination she said, the key was left in the lock of the street-door on nights; that she lay near the door, and nobody could go in nor out without her hearing them; and in the day-time nobody could come into the shop but she must see them, her business being there.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Joseph Barnes, and live at Walworth. On Thursday evening, the 13th of July, I was in the Walworth-road, at nearly eleven o'clock—I passed up to Walworth-terrace—the place was quite clear, there was no one before me—all at once two men came from behind and prevented my walking on—one kept before me and kept looking in my face, the other was by my side—I had my hand on my pocket, and presently my shawl got off—one of the men looking very impudently in my face caused me to look towards the terrace—if I went one way to avoid them, they went the same way—the prisoner is not the one who looked in my face, he kept close at my side, and the other just before me—in a moment I was left quite by myself—I put my hand into my pocket, and my purse was gone—I had but a few moments before been speaking to Mr. Tarry, and given him a little order—I had my purse then—I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that was there—he had a dark coat on, either black or blue—I lost this check, a sovereign, a half-crown, and my purse—I went the next morning to the Bank to stop the check, and saw the prisoner there—I was there from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, waiting in an inner room—as soon as the check was presented, a gentleman brought it to me—I said it was mine—that was exactly nine o'clock, the moment the Bank opened.</p>

I know the prisoner—I believe he keeps a coffee-house in Waterloo-road—on the evening of the 13th of July he came to my house from twenty minutes to a quarter to ten o'clock—I would not be positive to five minutes—he had a bucket with him, and asked me if I would give him a bucket of water—I told him to go behind and fetch it—he used to come and fetch water from my house occasionally, when he was short of water—I have kept this beer-shop ever since the 5th if April—I told him he might fetch the water—he</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Lyon-terrace, Edgeware-road, and am single. The prisoner came into my service on the 24th of May, and on Saturday morning, the 7th of June, about' half-past ten o'clock, she said she would leave, as the situation did not suit her—she was to leave in the evening, but absconded directly that morning—I examined my cash-box, which I keep in my bed-room, on the Thursday following, and missed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had ten 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes there—I saw them safe the first week she was with me, but not afterwards—the numbers were 34422, and the others were in rotation—I got the numbers from my agent who pays me—I swear I had ten notes—I fre<lb></lb>quently trusted the prisoner with a bunch of keys on which was the key of the cash-box—the keys on the hunch opened several cupboards—she had them two or three days before she left, and frequently was sent to a cupboard where things for the use of the kitchen were kept—the first time I tent her for my cash-box was to pay a bill—she brought it down—I took it into the front kitchen and opened it—she did not see me take the money out, but she knew it came from the box—I never gave her a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to change, or for any purpose.</p>

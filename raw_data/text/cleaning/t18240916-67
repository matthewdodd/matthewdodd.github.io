I asked what brought him there, and would he not cover himself with the hay; he said he was warm enough; he asked me what brought me there - I said I had leave to be there; he said I should not be there, and gave me a shove. He had been at work as a haymaker. Some men then came round the shed, who had been at a public-house, and made a great alarm. Linton went out to them; some persons then came in and dragged me from where I had been lying. Linton was one of them, and assisted in pulling me out; I saw him searching under me.

            . I am a labourer on Mr. Wilkinson's farm. On the night of the robbery this man came into the rick-yard and enquired if he could sleep there. I said he might sleep in the shed. I generally sleep upon a rick.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160028"></xptr>I went on the rick first, and then into the shed - I do not know for what reason. I did not steal his money, nor do I know when it was taken. I laid down by the side of Nash, and felt all over him to feel if he had any money; he awoke, and said</p>
               <p>"Who is here?" I appeared to be asleep, and he said</p>
               <p>"You had better lay some hay over you." I then got up and went to the yard, and saw Sanders; I said</p>
               <p>"Here is the Irishman," and then we went in, and I laid upon his feet and took hold of his hand, while Straw Joe (Sanders) tried to ram some hay into his mouth to prevent his crying out; and then the man in the glazed hat and Straw Joe searched his person, while I searched the hay; in the mean time Straw Joe struck him. Salmon was not then in the shed, he was outside. I then went out and met Salmon, and he went in and searched him, and I stood in the door-way - they came out; I went in, and Nash was enquiring for his coat; and as we were coming out Joe said to me</p>
               <p>"I have his money." We then agreed to go to Totteridge. I did not know what money was taken from Nash, but the half sovereign, the purse, and the buttons were given to me by Straw Joe. The buttons which were found on Salmon were those that Straw Joe gave me. I put them and the half sovereign into my pocket, and threw the purse into a pond. I do not know how the buttons came in Salmon's possession - I did not give them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Is this your first robbery - A. Yes, I went into the shed of my own accord, and fumbled about the man, but I did not take the money. I went there to sleep and to rob the man; I went to do both. I cannot tell whether these are the buttons or not; I think those I had were bigger.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Linton was the man who came in and laid by you. - A. Yes, he shammed sleep; when I came out of the shed I saw the prisoners near it, and to the best of my opinion they had been in it; Salmon struck me when I came out.</p>
               <p>SANDERS's Defence. What they have sworn is false - when I was coming down to the shed, Linton and another came out; I never saw the prosecutor, there were from twelve to twenty persons about the ricks and barns.</p>

             re-examined. I did not see the prisoners in the shed, but they were in the employ of the same master. I had seen them before that day among the rest. I had been working there some time, and had slept in the ricks or in a barn. I cannot tell what time of night it was. When I got out I went to a public-house at Whetstone, and enquired at the gate for a watchman, it might be between ten and eleven o'clock; it was not very dark; I could distinguish one man from another, there were a great many round the shed when I went away. I had been showing my money in the yard the day before. The shed had no door.</p>

I did not know who had stolen it. I ascertained I had lost it; I advertised the pocket-book, some suspicious persons were taken in custody, among them was this boy. Some of my articles were found on this boy. On the Monday following, Armstrong, the officer, took this boy in my presence, and carried him before Mr. Moser, the magistrate; there the boy acknowledged he had changed the five-pound note; he also acknowledged, he was the person that took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and that he was with the others; he told me where he laid out the five-pound note, and upon going to the place, I ascertained it was my property; it is here, and the pocket-book is here likewise. The prisoner said, he had taken the notes out of the pocket-book; he acknowledged that he himself, in company with one or two other boys, took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and when he had taken the notes out, he threw the pocket-book down a privy in Petticoat-lane. He said, that he had spent one five-pound note at Mr. Meadows's, a clothes-sale shop, in Houndsditch. He gave no account of the others. I have the pocket-book now in my possession. He shewed us the privy; in dragging the privy, the pocketbook was found. I can swear it is my property.</p>

               <p>MR. MASON. I am shopman to Mr. Meadows, 39, Houndsditch; he keeps a clothes-sale shop. On Saturday, the 12th of October, there were several boys came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Denham. What day was the 10th of September - A. On Saturday. I lost my pocket-book about twelve o'clock at noon.</p>

               <p>Mason. He came to our shop between four and five; they asked me whether I had got any clothes that would fit them; I asked them what sort of clothes they wanted; one of them said, a velveteen jacket, and trowsers; the waistcoat and a short coat the other boy had. There were four or five boys together; I believe the prisoner to be one of them; I think he is the boy that had the velveteen jacket and trowsers. After they had tried them on, they asked the price; I told them; they paid me. I took four pounds eight shillings for the two suits. I think one of the boys presented me with a ten-pound note, I cannot say which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a five-pound note - A. Not of the prisoner, I had not. Two or three boys came afterwards, they gave an order for a coat; they gave a five-pound note; this boy was not there then. I gave the ten-pound note to Mr. Meadows, my employer. I cannot say where it is now; the five-pound note was paid on the same day; the prisoner did not offer that, it was a boy a considerable deal bigger than him; there were three of them I think came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in company with them - A. I did not see him in company with these boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the boys the clothes - A. No; he had the clothes afterwards, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Mason, who was it that came to the shop, how many boys came into the shop - A. There were four or five I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say there were only two - A. I beg pardon, I have said, no such thing; there were four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you are about? You have said the prisoner ordered a velveteen jacket - A. The prisoner asked for a velveteen jacket and trowsers; that is all. The prisoner put them on in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come to - A. The two suits came to four pounds eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take for the boys suit - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said this boy's suit came to one-pound sixteen shillings - A. They were both paid together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, consider, whether he gave you a five-pound note, or a ten-pound note - A. I don't think he gave me a five-pound note; I cannot take upon me to say he gave me any money at all; I cannot tell who gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you have said, he gave you a five-pound note or a twenty-pound note - A. I do not recollect saying any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect whether he gave you a five pound note or a ten-pound note; you have said here a ten-pound note once? Have you seen the clothes again - A. I saw them at Worship-street, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know them; do not shuffle with me? you must know whether they were the things that you sold in your shop or not - A. Our shop when out of articles go and borrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was the prisoner the person that came into your shop - A. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he was; have you never sworn he was the boy - A. I swore that he was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260020"></xptr>the shop, and that he was the person that bought the velveteen jacket and trowsers; I have seen the boy once before; I see him now, and I saw him at Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>COURT. You upon your oath, don't know whether it was a five-pound note or a ten-pound note? You disgrace yourself very much.</p>

It was in the early part of the day; the prisoner was in the shop before I got change at the next door.</p>

            . On Monday, the 12th of September, Mr. Denham came to me; after I had heard what he had to say, in about an hours time; I went to Spread Eagle Court, in a room in that court, I found this velveteen jacket, trowses, and hat, with other clothes. I took posession of them clothes. and went to the office with them, and in half an hours time, the little boy, the prisoner was brought to me at the office, by a person of the name of Hareson, (who is now under confinement for an assault upon his wife) I locked the boy up; the boy said, sir, I will tell you all the truth; he then gave me to understand that he was in a market with a boy of the name of Denham; that Denham picked the gentleman's pocket of the pocket-book; he, the prisoner, being a little way off; and they both ran away together. I asked him whether he knew what Bank notes where; he said, no, he did not; but they had throwed the pocket-book with some of the papers down a privy, which he would shew me and the gentleman; we went that night to a privy, but not the right; the boy might very easy make a mistake; we dragged the privy; we did not find it; we dragged another privy, and found the pocket-book which the prosecutor knew to be his; with three sixteenths share of lottery tickets; we searched further for the two bills of exchange; we never could find them. I shewed the boy this velveteen jacket, and trowsers; he said, these are mine. Where did you buy them; he said, he would shew me and the gentleman; we went into Hounsditch with him, I holding him by the arm. I asked him what he gave for them going along; he said sixteen shillings. I said boy, how did you get the money; he said by holding gentleman's horses. I went into the shop, and shewed the boyes cloth's, and they had every reason, they said to believe they were the clothes that they sold. I then asked, with what they were paid for; I was answered, by master, or man, by a five pound note. Where is that Next door; I sent the gentleman with the change of the money there, and by that means I came into the possession of the five pound note. The prisoner was taken back to the office. and committed, I never have been able to get young Denham, yet he and young Knightly I the prisoner that was tried before this, and Griffiths, were all in company at the time of the robbery. The prisoner had a velveteen jacket, and trowsers on, which I took off him. These are them.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mason. Look at these things - A. These are the same, or like what I sold; I might have sold them, I cannot pretend they are my clothes or they not; because every shop that is out of an article, they can go and apply at the wholesale warehouse for the same article, and the next shop can go and get such an article with the same mark on them.</p>

I had a 10l. note in my fob; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060090"></xptr>changed it at the bar; the landlord wanted me to leave my money with him, but I would not; I got nine sovereigns, and 1l. in silver; I put the gold into my jacket pocket, where I had another sovereign, and the silver in another pocket. Lyons was sitting down on the seat, close to me; I then pulled off my jacket, and gave it to White to hold; I put my hat and box on the table - Lyons took it. I left the house (when I had done dancing) with a person named Archer, and the two prisoners; we went to a cook-shop, to have some victuals - the prisoners sat next to me, but I cannot say which of the two was nearest to me; I staid there a quarter of an hour: I felt Lyons put her hand into my jacket pocket, where the gold was, but cannot say she took it out at that time - I did not feel my pocket till after they were gone, and I had got out into the street again; I then found I had but 4s. 6d. left - they left me suddenly; after we got athwart the road, they hid me good night - nobody else was near me - I was not very drunk; I gave information at nine o'clock next morning - I have found my hat, but not my money.</p>

            . I take in needle-work, and live in Bluegate-fields, next door to the prisoners. I went into the Bull's Head public-house, with a friend, and saw the prosecutor come in - he had a new hat-box, which he gave Lyons to hold for him; he gave me his jacket to hold, and began dancing; in a few minutes Lyons came to me, and said "You have no business with that jacket;" I said,"Well, then, take it," which she did; she had then got the bat-box - I went away, and saw no more; the prisoners were sitting together. I did not see Lodge touch the jacket, or box, but they laid on the table before them - I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. McLeod applied to me on the morning of the 17th of November, and described the prisoners; I went with him to Ratcliff-highway, and he pointed out Lyons to me - I questioned her about the property; she said she knew nothing of it - I said she must go with me to find the other girl; we found Lodge, who also said she knew nothing of it; the Magistrate committed Lyons, and dismissed Lodge - I went away with her; she then took me to another public-house, where I found this hat and jacket.</p>

            . I keep the Hoop and Grapes public-house. Lodge came to me on the 16th of November, and told me to take care of this hat and jacket - Lyons was with her, but Lodge spoke.</p>
               <p>D. McLEOD re-examined. I am certain I had my money when I left the public-house - it could not have fallen out; I felt Lodge's hand near my pocket - it was in the jacket I have on - it was an upper jacket that I pulled off. I changed my note after I had done dancing, and came away directly - I knew Archer well - he did not take it.</p>

On the 24th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going into my office—I met the prisoner and another boy coming out of my counting-house with a box—I took the prisoner and the box—the other boy got away—the box contained these books, which are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said it was given him by a young woman to take to Mr. Bannister's—he had a butcher's apron on—there is a young woman in the house, but she was not there.</p>

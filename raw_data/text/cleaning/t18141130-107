               <p>MR. BECKWELL. I superintent the timber at Mr. Mill's Dockyard; at the Isle of Dogs; I did not miss the timber until it was found. This piece of timber was shewed me by the officer Evans; upon examining, I found it was missing; the value of it, when lost, was more than found; the worth of it is forty pounds. The marks were F P for the ships name and M for Mills. It was formerly one piece, it is now cut the mark remained. I knew it directly I saw it, it was not defaced in any way. It was fifty six feet and a half long.</p>

            . I am a waterman; I ply at stone stairs, just by Rayner's wharf; I went on shore, with some passengers. I saw Parker on the wharf, I did not know his business: the next day the 4th of November. I saw it in the morning moved to Rayers wharf; Parker was upon the timber he was assisting in craneing it. I came out in the morning about seven o'clock; I saw Parker and several working men the timber was brought before I came out in the morning they were heaving it up on Rayner's wharf; I saw no more until I saw it sawed, I think that was on the same day I will not be sure; I saw it sawed at a little after seven o'clock. I saw it being sawed by two men, as I was going off with a fare.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I saw this piece of timber on Mr. Rayners wharf on Friday the 4th of November; I saw Parker assist in craneing of it. I came out, it was heaving up a slip that was made on purpose for heaving of timber.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORD. I remember this piece of timber being brought on Friday morning the 4th of November, Parker and the others said it must be landed on the wharf; they said they had permission of Mr. Rayner on the over night. I went to borrow a rope of Mr. Pallister, Mr. Rayner was by, I got the tackle ready, and it was brought on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that day afterwards did Turner come - A. Yes; he came down and cross-cut this piece of timber; he brought a saw with him, and cut it in two. I assisted him, after he had cut it in two he said, he believed Mr. Gould was coming to draw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you for wharfage and landing - A. Mr, Turner, and he paid me for the cross-cutting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he pay for the wharfage and landing - A. I cannot say; after it was put by till Monday; the prisoner Gould came, Gould brought Mr. Planket's timber carriage; with three or four horses, I fancy his own horses he took it away, he did not say where he was going with it as I heard.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAYNER. Q, Do you remember the timber coming to your wharf - A, I remember a person applying to me, on Thursday evening; I saw it on Friday morning landed, about eight o'clock. About eleven o'clock, I remember the prisoner Turner coming, he was looking at the timber; I think he mentioned something about having it up, I said to him, what, does it belong to you; he said, yes; I said, another person had applied to me, the night before, but if it belongs to you, that is very well, he said, yes; it belonged to him, he could pay the wharfage and labour; I asked him the contents, he said two hundred and sixteen feet. I asked him why he did not send for the timber, as he had promised; his reply was that the carriage was broken down, that they would come for it on the Monday following; the carriage came on Monday, the prisoner Gould came; it was loaded, and taken away by Gould, Gould assisted in loading it.</p>

               <p>- BIRCH. I am a sawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Turner - A. Yes, on Monday, the 2nd of November, he said, he had a large piece of timber he wanted sawed if I would cut it, I should do it; I said, I had no objection. On the Monday following, I saw a strange carman; I asked him what he wanted, I suspected he was the carter of that timber, and while we were unloading it Turner came, Turner marked the piece on the saw pit how I should cut it; I asked master the proper place to put it for conveniency; master said outside of the yard; Turner said let it remain in the yard: Turner seemed careless whether it was in the yard or no; it laid outside of the yard, and there it remained until Evans the officer came.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Wednesday the 7th of November, I went to Mr. Ireland's yard, I there saw the timber; it appeared to me to be all one piece before it was out, it was marked M at one end, and F B on the other end 216, the quantity, the ships name the Friend; I shewed Mr. Beckway the same pieces; he identified it. In consequence of information, I went to the house of Turner in John-street, Curtain-road, he was not at home the first time I went; I went the second time, and found him; I told him I had come to make some enquiries respecting a piece of timber he had cutting at Mr. Ireland's. I asked him who he bought it of; he said a person living some where about Limehouse, he did not know the person. I asked him what he was to give a loud for it; he said ten-pounds, he had paid seven pounds on account, he was to pay the remainder in two months. I asked him if he had a bill of parcels; he said, no. He said a person came there at two o'clock in the morning, which he believed to be the man that he had bought the timber of, he said he had the appearance of a sailor. I told him he must go to the magistrate to explain the matter; he very readily went there.</p>

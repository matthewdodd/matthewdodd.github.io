Watch! several times; a man came into the room and said, "What do you do here - what do you want?" and struck me over the head with his fist; I was then about to go, but at that moment the watchman came up; it was a front room, on the first floor; I was going down, and met the watchman on the stairs; I gave charge of her - we went to the watch-house - the man followed us - he insisted upon coming in, and I gave charge of him, for striking me; it appeared to me that the other woman had got my watch; the prisoner was searched, but it was not found on her, nor on the man; the watch-housekeeper directed me to search all my pockets, which I did, and the watch was not about me then: there were between twenty and thirty people at the watch-house, and I had to pass through them to get out; when I got opposite St. Luke's hospital, I found the watch in my left-hand trouser's pocket; I am sure it was not there when I was in the watch-house; it appeared to have been pulled, the ring was broken, and the seal and key were loose - the fob did not appear as if it had been pulled out; I will take my solemn oath that it was not there when I was at the watch house.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, about half-past twelve o'clock; the prosecutor seemed to have all his senses about him, and told his story correctly and well -I desired him to feel in all his pockets, if he had lost any thing else - he did so; I said, "Are you confident you have not lost any thing else?" he felt all his pockets, and found this bag, with a sovereign and some silver in it, all safe; there were a great number of people in the watch-house, and some outside.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that he had a watch; on the following morning he told the watchman that a friend of his had been drinking with him, and had taken care of his watch for him: how could I possibly put a watch into his pocket without his knowing it; that man or woman would not have come up, only he broke all the ornaments on the mantel-piece.</p>

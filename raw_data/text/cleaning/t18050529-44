On the 15th of May, about half after nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop with another man, who represented himself as drum-major to the East London Militia; the prisoner said he wanted to speak to me in private; I told him I had no secrets in my place, and what he had got to say to speak out; he and the other man talked about some lead that had been stolen; I saw a man looking through my window; I turned my head, and the prisoner at the bar went into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the watch? - A. In two minutes after he went out of my house; I made application to Captain Walker, and the Captain sent him down to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you took him up? - A. On Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again? - A. The pawnbroker has the watch. I saw the watch hanging in my room at half after nine o'clock, before twenty minutes to ten I missed it; I went up to the Guard-house, in Bunhill-row; I have seen the man several times in the Artillery-ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him personally; had he ever been at your shop before? - A. Once before; I never had any dealings with him in my life.</p>

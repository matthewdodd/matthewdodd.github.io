               <p>What are you come to prove? - I do not know what I am called for, I was subpoened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100056"></xptr> something upon a cane I was told; I have seen the gentleman with a cane, that is all I have to say; if the cane is produced, if I know it I will speak.</p>
               <p>Should you know it? - I cannot tell without it is produced.</p>
               <p>Can you describe it? - I have seen it frequently divers weeks and months, three months I believe I have: A cane is a very trifling affair you know gentlemen for a woman to take notice of, if the cane is produced, and if I know it, I will speak, that is all.</p>

               <p>These boots were given to me in part of payment of rent, of a lodger of mine, for twenty-five shillings, and a pair of red Morocco shoes, which shoes are damaged.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you the lodger here? - No, I have not, he is gone down to Portsmouth, it is about three weeks ago, he came in and asked me to lend him a crown, says I, you owe me twenty-five shillings rent, says he, I have two pair of boots, and a pair of children's shoes, I will give you the shoes, and leave the boots in pledge; he bid me to sell the boots, they hung publicly at my door, I offered them for sale, and I could not get the price, which was 35 s.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite Mr. Fairey. On the 27th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner, Gray, take the knives out of a paper, and put them into Sweeney's apron - he held them while Gray went for more. He returned in two or three minutes, took more out of a paper, put them into Sweeney's apron, and went over a third time for more - I did not see where they got them from. My house is about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's. Gray returned in about two minutes with more - they then saw me looking at them, and removed themselves from there into Prince's-square. I looked out at my door, and saw Sweeney come up the court again - he thought I was watching them, put the knives under his jacket, and then went round the other way. Thinking they came out of the pawnbroker's shop, I went in, and asked him if he had lost any such things? he said No. The prisoners left the court, and I saw no more of them. I am sure they are the boys; nobody else was with them. They threw the papers away - Fairey picked up one. Next morning Gray was brought to me; I was asked if he was one of them? I am certain he is.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of January, Gray was given into my charge; he said he had not got the knives, but Sweeny had them, and sold them for 2 s. 6 d., and gave him 6 d. He described Sweeny to me; I searched for him, and found him in custody at Union Hall, for a similar offence.</p>

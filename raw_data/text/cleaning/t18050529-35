Yes, I am not married: On the 2d of April I sent my two children on an errand, at six o'clock at night; the oldest is six years old, and the other is three; the young child had a dark cotton frock on, when she left me; they had been gone twenty minutes when the woman, who sits at the corner of Leg-alley, Shoreditch, said that my little girl had been taken from my boy by a woman.</p>

             sworn. - I had been on an errand; I heard that a woman had ran away with the child; I ran down Bishopsgate-street after it, and could see nothing of the woman; coming home, I met the child in another woman's arms; directly the child saw me she cried to come to me, I brought the child home, and went down Bishopsgate-street with a piece of the child's frock, to see if I could find it at the pawnbroker's; I went to Mr. Clarke's, and Mr. Parsly said he had just taken it in, and if I had come five minutes sooner, I should have seen the woman. I found the frock at Mr. Clarke's.</p>
               <p>- PARSLY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Clarke, a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar, on the 2d of April, brought me a frock, which I now produce, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, a very few minutes before Nash came; I lent her one shilling on it; I am certain she is the person.</p>

               <p>JOHN MATTHEWS sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; I was headborough at the time this happened: I took this woman into custody; I had her at Worship-street-Office when I was informed of this; I went and saw this frock at Mr. Clarke's; I have known her these three or four years, she has been in the habit of using my shop; I had taken her up on another charge. (The frock produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Parsly.) Had she pawned any other frocks at your house? - A. Yes, about three weeks before this.</p>

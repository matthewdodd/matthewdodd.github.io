I collared him and searched him, but did not find it on him - I let him go. A gentleman pointed the prisoner out to me - I seized him, and saw my handkerchief laying at his feet - I picked it up, and gave him in charge, I live in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>EDWARD INSKIP. I am an artificial flower-maker, and live in Addle-street. On the 10th of October I was in Newgate-street - the passage was obstructed by the unloading of a waggon. After the truss was removed, I saw the prosecutor collar a man, and charge him with stealing his handkerchief-the man offered to be searched. I observed a porter pointing toward Cheapside; I looked round, and saw the prisoner standing against a warehouse just by, and saw something yellow under his jacket behind. I turned round, and told the prosecutor, who was there, pointing to the prisoner, and looking at him. He shook himself, and I saw the handkerchief fall on the pavement from him-nobody else was near him. The prosecutor collared him, and picked it up.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Several persons came by the prosecutor. I saw the handkerchief drop, picked it up, and put it under my jacket. The prosecutor charged a man with the robbery. I thought I had better drop it.</p>

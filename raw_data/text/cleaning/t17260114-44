            , commonly call'd Sir John Follard, at the Black-Lion Alehouse in the Strand, thus depos'd. The Prisoner came to me, and desir'd me to lend her 14 Shillings to fetch a Ring out of Pawn, where it had lain for three Months; and which, she said, was given her by her Master, my Lord Nutterville. I lent her the Money, and she left me the same Ring in pledge to me. But, not long after, my Lord's Gentleman came with her, and demanded the Ring again.</p>

The tobacco imported is deposited in the London Docks or Excise, till the duties are paid. When the merchant wants his tobacco he gives notice at the Tobacco Office, it is then weighed, and the officer who weighs it sends an account to the office of the weight, and gives another to the merchant; the officer makes out one account for himself, the merchant makes out one for himself, and the officer signs the one the merchant has. The officer deposits his account in our office, and the merchant takes the other to the collector. The amount of duty is ascertained from the weight at the collector's office, and paid by the merchant, the collector then gives him a certificate of its having been paid, and the merchant endorses the landing marks, number of the import, and delivery weights, and the person to whom it is to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this, is it such an instrument as is given at the collector's office - A. It is; after this the merchant carries the certificate signed by the collector to the comptroller's office for his signature. It then comes to our office. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18210912-89-deflabel497" type="occupation">clerk</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18210912-89-defend957 t18210912-89-deflabel497"></join> in our office, in the permit seat; it was part of his duty to examine these certificates when presented. He has the custody of the weighing officer's note, and is to compare the certificate with it, and to examine the certificate and see if the signatures of the collector and comptroller is correct, but we are not very nice about these things; but we are always particular in comparing the note with the certificate, if he is satisfied that it is correct, he gives the broker or merchant a permit, and puts the certificate in the drawer. The certificates and permits are always numbered.</p>
               <p>Q. Should the two numbers correspond - A. No; sometimes it is omitted to put the number of the permit on the certificate. There are also counterparts of the permits. There is a book kept in which the certificates are entered - We call it the duty-paid ledger. It was the prisoner's duty to enter the certificates in that ledger, in the course of the week, as we compare accounts at the end of the week and make them up; and a voucher is drawn which is a copy of of the duty-paid ledger. It was the prisoner's business to make out the voucher; it should contain an account of all the certificates granted in the course of the week. When the voucher is made out it is examined with the duty-paid ledger, and the certificates are also compared with it. It is also compared with the counterpart; the certificates are always compared with the counterpart of the permits; they then go to another clerk, who enters them in the import ledger, and they are laid up in weekly bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the certificates of the preceding week would not be in the drawer - A. No. I believe they are sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120055"></xptr>left in for a fortnight, but then the first week's are always tied in a bundle, the bundle is not always made up at the end of the week. At the latter end of July, I think on a Tuesday, I received some information from the clerks, and set about making enquiry, and saw the prisoner. I think he told me there was a double No. 198 of the certificate, meaning that there was two certificates of that number. (I think this was on Monday). I went with him afterwards to Mr. Mayo's office, and as we went along he said</p>
               <p>"I think I had better not say any thing about No. 202," which was another certificate. I compared the permits and ledger with Mr. Phipps, the general surveyor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is your office - A. By the Docks. He had been four years, in our office. I know Mr. Grant, he was clerk to his cousin, who is a broker; he was to pay the money. He absconded, about a month ago; it was before I was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner remained at the office - A. The 10th of August was the last day he was there. We went to Bow-street, ten days after. The discovery was made a fortnight or three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very nice about examining the signature of the collector - A. No; we do not always know them; as they are often changed. The permits are not always issued in their regular order of numbers - the certificates are put in a drawer which is open to all the clerks. I never saw a broker go to it. I believe it is not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. The voucher is a copy of the ledger, and ought to contain the week's certificate - A. Yes; if a certificate is omitted it will not agree with the collector's account.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the enquiry suggested by the prisoner himself, in consequence of his having made complaint about Grant, who has absconded - A. He made a complaint, about No. 198. I have never seen Grant since. The prisoner complained of Grant.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. The double number that the prisoner disclosed was No. 198 - A. Yes he mentioned no other number to me. His seat is railed in.</p>

            . I am a tobacco warehouse-keeper, in the same office as the prisoner. It is my duty to call at the collector's office, every Monday morning, to get the account of duties received during the week, for the purpose of checking the account.

I produce it. The number of hogshead is eighty-three, of pounds 113,552, the amount of duty 22,646 l. 8 s., his duty was to sign a check, against his own account, if they agree together in number and amount of money; if he found them correct, he was to call the warrant over, against the duty-paid ledger - he makes up his vouchers from the certificate, which he sends to the chief office, as a charge on the collector.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue at the office that morning - A. Yes. The prisoner said to me, that the account I had brought up did not agree, and the difference was the amount of a certificate paid by Mr. Grant. I think he named 327 l. odd, as the amount. Mr. Jones came into the office, and he named it to him. I knew

            , his business frequently called him to our office; the prisoner, and he seemed very good friends, merely passing civilities, nothing more that I saw - I have seen them go out of the office together occasionally.

             came to the office that day, and I think brought down some warrants, Sutherin named something to him about double numbers. I heard Grant say, he knew he had paid the duties, and that was all he cared about. I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. On the next day, Tuesday, the 31st of July, did Jones direct you to make out a search - A. Yes, to see where the error laid, and could not discover any weighing bill tallying with the warrant. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I, Hoare, and Henler, made further search (the office shuts at four o'clock); they came, and wished to look at the warrants paid by Grant on the preceding day, the 30th; I opened the drawer in the prisoner's seat, which contained the warrants, and took them out, they examined them. I know Mr. Smith the collector; to the best of my belief, the signature is not his writing. I do not know about Wright's signature.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found in a bundle tied up, or how - A. Loose. The bundle of the preceding week was in the drawer, not tied up, but folded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now turn to the ledger, and tell me whether there is any entry there of No. 202 - A. There are two of No. 202. I saw the account when there was no double entry of No. 202, that account is not now in the ledger, the entry is made by the prisoner, and so was the first that I saw. On Wednesday the 1st of August, I saw the prisoner making entries in the ledger, from a loose leaf not then attached to the book, but it was a leaf of the ledger, and the same I saw in it before, it was ruled exactly the same, and in his writing. I do not know what became of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Grant was a respectable decent young man - A. Yes. There was no particular familiarity, between him and the prisoner. The prisoner was the first person who spoke of the warrant No. 198, and that set the enquiry afloat respecting this. I heard him talking to him in the office, about double numbers, and after that I saw 
               <persName id="t18210912-89-person962">Grant</persName>
             no more. If I took the certificate up in a cursory way, I might not notice that it was not Smith's signature. I know when he was absent he sent a sick note.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Have you the counterpart of the permit - A. Yes, of No. 202.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the account you got from the collector, contain either No. 198 or 202 - A. No; I delivered it to the prisoner to examine; he said it did not correspond as to 198; 198 was entered in his voucher and his book, but 202 was not in his account, and his account was 327 l. and odd more than the collector's, but it had No. 198 in it.</p>

             was in my service, on the 26th of that month I directed him to clear five hogsheads of tobacco, for which I gave him a check of 303 l. 19 s. for one hogshead, and Fish and Co. furnished him with the money for the others. I produce the check which I got from my bankers; the amount of duty is 303 l. 16 s. 2 s. rent, and 1 s. Dock charges; the other four hogsheads were for Fish and Co. St. John-street, the duty on them was 1146 l. 4 s., rent 8 s. charges 4 s., and the transfer on thirty-one hogsheads, 5 l. 2 s., making altogether 1135 l. 1 s. 2 d. On the Tuesday morning following, I was at the Collector's office on business, and met Crouch, and heard from him that there was a mistake in a warrant; he requested me to look into my books and see if such a hogshead, No. 198, was cleared on that day. I did, and went to the office to find a duplicate-paper of the warrant, but could not, and informed Crouch and Jones; they found the hogshead had been cleared, but could not find the duplicate - I knew the tobacco was cleared; he then informed me, the warrant was supposed to be a forgery, after which I came back from the office, and not having seen my young man all the day, raised my suspicions. In coming from the Dock, at the corner of the street where I live, I met the prisoner; he asked me where Robert, my young man was to be found, or where his friends lived, as he must and would see him. I told him his mother lived in Hans-square, Sloane-street, and said I was going myself to Clapham, where his brother lived. He wished me to go home and dine with him, I said my mind was too much agitated, and I would go to Clapham immediately, to seek the young man out if I could - this was about three o'clock. He then left me apparently to go towards Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to this certificate, No. 202, can you speak to any of the writing in it - A. Yes, the body of the warrant is certainly my clerk's writing, but the date is not; the endorsement is my clerk's writing, except the No. 26. I went from my own house over to Clapham, and not finding him there, I went to Hans-square. I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this No. 198 also - A. The body of the warrant is my clerk's hand-writing, but the date of the importation, 6th of November, 1820, is not. I have since paid to the Excise the duty on this tobacco. I have paid them twice, once to Grant, and now to the Excise. I saw the prisoner a few days afterwards at the office, the conversation turned on this business, and in the course of conversation, he said he knew my clerk kept a horse and gig. I asked how he came to be possessed of this information, he said he has been seen in one down at Chelsea, and had been seen to get out of this gig and go into the fisting shop; that the prisoner's brother and his uncle Johnson had seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to the prisoner's house - A. I did, after some discovery; he lived in Gray's-walk, Lambeth; Mr. Bailey accompanied me. I knocked at the door twice before we got admittance - his wife opened it - I was shewn up stairs; she went to a pair of folding doors, which separated two rooms, as if to go in, but they appeared to be fastened; she immediately said,</p>
               <p>"Sutherin, Mr. Grant has called to see you," he said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come in?" she said,</p>
               <p>"How can I, when the door is fastened." After this he came in, and asked if I had heard any thing of Robert, I said, I had not; he then asked if any thing more was discovered. I said, I understood there was, but I could not tell him the particulars; he said, what an unlucky thing it was for him; that Robert had frequently been there, and always gave him to understand that he slept in Leicester-square; he said they had had some money transaction together once, about the sixteenth of a lottery ticket, and that he had conducted himself with great propriety.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he must and would find him - A. Yes. He did not tell me where he lived himself.</p>

            . I am chief clerk to Messrs. Ladbroke and Co. When a check is presented, a clerk cancels it, and another takes an account of the large notes paid for it. I paid these two drafts, produced jointly with Mr. Gillman and Jenery; Mr. Gillman wrote off the numbers and dates of the large notes; Jenery paid the small cash; I cancelled it and ordered the large notes to be entered off. I have an entry on my book of the amount of the small cash that I paid 4 l. 2 s. in full of a sum of 1439 l. 0 s. 2 d. I have no recollection who presented the draft.</p>

Grant could get a blank certificate, the brokers fill them up themselves, they are allowed to take them away and fill them up at their leisure.</p>

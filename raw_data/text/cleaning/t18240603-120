I did not pursue them, nor call Stop thief! - I do not know that any body followed them - my mother has not got the bundle again - the prisoner was taken on the 14th of April. I know he is the boy, and I said so at the office. I knew him before that night - he was not a friend of mine, but I had seen him about the streets. I am quite sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know where he lived - A. No; but I know his name. I told the watchman of it, but nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at the office that you knew the boy because he had a black coat - A. Yes; and a brown one he wore sometimes - it was not very dark - there was a gaslight in the alley.</p>

            . I am a tobacco-pipe maker. I lived in the house with the prisoner, at No. 42, Cannon-street-road. I can take upon myself to say, upon my God, that on that evening, and for three evenings before, and three evenings after, he was at home from seven o'clock till he went to bed. I can positively affirm to the Jury, and to all present, that that is the fact. He is not in any business. He has a mother and a father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you work - A. At the west end of the town. I leave work at five or six o'clock in the evening. I have spent my evening at home for the last twelve months. I am a widower, and have no children. I sometimes go out by chance.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this lad lodge with you - A. He occupies the front room of the first floor, and I occupy the back.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you go to bed - A. Sometimes at eight o'clock, sometimes at nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you watch their door - A. No; they might go out, and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. What impresses so strongly upon your mind about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030041"></xptr>the three days before, and the three days after the time spoken of - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the lad was in the house; can you swear positively to the six evenings you have spoken of - A. I do not know that I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you can say - A. I can answer nothing to the purpose I am called upon unknown to this business.</p>
               <p>HYAM PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. How did you know the name of the prisoner - A. Because I had had sold him fruit, and I have heard his name from other boys. The other boys were all bigger than him; I should not know any of them. It was very moon-light, and there was a gas-light. I cannot be mistaken.</p>

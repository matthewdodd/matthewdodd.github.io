On the 9th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the kitchen, heard somebody creeping in the passage, and on the stairs. I went to the kitchen-door, saw the clothes were taken off the bannisters, and saw the prisoner about half way down stairs with them on his shoulder. I called out,</p>
               <p>"You have got my husband's clothes." He still kept creeping on with them. I called out Stop thief! some gentlemen down stairs in the office heard me, and coming to my assistance, they made a bustle; he heard them, threw the clothes down, and endeavoured to escape, but the witness caught him at the bottom of the stairs; the clothes were taken of the bannisters of the first-floor - we lodge on the second-floor. The street-door was left open, as there are offices on the first-floor.</p>

            . On the 9th of August, I was minding the counting-house for Mr. Sanders, the owner of the house, and heard the prosecutrix call out Stop thief! and a noise on the stairs. I opened the counting-house-door, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs as fast as he could - he had thrown the things down. I secured him till the officer came.</p>

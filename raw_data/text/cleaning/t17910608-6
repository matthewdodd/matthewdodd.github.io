On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080009"></xptr>28th of April the prisoner came to No. 65, Hatton-garden, and knocked at the door, and enquired after Mr. Edwards; he desired me to go and enquire, I went into the parlour, and as I came out, I saw the prisoner walk out of the street-door with the cloak under his arm; the cloak was hanging up in the passage; he run up Hatton-garden with the cloak under his arm; I cried stop thief, and he dropped the cloak; and a gentleman tripped up his heels and we took him. I am sure he is the same person that came to the house, and went out with the cloak.</p>

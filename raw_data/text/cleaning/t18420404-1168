                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Edward Cooke Bourne of No. 244, Regent-street, furriers. The prisoner was in our employ as shopman, and received money for goods from cus<lb></lb>tomers over the counter, and occasionally from customers on our account—he was in our service about sixteen months, and absconded on the 20th of January without notice—the prisoner took an order from Mr. D. Sombre, the member for Sudbury, for a fur coat—I was not present—if he received the money his duty was to place it in my desk in the shop, and enter it imme<lb></lb>diately in a book—I have the book which he kept for that purpose—my desk was accessible to every shopman for that purpose—my desk the counter from a customer he should do the same with it—there is no entry of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on January the 5th from Mr. D. Sombre—there certainly appears to have been a leaf torn out, but I could not be positive of it—if any sum was received by him between the 5th and 17th, of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. D. sombre, there is no account of it, nor for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or six guineas for a sable boa on the 16th of January—there is no leaf gone till after the date of 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. In January last I was in the service of Messrs Bourne—on the 17th the prisoner was in their service—I remember the day—two ladies purchased a sable boa—I saw them pay 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or six guinea to the prisoner over the counter—it was his duty to enter it in the book—in consequence of something that happened, I afterwards informed my master—the prisoner left on the evening of the 19th, and never returned—I have looked through the book—there is no entry of either of these some—it is customary to take a ticket off an article sold, and to enter on the back of it the day it was sold, and what it is sold for—the ticket of the boa was found in a drawer after the prisoner left—I have looked through the books, and there is no entry of the articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The gentleman paid me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the lady took a sove<lb></lb>reign from her purse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the morning before I left, Edward Bourne came up with about twenty different accounts for me to put the addresses on; he had a great many accounts to deliver; as soon as the boy came in, and he was gone, I told Shaw I had received 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the fur coat, which was not accounted for, on the 5th of January; also the boa, which I sold, and entered in the sale-book, but the leaf was torn out by Capon, which I have a witness of; if he will speak the truth, he will admit seeing him tear it out; I told him the boa was entered, and I tore off the ticket, and put it into the ticket-box; if I intended to keep the money back, I should not have written the ticket off and put it into the box in the regular way—I wrote it off for the 18th, and Mr. Bourne had the ticket—the boa was sold on the 17th, but, it being late at night, I entered it on the 18th; the leaf was torn out on the Tuesday.</p>

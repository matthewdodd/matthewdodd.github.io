Yes; James Ritchie and Joseph Penny got it out of the hold, I assisted in getting it out of the half-deck; the tallow was contained in a bag; I and Ritchie conveyed it on shore; the ship laid at King James's-stairs, Shadwell.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us all that passed? - A.His house is about 30 or 40 yards from the stairs; I went towards Mr. Archer's, and I was stopped in Star-street by Melkin, he asked me what I had got; I then went into Mr. Archer's shop and put it behind the half-door, there was only a girl in the shop; Mr. Melkin came in, and asked what was in the bag, and he dragged it from behind the door; the little girl stamped with her foot when I came in, and Mr. Archer came up, then words passed between Mr. Archer and Melkin, but I don't know what they were; the bag of tallow was thrown into the cellar; I saw Mr. Archer put something into Melkin's hand, I did not know what; then the bag was thrown down the cellar; I went down the cellar; and some tallow had fallen out, Mr. Archer and a young man picked it up, and I helped them; they put it into a thing like a frying-pan, and before it was all taken up, Mr. Melkin came down and took a sample of it, and told me to go into the street, and then he took me to the Justice's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Archer know you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same dress that you are now? A. Yes; only I had a black handkerchief on; I am 16 years of age; I should know the bag again if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sure that Melkin did not tell you to throw the bag down? - A. He did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Archer said so, or was it Melkin? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said at the Justice's, that Melkin told Archer to throw it down? - A. I don't recollect, I think I did say so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you think now? - A. I think it was Mr. Melkin desired Archer to throw it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You stated to the Jury just now, that some of the tallow sell out? - A. Yes, some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the Justice that all fell out? - A. I never said all of it fell out of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Justice it was put into a frying-pan, or any thing of that sort? - A. I said Mr. Archer was picking it up, they did not ask what it was put in.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was torn? - A. Yes, in several places.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was so broken that it could not be put into the bag again with security? - A. I don't know that, I did not put it into any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been aboard ship? - A.Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, on board of ship, such a thing as I am going to describe to you-did you ever hear of sweepings, whether there is not a good deal of tallow swept up, which is thought the perquisite of the crew? - A. I have heard of a thing called sweepings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this tallow dirty or clean tallow? - A. It was not very clean, nor yet very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You are admitted an evidence on the part of the Crown, and you have been in custody ever since? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant belonging to the Tower Hamlets: On the 10th of January, in the evening, I was in Star-street, I saw a person coming with a bag, and I asked him what he had got; he said, what is that to you; he said, he had got some tallow; he went into Mr. Archer's, and threw the tallow down, I went in and seized Lumsdale with one hand, and the tallow with the other; Mr. Archer came up and desired I would let the boy go away, for he might be sent on board a man of war, and drop the tallow down, and he would give me half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If you would let go the tallow and drop it down, he would give you half-a-crown? - A. He nodded towards the cellar, I received the half-crown, and I dropped it down; I afterwards went down and took a sample of the tallow from the bag, and brought the boy along with me to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What did Archer say? - A. Mr. Archer said he would go down with him; I went down with them, and we found the bag as I stated before; Mr. Archer took the tallow from under the drip-board, he pointed to it himself, it was in a tub or cask; the officer said he must have the tallow, and Mr. Archer put the tallow into the bag out of the tub; the officer then said, he wanted the other tallow that was brought before; Archer said, what was left of it was lying under the drip-board; a sheet of paper was procured, and Mr. Archer put it into it; we took the tallow to a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray what way of life may you be in? - A. I have been in different lines; I come out of Staffordshire, and I have been in Northamptoushire.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office: I went to the house of Mr. Archer, in consequence of an information by Mr. Melkin; I went with Mr. Melkin and the boy Lumsdale, to Mr. Archer's shop; the girl was in the shop, and she called him out of the cellar; I said to Mr. Archer, I am come for the bag of tallow that was brought by this boy; he asked me what was the matter; Mr. Archer seemed to turn himself round, and under the drip-board he picked up the bag; says I, Mr. Archer, I must have the tallow as well as the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The bag was empty? - A. Yes; says he, here is the tallow in this cask or tub, and he assisted me in shooting the tallow into the bag; now says I, Mr. Archer, you must go with me to the office; he said, I wish you would let me wash and clean myself before I go; I told him he must go with me, he begged I would not take him with me, but leave him behind; I told him there was a felony committed, and therefore I could not leave him; Mr. M'Carthy came to the door, and several other people, and said he would pass his word for him, he is a publican, and keeps a public-house on the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time was this? - A. This was about eight o'clock, it might be a quarter after; I brought him to the office, and the boy went under an examination, and likewise him, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. After he was committed what passed? - A.After he was committed, he went over to the public-house with me; he begged to go to his house again, for he had some particular business to settle; after some time, I granted the favour; I carried Lumsdale, Melkin, and Cook, with us.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not give you as a reason that the bag was so holely that he was obliged to put it into something else? - A. I cannot swear he said that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is the bag in the same state in which it was at Archer's? - A. No, I cannot say it is, here is a skewer in it, the string had slipped off.</p>

I met the prisoner last Thursday in the street; I went to the public-house to give her something to drink, and then walked by the side of the bridge - I had 16s. or 17s. in my pocket; just as I was leaving her I put my hand into my pocket, and my money was gone: I had not a farthing - I accused her of taking my money; she said she had not, that what money she had was her own - the night-constable was on the spot, and he took her; when she got to the watch-house she threw some money on the table, and said it was all the money she had - the officer went to where we had been, to see if he could find any there; he could not - he then came back; the prisoner stooped down, and threw the rest of the silver on the floor - there were 15s. found in all; I lost about 17s. - I had it safe at the public-house when I paid for some liquor.</p>

            . About one o'clock on Tuesday morning I saw the prosecutor and prisoner cavelling together -I went up; he said she had robbed him of 15s. - I took her to the watch-house: she threw 4s. 6d. on the table, and declared it was all she had - the night officer searched her in my presence, and the rest of the money dropped from some part of her garments; the whole money we found was 15s., which was what the prosecutor stated - he was intoxicated, but not very bad.</p>

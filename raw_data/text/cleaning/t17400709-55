She neither said she lik'd it, or disliked it; but only that she must have larger Patterns, and she would come again by and by, and bring her Cousin with her, who had been at our Shop (she said) and had bought a Gown; and so she went out. I turn'd up the Goods I had shewn her, and missed this Piece; upon which which I came quickly round the Counter, and overtook her at the next Door, and told her she had got something. No, she had not, she said; but I turned back her Cloak, and saw this Linnen upon her. I told her 'twas ours: she said it was not; I knew it, and took it from her; then she would have got away, but I held her, and got her back to the Shop; after which she was carried before a Justice, where she confessed the Fact, and said she did it through Poverty.</p>

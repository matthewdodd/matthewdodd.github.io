            . I am one of the Bow-street patrols; on the 6th of December, about half-past six at night I and Dickens were walking through Islington, we met the prisoner; I saw him with a bag on his back I asked him what he had got, he said, what he had got, was his own; he said he had got three quarter loaves and some potatoes. I thought it was a large bulk for that; I took him into a green grocers shop there, Dickens followed him in, I holding of the prisoner and when he turned out the bag I saw two bee-hives; we handcuffed him and took him to the office. Dickens and me went to Mr. Nicholsons; we saw the garden were they were stifled with brimstone.</p>

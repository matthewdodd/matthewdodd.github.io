               <p>Court. When was this man committed? - On the 13th of January.</p>
               <p>Court to Huckey. Did you take notice what was in the box? - It was impossible; I took out a bill of parcels of Mr. Slade's; I should not know it again; it amounted to four pounds, fourteen shillings, and three-pence; I kept the bill of parcels, and took it to Ashmore, as I think (the bill of parcels produced); this is the same amount; I set a mark on it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who went to Ashmore's? - Mr. Slade's clerk.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was going down Fleet-market, and saw this box lay by a china shop; a man came up, and said, why do you take this box away; I said, does it belong to you: I stopped ten or fifteen minutes, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130075"></xptr>nobody came.

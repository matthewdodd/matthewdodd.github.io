               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your fowls used to fly away over the garden-wall? - A.No, they did not; a great many other people round the country had lost fowls also.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the same sort? - A. Yes, for a year and a half, or two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, notwithstanding that, to swear to these fowls? - A. I can positively swear to the cock particularly.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HOWARD sworn. - I am gardener to Mr. Freeman: On Saturday the 19th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I put up the fowls in a hen-house in the yard; there was a padlock on the door, but it was not locked; there were eight hens and a cock. I heard the dog in the yard make a terrible noise between three and four o'clock in the morning; I sleep in a room adjoining the yard; I did not get up till about six o'clock; I went to the hen-house, and they were all gone; I saw them again in Islington watch-house on the Sunday evening; they were then dead; the cock had no feathers on his breast, and I cut all their wings, because they used to get over into the garden; I had the training of them; some of them were speckled; there was one white one; they had smooth feathers; I can swear they were my master's fowls; I did not see the prisoner till Monday morning, about ten o'clock; he was stopped by the watchman; I never saw him near the house that I know of.</p>

               <p>CHARLES DIXON sworn. - I am a patrol of the parish of Islington: On Sunday morning the 20th of March, about half past five o'clock, I was on duty; I saw the prisoner come across the fields with two bags hung across his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, he had nothing; I put my hand upon the bags, and found there was a fowl, or something of that sort, in it; I asked him where he came from; he told me he came from Southgate, and was going to Mr. Ball's, at Snow-hill; I told him he must go with me to the watch-house, and I took him to the watch-house, with the bags; they contained nine dead fowls; they were quite warm. I saw Mr. Freeman's servant at the watch-house on the Monday morning; he claimed them as Mr. Freeman's fowls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the two bags in a ditch; I had not gone above two hundred yards before I was stopped by the patrol.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him three years, who gave him a good character.</p>

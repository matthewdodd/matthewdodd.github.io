                  </hi>. I live in Basinghall-street. On the 27th of No<lb></lb>vember, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Duck-street, Smithfield—I felt a slight touch behind—I instantly turned round, and saw the prisoner running from me—I ran after him about fifty yards, and laid hold of him, and said, "You have got my handkerchief"—he denied it—I said, "You must have dropped it," and the constable passing by took hold of him—I found it on a dust heap in another street—not where it was taken from me.</p>

                  </hi>. On Sunday night I heard the cry of "Stop thief"—I was in a house—I ran out, and saw the prosecutor with this lad—I took him, and found nothing on him—I told the prosecutor to look about—he went a few paces, and got on a dust-hill and found it.</p>

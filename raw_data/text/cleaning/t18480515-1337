                  </hi> I live at No. 4, Lucas-place, Commercial-road, in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney, and am one of the bailiffs of the Whitechapal County Court—the prisoner is my son, and is 17 years of age—I was called up about half-past five o'clock, and found the first-floor back-room window open, a piece of glass large enough to admit a person's hand had been forced from the outside—it had been fast the night before—I missed a silver watch and chain, and a parrot—some time after that I saw my son in the street, and asked him what he had done with the watch and the parrot that he had taken from the house, he denied it, and I told him the parrot had been seen in his possession, on the Tuesday morning—he had been taken to the station house, but told a plausable tale, and they suffered him to leave with the parrot—he afterwards said, "Well I sold the parrot for half-a-crown, to a delaer at the entrance of London Dock gate, and the watch and chain to a man in Petticoat-lane, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—it was worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 2nd May, about half-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the top of Lucas-street, about twenty yards from his father's, with a parrot in the bosom of his jacket—I asked him where he got it, he said, from on board a ship—I asked what he had been doing with it all day, he said he had it in his bosom all day, and he went to the play with it, and the London Dock gates being licked he could not get in, he was going off to Stopney to his mother—he has no mother living there.</p>

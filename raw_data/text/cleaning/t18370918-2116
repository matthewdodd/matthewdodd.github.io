                  </hi>. I belong to the brig <hi rend="italic">Sceptre</hi>, of Shields.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 43, Lower Cornwall-street. I went on this morning to the Crooked Billet, in King David-lane—I saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner—she put her hand into his pocket, and Pulled out 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. counted it, and put it into her pocket—I came out, and told my master of it—I went in again, and saw the prisoner take the jacket off his back—he was so drunk that he could not help himself—she rushed out of the house—the man went to sleep for an hour—then he missed his jacket, and made an <hi rend="italic">oration</hi> about it; and then I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with the jacket—she abused me, and would not give it him, and said it was not his—I gave her in charge—the prosecutor was so drunk he could not have given it to her. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was worse in liquor than he was, and he gave me jacket to pawn.</p>

            . I am porter to the fishmongers company, besides the general charge in the great repairing of the hall, I had a particular charge to have a particular watch. I have had great reason to believe the hall had been robb'd, especially on the 26th of June, though I saw the carpenters fasten the door, and staid myself half an hour after that. Then I went home to get me a mouthful of supper. And when I came back, to my surprize found both doors of the hall open that leads into the hall, which gave me a strong suspicion that all things was not right, so I was determined to watch more narrowly; and on Friday the 29th, I went into the hall about the evening, and as I thought every thing was safe, and coming back to my own house which is but a few doors from the hall, (I had not got in, but set down at my own bench) I saw the prisoner and two other labourers, (one of them I very well know, as well as the prisoner, the other I do not know), go up Miles's-lane, with something cover'd; seeing of them go by I judged by the weight that seem'd to be under their arms, that it was lead, and I supposed where they were going to a house of ill repute in my own neighbourhood, did not detect them in the street, but followed them up the lane. The hindermost man either was heavier loaded, or feebler, for he lag'd behind, so that if I had waited for him, I had mist seeing the prisoner; (for I knew the prisoner, he had work'd in the hall a long time). I pushed by the hindermost man, and follow'd the prisoner, and the other labourer into the house of Mr. John Fowler, a dealer in iron, and other things of that nature, in Crooked lane; they went straight up unto the west door of the shop, and pass'd by the master of the shop who stood straightening of nails, he took no notice of them no more than though he had never saw them. I pushed by the master and went after the prisoner, who then had turn'd into one corner of the shop, where there hung a pair of scales, the prisoner at the bar, as I firmly believe, dropt from him a piece of lead; I said to him, You villian, you have stole this lead, which he denied, and made some small resistance, the other labourer had got rid of his burden, and run out at the fouth door of the shop, then the master of the shop came up to me, and took me by the shoulder, and said, don't make such a noise, I want to speak with you, supposing he wanted me to smother the matter; I told him I regarded the Fish-mongers company so much, that as I was constable, I would charge him to aid and assist me down to <placeName id="t17530718-12-crimeloc55">Fish-mongers-hall</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever take a view of the hall to see where the lead was taken from?</p>
               <p>Barber. I went up with the plumber's servant, and there was lead missing from off the chimnies.</p>

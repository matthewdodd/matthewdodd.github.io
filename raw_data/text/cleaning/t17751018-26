On the 4th of October, having set up all night, I went at about eleven o'clock into the George, in Chick-Lane, to have some bread and cheese: I met the prisoner there; we drank together: she prevailed upon me afterwards to go home with her to her lodgings; I went very reluctantly. I am sure I had the money mentioned in the indictment in my pocket when I went into the house; I missed it before I got out of the room.</p>

            . I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings; there was a pot of beer sent for: I said, I could not stay, and went away and left him there. Mr. Coney pulled out some money to pay for the beer, and I saw two guineas and some silver in his hand; he came afterwards to me, and told me he had been robbed by the prisoner. We found the prisoner afterwards in bed.</p>

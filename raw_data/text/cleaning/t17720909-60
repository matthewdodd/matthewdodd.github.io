            . I use Covent-garden market. On the 1st of September I went to market about five in the morning; I saw Wood there; when I went home I found I had been robbed; the street door lock was picked, and the parlour door broke open. I lost a box out of the parlour with thirteen or fourteen pounds in it; I missed the plate out of my bed-room, and the rest of the things mentioned in the indictment. I suspected the prisoner. As I stood at the door the prisoner, Smith, came by; I charged him with robbing me; some of the neighbours came and searched him, but found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Isabella Shields was called to prove that the prisoner, Wood, was seen about the house, about the time the fact was committed, but she only saw her go into the other prisoner's cellar.</p>

I and Stephens searched a cellar which she went into, and there we found a parcel of pick-lock keys, a fork, and some chocolate; one of these pick-lock keys opens Mrs. Wish's street door.</p>
               <p>Joh Trip. These buttons (producing a pair of gold buttons) were brought to me by the prisoner, Wood, along with Sims; first she said she found them; then that she had had them seven years. Sims desired me to let her have a shilling on them, as she was going to prison without a farthing; the buttons had the stones knocked out.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wish deposed to the buttons and chocolate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Farrell deposed, that she gave the prosecutor this chocolate, and knows the mark upon it.</p>

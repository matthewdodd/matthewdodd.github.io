            . I am a ship-caulker, and was in Bishopsgate-street about eleven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner close behind the prosecutor; I saw him pull the handkerchief about half out, he got it out by the second attempt. I was about twenty yards from him, he crossed the road and looked behind, he gave me a kind of a nod, which I understood to mean I was to say nothing about it. I followed and overtook him near the Exchange without losing sight of him - he dropped it when I was within a yard of him.</p>

            . I am servant to the Right Hon. the Earl of Thanet. On the 28th of October my Lord and Lady set out in a post-chaise with four horses and two postilions, to come to London about six in the evening, coming over Shooter's-hill, I was with them; there were two footmen on horseback; I then saw the large leather trunk behind the carriage, it was very safe; I gave the footmen charge of it, to watch that and the carriage  and I came forward to get supper for my Lord and Lady. When the carriage came to the door, neither of the footmen came with it; I told the post-boys to take every thing out of the inside, and likewise to take care of the trunk behind; they came to me instantly, and said, the trunk is no t here; I went to look and saw it was gone; I found one of the straps between the pearch and the axletree of the carriage, it appeared to have been cut by two or three attempts, with some instrument; I took an account of my Lady's woman of what principal things she could recollect were in it, and went immediately to Sir

            's. I am an officer of Aldgate parish; Mr. Murray came and desired me to go with him to take a person in custody; he said a woman named Lowrey, would shew him to me; we went to the Crooked Billet in Queen-street; Murray went in at one door and I the other; the woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176712090020"></xptr> went in first; she was sat down by the prisoner, who was drinking a pint of beer; I went and sat down by the prisoner; and said to the woman, Madam, am I right; she said I was. In a little time I told him I was an officer, and he was my prisoner; he said he had nothing about him; Mrs. Lowrey said to him, you have a dozen pair of gloves; then he took and delivered them to me, (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>E. Hallam. By the manner these are tied up in paper, I think I can be sure they are of my tying up, and my Lady's property.</p>
               <p>Cripps. The prisoner told me after this, that he would shew me where there were a great many other things of great value; he took us to several houses, saying he would shew us the men that were concerned; at last he took us to Kent-street, in an alley on the other side the water, and up into a room; there were I believe thirty shifts, a lady's riding habit, a silk sack and gown, and a great many things, which were carried to Justice Fielding's, and there delivered to Mrs. Hallam and Mr. Smith.</p>

I said to the prisoner after he was in custody, you may as well let us know where the rest of the things are, we will be as favourable as possible; he took us over the water to a house in Kent-street; there he shewed us almost a porter's load of rich things; but before we went from the Crooked Billet these silk stockings were delivered to me by Mrs. Lowrey, (producing 13 pair of silk stockings;) these she said she had from the prisoner.

I live in Rosemary-lane, and was crying old clothes that morning, and saw the prisoner sell something to a Jew, it was white, I took it to be a shirt; he offered me a pair of white silk stockings for 3 s. I said, I'll give you two; he agreed for that; said he, I have another pair to sell; I said, I'll buy them; said he, I have got eleven pair more, and put them in my hands; then I suspected he stole them; I said, come along with me, I have not money enough, I can borrow some at a house a little way off; I took him to the Crooked Billet, that was that I might get him taken; then he mentioned a silk sack and petticoat, and abundance of things; I said, how did you come by them, I'll buy them; he said he got them out of a gentleman's house in the country; I went out, pretending to borrow some money; Mr. Murray not being at home, I returned to the prisoner and bid him call for another pint of beer; then I went to Mr. Murray's again, he was come home; he went to Mr. Cripps, and they came with him, and took him as before-mentioned; I had eleven pair more of stockings from the prisoner, besides them that he sold me for four shillings; I had the whole tote from the prisoner.</p>

            . My master is a saddle and harness-maker, and lives at No. 26, Long-lane. The prisoners brought the harness to his shop about half-past three o'clock, on the 10th of December; I hung it up on a pin in the shop - a man came in the evening and inquired about it; it had been sent to our other shop by one of the boys, but I am certain it is the same harness - it was taken away by Vann.</p>

            . This harness was brought to the office, and Dutton was brought the same day - the other man was charged on suspicion of stealing it; that was on the 23d - I had taken Phillips, and Dutton told me that Phillips used to take him about, and give him a shilling or eighteen-pence for carrying things; he said he knew nothing about that, but Phillips had employed him to carry it: Phillips said he bought it for 12s. of a man at a watering-house, in the City-road, and could produce the party - I said "That would be right for you to do;" he did not mention any name - Dutton said before the Magistrate, that it was bought by Featherston-street, in the City-road.</p>

               <p>DUTTON'S Defence. I was out of work, and met Phillips, who said things were very bad, and as he had a little money he thought of buying an old harness; he went round to different gentleman's servants and bought it up- he met a man with this harness, and bought it; we went to the shop and sold it for 16s.</p>

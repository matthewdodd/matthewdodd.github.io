               <p>John Smith. On monday was a fortnight I went to bed; I then had 6 s. and 6 d. in my pocket; the prisoner came to bed some time after me; on the wednesday morning (for I never look'd at it on the tuesday) after I was gone out to go to my work, I felt in my pocket, and thought my purse very empty; I look'd at it, and found it tied of a harder knot, than generally I tied it; I look'd in it, and found but 3 s. when I came home from my work, I marked my money with a needle; this was on wednesday night, they were 3 king William's shillings, and a sixpence then, and put them in my purse, and on the tuesday morning I miss'd one of the shillings; then I went to justice Welch, and got a warrant, and got a constable, and we charg'd the prisoner with taking it, and he produced it.</p>

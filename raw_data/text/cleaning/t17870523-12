               <p>I was crossing Cheapside, and going down Milk-street, on Friday the 11th of May; I saw this <rs id="t17870523-12-deflabel69" type="occupation">boy</rs>

I said, I should take care of him, if he did not tell me how he came by it; as I was leading him by the arm to the Compter, he said, he found it; I left him in custody at the Compter, and took the property to my house, and sealed it; as there is a mark to every piece of print, we know where to apply in the trade for the printer; I went to the printers, and they informed me it was the property of Mr. Pugh, which was about ten yards from where I first saw the boy with the property in his hand; the men got off.</p>

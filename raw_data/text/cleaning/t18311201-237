            . I am a Policeman. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him; he was quite sober; the prisoner said she had a half-crown belonging to herself, and she gave it up at the watch-house from her pocket, she had no more money about her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He accused me of robbing him, and held my two hands; I said, "What are you going to do?" he felt his left-hand pocket, and said, "You have robbed me of half a crown;" I said, I had not; I thought he was going to strike me, and called the Policeman myself - it is my first offence.</p>

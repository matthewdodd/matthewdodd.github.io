I saw him take several papers from his chest, he went away with them in his hand, I did not stop him; I had been absent from the prisoner with Clinch ten minutes; my brother was with the prisoner, and saw what he was doing in the warehouse. Immediately upon the prisoner leaving the house, I saw a short length of white quilting, such as we dealt in, it was under the prisoner's packing counter; this piece of quilting could not have got there by accident.</p>

            . I have had the boxes and parcels in my custody, there is no number outside of this box, it was opened by Mr. Cook, with a key he had of the prisoner; the whole of these parcels were inclosed in this new flannel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cook. The greatest part of the property in this box, I can swear to. Forty-four yards of white sattin, that is our property, twelve yards of yard wide crape, one of the packages contains four pieces of yard wide crape, this is black silk mode, and black silk sarsnet, twenty-six yards of shot sarsnet, another piece of the same, nineteen silk tippets, five silk shawls; this parcel was sealed up, sealed with W. P. on the outside, 
               <persName id="t18150215-90-person788">W. </persName>
            &amp; P. in large characters; all these except the crapes were inclosed in the flannel wrapper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cook. Do you mean to say all the articles you have spoke of, to be the property of you and your partner's - A. Yes, they are worth about fifty pounds, there are two other boxes, I believe the whole of the contents of them to be our property. they were produced before the Alderman at the prisoner's examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the whole - A. About five hundred and ninety seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Sower. Did you receive a letter from the prisoner - A. I did while he was in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>"William Page has the service of the goods, he was my accomplice, he has removed the goods, he is the person who took them to the house; the Barfield's are innocent, they did not know they were stolen goods, they were told they were smuggled goods, there is no person concerned but him with me."</p>
               <p>MR. NALDER. I found this box in Guildford street, over Black-friars-bridge.</p>
               <p>MR. SOWER. I received this letter, after he was examined before the Alderman, I believe it to be his hand writing,</p>
               <p>(The letter read.)</p>
               <p>"Box, 2. has been removed by P. into some street, near Guildford street; he never told me the number The goods he had in his possession made one or two parcels, the remainder he fetched away from me, and meaned to destroy them. I never sold any thing to receive any thing for them, what I did give were for presents; if I can call to mind any thing else, I will write if Mr. Sower were to call to ask me any questions, perhaps I can recollect, better than to write."</p>

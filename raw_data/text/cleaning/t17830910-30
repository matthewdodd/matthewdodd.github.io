               <p>I know the prisoner, on the 2d of August, about five in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man who escaped, I was in a field the back of Welling's farm, the other side of the New-road, just above Marybone turnpike, and I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why do you not tell the truth and say who was with me?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take the prisoner with the ducks upon him? - The ducks he dropped when I stopped him, I saw him with them in his hand, and he carried them some way before he dropped them, Mrs. Morgan saw these ducks at the Rotation office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Morgan. Can you be positive to these ducks being your husband's property? - Yes, I have sworn to them, and they are here now.</p>
               <p>When did you see them? - The night before, I saw them fastened up in their pen.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>There was another man that run away from me, I had been down to Kilburn with the waggon, the waggoner staid for his bills, and I went down on the other side Kilburn turnpike, he gave me a shilling for going with his waggon, I was coming home the nearest way and overtook this man, and I walked side by side with him till I came to the ditch, and in getting over the ditch, he asked me to lay hold of the basket, and these two men came up, I heard the ducks quack, and thought it would fall on me, so I ran as well as him, I did not know the man, I did not steal them, I have no witnesses.</p>

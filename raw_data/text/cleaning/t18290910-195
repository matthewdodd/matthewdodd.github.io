On the 21st of August I was returning from Bagnigge-wells tea-gardens and met with the prisoner, who forced her company upon me, and would walk with me - I repulsed her: and while I was pushing her from me, she took the money stated from my pocket and went off; the money was loose in my pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in Great George-street, Bethnal-green. I knew the deceased, Thomas Hawe—he was a coal-whip<lb></lb>per—I had known him for about three weeks and a month—on Saturday evening, the 9th or 10th of December, I was in his company at the Queen's Head, at the corner of North-street, Mile-end-road—the prisoner was there, and a young woman named Jane Bubb—there was a dispute be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and the deceased about Jane Bubb—the prisoner told her to keep herself to herself, and not to be talking to other young men—she had come there with the prisoner, and she was talking to the deceased—the prisoner then said he would strike her if she did not keep herself to herself—the deceased said in his presence that he should not—that was all</p>

               <p>that passed—they left there afterwards—on the next Tuesday I was at work with the deceased all day, and went to the Northampton Arms pub<lb></lb>lic-house in the evening, between eight and nine o'clock-—the prisoner was in the tap-room when I got there—the deceased came there a little after ten o'clock-t-the prisoner had come about nine o'clock—I did not hear the prisoner say any thing in the tap-room—I did not see the other people come down to him afterwards—I was up stairs in the same house about ten o'clock—there were thirty or forty persons there, as near as I can guess—Jane Bubb was there and the deceased—the deceased went down stairs, and in about five minutes returned with Jane Bubb, and she went and sat by his tide—'they came up together—she sat down by the side of the prisoner, and kept laughing and sneering all the time at the prisoner—the deceased then sang a song, and in a few minutes after he got up to go, and Jane Bubb with him—the prisoner all the time appeared much agitated—all the while the was in the room, sneering and laughing at him, and when they got up to go away, he jumped off his seat, ran to the door, and went down stairs, and they followed him—I followed them, and when I got round the stairs I heard the deceased say, "Don't strike her"—I suppose he said so to the prisoner—the staircase goes round—as soon as I got round, the first thing I saw was the deceased either strike or push the prisoner, and he went back about a yard and a half against the partition—the de<lb></lb>ceased then followed him, and doubled his fist—they then struggled to<lb></lb>gether with their hand round each other's neck—they bad about one of two hits at each other, as I thought—I then stepped in between them, and said, "Drop it"—the deceased made answer "He has got a knife"—I then laid hold of the prisoner's hand, and held it till a young man named Stiff came down and took a knife out of the prisoner's right hand—it was open—I did not see any blood on it—it had a black and white handle—it was a sharp-pointed knife—a common clasped knife, which men are in the habit of using—the deceased was taken to the hospital—I saw him again the next evening, alive—I saw him after he was dead, at the Coroner's In<lb></lb>quest—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—that was the knife given to me by James Holland.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-porter, and live in North-street, White<lb></lb>chapel-road. On Saturday night, the 12th of December last, I was at the Queen's Head—I saw the deceased, the prisoner, and Jane Bubb there—Jane Bubb was sitting between the two—the deceased got up and said. "There is a vagabond who says he will strike the girl because she spoke to me"—I saw the prisoner mutter to himself, but was too far off to know what he said—I saw no more of them that night—I saw them on the Tues<lb></lb>day evening afterwards at the Northampton Arms, up stairs in the singing room—I went up with some friends—when I had been there a short time the deceased came up with two friends—I heard him sing a song—I went down, and when I came up again I saw him sitting by the side of Jane Bubb, and she was laughing and jeering at the prisoner, who appeared greatly excited at their conduct—the deceased and Bubb got up with the intention of going down—the prisoner rushed down before them—I heard a noise and followed immediately—when I came down I saw the deceased and the witness Burn and the prisoner—the prisoner held a knife in his right hand—Burn was holding him by his right hand, and I took the knife out of his hand—the affray was all over when I got down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

CATHERINE HATES. I am servant at the Northampton Arms. I re<lb></lb>member the Tuesday night in question—I saw the deceased that night, and the prisoner and Jane Bubb—they were up stairs—I saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and also up stairs—he did not come to the bar to me—he came to the house by himself, and Bubb came with the deceased—they did not dance together that evening, that was on Saturday—Todd and Clark were down in the tap-room, when the prisoner called me down into the tap-room—the prisoner had said to me, that Tuesday afternoon, that if Bubb came there that night, he would give her a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—that was before she came with the deceased—I never heard him threaten to give her a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi> before that—I remember their dancing together at our place on the Saturday before—he had been complaining of her then—after they came on this Tuesday evening, the prisoner came and called me down stairs into the tap-room, and gave me a knife, a pocket-book, half a brace, and another book besides—he told me to take care of them till the morning—I told him I would take care of them, and told him not to go up stairs any more—I left him in the tap-room with Clark and Todd—after putting his things away I went up stairs for his beer, and brought it down stairs—he afterwards came up stairs again, and brought his beer back, and soon after he went up, the deceased and Bubb got up to come down stairs—when the prisoner saw it he rushed out, and came down before them—he got before the girl in the passage, and asked her where she was going to, and he struck her—the deceased saw it, the returned back from the bar, and struck the prisoner—they were then in the passage—he appeared a more powerful man than the prisoner, and they</p>

               <p>struggled—he appeared to me to strike him hard—I do not know whether he went backwards in consequence of the blow, but they struggled toge<lb></lb>ther, and the deceased fell—I cannot say how long they struggled toge<lb></lb>ther—it was not very long—I saw the deceased strike the prisoner once, but not after the first blow—when the deceased fell, I picked him up, brought his hat to the bar, and told the girl to go out—the deceased ran to the prisoner again, and they struggled again—the prisoner was standing by when I picked up the deceased—I stooped down to hold him up—I left the deceased's hat at the bar—I do not know what hap<lb></lb>pened after they struggled the second time, for I picked up the de<lb></lb>ceased's hat, and told Bubb to go out, and as I returned from the bar I saw several young men trying to get the knife from the prisoner—it was in his hand—there were a good many other persons in the passage besides me—a good many were coming down the stairs, and when they heard the scuffling they all ran down.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had any quarrel with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, never—nor any dispute with him, lately—I had a little bit of a quarrel with him once, but we made it up, and have been good friends since that—I cannot say how long that is ago—it was a long time before this transaction, but I cannot say how long—it was about his striking this same girl, Jane Bubb—it is a long time ago, and we have been good friends since—I found him striking her, and I told him not to do it—we have made it up a long time, and been friends—we had two or three blows about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who had the best of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that either of us got much the worse from it—I am nineteen years old—I should say, to the best of my recollection, it was six or seven months ago that we had the quarrel—I do not know how old the prisoner is—he is a labourer, I be<lb></lb>lieve—I believe Bubb is a slop-maker—she is a young woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the London Hospital. About eleven o'clock on the night of the 12th of December I remember a man being brought in—he had a wound on the right side of the belly, about an inch and three quarters in extent—it was a serious wound—the bowels were protruding, and the patient bleeding—he died of that wound—it might have been made by the knife produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty near the North<lb></lb>ampton Arras, on the 12th of December, and was called in—I took the prisoner into custody outside the house—I then went inside to solicit some<lb></lb>body to go as a witness with me, and when I went into the house the parties there came round, two or three, saying one thing or another—I said, "Who will go with me to the station-house, who saw what took place?"—the prisoner expressed a desire to go and see the deceased—I took him into the tap-room—he stooped over some of their heads, and looked at him—I walked with him to the front of the bar, and he put his arm down on his head and staid there for a while—I said, "Cheer up, perhaps it may be better than you expect"—I took, him out, and in going along the road, he said, "How do you think it will go with me?"—I said, "I am sure I can't say, but by all the appearance of the man it seems to me he won't live to reach the hospital"—he said, "Well, I might have done it, as I had been eating a bit of bread and cheese just before with my knife in my hand"—and directly afterwards he said, "I wish you would lend me a knife, as I wish, if I can get an opportunity, to put an end to my own ex<lb></lb>istence"—he said, directly afterwards, that he had been treated very ill by the girl, who had been walking up and down the room, laughing and making</p>

In July last the prisoner and his wife came to lodge at my house: he had no conversation with me respecting my property till about two months after that - I took him to lodge there for protection, it be - a lonely situation, and I had no man-servant; he asked me if I had any articles of value, as it was a had neighbourhood, winter was coming on, and there might be robbers-I said I had a gold watch and a few trinkets; I had given them apartments free of rent, for the purpose of protecting my house - a short time after I told him I had the watch and trinkets, he said if I would inform Mrs. Price of my affairs, as to my property, she could give evidence in case of a robbery - I did so according to his desire: the prisoner afterwards said he thought my jewellery and trinkets would be safe in the well under the carpet in the drawing-room, which is on the ground floor - the carpet conceals the well; I had talked to him at different times about my valuables, and on Thursday, the 21st of October, the prisoner put them into a hole in the garden; I first mentioned that place to him - he said he would dig the hole, and put them there; I went with him to hide them in the hole in the garden, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he placed them in the hole himself - he put all the articles stated in the indictment into the hole; the value of the whole together was very near, if not quite, 400l.; one of the sets was presented to me by an old friend on my marriage, and I do not know what that cost; I sent my maidservant out of the house while we put them into the hole; Price had desired me to send her out of the way while he put them there, that there might be no witness to know of it - mine is a detatched house; the garden is walled round- there are no houses that could overlook the hole in the garden, I should suppose not: I suppose the nearest house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090110"></xptr>is about as far off as a very strong person might throw a stone - this was on the morning of the 21st of October; the prisoner went out that evening, saying there were thieves about - he returned, and said he was shot at; I had heard no shot - he had been out a few minutes; I do not know whether he had been in the garden or where; he said there must be somebody about in the garden, and I said that in the morning he and I must search for the property - this was about seven o'clock in the evening of Thursday, the 21st of October; when he came in, I went with him to the side of the house which looked over the garden, but neither saw or heard any body moving about the garden - he went with me, and fired a pistol out of the window; I heard nobody exclaim that they were wounded, nor saw any body - the garden wall must be six feet high; it was a middling night; the garden is about the length of this Court, or longer - if there had been any robbers I must have seen them: next morning, the 22nd, I went with the prisoner's wife to look in the garden for my property; the hole appeared as we had left it - his wife dug up the mould for me, and dug out the box, but the jewellery was all gone except this little article (producing a locket set with fine brilliants) - this was left behind, covered up in this little case.</p>
               <p>Q. A person taking the things out in a hurry might have overlooked that? A. It was tumbled in hay, and in a small red leather case - it is worth 60l.; I had asked the prisoner the night before to go into the garden with me in the morning, and he said it was proper to go, but when I asked for him to go next morning he was gone to town, and I sent for his wife; he had asked me the value of my property, and I said it was some hundreds - he came home that afternoon about one o'clock; I said to him "The property is all gone" - he laughed, and said he must go back to town; he staid an hour, walked all about the garden, and said it was very probable the property was on the premises; the house is in the middle of the garden: he then went back to town, returned in the evening, and asked a man to sit up all night with him in the house, and suggested to me that it was necessary for them to sit up to fire pistols, and they fired pistols all night - they fired, as near as I can judge, about twenty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any body dead about the premises in the morning? A. No - I told him next morning it was very miserable to live there, and I thought I should go away; he said I ought not to go, for if I did he would go away, and I ought to stay, and not be frightened away - he said on the following evening that it was pretty certain the property was about the premises, and if he found it I should be under an obligation to him; he offered me the keys of his boxes to be searched when he came in from town at one o'clock on Friday - I had not charged him with any robbery, not given him the least him of it; I did not search his boxes - I had not the least suspicion of him at that time. On Sunday morning, the 24th of October, about ten o'clock, I was in the garden with him - he was searching for the property among the trees, and found a case of very valuable jewels, worth about 70l., hid in the ivy-tree; I have not brought it here - it is as large as my hand - he called to me, "Look there!" and took it out of the ivy - I could reach it; we had talked a good deal about my loss in the interval; I had said I was afraid it never would be necovered, and it would put me to an expence to take steps - I have got no more of it back; that still missing is worth from 200l. to 300l. -Ledbetter, the officer, was sent for, to whom I described what had occurred; he desired the prisoner to come to Bow-street to give an account of it, and the Magistrate held him to bail.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner pointed out the jewel-case in the tree? A. Yes - I had not seen it before, and should not have seen it; it was quite concealed - it would be impossible for a person who did not know it was there, to find it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HURCOMB. Q. Who fires the pistols off at your house now? A. I have left a man named Arthur Maggs to take care of it; he tells me he never has occasion to fire, but I do not live there now, I live at Brompton; I left the house two days after the robbery - the prisoner fired pistols almost every night after the robbery, but I understand none have been fired since he left; there was no firing before he came to live there -I am timid, but Barnwell, whom I bought the house of, lived in it with his wife and family before the prisoner came - I went there in August, 1828; I have been divorced twelve years and more - I lived in the house some years since I have been separated from my husband; I know Akers, he is the carpenter - I employed him at the time of this accident; when the prisoner said he had been fired at, I went up stairs with him, and looked out of the window, it was about seven o'clock in the evening - we had no particular alarm that night, but I was under constant apprehension; this was the night of the day the property was deposited in the garden - it was gone next morning; Mr. Price desired the servant should be sent out while the things were buried - he sent her to the Post-office, and I sent her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send her to the Post-office to ask for a letter for A. B.? A. No, Price did - I had shewed him a brooch with my father's hair in it, and he saw the outside of the rest of the things; he advised their being put under the carpet - it was not my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not recommend you to place them at your banker's? A. He mentioned that people put property into banker's hands by way of security; I told him I had no banker - he did not advise me to send them to a man who did not exist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not, supposing you had a banker, recommend you to send the things? A. I have said as plain as I could speak that he said property was safe in banker's hands, but my saying I had none, stopped the conversation; he said if I had a banker it would be proper to send them there - I think this was on Thursday evening, the 21st of October, when he went out, and said he had been shot at.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it was when you talked of putting them into the well in the drawing-room? A. I cannot say, to be certain, when it was; he proposed putting them into the well in the drawing-room - I cannot say in what room I was in when he proposed it, for we were continually talking about the well; I first told him there was a well there - it could not be seen; he spoke about alterations in the house, and I said, "Here is part of this house you would know nothing about," and I might have said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090111"></xptr>some weeks before that the well was a secret good place for any property; he proposed to put them there on the evening they were put there; I might have proposed it a month before - the carpet was drawn over the place after they were put there, and there was a heavy chest of drawers near the place; I believe he put a tack or two in the boards - I do not know of his borrowing a screw-driver to get the boards up; I was present when they were taken out - there were a few small nails to be taken out; there seemed no difficulty in getting them up - when he put them into the well he packed them up in paper and hay, and sealed them; my bed-room, the dining-room and drawing-room are all on the ground floor - both the dining and bed rooms command a view of the hole in the garden; the entrance to Price's apartment is on the other side of the house - his sleeping room is over my bed-room, but does not look on the garden; my maid-servant slept pretty near me, on the ground floor, and close against the drawing-room - she slept in a passage between the drawing and bed-rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not frequently in the habit of alarming Price at night, calling him up, expressing your alarm of thieves being in the house, and requesting him to come and stay with you? A. He came to me the first serious alarm himself, and said he thought there were thieves about - that was three or four four weeks before this, and after that I sometimes called him up: Akers did not sleep in the house on the night the robbery was supposed to have taken place - I am quite positive of that; he was there that day, I believe; he was in the garden when the prisoner found the case in the ivy - he was not at work there; it was Sunday - he had come to make an excuse for not coming to set up the night before, as Price had desired him; I opened the case in the presence of Akers and the prisoner, when it was found - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the things were put into the garden, had you any workmen about the premises? A. I had Akers, but nobody else that day - I believe not; I am pretty sure Fox, the bricklayer, was not there - I will not swear it, but am pretty sure his work was done then; the prisoner had a key of the garden gate, and I had one- I had deprived my maid-servant of a key; she did not let the prisoner in and out - he let himself in and out; he usually went to town at seven o'clock in the morning- he left at eight the morning after the robbery; he usually returned about five, and often later - I did not have a fire lighted in the parlour after the things were deposited in the garden - I thought Price a designing man, but did not at first suspect him of this; he came to lodge with me in consequence of an advertisement which was inserted by my agent, Mr. Dyer. of Knightsbridge - it was headed, "Gratis;" it was stated in the advertisement that it was by way of protection, but that was my motive; I left it to Mr. Dyer to inquire into the prisoner's respectability - I went to Mr. Dyer after the robbery. the prisoner's wife said he should be there, but I thought it best not to meet him - they came to lodge there on the 22nd of June; I never lived alone in the cottage - Barnwell, his wife, and daughter lived there before; Mr. Robinson never lived there - I was formerly acquainted with Mr. Robinson, but he was never at the cottage; there was not a crim. con. trial about him, that was about Mr. Dunn - I was the wife of General Dyott; I believe he is now living - I was never in France with Mr. Robinson; I never travelled with him - he has lived in a house with me; persons have not been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my cottage - not since I lived there; Barnwell only left the house a few months before the prisoner came - no men were in the habit of coming there, except a carpenter or so, or an attorney on business - I never charged any other person with the felony; about a year and a half ago a good deal of my money was embezzled - received for my trustees; not stolen, but embezzled - I indicted a person named Eager for it: he was found guilty, and was six weeks in the House of Correction - I never made a charge of any kind against Clark, or any gardener; I missed some silver spoons, but charged nobody with that - they were not found; I did not go by the name of Miss Innes - I was for a short time, without any satisfactory reason, called Mrs. Egerton; I know no reason for it - it was very unwise advice; my accounts were never made out in the name of Innes - I pay ready money for almost every thing; I have very few accounts - I have printed my memoirs; I was never confined in any asylum as not being of sound mind - I had but one watch; I hardly ever used it - I think the prisoner has seen the watch; he did not abscond - he continued at the house after the charge, till he removed at the suggestion of a gentleman; I wished him to remove, but he continued there a fortnight - the Magistrate suggested that he should remove, and he did; he gave bail on this charge - he never advanced me a farthing; he has arrested me, but what for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he never paid for coals for you? A. I have not received the coal-merchant's bill - he persuaded me to let him order a chaldron of coals, but whether he paid for them I do not know; I never pawned my trinkets, except when my money was embezzled, and I was under the necessity of raising a little.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it before or after he was held to bail that he arrested you? A. After.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of this transaction, I went down to make inquiries at the prosecutrix's house - the prisoner went to Bow-street, and was bailed there; I saw the place where the jewels were buried - the hole was at the bottom of the garden wall, so that no person could see where the jewels were deposited; no person in the adjacent houses could overlook the place.</p>
               <p>MRS. DYOTT re-examined. My income is 800l. a year. Prisoner's Defence My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury - The endeavours of my counsel I hope will convince you of my innocence of the offence - Gentlemen, nothing but malice has been the reason of her appearing on a charge so unfounded, which I hope to be able to prove by my friends, and restore my character which previous to this transaction was unsullied! when I consider I am the third or fourth person who have unfortunately been subject to similar inquiries to the one in question, nearly all of whom proved their innocence after having been subject to very heavy expences as myself, I hope to convince you Mrs. Dyott's character will not stand in the scale with my own, and I hope the Jury will prove her statement false and unfounded, after hearing my wit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090112"></xptr>nesses - I know nothing of the property; I never saw it- she cannot prove I ever saw it; I advised her to remove it to a banker's, and when she stated she had no banker, I can prove I advised her to lodge it in the custody of a pawnbroker, even if she paid interest, and she told me she paid 15 per cent. interest on it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Parson's-green - I have lived there about nine years, and have some houses in the neighbourhood. I have worked for Mrs. Dyott, and was at work for her on Thursday, the 21st of October, on her premises, in the house - I am certain of the date; I did not hear of this robbery till the Sunday - I was watching at Mrs. Dyott's on the Friday night; it was after the property had been taken, I am quite sure - I was not watching there the night before(Thursday) I am quite sure; Friday was the only night; I was watching - nothing particular happened that night; pistols were fired off by Mrs. Dyott's wish several times - she wished pistols to be fired several times - I did not take off my clothes all night - I laid down on the bed; Mrs. Dyott called me up - she said nothing particular to me; she merely called Price - I heard her call him; he answered, and then I got up - Mrs. Dyott said she thought somebody was getting in at the drawing-room window; we were then on the ground floor, in Mrs. Dyott's bed-room - she bad removed her bed up stairs that evening; nothing else occurred - we went to examine, but saw nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. About what time of night was this? A. About half-past three o'clock in the morning, I think - the pistols were fired that persons might know there were people in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. Do you remember on Sunday being in the garden with Mrs. Dyott and the prisoner? A. Yes - she wished me to help to take down the ivy which grew by the wall; Price was taking it down at one end of the wall, and I at the other, as Mrs. Dyott wished to have the wall whitewashed - she said she thought it should be whitened, that by looking out of window they might see persons about the house; while Price was taking it down, Mrs. Dyott called me aside to explain what work I was to do next day - Price came up, and laid hold of a piece of ivy which I had left half down- he pulled it quite down, and there was the leather case in the ivy; I saw it found there - Price could not have put it there at that time, and I do not think that Mrs. Dyott could, unless she did it while I was away at the harbour, which is at the end of the wall, where Price was pulling it down; Mrs. Dyott said she was very glad she had got that, that was all she cared for, but there was another red morocco case, which she should like to get, but that was not of so much consequence - the locket in the red case had been found at that time; I was not called in to take care of the premises before the Friday.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you know the locket in the red case had been found? A. Mrs. Dyott mentioned it on the Sunday morning, while we were in the garden; she said there was another morocco case besides the one found - I have not the slightest notion who put the case in the ivy; Price had finished pulling the ivy down at his end - the case was found at the place I was at; I did not see it till he discovered it - I have known him three or four months; Mrs. Dyott asked me to watch the premises on Friday - that was the first and only time I sat up - Price and I were not in the same bed; he was in his own bed, not in the same room; he did not tell me of the robbery that night - I never heard of it till the Sunday; he never told me Mrs. Dyott had complained of losing her jewels - I never heard it from him, nor from Mrs. Dyott, nor the servant, till Sunday - that I swear; I never said I had any idea who robbed the premises - I have no recollection of having said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you never express any opinion about it? A. Never, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why tell me you did not recollect? on your oath, did you never tell any body you thought you knew who robbed the premises? A. I never said any such thing, nor that I did know who robbed Mrs. Dyott, nor that I and Price shared the plunder between us; I was in no public-house the night after the robbery- I was at the Royal Oak on Sunday; I have been there about three times - Moore keeps the house; I was drinking with him on the Sunday after the robbery, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and I think I left there about seven in the evening - we were not great friends; I was not drinking all the time - I should think we had three or four pots of beer, but no spirits; I was not altogether intoxicated - I was not perfectly sober; I am not certain whether I had four or five pints - I do not consider that I drank five pints altogether; I was rather elevated.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, when you got a little elevated, did you not tell Moore something to this effect, that you and Price made a good night of it, and never made a better night than the night Mrs. Dyott was robbed? A. I only say I never said such a word, nor any thing of the kind, nor to that effect, nor did I mention the red morocco case to him, nor a red case, or red pocket book, nothing of the kind; we were not particular friends - I was not with him all the time; I did not talk with him about the robbery at all, to my knowledge - I said nothing to him about the robbery; I rather think I mentioned finding the case in the ivy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if you think it rather might be mentioned, how came you to swear that Mrs. Dyott's robbery was not mentioned? A. I cannot say - I rather think the jewelcase was mentioned; I am not certain of it - I did not know what the case contained; not when I was at the public-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now recollect what you have said before; do you mean to assert, that at the time you might have mentioned the jewellery-case being found, you did not know what it contained? A. No, I did not know.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to represent, that when Mrs. Dyott's box was handed to her, she did not open it to see if the jewels were gone or not? A. She took it in doors - she did not open it in my presence; she had taken it in before she spoke of the red morocco box being more valuable - she did not open it in the garden to see if the jewels were safe, nor even shake it; she took it in doors, then came back, and said there was another large morocco box, she should wish to have that found if she could; that the one lost was more valuable than that- she said she did not care much about that as long as she got the blue one, that was not of so much value; I under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090113"></xptr>stood the one not found to be the most valuable - it was after that I went to Moore's.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear you did not know the box contained jewels at the time you was at the public-house? A. I did not know what it contained; I have sworn she said the jewels were more valuable in one, than that which was not found, but I did not know what it contained, no more than what she said - she merely mentioned it in the garden; I heard her say something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going a little further with Moore, and saying, what d - d fools you were to restore any part of the property? A. No; I swear nothing of that kind took place; I was not speaking to Moore about the jewel-box which we found - I never meationed it to him; I do not think I said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you forget whether you spoke of it to Moore? A. I think I might forget: it was found about half-past ten, and I went to Moore's between eleven and twelve - it was not spoken about; it was not mentioned to my knowledge - I do not recollect speaking to him at all of Mrs. Dyott; I had never fired out of window before; I do not recollect telling him I had been up all night, firing out of window; I do not think I told him a word about it - I might have done so and forgot it; I am quite sure I never told him it had been a good night for me - I do not recollect talking to him about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know what you was doing? A. Most likely not; I do not recollect at all - I was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fix the quantity of beer drank at five pints in eight hours? A. It might be more; I am almost positive I never said any thing about its being a good night &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to repeat that you were so sober you never mentioned any thing of the kind, and could not without remembering it? A. Yes; I never did mention to him any thing about finding the box in the ivy, and firing out of window - I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was so flurried when called upon for my defence, I did not at that moment recollect it; but being provided with memorandums which I had written, I should feel particularly obliged to be allowed to state it in the presence of Mrs. Dyott, and she will not do me the injustice to say I did not wish her to act by my determination - about twelve o'clock on the Friday, Mrs. Dyott searched for the property; the maid-servant came to my office with a letter, who from I do not know, but understood it was from Mrs. Dyott - it intimated a wish that I should meet her at Mr. Dyer's, at Knightsbridge; I left my books loose on the desk, took the coach and went to Dyer's- he said Mrs. Dyott had just left, and advised me to recommend her to go to Bow-street; he said he was not aware that she had the property she reported to have lost, or he would have advised her to put it into his hands - I left him, intending to advise her to return with me to Bow-street; I went on Baston's coach, and overtook the maidservant at Queen's-elms, who had rode with me to Mr. Dyer's - I saw Mrs. Dyott, who repeated to me her loss; she spoke in a very careless manner, which induced me to believe she had not lost what she represented; I immediately offered her all my keys, to look at my rooms, if she suspected me - I, of course, knew she had lost them, from what I heard at Mr. Dyer's, and what she told me herself; she said he shad no suspicion of me, and refused to search- I stated that the next day was a Board-day, that I was very busy, and should be obliged to start very early in the morning of Friday, and it is said that betrayed my guilt; now I left at eight o'clock that morning, and left word with Akers to tell Mrs. Dyott I would be home in the middle of the day, and she did not wait for my coming home, but sent to me, as I have represented; I begged her to return with me to town, and go to Bow-street, for I would do my best to serve her; but in consequence of the expences she said she had incurred from the loss she repeated to your Lordships this morning, she said she did not care about it, for the thieves had got all they could have - she would not allow me to go to Bow-street; I was obliged to go to town to finish some reports, and on my return in the evening I found Akers had not left, but was to sit up the greater part of the night, and on Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, I rapped at Mrs. Dyott's bed-room door, and asked if it was her wish I should go to Bow-street and make some inquiry - she said No, it was not, and she would not give me authority to go; I went to the office, returned in the evening, and on Monday morning, before I left my bed-room, Akers called to see me about the limewhiting of the walls at the back of the house - I immediately accompanied him and Mrs. Dyott; (he had been on Saturday pulling down ivy,) the case was found on Sunday morning, and as soon as Mrs. Dyott had got the case, I never saw the contents - she took it herself from the ivybush and fell down in hysterics; I caught her in my arms, but she never let it fall out of her hand - she wished me to order an omnibus to call for her at two o'clock, and she took with her to Brompton a trunk - what it contained I do not know; I never saw it - she promised to return on the Monday, to search for some other things, as it was probable, having found one, she might find another; she never came, and on Tuesday the officers saw the premises - I went with them into the drawing-room, of my own accord; Ledbetter said it was a curious circumstance - I said it was, but I was perfectly innocent; he wished me to meet him at the office on the following day at twelve o'clock - I said I could not at that time, having business of importance to do; two o'clock was appointed, and at two I arrived, with the intention of seeing Mrs. Dyott, but I was surprised to find a statement made very much to my prejudice - I knew nothing about it; I remained on the premises for a week - perhaps your Lordships will ask Mrs. Dyott if I did not wish her to go to Bow-street for advice.</p>
               <p>MRS. DYOTT re-examined. I have attended to what the prisoner has stated - he told me after the robbery that it would be proper to make inquiry at a public-office; his wife had sent him the letter by my servant, and she proposed my meeting him at Mr. Dyer's, but I declined - I went to Mr. Dyer's immediately, and did not see him - he came to my house about one o'clock that day; I was a little overcome when the jewel-case was found, but did not go into hysterics; I am not hysterical.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner support you? A. He stood close to me at the time, and I was a little agitated.</p>

            . I was in Mrs. Dyott's service for thirteen months - I heard her and the prisoner talking about moving some valuables from the well in the room-drawing - I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090114"></xptr>in the kitchen, they were in the hall, and I could distinctly hear what they said; I heard Mrs. Dyott say she thought they had better be put out in the summer-house; Price said, "Ma'am, I think they are safer where they are," and he told her she had better put them into her banker's hands - I am sure I heard that, and she said, "Oh, no; I think putting them into the pawnbroker's would be a great deal better;" this conversation was on the Sunday night before the robbery - they were put into the garden on the following Monday morning; I donot know that, but I was told so afterwards - I was sent to the Post-office rather before seven o'clock in the Monday morning; Mrs. Dyott sent me - she said, "Jane, go for this letter A. B. to the Post-office, and you need not hurry yourself;" the Post-office is about ten minutes' walk from there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this on Sunday? A. No, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. Do you remember the Thursday night following? A. Yes, the night before the property was missed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be very particular; was Akers in your mistress' house on that Thursday night? A. Yes, he was in the house all that night; he never went out, and he was also there all Friday night - on both nights: I let him in and out; I had a key of the garden-gate, which I always kept myself - I used always to let the prisoner in and out; Mrs. Dyott had two keys for her own use, besides the one I had - Akers was at work in the kitchen on the Monday before the robbery; there was no other workman about the premises - he sometimes came to work at six o'clock, and sometimes at five; he was not in the house when I was sent to the Post-office - the door to the prisoner's part of the house was different from Mrs. Dyott's, but she used to have the doors of the house locked up by half-past five in the afternoon - the garden-gate leads to both entrances; if the prisoner went to the hole at the bottom of her garden the shortest way from his own door, he must get over a wooden partition, which is very high, by Mrs. Dyott's bed-room - her bed-room window is opposite it; he could not have got over that fence - he would have broken it down; it is slight like a verands.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, if he had gone at any time to that part of the garden he would have had to go from his own door all round by Mrs. Dyott's window? A. Yes, and then she must have seen him - he must pass her dining-room, drawing-room, and bed-room windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether between the Monday and Thursday, Mrs. Dyott had a fire made in the dining-room? A, Yes, she had one in the drawing-room and dining-room - she was in her bed-room the whole of the day; she did not say why she had the fire - she would not suffer me to go in there; it was not usual to have a fire in the dining-room - she used to sit in the kitchen before; I was there before the prisoner came to live there Mrs. Dyott was always afraid of thieves before they came - I am quite sure Akers was in the house on Thursday night, and I heard a noise that night with the glass door in the hall; I went, and told Mrs. Dyott - she desired Price not to go out; this was about one o'clock in the middle of the night - the noise was outside the house; Mrs. Price went into her own room when I told her - nobody was sleeping in that room; she changed her bed after Thursday night, and went up stairs - Akers was up, I, and all of us - Mrs. Dyott was up part of the night, and Mr. and Mrs. Price were up the whole night; I alarmed Mrs. Dyott at one o'clock - she then went up stairs; the window looked into the garden, I heard her desire Mr. Price to fire at that man - she had been looking out of window for some time - the whole evening - I was down in the hall, where my bed is; Price got up upon this alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by his getting up; what did he do? A. He dressed himself, and was with Mrs. Dyott the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Price gone to bed before one o'clock? A. No, but I saw him dressing himself; he had gone to bed - he went to lay down on his bed, and Mrs. Dyott came after him again; I do not know whether Mrs. Price was in bed- I was not in the room; I saw her up after one o'clock: Price and Akers were up stairs watching the men about the premises - Mrs. Dyott said she saw three men, and pointed towards them; she said to Price, "There, I see three men plain; shoot at them;" on my oath I heard her say that; it was about an hour after Price was up - he shot at them, and she asked if she should see them dead tomorrow morning; he said he did not know - Price did not go out the whole night; Mrs. Dyott told him to fire through the glass if he saw any one - he lifted up the window to fire at the three men; I am sure Akers was in the house at the time; he fired once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure he fired on the Thursday night, at the three men? A. Yes, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. Do you remember at what time Price left the house next morning? A. A little after seven o'clock - I was sent to the Post-office on the Monday: Mrs. Dyott sent me to Chelsea for some brocoli on the Friday morning, and when I came back she told me to go to Mr. Price, and she gave me a letter - that was about nine o'clock; I gave him the letter, and he came back to the cottage with me immediately - he took the coach, and stopped at Mr. Dyer's, at Knightsbridge; I went on, and Mr. Price overtook me - I went on to the cottage with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived about thirteen months with Mrs. Dyott - have you ever seen any singularity of behaviour in her? A. I think she is a very bad woman, Sir; sometimes three or four gentlemen came to the house in the course of a day - they have staid there about an hour or two; she told me not to come into the room unless she called - Price had no key to the gate; some time before I went to my mistress she went by the name of Miss Innes; I never heard her answer to that name - my father served her with milk, and used to send her bills in that name; I know she went by that name in the village - it was four years ago; I have seen her walking about the house without any clothes on whatever, none at all.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this as true, as that Akers was at the house all night on Thursday? A. Yes, I swear he was there all Thursday night; he was in the house two nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he there for on Thursday night? A. She said she was surrounded by thieves, and he had better stay- she gave him a pistol; she said this about five o'clock: he had been working there all day - I saw her give him the pistol, powder, and ball; she gave him, I should think,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090115"></xptr>about 100 bullets; the powder was in a dram, a little tin box - I saw it opened, and saw the powder in it; she opened it before me - the bullets were not in any thing; Mr. Price gave him the bullets - Mrs. Dyott sat up all night making bullets; Mr. Price made them out of some shot - I saw him making them in his own kitchen; he had the shot in a small fire-shovel - there was about half a pound of shot; I and Mrs. Dyott were in the kitchen with him when he was making the bulltes; perhaps there was not so much shot as would fill that little thing (an ink-stand); I sat by looking at him - he made one hundred balls, I think - I did not count them; he made them out of not quite that thing full of shot; it was middling size shot - he made them on the Tuesday night before the Thursday; I saw him give the hundred balls to Akers - he said, "Akers you can take these balls, and if you hear any body you can fire;" Mrs. Dyott gave Akers the pistol - Price had a pistol himself; he threw himself on the bed on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely took a little nap in his clothes? A. Yes - I saw him get up and dress himself afterwards; he did not go to bed twice.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he got up and dressed himself? you told his Lordship you were all up the whole night? A. Mrs. Dyott told him she was annoyed with thieves about one o'clock; Mrs. Dyott can see very well - I heard her point out the man to Price, and then he fired; it was about half-past one o'clock - it was getting rather lighter, light enough for him to have seen the three men; I am sure of it - I did not look out of window, but I know it was quite light; she could see them in the garden - she said she saw one with a smock-frock on; Price was looking out of window at the time - I do not know where Akers was when Price fired; he was in the house - I saw him there that night, and spoke to him; I have no doubt of his being there - I am sure he sat up both Thursday and Friday nights - Mrs. Dyott missed her things on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, she made a dreadful fuss about her jewels in the house? A. Yes, I did not hear her make a fuss; I have sworn just now she did make a dreadful fuss.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did she make a terrible fuss about it on the Friday? A. Yes, she told both Price and Akers on the Friday that she had lost her jewels - I heard her tell them - they both said they were very sorry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Akers has sworn that he never heard Mr. Dyott had lost her jewels till Sunday morning, would he not have sworn what is not true? A. Yes. When my mistress sent me to the Post-office, she told me I need not hurry: Price was there that morning - I am sure it was not Thursday; it was Monday, for I went to my mother that morning - I could have quitted Mrs. Dyott with a week's notice, but her housekeeper was mistress over me.</p>
               <p>Q. But would you stop in the house with a bad woman that walked naked through the house? A. I did not see her before - it was about two months ago; it was after the robbery - the robbery was about a month ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it true or not that you have seen your mistress walk naked through the house since the robbery? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Be careful now - when did you see her walking naked since the robbery? A. A fortnight before I left; it was in her bed-room in her house at Walham-green - it was about a month ago; it was after the robbery - it is longer than a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months? A. Not so long as that - I do not know what month it was in; a month is four weeks; she walked up and down stairs naked, all through the house; every body could see her - Mr. Price could see her if he came in, and the gentlemen who called, if they came; she walked even without her shift, in cold weather.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after the robbery did you leave her? A. About three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear she staid three weeks in the house after the robbery? A. No, she went away on the Sunday morning, but she came backwards and forwards, and changed her clothes, and put on clean ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what you mean by walking naked? A. And then she went up-stairs in the same state - I was left to take are of the house when she left; Mr. Price remained there - he and Mrs. Price must have seen this; Mrs. Price was at home all day - I never mentioned to any body that I had seen her walking naked - not before I came here; Yes I did, I mentioned it to Mr. Smyth, the prisoner's solicitor, about three nights ago - I live with my father and mother; I never mentioned it to them, nor to any body but Mr. Smyth, and Mr. and Mrs. Price - I do not know how many times I have seen her walk naked; it was not half a dozen times - Mrs. Price never saw it, for she never went into any apartment unless I was with her, and Mrs. Dyott never went so before Mrs. Price - sometimes she undressed in the drawing-room, and sometimes in the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not walking about the house naked? A. No; she would go into the garden - she did not go there quite naked; she went up-stairs from the lower part of the house quite naked; Akers was not in the house when she did it - I never told him of it: I told Mr. and Mrs. Price of it several times - I saw her every morning, and when I saw her I told Mrs. Price; I saw Mrs. Dyott walking naked every morning for the last two months I was with her; this was for two months running - I did not tell Akers of it till the last day or two; I had mentioned it to him within the last day or two.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and joiner. In October last I opened a beer shop at Fulham, on a Sunday in October; six or seven weeks, ago Akers came there, about eleven o'clock in the morning; I had not heard of this robbery till he came - he staid till about nine o'clock in the evening; he and I had a pint or two of beer -I am not allowed to draw in the time of service, and he drank by himself afterwards - I have known him three or four years, and have worked with him: he said to me, "I have made a good thing of it," and said he had been at work at our old shop, Mrs. Dyott's; he said, "We were d - d fools not to take the one away that we left behind some ivy;" he called it a box, and said it was left behind some ivy against the wall - I am sure he said, We; he said Price and he were there together at night - that he went out and fired a pistol in the air, and then ran back and told Mrs. Dyott that some robbers out there had fired at him - he had been talking of himself and Price; I am sure he said, "We were d - d fools not to take away the box left behind the ivy, as well as the rest" - and said it was worth 60l.</p>

               <p>MR. HURCOMB. Q. You have left Fulham now? A. No, my wife is there now - I have lived at Sheen, in Berks; I did not go away from there, leaving my wife and family chargeable to the parish, for I had no wife then, nor have I done so since - I have not been there for these five years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS, Q. You left your wife at Fulham? A. Yes, to-day; I have not been to Newbury these three years - I have worked at Fulham these five years, but have been home once.</p>

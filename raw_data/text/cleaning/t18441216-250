                  </hi>. I am a wine-porter, and live at Lambeth. On the 12th of Dec. I was in Little Russell-street, Covent-garden—I noticed the pri<lb></lb>soner and another lad—the prisoner was standing inside the doorway of a tobacconist's shop for nearly twenty minutes, and running backwards and forwards, as if waiting for an opportunity—this attracted my attention, and I watched him and his companion to Drury-lane—they went to a pie-shop, and then the prisoner went to a hatter's shop, he went inside the door, and reached this hat down—he came out, put it on his head, and carried his cap in his hand—he was about moving off, when I ran across the road—he saw me, and threw this hat down—I took it up, and called, "Police!"—the prisoner then disappeared down a small passage—I ran down after him—a neighbour told me a lad had run into the first house—I went in there, and saw a woman with a light—I told her I wanted somebody who had come in there—she said no one had come in there, and she blew out the light—there had been a light in the right-hand room, and that was put out at the same moment—I waited till the policeman came—he and I went into the right-hand room, and there was the prisoner on the bed, with his cap and coat and shoes off—he said he had been in bed all day—I asked him if he belonged to that cap which was on the floor—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You are the person I want"—he said, "I heard you say to the policeman that a boy ran down here that stole a hat"—I had not mentioned anything of the sort.</p>

I pursued directly, calling Stop thief! and somebody came behind me in Golden-lane, and struck me a severe blow over the ear, which hindered my observation - I had, before that, seen Bodell turn up Busket-alley, which leads into Whitecross-street. I described him to Harrison - he wore a blue coat, and, I believe, corderoy trousers; I went that night with Harrison to the Barley-mow, public-house, Blue Anchor-alley, and saw about a dozen people there, but he was not there. On Sunday evening the officer called, and shewed me some lace, cambric, and Irish linen; I went to the office on Monday, there were about thirty persons there; I pointed out Bodell at once as the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 8th of September, Lovegrove described the person and dress of Bodell to me; but I did not know where he lived. I went to the Barley-mow, he was not there - next evening Lock and I went to the Barley-mow again; we found Bodell there, and a man named Burke - we took them both, but Burke was discharged at the office; we put them into the watch-house, then went to Burke's lodging, and found Hammond there; I asked her where Burke was, she said she expected him every minute to tea, the tea-things were on the table. I saw a bag hanging by the fire-side, and in it found this piece of lace, and a piece of cambric; she said Burke had brought them in, in his hat, and gave them to her - Lock turned the bed down, and under the clothes found this Irish linen. I went to Worship-street; put Bodell into the room with twenty or thirty others, and Lovegrove immediately identified him.</p>

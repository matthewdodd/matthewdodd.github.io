               <p>GEORGE JOHNSON. On the 9th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a public-house in <placeName id="t18280703-132-crimeloc667">White Lion-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you say I was not the man? A. No.</p>

At twenty minutes past eleven o'clock that night I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030062"></xptr>Mr. Colson's, the White Lion public-house, White Lionsquare, Whitechapel; I saw the prosecutor standing in a mob, and I saw the prisoner take his hand out of his pocket - a lame man was in company with him, who got away then, but he has since been committed for three months; I called my brother officer, and we took the prisoner into custody - I am certain he is the man who had his hand in the prosecutor's pocket; I charged him with it at the moment - I think I saw something pass from the prisoner to the lame man: the prosecutor gave the same account at the office, as he has now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you saw me take my hand out of the pocket, why did you not seize me? A. I did, and charged you at the moment, but did not search you.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Moore - we were passing the house at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, and heard a disturbance; we went and saw the landlord and several persons turn the prosecutor out; he said he would have satisfaction and was going to play the dence with them - I could not get out of him what it was; he said they had robbed him - I said "Look round and see if you can see the party;" he said he could not see the person - my partner came up and said "I saw this man take his hand out of his pocket," I said "If you saw him, take him into custody;" he did so; there were one or two more suspicious characters - we went after them, but they got away; I took the prosecutor to the office and found 4s. 8d. on the prisoner.</p>

At eleven o'clock at night, I went to the house to have something to drink; I saw this man quarrelling with some young women and some other persons - he was turned out and came in again, he struck the young woman and said he was robbed; then the officer came in and said I was one who had my hand in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Christmas. The prisoner has been in my service, and left me on this day week—I have been very ill, and she used to attend me—I did not know she Was gone till I missed my cloak, veil, and other things—they axe here now—this cloak and veil are mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I missed them within half an hour of the time she left me—I was confined to my bed at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She allowed me to wear the things. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not know that she had the things on her—she asked me once to lend her the cloak I have on, but she let me have that again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She did so to all the lodgers—before she was indicted she used to go out and pick up dirty girls and dress them, and she was sent to Brixton. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. What I have done I have suffered for, and I am sorry for it, but I have not done it since—she came to me as a charwoman—she never brought any men to my house—she never saw any one in the house more than myself—I did not take her to Ratcliff-highway with one of the lodgers—I did not give her leave to wear the things, nor pledge the candle<lb></lb>sticks, which she did—I never allowed her to pledge them.</p>

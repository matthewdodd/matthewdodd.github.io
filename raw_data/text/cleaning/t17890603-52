               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. All those sheep were your property, Mr. Bennett? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Have you any persons concerned with you in the trade of drover? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>In driving so large a stock, some of them will get astray? - No, if there was a few it might be done, but being so many together, they will keep to one another, it is impossible they should ever get away one from another; I have had two thousand together,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030073"></xptr>and never lost any of them; it is not usual, that I swear positively.</p>
               <p>Who counted this stock? - I counted them myself; I set out from my own house, five miles from Whitechapel-church; my servant when he came to market told me that there was so many; I told them over when I came to market, I counted them when they were at home, and when they came to market; I never trust to my servants, I counted them at home on the Sunday night before they came to market.</p>
               <p>Who set out with them? - My man set out with them, not myself; I came after them with some bullocks to market, I did not come from home till twelve, the sheep set out about eight, my man is here; I have only one man as a servant, I have others that work for me, and assist in collecting, and folding my cattle, and they did on this occasion; they did not assist in counting them, I counted them myself; they divide them and tell them over, and then I tell them over afterwards; I count them at home as they run out of the gate.</p>
               <p>Then you pretend to say that they running through a gate, you are accurate in counting them? - Yes, there were twenty-three score and seventeen.</p>
               <p>I believe in telling, you now and then reckon more than twenty to the score? - No, never.</p>
               <p>You know nothing as to Jacobs? - No.</p>
               <p>You found these in Sillitoe's premises? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One thing, I confess, struck me a little, you said they were concealed in his place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you, on your oath, whether they were in any other place than what his cattle is usually put into, which he receives as a butcher? - It was a little bit of a pound, it is paled up pretty high, that nobody can see them backwards.</p>
               <p>Was not this cattle in the ordinary place in which he keeps his cattle in the course of his business? - I cannot say that they were in any other place.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, whether this cattle, which you state to have been concealed, was in any other place than that in which the man, in the fair course of his business, usually keeps his cattle? - I cannot say no otherwise, only as that place was, they were in that place.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that they were concealed in any place, in which a person going to this man in the course of his business, would not expect to find cattle? - They were in a back place; I can say no otherwise.</p>
               <p>You cannot misconceive the purport of this question; were they, or were they not in that part of his premises in which, according to the course of his trade cattle would be found? - They were adjoining to his house.</p>
               <p>Is that an answer that an honest man would give respecting a man's liberty for fourteen years; were they or were they not, I am sure (it is a pertinent question) in that part of Sillitoe's premises, in which any person's cattle, in the course of their business, would be found? - If we had not had an idea, we could not have found them.</p>
               <p>I put the question again? - I found them in the place where he always puts them as he tells me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What age are you? - About nineteen, I lived two years with my master once before, I came away, and I have lived with him about eight months; I have eight guineas a year.</p>
               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the nature of an oath? - That I should not swear false, that I should not tell a lye.</p>
               <p>Do you know who you apply to for the truth of what you say? - I know that I should say the truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Who do you call to witness to that truth? - I have nobody to witness to the truth.</p>
               <p>Who do you call to witness? - Why God.</p>
               <p>Then do not let the fear of losing these eight guineas a year, or any thing that your master can say, induce you to tell a lye? - I would not tell a lye for twenty guineas a year, I will not be influenced by any thing, if I know it, I did not count them at home; my master told me there were twenty-three score and seventeen, I cannot tell how many sheep and how many lambs, nor no man living; I cannot tell how many different marks there were.</p>
               <p>You lose sheep occasionally? - Yes, we do very often.</p>
               <p>They stray you know? - They stray or are stole; they do not stray in London, they are taken away from us; I never had a lamb or sheep strayed from me in London in my life; I never had none strayed from me; I always drive them, when my master has any to drive; I had two men with me, they are not here; I was behind them and they were before me.</p>
               <p>Of course they could give as good an account of the cattle as you can? - They were only hired men, they had not the care of the cattle; Abraham is a drover, and is employed as such by many people.</p>

               <p>The sheep were in Sillitoe's open back yard? - There was no cover over it; it was open high pales; the people might see out of the window.</p>
               <p>He is a butcher, is not he? - It looked more like a cook's shop, than a butcher's; there was meat there, dressed, in the window.</p>
               <p>Was he at that time? - No, I was in the house when my master saw them.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had your master had these lots? - We went down into the country to gather them on Saturday, and we came up on Sunday, we go first to Stanford le Hope.</p>
               <p>Do not other people collect lots marked in the same way? - My master is the only drover in the country, there is no other drover drives for the farmers that we drive for, unless a butcher goes and buys a lot himself, then he drives them home himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Bennet. Do the farmers in this part of the country usually employ more drovers than one? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a drover? - I call on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</p>
               <p>How many counties do you call in? - Sir!</p>
               <p>Do you know the meaning of the word county? - What, counting them over: oh! I call in one county, in Essex, at Stanford le Hope, about thirty miles from London.</p>

               <p>What reward is there now for a person who apprehends a sheep stealer? - What is that Sir, did you speak to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030076"></xptr>Do you mean to swear you did not hear me? - I do not know what reward there was, nor did not apprehend him on account of the reward; I do not know what reward there is for sheep stealers, I did not know there was any; I have been a drover above seven or eight years, and never heard talk that there was any reward for apprehending sheep stealers.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman, at eleven o'clock last Sunday night was a week, I was sitting in my box in Kingsland-road, and I saw some sheep go by, and I noticed them; there were four, and Mr. Sillitoe came and asked me to help him in with them; he desired me to mind his door, and he would go after them; accordingly I minded it, and I saw them go into his house, he brought them up; there were four sheep went into his house, nobody else but the drover and him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Sillitoe's is very near your watch stand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he who was doing a dishonest transaction, chose of all persons upon earth to ask an honest man who was keeping the peace to help him? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did you see the witness Wood there? - Yes; he ran by me at the time.</p>
               <p>Did Wood at that time make any application or any complaint to you about these sheep? - No, not at all; I asked Mr. Sillitoe, says I, master are they yours? he said yes, they were; and he being a housekeeper, I obeyed his orders; I had seen Wood up and down the road sometimes, he lives in the road, about two hundred yards from Sillitoe's.</p>
               <p>I believe Sillitoe bears as good a character in the parish as any man? - I cannot say to the contrary of that; I knew him to be in the butchering line.</p>

               <p>Court. At the time they were driven in by Sillitoe, was anybody with him? - Only the drover.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was called up by Wood and Mr. Bennet's man, to go to the house of Mr. Sillitoe, concerning some sheep; I knocked at the door and Mrs. Sillitoe was in bed, she answered me, the door was in about five or six minutes opened; in the back yard four sheep were found, and I think there were one or two hogs besides, they were all alive; I cannot describe the marks of the sheep; I went afterwards to apprehend the lad Jacobs in Smithfield, I took him from the room, I said I am come to take you on account of the sheep you left at the butcher's last night in Kingsland-road; says he, I left none; Mr. Bennet has the skins to produce; Sillitoe was not at home; I left word with his wife, that he must come to the justice about five or six o'clock; Mr. Sillitoe sent for Harpur and me, to let us know he was at home; I asked him how the sheep came there, and told him that he must attend the magistrate, which he did; the next day the magistrate had a multiplicity of business and did not go on this; Sillitoe was then ordered to attend again on Saturday, but Bennett chose to have a hearing on Friday; Sillitoe attended, and he was bound over by the magistrate to be a witness on this prosecution; I told him this, that the magistrate was determined to know the rights of the business, and if he had done wrong, he must answer for it, and if not, he had nothing to fear; I thought he must know the consequence; but transportation for fourteen years was not mentioned to him; the magistrate upon hearing how they found the sheep, and how Sillitoe not being at home, and being sent for and coming; he said he thought there was nothing criminal in him, and he should admit him as a witness; he never was committed, but by a certificate after Jacobs was indicted; he always said in the presence of the lad, that he left them there for the use of one Mr. Lee, and Lee was present, and he was bound over as witness: Lee was not a witness.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me what curious hand has contrived to have a prosecution for a felony, subjecting this man to fourteen years transportation?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030077"></xptr>- I cannot tell how he was indicted, but I only know there was a certificate; the magistrate sent for me, I was at home, he asked me what I knew concerning that business; I told him how I found the sheep; for the first word the woman said to me, says she, they are not ours, but left here; I then went after the boy; the boy said he knew nothing of the sheep; but as for Sillitoe, he certainly never was in our custody one hour by warrant or otherwise, till after he was indicted.</p>
               <p>Does not Sillitoe bear a good character? - I never knew him till this time, nor was in his house; I am constable of that very liberty where he lives, and I never knew him till this time; till he sent for me and Mr. Harper to know the business.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the least charge, or the least intimation of dishonesty against this man? - I never knew him till this day; the skins are here; they were delivered to Bennet for him to kill the sheep, and he or his man has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Bennett. Have you kept the skins? - Here is one of the skins; all the ewes were marked with red oker; one is marked head and rump, that is a woolled one; here is one that is marked down the near shoulder; this is the shorn one, marked down off the neck with red oker; this is the lamb skin, it is blued on the face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Who advised you to prosecute Sillitoe? - I do not know, I took my own advice; I thought he was as much concerned as the other; I went to the magistrate and asked him for a warrant, and he granted me a warrant; I was advised by many of my friends and my masters; they said I was to blame if I did not.</p>
               <p>Is there no person in Court who advised you to prosecute? - No Sir, only this gentleman, he said he thought we could find a bill against him.</p>
               <p>What is that person's name? - Mr. Dalton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Jacobs called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, as to Sillitoe, I am to submit to your Lordship, that he being before the magistrate, who had a competent jurisdiction to commit or discharge, and he heard the whole evidence; he thought proper in his discretion to discharge this man, conceiving there was no evidence that could affect him in this transaction; but he bound him over to give evidence; he took his examination, he heard all the evidence he had given, and he bound him over; it was decided in the case of Mrs. Rudd, clearly, that where a person is before a magistrate, having a competent jurisdiction, clearly admitted as evidence; that they cannot be indicted for that fact, unless they have given a separate account: it was determined on that principle before the judges, that Mrs. Rudd having been examined, and having told all she knew of the transaction, could not be indicted, excepting that she varied, and on account of that variance, she was indicted; now unless they prove he gave a false account; I take it the magistrate's jurisdiction is competent.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no examination returned from the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner is not to be injured by the neglect of the justice.</p>
               <p>Court. If you do not return his examination to me, I cannot take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no examination taken down; a person certifies that there was no examination; I take it the magistrate not having taken it in writing, should not prejudice this man.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I was present; he was bound as I tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any examination of him taken before the magistrate? - Never, none taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. The magistrate asked him whether the sheep was brought there by the lad, and he said yes; then he asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030078"></xptr>how I found them, and I told him, and he bound him over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it, he is not, after that to be indicted here for that offence; it clearly comes within the case of Mrs. Rudd.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion it is a to be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you think it differs from the case of Mrs. Rudd, which was solemnly argued and decided here; I am bound by that opinion; Mrs. Rudd was called before a magistrate, charged there with the fact; she there gave an account before the magistrate, which was an untrue and false one, and on that account only, the judges were of opinion that she should be indicted: here, there is no pretence that there is a variation from the truth of the story, which the man told before the magistrate; I take it he is precisely within that case.</p>
               <p>Court. I certainly should not permit you now to examine, if there had been any examination returned, I should not permit you to examine him as to what passed before the magistrate; and you did not examine him as to that, in his original examination, and before me there is no evidence of what he said before the magistrate; if you could have made the question so as to have it saved, you could only have made it on the ground of a written examination; or on the ground of what past before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Clearly I make it on the verbal examination.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall certainly leave it to the jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sillitoe. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Sillitoe called five witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

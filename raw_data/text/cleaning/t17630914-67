             were coming on horseback from Barnet races, between 9 and 10 at night, in the new road between Islington and London, the prisoner and another man came out of the footpath and asked what it was o'clock, he answered he could not tell; the prisoner put an oaken stick before his horse's head and stopped his horse, they both said, D - n your eyes, your money, or we will blow your brains out. He called to his companions, they fired at him directly, and afterwards struck at him several times with the stick; he thinks it was the prisoner that fired. When they found hi s companions coming up, they ran about ten or twenty yards towards Islington; he rode and got before them, and turned them back again, then the other tumbled over the rails and got off, he rode up to the prisoner and knocked him down, he got up again and was going to get over the rails, and he took him by the collar and secured him, and took the stick from his hand. (producing a large oaken stick.)</p>
               <p>Wills and Exton confirmed the account he gave.</p>

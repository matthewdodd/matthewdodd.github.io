            , I met her at Cheltenham; she went with me to Bath and Reading, where we lodged some time; she had a former sweetheart named Smart, and she found out that he lived within a mile or two of Reading, and repeatedly went after him when I was away. I then brought her to town, and furnished her a house at Chelsea. I went to Cambridge to see my uncle, and she sold off every thing, and when I returned, I could find her no where, but at last heard she was at Mr. Shackle's. I went sixteen times after her, the master said if I came there, he would shoot me. I kept single for three years, and thought it necessary for a young man like me to marry again.</p>

I was coming from chapel with my brother down Queen-street, about half-past eight at night—I saw M'Bride, Greeney, and Myers (three of the same boys I had seen before) Greeney and M'Bride bad a large copper—I know that when I first saw M'Bride and the others hammering at the door it was Monday the 30th of Dec., because the 29th was my birth-day—I am sure my birth-day was on a Sunday, and it was on the day after my birth-day I saw these boys, and I saw them with the copper on Thursday night—I gave notice of what I had seen the next day.</p>

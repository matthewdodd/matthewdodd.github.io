               <p>Q. Was he entrusted to receive money on account of your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the book that he kept the account in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have there the account of beer carried out on the 26th of November, have you the account of half a kilderkin of beer received by Mr. Owen - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q Is there any account of money received - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever apply to you on any subsequent period to rectify any mistake on that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Must he either bring back the beer or account to you of the several customers he has delivered beer to - A. He must.</p>
               <p>Q. If he takes out thirty barrels and delivers twenty he is to deliver an entery of the persons he has delivered to - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Mr. Cook was authorised to receive money as well as you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether he received it is impossible for you to tell - A. It is not, in that book the book is filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not had that book in your hands ever since it has been filled up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other gentleman that has been examined, he also received money occasionally - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you received of Mr. Cook, or accounted with Mr. Cook, for this ten shillings - A. No, we have never received it from one or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you charged this ten shillings to Mr. Cook - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Has not Mr. Owen been a ready money customer - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Knowing that Mr. Owen paid you regular, why did not you ask for that money when he had the beer - A. We have many customers that pay regular; omit one and pay two the next time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Whether the prisoner accounted to you or young Mr. Paulain, or Mr. Cook, it would be entered at the bottom of the book - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it would be corrected in that book if any error was made - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The book comes down to almost the end of the year, therefore he had the opportunity of referring back to this entry - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any alteration been made in that entry, the entry in question of Mr Owen - A None.</p>
               <p>Court. After the book is full and delivered up to you, supposing the man had said, I find I have made a mistake, I ought to have mentioned ten shillings, would it have been entred in that book. - A. No; it would have been entred in a subsequent book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make any application to you. -

               <p>MR. PAULAIN, JUN. Q. Has the prisoner ever made any application to you respecting his making a mistake of this ten shillings. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He has applied to you for various other errors for money received. - A. He has sometimes; never to Mr. Owen as I recollect.</p>

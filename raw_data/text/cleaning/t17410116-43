Accordingly he staid, and sung the Company several Songs, but half an Hour after 11 he went privately away, and the next Morning I missed the Tankard. I heard a very bad Character of the Prisoner, so I took him up on Suspicion, and advertised the Tankard, and it was stopped by Mr. Kay, and brought to me; I am sure it is the same Tankard that he drank out of, for I have not another like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether he has no more Tankards that go about the House than this?</p>

             . The woman Prisoner brought this Tankard to me on the 11th of Dec. and desired me to buy it, she told me it was the Property of one Norcatt her Husbands Master, I had some Suspicion of its being stolen, and I bid her fetch her Husband. Accordingly he came, and told me the same Story as she had done, and said that his Master was a Plummer and Painter; but he was under Misfortunes, and apprehensive of being arrested; that he was obliged to raise 7 l. and if I would lend him 2 or 3 Guineas on this Tankard, it would make up the Money. I told him it was very proper that I should see his Master ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160020"></xptr> and know whether he was the Owner of it or not; then he said his Master was at his Lodging in Summer-street , Cold Bath Fields; I accordingly went there, but no Master was to be found. The next Morning the Woman Prisoner came to me, and said, I might be very easy for there was no Advertisement; she pull'd a News-Paper out of her Pocket; and on looking over it, I found this very Tankard advertised. I then acquainted Mr. Gibson, and he told me he had got a Man in Custody, on Suspicion of stealing it; and in a few Hours I saw the Prisoner before the Justice, and knew him to be the Man that came to my Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Ask him whether it was brought in my Name?</p>
               <p>Kay. No, he said he had it from his Master.</p>

             . On the 10th of December, I was going to the other End of the Town, and called in Summer street , where the Prisoner lived. The Prisoner's Wife asked me to stay to Breakfast, and while I was there, a pretty tall Man in blue grey Cloaths came up stairs; - this was about 11 o'Clock in the Morning; he had a Tankard without a Lid under his Coat, it was tied up in a speckled Handkerchief; he said he wanted about 40 s. on it, for he was in inlection of being arrested and he delivered it to her, and she went out with it: While she was gone, the Prisoner

             came in and asked for his Wife, and the Man told him where he had sent her; in the mean Time she came up and said, the Pawnbroker suspected the Tankard was stolen; upon that, the Prisoner flew in a great Passion with his Wife, for going with it, and gave her a great Blow on the Head. The Man then desired the Prisoner to go and fetch either the Money or Tankard, and accordingly he went, and the very next News that I heard of them was, that they were in Consinement . I believe this was either Wednesday or Thursday, and I am sure it was the 10th of December .</p>
               <p>Mr. Kay. This very Woman came to me 3 or 4 Days after Lacock's Commitment, and said he was her Husband, and if she could be of any Service to him in saying any Thing in his Behalf she would; that she had received a Letter from him, and 'till then she knew nothing of the Affair.</p>
               <p>Harding . He is not my Husband; I had a lawful Husband, and he died on board the Scarborough Man of War.</p>
               <p>Gibson . It was the 10th of December that I lost my Tankard, and I did not miss it till between 11 and 12 at Night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Tankard only in the private Room, when Wilson and the Prisoner were alone; or was it carried into the Club Room ?</p>
               <p>Gibson . The Tankard was used when the Company were there, but it was at the Prisoner's Table ; - there were three or four Persons at each Table.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see any Man in the Room, in a blue grey Coat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, the Prisoner was the only Stranger in the Company; all the rest were Neighbours and creditable House keepers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of this, than the Child that is unborn; I had paid my Reckoning, at 6 o'Clock and was coming away, but he entreated me to stay and sing the Company a Song.

            . I am a watchman. On Tuesday, the 30th of May, early in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Lower Barclay-street, Portman-square, while I was calling half-past one o'clock; I followed them to Duke-street; I there stopped them, and asked what they had got-Bozier said nothing; I laid hold of his pocket, and found a quantity of nails; I asked what he had got there - he said "A few nails;" I asked if he was a carpenter - he said, "Why do you think I stole them?" I said I would know, and took him to the watch-house; I found on him a quart pot, squeezed in his hat, and a pair of shoes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220065"></xptr>- he had one shoe on his foot, and the other in his breast; I found a quantity of nails in Brown's coat pocket, a pint pot in his hat, an oil-stone in his breast, and a nail-bag round his shoulders - he gave no account how he came by them.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the Strand was it? - Near Exeter Change, The prisoner at the bar came up to me and asked me if I was a north countryman? I told him I was; we walked on about ten minutes, and he took something off the flags, on which he asked me to go into a house and see what it was; we went into a public house in the Strand, near Exeter Change, and he opened it out, and it was a red pocket book, he opened the brown paper, what he took up off the flags; within that pocket book there was this cross, in a box, and a piece of paper, saying it was value two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You read the paper? - No, I did not; he read the paper to me. There was a stout man sitting in the room, and he said I had a right to fifty pounds, if it was of that value, as I had seen him take it off the flags; on which the prisoner said he had a friend that lived close by, and he would go and get the money; the other stout man and I walked out into the street, near Exeter Change, while he went to his friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any house? - No, we walked about there about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out of the public house first, you or the prisoner? - We all went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all three walk together for that ten minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what happened after that? - He came back and said his friend was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner left you? - Yes, he left us for about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after he came back? - He returned, and said, his friend was not at home, but said, if I would leave what security I had, if I had any money, he would leave this property with me till to-morrow morning ten o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180030"></xptr>when he would call on me again, and give me the money, and the fifty pounds, which he said I should have, and he never came back the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any thing? - I gave him eighteen guineas in all; sixteen guineas and four half guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you? - He gave me this poppet as I call it.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did he take him up? - I don't know the day he took him up; the ship went away; it may be five weeks or a month afterwards, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose desire did he take him up? - At my desire. I thought it was a fraud; I think it is not the value; I was told so by one Mr. Fox.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the reason you did not produce it before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say that is the same cross you had of him? - I made a mark on the back of the cross when I gave it to Mr. Fox.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You recollect Mr. Lucas and you, and Mr. Fox going out in order to have me committed for a further examination. What was the reason I was not fully committed then? - I don't know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q.

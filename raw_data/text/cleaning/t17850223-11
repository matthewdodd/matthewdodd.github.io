               <p>Can you say with certainty that these are the same goods you carried a few days before? - Yes. As I was coming down Well-street I met the prisoner, I never saw him before to my knowledge, he appeared to be very much in liquor, he asked me the way to Thames-street; I asked him what part of Thames-street? he said, pretty near Black-friars; I told him to return again with me, for he was going quite the reverse way; he then asked me to let him carry my load, which I refused, he then asked me to go into a public house and drink a glass of gin, which I refused; he said he was going to Great St. Thomas Apostle's; I told him I was going part of the way, and I would shew him as far as I went; he came along Fenchurch-street, along Lombard-street, and along the Poultry, as far as the top of Queen-street, Cheapside; there I directed him and left him, but when I got down <placeName id="t17850223-11-crimeloc57">King-street</placeName>

               <p>How long had he it? - But a very little time.</p>
               <p>Had he it compleatly from you? - I had hold of it with one hand, I never let it go compleatly, but he had it in his arms.</p>
               <p>Was it ever out of your possession at all? - No, I cannot say it was; as soon as I felt it go, I immediately snatched it with my hand.</p>
               <p>When you snatched it with your hand, it was clear from your head, was it not? - Yes, quite gone. I ran home with it as fast as I could, and he ran after me to my own door, and took it away again, he had it then compleatly; I let it go, and secured him; when I secured him he had the bundle.</p>
               <p>Did he snatch it the second time? - He laid hold of it, I made no resistance, but caught hold of him and rung the bell instantly; the door was open, he let go the bundle, it went to the ground, and I pulled him into the house; I never lost sight of him, the prisoner is the man; he was with me altogether about a quarter of an hour, and when I got him into the warehouse he fell down and appeared to be drunk, then he got up and fell down again, and appeared to be very drunk.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you from the whole of his conduct to you that he really was drunk, or that he shammed drunk? - He appeared to be very drunk when I first met him, but when I met him in King-street, he appeared to be very sober.</p>

               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You have enquired, I believe, where this man lived since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You find he lives in Saint Thomas Apostle's as he said? - Yes, his dwelling house is there, he told me so that night, I have heard he is a housekeeper there, and has a pension from government, and is a shoemaker, and is disordered in his head at times.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear he was discharged the army for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he say it was his leather? - No, never.</p>

               <p>Did not you really see and perceive that he was very drunk in the warehouse? - He seemed so then, but not in the street.</p>
               <p>It was not very easy for a man to snatch that from a stout young man like you? - He did not snatch it quite from me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any body with him? - I did not, I heard a voice.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he had lost some leather that evening? - No, he told another person.</p>

            , between eight and nine, about half after eight; the prisoner when he came into the warehouse, at first seemed to be exceedingly in liquor, and I being at some distance went to the prisoner, he was reeling against a pack of sheeting, I went up to him and told him it was exceedingly hard that our man could not go about the streets like other porters without being stopped by him, to which he said at first, he did not stop him; I then told him I was sure he would not have been brought there if he had not; he said the reason he stopped him because he had lost a large quantity of leather; I told him that was a very wrong way of looking for his leather, that he should apply to the public office, and not stop porters; to which he said he had applied to the public office in Bow-street, and saw Sir Sampson Wright; I said then his name was upon their books; to which he said his name was not down; he then told me he was a very good kind of man, and said he rented two houses, the one he let out, and the other he occupied himself, one he said was in Saint Thomas Apostle's, and the other in a court near there, but I have forgot the place; I am sure he said one was in Saint Thomas Apostle's.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he lived? - I think he said in some court in that neighbourhood. I told him I was afraid he was not looking for leather at that time of night; and he said he should not give me any answer, for I intended to take an advantage of him, I told him that was far from our intention.</p>
               <p>Did he really appear to you to be drunk or not? - When he went away he did not.</p>
               <p>Is that Mr. Martin's chintz? - I cannot positively swear to it, we had some of them in the house some few days before, some of the pattern was given to the porter to send to Mr. Craydon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Had you good nature enough if the man was in liquor, before you sent for an officer, to send to see if he lived there, and was a man in credit? - We did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not? - I do not know it was my business, if I had left the warehouse it would not have been proper.</p>
               <p>You know you said you did not want to take any advantage of the man? - I have heard since that he does live there, and has the lease of a house.</p>
               <p>Did you search him there? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he searched in your presence? - He was not, he was searched at the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>What was found upon him? - I cannot tell, because I was not there.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard? - I would not go by hearsay, I heard he had a new pair of shoes in his pocket, and a size-stick to take measure by.</p>

               <p>How far might he run after him? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230037"></xptr> I suppose I did not see him run above twenty or thirty yards.</p>

               <p>Should you have taken him by his running for a drunken or a sober man? - Most certainly for a sober man.</p>
               <p>Then at this time there was nothing appeared to you that should make you think that the man was in liquor? - There was not, Mr. Martin's porter caught hold of his master's bell at the door, and pulled it sharply, by that time the prisoner overtook him, and there was a great struggle between them at the door, the door was opened, and Mr. Martin's porter pulled him into the house, and the door was shut, I saw a parcel which the porter had when he was running, but I did not see what was done to it by any body; the door was shut after he had dragged him into the house, and the parcel shut out of doors; I pulled the bell and somebody came and pulled the parcel in doors.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner do any thing to the parcel? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you so situated that you might have seen it? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Did they pass very quick? - Very quick.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Look at the prisoner, is that the man? - I cannot swear that is the man, it was so dark.</p>

               <p>Where not these ten skins by some mistake sold to a man in Westminster, who was a quaker? - There were seven, and they were returned to the prisoner, and he would not accept of them, there were some done, but they lay and rotted, therefore I thought it was better to sell them.</p>
               <p>Did not you declare that he had acted like a madman in this affair? - He did not behave in a proper manner.</p>
               <p>Did he appear like a man that was a little touched in his head? - I cannot say he behaved in a proper manner the two or three last times I saw him, he appeared like a madman more than any thing else; I thought he was very much out of the way when I saw him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230038"></xptr>Court. How long have you known this man? - About twelve months back.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he lived during that time? - He told me he lived at Knightsbridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. I believe he removed from Knightsbridge? - My man brought me word that he was sailed for debt, and run away from there.</p>
               <p>What skins were these? - Seal skins.</p>
               <p>Are they used by shoemakers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many of these seal skins did you return to him? - Ten, and he said there were but eight, the other seven were sold to the Quaker's in the Broad-way, and the other three were not dry.</p>
               <p>What became of the other three? - I sent the ten to him and he refused taking them, he was then laying in bed, and would not so much as see the man, nor suffer the skins to be taken into the house.</p>

               <p>I live in Bedford-street, Covent Garden, I have known the prisoner near three years, I belong to the same society, I am a shoemaker, and he is a shoemaker; I never heard any thing amiss of him in my life, he always was a very just upright man, he has received some wounds about his body and head as I have been told, and when he gets a little in liquor he is more like a man that is fit for Bedlam which I have seen.</p>
               <p>Can you call him a reasonable man? - I have seen him distracted when in liquor, and acted like a mad man; with the value of three or four pints or beer he was not fit for the company of any reasonable man; liquor did not take the same effect with other men, he has appeared to me to be sober when he came there, and in a very short time he was like a raving mad man.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you yourself ever drank in company with him? - Yes, many times drank a small quantity of beer.</p>
               <p>What state has he been in then? - Not fit to keep reasonable men company; I believe, and am almost sure he was a soldier, because I have seen him with some of the same regiment.</p>

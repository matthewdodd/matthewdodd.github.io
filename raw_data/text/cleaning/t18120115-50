On the 14th of January, in the morning before seven o'clock, I stationed my son in Philpot-lane, and myself at the corner of Rood-lane. At half past seven my son informed me that he had watched the prisoner into the White Horse, Rood-lane. Upon going in I found the prisoner and a woman there; I asked him what he was doing there; he said he came to have some gin; I asked him where the property was that he had robbed me of, and placed my back against the door to prevent him going off; he got up with the intent to lay hold of me to push me from the door; I told him he should not go out of that room untill I got an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property there - A. A loaf of sugar was found under the woman after the officer came; he and the woman only were in that box. The woman said she bought the sugar of a man. I took the woman in custody, she said she was his wife.</p>

            . On the morning of the 16th of January I stationed myself in a court in Philpot-lane, at half past seven the prisoner passed by it; I traced him into the White Horse in Rood-lane, he appeared to have something concealed under his apron. I fetched my father immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the White Horse did you find him in - A. In a small room on the right hand side of the passage. There was no one in the room but the prisoner and a woman. My father asked him where the property was that he had taken; my father was standing in the room with his back to the door to keep persons from going out; the prisoner said he had none, he came to take a glass of gin. A constable was sent for, and immediately the prisoner made a bolt at the door and tried to remove my father. The loaf of sugar was found under the woman, where she was sitting.</p>

               <p>IRELAND. I am a servant to Mr. Hedley. I only know of making up the pile of sugar that this sugar was on. I examined the pile, it was one deficient. I believe it to be my masters.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday the 16th of January I went to my work as asual about seven o'clock I opened the shop and went to get some refreshment I had a pain in my bowels; my master followed me and asked me what I had got, I said, nothing; the officer searched me and found nothing. My wife, who was acquainted with the landlord, was in there, which was the occasion of a loaf of sugar being discovered On the night before she had been to a house at Downe's warf, and on her return from that house she passed two sailors, one of them gave her a punch on the shoulder; she found he was a person who had been formerly a lodger of her's. He entered into conversation with her, and told her that he had been twice cast away; that he was in possession only of one sixpence; he asked her to lend him some money; she said she had none. She knowing him some time went to her son's master and borrowed him twelve shillings; he waited for her return in Burr-street. He requested that she would go the next morning to his ship; she went and received of him a loaf of sugar. I declare I do not know of any felony respecting the loaf of sugar in question. I am bound to believe my wife's description of the loaf of sugar to be true.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 13th of September, was she servant in the house? - A. Yes; there was only her and me at home in the morning; Mr. Harris is employed on board ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Two napkins, a linen sheet, four five-pound Bank-notes, seventeen two-pound notes, and a one-pound note, making altogether 55l.? - A. Yes, in a deal box, which contained them all, about a foot square; it contained a few memorandums, my will, and the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the shirts in the box? - A. No; they were in the drawers along with my other apparel; the watch lay on the top of the drawers, and the chain and seal to it; I kept it there sometimes the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go into the garden in the morning? - A. I went down about a quarter after eleven, and returned back about a quarter before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your things all safe before? - A. Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked? - A. To the best of my knowledge; it was a small deal box, about a foot square; I locked it the last time I was at it, and placed it at the top of my bed-tester for safety.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned, what did you observe? - A. The first thing was all my apparel strewed about the rooms I paid rent for; I found the drawers open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your box? - A. I did not think of my box directly; about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I went into the bed-room, and missed all the things I have described; one corner of the box hung over the bedstead the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person to whom you communicated it? - A. To Mr. Spraggs; he came about five or ten minutes after I returned from the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of your property since? - A. Yes, my watch, and seventeen pounds worth of notes were brought to the Police-office.</p>

Spraggs, and Chapman, to Robinson's house, No. 5, Old-street-road, and there I found Churchill; I told the aunt I should take the little girl to the office; Doutfire immediately said, Mr. Armstrong is come to enquire what I did with the sheet, what I sent the sheet here for; I said, Mr. Chapman has been robbed, and I shall try to find the things; Mrs. Robinson said, I was exceeding welcome to search her place, I said, no, I would take the girl to the office; I took her, and going along the Curtain-road, I by chance met the prisoner,

            , the girl said, "this is my uncle, sir;" I said to him, sir, I am going to take her to the Magistrate, you may step with us, and hear what it is about; he said, by all means, only let me go into the shop first; he went in, and returned to me, and we went to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay long in the shop? - A. No, not above a minute or two, no longer than to put a jacket on; I took Doutfire and the girl to the Magistrate, and Robinson was there and heard the charge exhibited by Mr. Chapman, before the Magistrate; I had dispatched Vickery and Mason to the house of Mrs. Robinson, to be in waiting, and I begged of the Magistrate to let me have a search-warrant, which he did; I went and found Mrs. Robinson and Vickery below stairs, and Mason up stairs; I read my warrant to her, and said, now, madam, I shall ask you a question, pray what was in the sheet when you opened it? Lord, sir, says she, a box, some Bank-notes, and a watch; where are they, said I, I have given them to my husband; said she, I have done it, don't hurt him; I put her into a coach, and took her to the office, where I found her husband detained; I said, Mr. Robinson, what have you done with the notes and watch your wife gave you? he said, they are in the shop; Vickery and I went to Mr. Knight's, a brass-caster, Robinson went with us instantly, we followed him into the shop, where there was some mould in a nasting-trough, he pulled the mould aside, and the first thing that appeared was the notes and watch, two 5l. three 2l. and a 1l. also a silver watch, that was all I found there; we took him back to the office and left him; we returned, and Vickery and Mason have the other things found at his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the watch to Chapman? - A. Yes, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The wife said, I have done it all, don't hurt my husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the notes in a paper? - A. Yes, in a little bit of paper, but the watch was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You took Robinson to hear the examination, not as a prisoner? - A. No, I did not mention a word to him, he staid all the examination, but when I went with the search warrant, he was detained.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew his master, Mr. Knight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Robinson, the prisoner, bear an excellent character? - A. I knew Mr. Knight, but I knew nothing of Mr. Robinson, till that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did hevnot bear that character? - A. Mr. Knight represented him as the best workman he had.</p>

Yes, this day week; I was present when Mr. Armstrong read the warrant, and when she owned it, he asked her what things were brought in the sheet, which was folded up, she said, there was a box, some Bank-notes and a watch; he asked her where the watch and Bank-notes were, she said, her husband had them; she owned she broke the box open with a poker before she sent for her husband, that he knew nothing of it, and hoped he would not be hurt, for it was her fault; on searching, I saw the pleces of the box pulled from under the bed, between the two beds; we found a parcel of new things, with a two pound note, which she owned she had taken out of the box.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What have you there? - A. A broken box, and three shirts, a silver watch and silver spoons; I went with Armstrong to the house of Robinson, and found part of a box between two beds in the same room, and three shirts in the same room, between the two beds; they would have been taken out by Mrs. Robinson; but we prevented her, and desired her to sit still; I found the sheet which she acknowledged the box to have been packed up in, the sheet that came from Doutfire; she said, she had broken the box open with a poker, and taken the things out; she acknowledged it to be part of the box; she said, there were some notes and a watch, and that she had given the notes and watch to her husband, whom she hoped would not be hurt as she had done it; we returned back a second time for some other things; I brought a watch away which was in the room with T. R. on it; I took it merely to prove it to be his apartments; the spoons and buckles are also his own.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Chapman.) Is that part of the box? - A. Yes, it contained the Bank-notes.</p>

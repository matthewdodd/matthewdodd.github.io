I went to his service on a Monday, and on the Wednesday following he came into the kitchen, and asked how long I had been in England, and if I had been married; he asked me to leave my bed-room door open, which I refused - he asked me to come down stairs the next morning, and said he would give me these things if I would leave my door open; I said I would consider of it - on the Sunday morning he abused me; I said I would let Mrs. Green know of it - when I was accused of taking these things he winked at me to say nothing, and when I was at the lock-up place he came to me and said I was a foolish girl for not consenting to his wishes.</p>

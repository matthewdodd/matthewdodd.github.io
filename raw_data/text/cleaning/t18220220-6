               <p>WALTER COBHAM. I am a servant out of employ. On the 4th of February, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock at night, my silver watch was in my fob, with a seal, two keys, and a ribbon. I was going home, along <placeName id="t18220220-6-crimeloc34">Cow-lane</placeName>

Nobody else was near me; I seized him, without losing sight of him, the watch has not been found, it cost nine guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you cry Stop thief! as soon as you missed your watch - A. Not half a minute after I received the blow the thief ran by me, and then the prisoner ran too - I do not believe he was pursuing the thief; he said he had no objection to my sending for an officer, and stopped quietly with me for a quarter of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200008"></xptr>an hour till one came. I held him all the while, he gave different accounts of himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner attempt to stop the man when he started - A. No; but kept running across me, right and left, to prevent my getting up to the man, and that made me take him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner between nine and ten o'clock, and took him to the watch-house. I asked where he had been that evening, he said to one Williams, in Fetter-lane, for some shoemaker's lasts; that he lived in French-alley, Goswell-street, and worked at a large tobacconists in the Minories, for three years, up to the present time. I was taking him to Fetter-lane, he said it was no use to take him, I had better take him to the Compter - I however, took him to the place he described, and enquired, in his hearing, but no such person as Williams was to be found. I then took him to the Minories, and on going along, he said, he had not worked there for eighteen months - I found nobody to give me an answer; he then said he got his living by going into the country with cheese and fruit.</p>

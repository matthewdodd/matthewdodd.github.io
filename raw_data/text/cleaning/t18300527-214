            . I am clerk to a stock-broker. I saw Porter take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket and pass it to Rose, who put it into his pocket - I told the prosecutor; Porter passed the prosecutor - Rose passed me, and was taken by the officer; I went on, and saw Porter tying up his garter - I did not take him, as there were several boys about calling Bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. Near four o'clock in the Bank-chambers - there were only the prisoners, the prosecutor, and myself; I had never seen Porter before - I had plenty of opportunity of looking at him; he was taken the next day I believe - I suppose five or ten minutes elapsed from the time of his taking it, till I saw him again; he was then in a turning leading to Coleman-street - he walked away from the Bank-chambers; I did not think myself bound to take him - I swear distinctly he is the boy that took it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw both the prisoners go down Bartholomew-lane, and cross into Bank-chambers - they followed the prosecutor; Rose came running back just as I got to the gate, and I took him - I do not know that I had seen him before that day, but I knew Porter; I am sure they were together - there were two others who, I suppose, were with them, but they did not go in; when they saw the bustle they ran off. I found the handkerchief on Rose.</p>

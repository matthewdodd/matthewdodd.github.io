               <p>Kingsland-road. On Thursday night, 29th Aug., about seven o'clock, I was sitting close to the door of my house, and saw the prisoner come run<lb></lb>ning after a little girl, eight or nine years old, named Louisa Rolfe, the daughter of a neighbour—they both ran into my house; he was close to her—she screamed and seemed excited—the prisoner had a clasp-knife in his hand, open, and he held it to her throat, pulled her down by the hair of her head on the ground, and said he would cut her b—throat—I seized him by the collar, and said, "Go along out, you little rascal"—he immediately turned round upon me and said, "Take that, you b——<hi rend="italic">sow,</hi>" and plunged the knife into the upper part of my right arm—it bled very much, and was bleed<lb></lb>ing for two hours and a quarter—he got away from me and ran away—I went to the doctor, and had the wound attended to, and afterwards gave informa<lb></lb>tion to the police—I was present when the prisoner was taken into custody at his mother's house, in White Bear-gardens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the Kingsland-road. On 29th Aug., Mrs. Brown came to my surgery—she had an incised wound on the outer side of the right arm, midway between the elbow and shoulder—it was about half or three-quarters of an inch in length, and extended to the bone, about half an inch in depth.</p>

On Thursday night, 29th Aug., I went to the prisoner's mother's bouse, and found him in bed—I said he must come with me for stabbing a woman—he said nothing, but cried—I asked him what he had done with the knife that he did it with—he said his sister had taken it from him—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Richard Cundell. The prisoner was in our employ as collecting clerk, and was authorized to re<lb></lb>ceive this money. On the 20th of April he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Welch and Co.'s account—I ought to have received it on that day—it would have been paid to me if he had paid it at all—I have the account here of what he paid—on the 20th of July he did not pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Welch and Margetson—Plinsall was no longer able to receive that money, he had left us in March, and there is no entry in the book of either of these sums—there are other entries—I have, since I made this discovery, spoken to the prisoner on this subject—these sums in particular were not mentioned to him, but they were with others—we asked him what he had done with the money—he could give us no account—he said he had muddled it away—that was the only phrase I could get out of him.</p>

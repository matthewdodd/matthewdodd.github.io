             concerned with them. There was two boat loads one night and two another. Conway was in one of the boats the second night. After it was taken out of the boat, Neal said it was his property. Conway said he had no concern in it; he only got his passage up in the boat. I saw part of the sugar come out of the vessel. Neal was not in the second boat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any sugar took out of the casks the second time?</p>
               <p>Henley. No; but I am certain it came out of the same ship. Two boats were loaded with sugar on Monday night. I saw the two prisoners both on Monday night; they were on board the ship helping to put it gs.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity might they take on Monday night?</p>
               <p>Henley. About 200 lb weight, I believe; the first was Monday night or Tuesday morning, the other Wednesday night or Thursday morning.</p>

I went? they did not say what it was for; they walked with me as far as Union stairs; when we came there I went along with John Hill in these boats; I went on shore in one of the boats with the sugar; I was paid 3 s. by Clark.

            . I was a carpenter on board the ship. We came up the third of July, from St. Kite's.

               <p>Reymot. About 600 lb. I received money for about 400 lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what came of the rest of the sugar; did you go on board after the sugar was sold?</p>
               <p>Reymont. Yes; there was about 90 lb. left the day after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive money of any body else besides Chambers?</p>
               <p>Reymot. No; I carried the rest home to my house?</p>

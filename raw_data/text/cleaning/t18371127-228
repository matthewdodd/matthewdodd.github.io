                  </hi>. I am a shopman to Mr. William Higginbotham, in the New Cut, Lambeth. On Saturday, the 21st of October, I saw Harvey and Stanley—between four and six o'clock, Stanley came into the shop first, and asked if Mr. Higginbotham would buy a chaise—at that time Duckrell was in the shop, but not Harvey—he came afterwards—I went and told Mr. Higginbotham that a person I knew very well was in the shop—I mentioned Stanley's name—he wanted to know if he would buy a chaise—he said he would—he came down, and Stanley spoke to him and said it had been standing at his place three months, and then Stanley went away, and when he came back I do not know whether he brought the chaise—he came into the shop, and said the chaise was outside—I observed only Stanley there, and I went out, and looked at the chaise—I went up stairs, and told Mr. Higginbotham that they had brought the chaise—he came out and looked at it, and agreed with Harvey, who was then outside with the chaise—this was near upon five o'clock—Harvey wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the chaise—Mr. Higginbotham agreed to give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Stanley for recommending him—Stanley and Harvey into the shop to receive the money—I gave Harvey a pen and some paper, and he wrote the receipt for the amount received for the chaise, and re Stanley the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the receipt—since then I have given up chaise—I sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Stevens, a neighbour opposite.</p>

I heard Thomas Rich<lb></lb>ardson examined at the office—I saw him put his mark to this paper—it was read over to him first—I believe this to be a correct statement of what he said—I can swear that he said he saw the prisoners bring the chaise to the shop—I went to apprehend Harvey on Friday night the 27th—I told him I wanted him respecting a chaise that was sold to Mr. Higginbotham, in the New Cut—he said the chaise he had sold to Mr. Higginbotham' was the property of his uncle—that was all he stated re<lb></lb>specting the chaise—Rosedale surrendered on another case.</p>

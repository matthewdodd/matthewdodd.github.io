            . I found these things in the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>MRS. POTTS. Here are four stockings, a handkerchief, and this piece of ribbon, which I know to be mine - the sovereigns were in the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the sovereigns were lost, did you not tell her about them? A. Yes, I had so much confidence in her; she did offer me her keys to search her box; she said it was unpleasant to be suspected, and cried - I said, I was sure she would not rob me of a needlefull of thread I had such a good opinion of her - she had lived with the people who kept the house before; they discharged her, and I not having a servant, kept her; one or two young men used to come to talk to her - I have a daughter, but no man comes to see her - the handkerchief was marked, and here is where the threads have been picked out; I have the roll the ribbon was cut from; one stocking was found in her box, and the rest in her bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you say about the ribbon? A. The Magistrate matched it with the roll; it tallies exactly, and the quantity is the same as is missing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not offer that if she would confess her guilt, you would not prosecute her? A. I did before she was committed; I said I was particularly fond of her, and if she would confess her guilt I would not appear against her; her father came afterwards, and said he did not think I should go on with it - I said, I must go on, as he had gone to the extreme; she did not confess - I did not wish to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She wanted to introduce me to a gentleman; she is as bad as any unfortunate girl, or she would not bring another man up to her bed instead of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110048"></xptr>husband; a man said it would be 5l. in my pocket if I would not expose her: the stockings were in another room, among some rubbish; she should be in prison instead of me.</p>

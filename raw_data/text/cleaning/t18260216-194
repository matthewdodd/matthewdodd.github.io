I was a little the worse for liquor; but not drunk - I met the prisoner there, and went with her to a house - but do not know where; I took off my jacket and waistcoat, and laid down on the bed, and went to sleep - when I laid down I had a watch, a seal, and key; a 5l. Bank note, a sovereign, half a sovereign, and 1s., in my watch-pocket. I awoke about half-past five o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was then gone - and also my watch and money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner last Thursday morning, about two o'clock; she said she was very cold, and wanted to know if there were any houses open, to get something to drink; I said, No - I met her again at four o'clock; she said she wished some house was open - I told her there would be one open in half an hour, which was the White Swan - I went there, and took down the shutters, as I generally do - we had a quartern of rum, for which she paid in halfpence; she then called for some brandy, and the young woman did not like to let her have it; she said, "I have got plenty of money," and offered a five pound note to change; but the young woman would not change it; she then to the White Hart, to Mr. Thomas, and he would not give her change; - she then went to the Coach and Horses, and there the gentleman took her, and kept the note.</p>

            . I saw this watchman and the prisoner, come to the White Hart public-house, and offer this 5l. note for change; I said it could not be right - she must have been robbing somebody - she went to the Coach and Horses public-house, and offered the note; I then gave her in charge, and went to her house, where I found the prosecutor, who said he had lost a watch and a 5l., note; I found the watch in her bosom at the watch-house - she said he had given it to her to take care of.</p>

The prisoner came and had a quartern of gin, and wanted change for a 5l. note; I asked where she got it - she said from a man at her lodging - I refused to give her change, and during the absence of Nelson, she produced a watch, which she said belonged to the man at her lodging - I believe I had seen her at my house with the man, the night before - she said he told her to put it under her pillow to take care of for him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

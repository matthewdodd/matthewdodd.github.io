On the 20th of October, the prisoner and two other men came into the shop for some pork. I served them with the pork, they paid me for it; in the mean time I saw the prisoner put some black puddings in his pocket. I am sure he is the man. I desired the prisoner to take them out of his pocket, he said he had nothing belonging to me. This was about eight o'clock at night; my son came home about five minutes afterwards, I told him of it, I saw the prisoner take them from the window, and put them into his side pocket.</p>

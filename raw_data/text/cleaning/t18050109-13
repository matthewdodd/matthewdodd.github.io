Yes, about twenty doors from Mr. Francis, the same side of the way; I was coming towards my father's, and I saw the prisoner at the window; I went and told my father that I thought he was going to cut the window, and me and my father went out together; we passed him, he was standing at the window; then we returned back again, and passed him the second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090013"></xptr>time; I then turned round, and saw he was pulling something out of the window; my father then went and laid hold of him; he dropped the silk, which I laid hold of, and held it there till Mr. Francis came out.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Francis.) How near was this roll of silk in the window to the pane of glass that was broke? - A. About the length of this roll.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, by accident of falling, this roll of silk might have broken the glass? - A. It could not have been broke by its falling, and one part of the silk was inside, and the other out, when he was taken; I do not think it could have fell there without a hand being put in.</p>

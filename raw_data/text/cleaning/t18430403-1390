I should guess—I saw nothing more of Lewis till he got to Mr. Pewtress's—he did not come into the van that I saw—I did not see Isaacs—I went down the Borough, round by Horsemonger-lane—I did not go through any turnpike—I went the straight road—I got to Mr. Pewtress's about seven o'clock, and found Lewis and the other man there to take the bags out of the van into the warehouse—I looked across the road and saw Isaacs waiting there—there was nobody to do business on Mr. Pewtress's part—I saw nobody but a young lad going in at the side door—the rags were pitched down against the wall of Mr. Pewtress's warehouse—it was about seven o'clock in the morning—I have not been paid—I was to have had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the fair price for the job was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went about a mile alto<lb></lb>gether—Isaacs proposed to give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first remember that Lewis had been to you two days before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know whether his name was Lewis—I recollected it when I was before the Magistrate—my deposi<lb></lb>tion was read over to me—they would not allow me time to mention it—Mr. Pewtress and I have not been talking this matter over—I have told him these two persons came two days before—Mr. Pewtress saw them as well as myself—I have had no conversation with him since about it, nor ever alluded to it—part of the rags were sent down to the mill, and some are now in the warehouse—they have not been given up to the prosecutor—part of them went to the mill either on Tuesday or Friday—this has been the usual habit of dealing since I have been with Mr. Pewtress—we have not been in the habit of giving or taking invoices.</p>

               <p>others of the same description—we keep the different sorts separate—we should not have shot them among the fines—there is a rapid demand for them at the mills sometimes—we supply the mills—they do not remain with us long—we only keep two sorts of rags, fines and seconds.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were these twills or seconds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We do not make any distinction between twills and seconds, nor in price, they are mixed all together—when these came in in the morning I looked at them, and took some of the twills to Mr. Pewtress before I weighed them, and said I thought there was a mixture of woollen among them, and asked him to look at them—he looked at two or three pieces, and said, "I don't think they are quite so good as they ought to be, but as there are not many of them let them go," or else we should have picked them out and returned them—the woollen would not do, if there was a great deal—twills are of a little more value than seconds; but we have but two prices, one for fines and one for seconds—we use all as seconds that are not fines—we do not sort them—they are sorted as they come in to us—if they are not right we pick them out at the time.</p>

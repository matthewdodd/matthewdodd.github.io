On the 5th of September, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from Covent Garden, where I had been to see my uncle; I met the prisoner by the Seven Dials - I was a little in liquor, and asked him to shew me the way to <placeName id="t18260914-385-crimeloc2161">Tottenham-court-road</placeName>

I lost sight of him once in turning the corner; but I heard the watchman say "We have got him;" I went up and found him in charge - the money I lost was found on him.</p>

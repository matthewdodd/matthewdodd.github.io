On the 1st of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and bought 2lbs. of sugar at 10d., 1 lb. of 8s., and 1 lb. of 6s. tea; they came to 15s. 8d. - she tendered me a 5l. note; I asked her address - she said "Jackson, No. 33, Russell-square," which I wrote on it in her presence - this is the note; I immediately suspected it was forged, from the appearance of it altogether, and knowing that Mr. Mocatta lived at No. 33, Russell-square - I went out, leaving my wife in the shop, pretending to get change, but to find a Policeman, who I brought into the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you offer to go with her to see for Jackson? A. I did, and went past the spot, but could find no one where she said he stood; she did not ask me to go to Russell-square.</p>

            . I live with my uncle, who keeps a straw bonnet shop at Aldgate. The prisoner came there about nine o'clock in the evening of the 20th of September, and looked at several bonnets - she fixed on one at 24s., and gave me a 5l. note; I asked her address - she gave me "Jackson, No. 140, Commercial-road," which I wrote on it at the time, with the date - this is the note; after writing the address I gave it to the boy to get changed, which he did; I gave her the change and bonnet - the note was returned next day from the Bank, marked "Forged."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not yours a large business? A. Rather - there was another person in the shop; I had not seen the prisoner before - the gas was lighted; she was in the shop about a quarter of an hour; I did nothing but attend on her; I saw her again in a fortnight, and have not the least doubt of her - she had a shawl and straw bonnet on; I knew her person and her face - she was without her bonnet for several minutes, trying others on.</p>

            . I am a clock and watchmaker, and live in Upper East Smithfield, near the Tower. The prisoner came to my shop on the 29th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening - I am certain of her; she asked to look at two rows of coral beads which were in my window; they were shown to her, and she asked the price - I said 22s.; she hesitated several minutes about the price -I said we never made two prices; she agreed to buy them, and paid me a 5l. Bank note, as it appeared to be; I asked her name and address - she said, "Jackson, No. 22, Lucas-street, Commercial-road;" I wrote on the note, in her presence, "Miss Jackson," but did not put the address - she saw me write it; this is the note - it has my own name under the name; I fetched the change down stairs, locked the note in my own chest, and brought down 3l. 18s., which I gave her with the heads; I paid the note to the receiver-general - it was returned to me on the Tuesday following, stamped "Forged."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain the prisoner gave you the note? A. Quite; I pointed her out at Newgate this day week, from a number of females, who were all in a row; I knew her directly I looked at her, and so did my young man - I never said I could not swear to her - she was nearly a quarter of an hour in my shop.</p>

Just as he came to me, he put his shoulder against me, and turned me round a little - I felt my watch go at the same time. I immediately seized him, told him he had got my watch, and called the watchman; I gave him to Martin, and thought I saw him throw the watch down. I found it about five feet from him, and the case lying in another place. He got from Martin, and ran off, but was secured again.</p>

               <p>"Let me go, I have done nothing." I gave him to the watchman, but he escaped from him, and ran down Burr-street - he was brought back - I know him to be the man.</p>

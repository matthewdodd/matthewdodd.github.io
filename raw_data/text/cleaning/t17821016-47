Which is a general rule with them; the prisoner said, I am going; he and several more went out of the house together, and he turned up the lane: the boatman said, Are not you going? he went into the Green Man and Ball: it is a rule for my maid to see if the rooms are empty, and how the things stand: she came and told me the prisoner had taken the sheets off the bed; I took a sculler, and went to the Gravesend boat; I could not find him; one of the men told me where he was; I went there, and brought him to my house; I was constable of the night, and I found my sheets in his bundle: he never would give much account of himself; he says he was going to Chatham, and that he has a wife and five children, but they are in the workhouse, and have been so these two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was out of a point of necessity, I beg for mercy; I have been in the woollen manufactory of a rug maker for seven years: the last seven years I have been clerk to different gentlemen in the lottery business.</p>
               <p>Court. What excuse can you make now to mitigate your offence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been out of business some time; I have a wife that lays in now; my wife has been in the workhouse, she was big with child; I had three children at home with me; I could not maintain them, and I went on the hop duty in Kent; Commissioner Scott, who was my friend, is since dead: at Chatham I had been at work, and I came to enquire after my wife, and was informed she was in labour; and she sent me word out she should be glad if I could assist her with a few shillings more than the workhouse would allow her: it was through this necessity that I did it.</p>
               <p>Court. You would have use understand that this was done on the spur of necessity; have you any body of character that can satisfy the Jury and me that you are a man of character hitherto? if you can do that, there will be no objection to your receiving favour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called no witnesses.</p>

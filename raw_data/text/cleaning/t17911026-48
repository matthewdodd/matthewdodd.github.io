               <p>I work for Mr. Russell, I found this soap under the manger in the stable, and shewed it to my master, it was about twelve o'clock last Monday week; there was straw over it. Master told me to put it there again, which I did; he told me to watch, I did so: this man came into the stable about five o'clock. He was going out of the gate, after doing up his horse, I stopped him, and he took it out of his pocket. I sent for our clerk, the prisoner took a cake out of his pocket, he delivered it to the clerk; the clerk gave it him back again, and then the officer came, and took him into custody. After the prisoner left the stable I went to look if there was any soap missing from the manger, it was gone.</p>

               <p>I am a headborough, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he was accused by Mr. Russell's clerk of stealing soap, I took him to the watch-house, I searched him, and found 10 lb. of soap in his breeches; I went to his lodgings, and found 12 1/2 lb. of soap. I do not in my own knowledge know that it was the prisoner's apartment, but he told me it was, and so did Mrs. Beard, his landlady; the soap was in a closet in his room. The soap now produced is the same which I took out of his breeches; he had a pair of trowsers over his breeches, there might be some in a side pocket.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I believe the soap to be mine, the quantity is too great to be missed, but having found this hid, it created a suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Curzon-street, and am single. On the 24th of March, I was in my kitchen, and Mrs. Lenel, who works for me, was in the parlour—she came to the head of the stairs, and gave me notice that my apartments which I had to let, were inquired after—I went up, and saw the prisoner at the parlour door—while I was telling him what I had to let, Mrs. Lenel asked me if I had my watch—I said, "No, I have not, it is on the mantel-piece"—she said, "It is not there"—I looked and missed it—I seized the prisoner by the collar, and said he had it—he said he had not—I said, "You have, and shall not go till you give it to me"—I pulled hint in to the parlour, and called Mr. Dungey, who was putting down an oil-cloth—the prisoner then put his hand into his pocket, put the watch on the table, and said, "There is your watch"—I said, "You have put it there"—he said, "I have not"—Mr. Dungey came up, and secured him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Chelsea, and am a cabinet-maker. I was in the kitchen, and heard the prosecutrix call out—I came up, and she said, "This man has stolen my watch," and said, "Give it me directly," said, "Come; deliver it up directly"—I saw him take the watch from some part of his person, and put it on the table.</p>

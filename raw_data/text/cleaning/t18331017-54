            . I am a carpenter; I live near the place - I was within ten yards of these parties at first; I came nearer to them - I heard the prisoner, who is a sweep, say to George Ashton, "If you come back I will stab you" - I was not near enough to observe whether he was crying - I ran up as fast as I could, and when I got to them, the deceased had turned round towards the prisoner and was within about two feet of him - I saw the prisoner plunge a knife into him - I did not see the knife, but he struck at him with something; the deceased fell into Crow's hands - I did not hear him say anything - I saw two sweeps there near him, they did nothing - the prisoner was standing up when I first saw him - I had not seen him coming out of any shop - Crow came out of a baker's shop - Nicholls and Stroud were with the deceased; they were very near when he was stabbed- the prisoner appeared very violent; and as if he had been put in a passion - he was very violent; I did not see anything in his hand before he struck the deceased - the deceased was returning to the prisoner when I saw them - he was moving towards the prisoner - I saw him move towards him after the prisoner said, "If you come I will stab you" - the prisoner appeared in a great rage when he said that - I did not see him take the knife out of his pocket; for all I know he might have had it in his hand before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About how far was the deceased from the prisoner, when he said, "If you come back I'll stab you"? A. I was about a hundred yards off; the last time I heard him say it, he was about two feet off; he said so two or three times - I could not see them the first time it was said - I might have heard it said three times - he was about three feet off the last time I heard it said - if the deceased had chosen he might have gone away instead of returning to the prisoner - he was older than the prisoner, and a great deal larger and stouter - it was said in the voice of a person, who was in great anger - I did not hear the prisoner say he had hit him in the eye with a tobacco-stopper - I am sure the deceased walked towards him.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. On Saturday night, about a week ago, I was with the prisoner and another sweep named John Potter, at a quarter before seven o'clock - I was quite sober; I don't know how the others were - we had been to a sugar-house, we had not been to a public-house - the deceased met us; there were two more boys with him; they were doing nothing - as they passed by, Emmett said, "He is a gone off" - he did not point to any one in particular - the deceased had gone on about ten yards before he said that; on the prisoner's saying that, he came back, and hit him in the face - it was a smart blow; I was near him, and the blow almost struck me; I heard the blow - the prisoner fell down from the blow and cried out - when he was on the ground the deceased kicked him on the thigh; I saw that - he only kicked him once; he did it with violence - Emmett began to cry, and then called the deceased a twopenny-halfpenny thief - the deceased went towards his companions, and the prisoner told him if he came back he would stick a knife into him; he said that immediately - the deceased came back in a minute or two, and was going to hit him; he lifted his hand up - then the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and took something out - I don't know what prevented the deceased hitting him; his hand was cleanched when he lifted it up towards him - I did not see the knife in the prisoner's hand, but he put his hand into his pocket as if to take something out - I did not know the prisoner before; we are not under the same master; but the other boy knew him - I am quite sure I saw the deceased strike him the first time, and afterwards kick him on the ground, and afterwards he offered to strike him again - it was not so much as three minutes between the first blow and his coming up the second time - I knew the deceased by sight before; his name was George Ashton.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it appear to you that whatever the prisoner did was in defence of himself, when Ashton was going to strike him? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JAMES NICHOLLS. I live in Webster's cottages, Westminster, and drive a cab. I was at Stockbridge-terrace on the evening of the 3rd of April - I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutrix's shop, with a pair of ladies boots, which he gave to another boy, and they ran off; I gave notice of it; I am sure the prisoner had them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is a thief himself; he told me to go and take the boots - I would not, and he went and took them - because we would not give him any of the money, he said he would tell of me. Witness. I had never seen him before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH CRYER. I live in St. Alban's-mews, and am a flower-maker. I was going out on an errand, and met the prisoner, who asked me to pawn the boots - he said they were his mother's; Taylor and Harris were with him.</p>
               <p>JAMES NICHOLLS re-examined. Q. How came you not to stop him? A. I knew he had not got them, for he gave them to another boy in a fustian jacket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took them, and gave them to me. Witness. I did not - I was in the middle of the road.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

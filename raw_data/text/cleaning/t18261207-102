            . I know the prisoner. On the 7th of December, 1818, I and my wife were present at St. James's, Westminster, when he was married to Mary Hitchcock - they lived together till within the last five weeks; she is now in Court, and very near her confinement.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAIR re-examined. When I consented to my daughter's marriage, I do not recollect his saying whether he was single or a widower - he never told me he had been married - he paid his addresses to her about two years, but only three months at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there never any report of a former marriage? A. There was, about four months ago; my wife heard of it, but we could learn no foundation for it - she married from my house, but she had lived at a liquor-shop, and he visited her there. There was some little dispute between her and my wife, who is her mother-in-law, and I got her a place - I knew the prisoner was a police-officer of Marlborough-street; he lived near me - I inquired of my daughter about it.</p>
               <p>MRS. HAIR. I know the prisoner - he used to come to our house; I heard a report of his having been married, and inquired of my daughter-in-law about him; she said he was not married.</p>

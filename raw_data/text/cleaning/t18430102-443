                  </hi>. I am an actor, and live in Kenniston-street, Gibson-street, Waterloo-road. At the time in question I had no engagement—on Friday, the 16th of Dec., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I had been at the Queen's Head, Piccadilly, and was going home through Castle-street, Leicester-square, in company with a female, I met the male prisoner, in company with four more persons and the female prisoner—I was knocked down immediately by the male prisoner—I had not spoken to him or to either of them—no words had been exchanged between my companion and them—I received the blow on the left temple, which felled me to the ground—the four others, who made their escape, seized hold of me by the arms and legs—my hat was knocked off—the female prisoner laid hold of me by the hair at the back of my head, and pulled me along the stones—they attempted to rifle my pockets, but could not find which pocket I had my sil<lb></lb>ver in—here is the coat I had on, which is torn—they put their hands into my pockets—I was as silent as I possibly could be—I had about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of halfpence</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020033"></xptr>
               <p>in the pocket of the coat, which was torn—they were taken, and I had two keys with the halfpence—one was the key of my box, and the other a very small key of my theatrical dressing-case, which was not taken out of my pocket, being so small, but the large key was taken out by the male pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw him take it out while I was on the ground—the other four were holding me at the same time, and the female by the hair of my head—the female who was with me immediately went in search of a policemen—I was not on the ground more than a minute before a policeman came up with her—the male prisoner at that time had left me, and was standing at the corner of a court—the other four had made their escape—the policeman took the male prisoner into custody—after he was taken I picked up the key off the stones at the place where I was knocked down—it was the key the male prisoner had taken from my pocket—I am sure I had the halfpence about me, and had not parted with them before I was knocked down—I did not men<lb></lb>tion the halfpence before the Magistrate, because I could not swear he took them out, though I swear he took the key out—I did not see the halfpence taken from me, but am sure I had them about me at the time I was knocked down—the young woman I was with was a stranger to me—I saw her going towards Waterloo-bridge when I left the Queen's Head.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184301020034"></xptr>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 3, Hand's-place, Granby-street, Waterloo-road. On the 16th of Dec. Mr. Phillips, who was a stranger to me, was going home, and I was walking with him through Bear-street, Leicester-square, which leads to Castle-street—the male prisoner was walking along behind us very quickly—he came along the front, suddenly turned round, and knocked Mr. Phillips down—the female prisoner was in his com<lb></lb>pany—after he knocked Mr. Phillips down, four men came across the way from the corner of Castle-street, and came round Mr. Phillips—the female pulled him by the hair of his head—I was frightened, and went at once for a police<lb></lb>man—I could not see what the other men did—I found policeman C 59—the four men who surrounded him went along Bear-street, as quick as they could, towards Leicester-square—as soon as they saw the policeman, the prisoners went across the road to the corner of St. Martin's-court, and stood there—when the policeman came up the male prisoner came across the road, and I said, "That is the man that knocked Mr. Phillips down"—he is the person, I am certain—the policeman took him—I did not hear him make any observation to the constable—the woman was not taken till the next morning at the office.</p>

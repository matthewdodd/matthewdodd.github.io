The landlord does not live in the house; it is all let in lodgings - we have the first floor back room. On the night of the 27th of January, at half-past ten o'clock, I was in the front room with one of the lodgers, and thought I heard somebody in the room - I opened the door and the prisoner came out - I ran to fetch my light; he ran up to the second floor, and I followed him with a light, and saw him put down eight awls on the garret stairs; he knocked at the second floor front door, and I asked who he wanted - he said Mrs. Jones - I said</p>
               <p>"There is no such person in the house; you villain, you have been into my room" - he said he had not; I said</p>
               <p>"You have, for here is my husband's tools." I ran down with the awls, and called the watchman, who took him on the stairs; he dropped the muslin, cap, handkerchiefs, pinchers, and one of the awls, after I left him; I had put the cap, muslin, and handkerchiefs, into a bonnet box, just before; the street door was kept open.</p>

I agreed to meet him at his own house, at half-past nine o'clock; he said he lived in Crown-street, and I was to ask for Mrs. Jones - a woman in the street directed me to No. 14. I was in liquor. I met a boy on the first floor stairs; he said Jones lived on the second floor; I went up, and this woman came and asked who I wanted - she had an awl in her hand, and made a stab at me with it, I took it from her - and am innocent.</p>

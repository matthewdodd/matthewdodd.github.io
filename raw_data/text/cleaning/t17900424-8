               <p>Did you perceive it taken out of your pocket? - I felt the watch taking out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - It was, as near as I can recollect, about four in the afternoon; there was a crowd; it was the Queen's birth day; I was passing to the Thatched House Tavern, to dine with some others; they are tradesmen; I looked at my watch coming up King-street, St. James's-square, very near the narrow passage that crosses St. James's-street; and I felt my watch in my fob in St. James's-street, but very shortly after I felt it going from me; I saw the prisoner standing close to my right side, his left side was to my right side; I never saw my watch again; I missed my watch; I felt it going, and concluded I was robbed; I instantly put down my eyes, and saw my watch in the prisoner's left hand; he was then in the act of drawing himself from me; I charged him with the robbery, and laid hold of him, and to my astonishment he denied, though I saw it in his left hand; there appeared to be accomplices of his present, for they pressed upon me; he struggled to get from me, which he effected, by their assistance; the prisoner got from me a short distance; I was endeavouring to apprehend him; I saw two young men that are in Court; I desired them to stop him: that was Hoddle and Taylor; which they did; I never lost sight of him from the time he robbed me till they took him, nor was he more than three or four yards from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner was taken to the Brown Bear before you arrived there? - He was, perhaps ten minutes.</p>
               <p>When you came to Bow-street, did you, or did you not, point to some other man as having had your watch? - There was a young man; two of them that were at the fire side, one on the left hand; the prisoner was on the right hand, the two constables sat between him and me; there was one candle burning, that was some distance, and I could not immediately judge one person from another; I believe there was something passed of that kind; there was a young man sat at the left hand; says I, that is the man, in consequence of which the prisoner started up, and said, so you have pointed him out, instead of me; then says I, I could never say that, for thou art the man.</p>
               <p>At the time you pointed to the other man, as the man that took your watch, you had not seen the prisoner at the Brown Bear? - He had not caught my eye, for the constables were between him and me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240123"></xptr>What did you point out the other man as? - I did say that is the man that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Did you mean so then, at the time you said so? - Why, certainly I meant so.</p>
               <p>Did you think so, at the time you said so? - I thought so, or else I would not have said it; says the prisoner, you have said this moment, that is the man that robbed you; I did not see him before then; says I, my friend, I was under a mistake, for thou art the man.</p>
               <p>How long was this mistake of yours after you saw the watch drawn from your pocket? - About half an hour, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you day-light in St. James's-street, to see the man by? - I had day-light; I believe it was about four, when I was robbed by the prisoner; I enquired of Sir

               <p>Was the prisoner searched at Bow-street? - No; not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember saying at Bow-street, if he is the man he must have my watch about him? - I never said so; the prisoner was searched at a publick-house in St. James's-street, very shortly after.</p>
               <p>Was your watch found upon him? - I did not see my watch.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it was not? - I certainly do.</p>
               <p>You know it was not found upon him in St. James's-street? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - I was present; but there were several people round; and it was not found; I did not search him; I believe it was not found.</p>

               <p>Court. At what distance were you from the man you had pointed out at Bow-street; the wrong man? - I believe it might be as far as from your lordship; something there or thereabouts; a little more.</p>
               <p>How large was the room? - It was a pretty large room; and as I entered into the door, at the side nigh the fire there were two young men sat, one of them had a brown coat on, the same colour as the prisoner, that made me conclude he was the same man; but I did not see his face at the time clearly; I judged it in a hasty manner, from seeing him in the same coat; when he stood up he was rather shorter, but he did not stand at the time I made the remark; I did not see the prisoner's face at that time.</p>

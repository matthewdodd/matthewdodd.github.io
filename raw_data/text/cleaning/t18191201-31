            . In the afternoon of the 11th of November I was going down Ludgate-street, and saw two young men on the other side of the street - from their appearance and manner I thought they were pickpockets. I turned back to watch them, and saw by their motions they were going to attempt to pick the prosecutor's pocket. Presently I saw one of them with his hand in Mr. Rutherford's pocket, I cannot say which it was. I instantly started across the street to secure them, and met Carney coming out from between two coaches, which stood by the pavement - he was one of them; he was putting on his hat, which was off before. I saw him putting the handkerchief into his hat. I collared him, and took his hat from his hand - he struggled to get from me, but did not succeed. I dragged him into St. Paul's Church-yard after the other two, and got some gentlemen to secure them. I am sure they were all three connected - Walker was one of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The coaches were between them - A. Yes, they stood still. I saw them pick his pocket - I think the man who escaped did it. The other men kept on the same side.</p>

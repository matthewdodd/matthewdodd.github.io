             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a hatter in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you dealings with Messrs. Maitlands in Basinghall-street? - A. Yes; they are merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the person of the prisoner? - A. Yes; about the 8th or 9th of October, the prisoner came to our warehouse, in Fenchurch-street, he was directed into the accompting-house to me; he said, he would be much obliged to me to let him have one pound nine shillings and sixpence, to give change for a bill of Exchange which he had to receive of Mr. Fourdrinier, on account of Messrs. Maitlands, and that the money would be returned either by himself or a Mr. Bates, whom I knew, at that time, to be in the house of Messrs. Maitlands; I then desired my clerk to let him have it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever after receive that one pound nine shillings and sixpence, either from the prisoner or Bates? - A. No, I did not; the moment he was gone out at the door I had some suspicion of him; he was taken up, I think, in the same month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask you for it on the account of Messrs. Maitlands, upon your oath? - A. You did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. If this man had applied to you on his own account, would you have let him have it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Townend, in Fenchurch-street: On the 9th of October, the prisoner came to our house, and I paid him one pound nine shillings and sixpence by direction of Mr. Townend, a guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and eighteen-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to have been in the employ of Messrs Maitlands? - A. Yes; my master asked me that question, and I told him I believed he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Did I tell you I lived with Messrs. Maitlands then? - A. You told me you did not want your gentlemen to know it, it was a mistake of your's; but I understood it was on account of Messrs. Maitlands; you told me, it was one pound nine shillings and four-pence you wanted, to take up a bill, and I gave you one pound nine shillings and sixpence; nothing further occurred.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you that I should refund it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make any communication of that to your master? - A. No; he took the money, and went away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BATES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Maitlands: The prisoner was formerly porter, he was discharged, I think, in the month of April, or thereabouts.</p>

            Myself, Robert Maitland, Henry Sterry, and John Nettleship; I discharged the prisoner from our house on the 26th of the March, I think it was, or thereabouts; he was our porter, and used to be employed in carrying out bills.</p>
               <p>Q. After the cause of his being discharged, was he a person that you would have trusted in your house? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of October, had your house, any demand upon a Mr. Fourdrinier, for a bill of Exchange? -

            Not to my knowledge; Mr. Sterry takes upon him that department; I have never seen the prisoner from the time he was discharged till I saw him at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorize him to take up one pound nine shillings and sixpence for you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Did I not afterwards call upon you and ask you for a recommendation to Dimsdale's house, the bankers? - A. I recollect you did; I forgot that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me, that as it was only from neglect, and not dishonesty, that I was discharged, that you would give me a recommendation? - A. No, I do not recollect that; I certainly never should have permitted him to have come into my house.(Mr. Sterry was called, but being one of the people called Quakers, was not examined).</p>
               <p>JOHN NETTLESHIP sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a partner in the house of Messrs. Maitlands; I discharged the prisoner from our service because I detected him in a fallacious answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discharge him without the approbation of the rest of the partners? - A. I had the approbation of Mr. Sterry; Mr. Maitland was at that time in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. From the opinion you had of him, after you had turned him away, would you have trusted him with money concerns for the house? -

            Certainly not.</p>

            There never was the least demand upon Mr. Fourdrinier from us.</p>

            Certainly not; he once called upon me to intercede to get him into the house again, and I told him I certainly could not; I advised him to get a place as soon as he could, and behave better than he had done with us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lived in Mr. Maitland's service three years, and having been in the habit of going to Mr. Townend's, I went there, and asked for this money; I told the young man I did not wish the house of Maitlands to know it, because it was for a purpose of my own; I intended to refund it again, and in about nine days after, I was taken to the Mansion-house. They wanted me to go for an East India soldier, which I refused, I was willing to go to sea; and I did not know till yesterday morning that there was a bill found against me. <rs id="t17981205-77-verdict407" type="verdictDescription">

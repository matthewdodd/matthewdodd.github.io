I left them at a quarter before eight o'clock on the evening of Saturday the 28th of July; the property was then all safe. I returned on Monday morning, at about half past ten; there are three locks to the outer door of my premises, a top one, a bottom one, and one in the middle. I usually unlocked the middle lock, but when I put in the key, I found it was not locked; I had locked it I am certain on the Saturday night. I could neither unlock the top nor the bottom locks, they were both spoiled. I suspected all was not right. I accordingly went to the back part of the premises, and perceived the doors which I had locked on the Saturday evening, were broken open. I got in, and on examining the goods, found twenty seven dozen pounds weight of thread, and one hundred and seventeen yards of linen gone. The whole of what was taken away was worth forty pounds, and what I got back, might be worth eighteen pounds.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 30th of July, at about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I saw a chaise cart standing at the door of the Punch-bowl, just opposite Little Queen-street in Holborn. There was a man in it, and presently I saw

             come out of the house which is his father's, and the man in the cart gave him a large black canvas bag which appeared to contain bundles of something and which he took into the Punch-bowl. On the Tuesday morning following, I accompained Salmon and Wilson, two other officers, with a search warrant at about six in the morning, to search the Punch-bowl, Old Scarr's house. Salmon told him, we came to search his house, and he said very well, and he would accompany us, and he would just go and call his wife, to mind the business. He went up stairs, we followed him close and met him just coming out of the room where his wife was in bed, with the same dark canvas bag in his arms which I had seen his son carry in on the Sunday morning. Salmon told him to put it down, which he did, and I was sent to call Davis, the clerk to the prosecutor, who was waiting outside; he came in immediately, and said the contents was his master's property. I searched the bedroom, and in a box, I found a quantity of linen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130021"></xptr>which Davis also said was his master's property.

The bed was not made, and only appeared to have been slept in by one person. In his box, I found this bunch of skeleton keys, and these bottles of phosphorus; I knew it was his box, for his shirts were in it, and when we were taking him away, he wanted a clean shirt out of that very box. We told him not to mind it then, as he could have it another time. He then went with us.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with the two last witnesses at Old Scarr's house, and afterwards in Angel alley, to get young Scarr. I searched a cupboard in the back room on the ground floor; Old Scarr was with me; before I opened it, he said there was nothing there belonging to this business, but said he would go and fetch the key to unlock it; I told him there was no necessity for that, and would not let him go; I took out a knife to open it, but found that it was not locked. In this cupboard, there was a piece of green baize, under which I found these three separate parcels of linen, each of them wrapped up in a silk handkerchief. I said to him, that this is what we were in search of. I next searched the bar, and there I found a pound of whitey-brown thread, and a remnant of linen. I then searched the cellar, but found nothing there. Here are all the things we found.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On the morning of the 27th of August I was at Brentford - I met the prisoner and two other men; I stopped them - the prisoner and I got into a scuffle, and he slipped his jacket off, which I have here - he appeared thickly clothed, and I found in his jacket a dead goose, a crow-bar, a turn-screw, a tinder-box, flint, and steel - I found another goose ten or twelve yards from where I stopped them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear it was me? A. I am positive you are the man; the other two ran away, and since that you have made a confession.</p>

In August last I had two geese in my father's yard - I lost them, one Saturday night: I attended before the Magistrate, and saw them dead - they were tame geese, and were the same as I had lost; I knew them by their having four holes in each of their feet, which I had made - they had been in a shed, which had no door to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner here requested leave to try the jacket on, which he did; it appeared rather tight.</p>
               <p>JAMES HANNAH. He had not so many clothes under his jacket then as he has now - I am positive he is the man I caught hold of, and this is the jacket.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother - he gets his living as a labouring man. On the 27th of August I was at Hounslow, and saw him there about seven or eight o'clock; this jacket does not belong to him - I have seen Thomas Starling wear it.</p>

            . The prisoner confessed that Starling and Thicket were the men who were with him; and they were taken, but not committed, as I could not state that I saw any property on them - I am confident I took the jacket from the prisoner.</p>

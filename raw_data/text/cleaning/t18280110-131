               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you expressly prohibited Holmes from having visitors? A. I do not know that I had for bidden him particularly - I have heard there had been carousing in my house all day; I saw no appearance of it that night; I went into Holmes' bed-room at two o'clock in the morning (and my son took a pistol), having heard McKelvin was taken. I believe the candles to be mine - my name is on the paper they are wrapped in; I can swear to the decanter by the pattern - I miss one like it; the table-cloth has my name on it; I have a knife which matches the fork.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Richmond. On the 1st of January McKelvin and another man came to the house, about half-past two o'clock in the day - I never saw him before; they came to see Holmes, and dined there: I first saw them in the butler's pantry - I had seen a man there once before, but did not see his face; they staid all the evening, and brought some liquor to the house - I was quite sober; the other man appeared to be ill in the evening, and laid down in the pantry - he had a sort of fit; we thought he might take part of my bed, and he slept with me till the morning. I saw McKelvin at the house as late as twelve o'clock, or between eleven and twelve - he was in the pantry with Holmes and the other man; I did not see him go out, but I saw Holmes go towards the door, and when he came back, he said he had been to let McKelvin out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of the man who was ill? A. He remained there - there were only those two and the servants, the cook and two housemaids; I had one glass of rum and water, and one glass of gin - no more; we dined about half-past two o'clock; I went out to a chemist's with the other man, returned about five o'clock, and in the evening we had the liquor - nothing was drank but what they brought - there might be two pints of gin and rum; I heard no appointment to meet again after that day; the meat and drink was thrown over the table-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Holmes tell McKelvin his master would be angry, and he must take the cloth to be washed, and bring it again? A. Not a word of the sort; I went to bed, and did not know what had happened till the next morning.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHMOND re-examined. When I returned home the housemaid opened the door; Holmes came up to me, and took my hat; he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 219). On the morning of 5th May I was on duty with the deceased, Henry James Chaplen, at Vauxhall-walk—about 1 o'clock we heard a disturbance, close to the corner of Salamanca-street, at the lower end of Vauxhall-walk, near the Pheasant—we went there, and saw nine or ten men—the three prisoners were among them—they were hallooing and making a very great noise—Chaplen said to them, "If you don't go home quietly, I will lock one or two of you up"—upon that they hallooed louder—I then spoke to Hickey and M'Elligott, and said, "Go home, there's good men, and don't make such a noise at this time in the morning"—Hickey replied, "By Jesus, we know what the time is; we have it in our pocket"—I crossed over the road to speak to some men and a woman who were hallooing—four or five of them seemed to go on faster than the others towards the Queen's Head—I was not near enough to see who they were—I followed them, and when I got opposite Salamanca-street, they all appeared to rush out at once, from the opposite side of the street—Chaplen was then on the pavement, directly opposite the gate—I saw Hickey strike Chaplen on the side of the face with what appeared to me like a brickbat—Chaplen staggered against the window shutters, drew his staff, and struck at Hickey—I rushed across the road, and saw Cane strike Chaplen on the left<lb></lb>side of the head, about the temple; be fell down, and as he was falling, a person, who I could not recognise, gave him another blow on the left side of the head—there were four or five other persons round him at the time these blows were struck—I could not see whether Chaplen's head was bleeding at that time—the spot where the blow was struck was directly opposite Sala<lb></lb>manca-street—as Chaplen was falling I rushed at Cane, caught hold of the collar of his jacket, and struck him with my staff over the temple—at the same time I received a blow from a stone on my left shoulder, which knocked me down—I still had hold of Cane—I got up again, and received a blow in my breast, and went down again—I got up again, and ran up Salamanea-street, springing my rattle; I heard the prisoners run away when I sprung my rattle; Chaplen was then lying on the pavement—two constables came up, and I assisted them in taking Chaplen to the Queen's Head—after<lb></lb>wards, in consequence of information, I, and another constable, went to 49, Vauxhall-walk (that might have been about ten minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour after Chaplen had been knocked down)—it is only three doors from the Pheasant—I knocked at the door some time, and it was opened—I went in, and saw Hickey coming out of the kitchen, or wash-house door—he was bleeding from the right-side of the head—he had his clothes on—we took him into custody—my brother constable said to him, "I take you into custody for assaulting, or ill-treating, one of the constables"—he said he had not been out, or would not go out of the house, I do not know which—a constable, named Streems, said to him, "How came the blood on your hands?"—he said, "My nose has been bleeding"—we took him outside—he said at first that he would go, and then he began to kick and plunge about—when we got him into the street I saw M'Elligott close outside the garden railings of No. 49—I turned my lamp on him, and said, "Holloa, young fellow;" and said to my brother constable "Here is one of them;" and he was taken into custody by No. 113—I left Hickey in charge of two constables, who took him to the station, and came back to No. 49—I then saw Cane</p>

               <p>coming up from the cellar—he was dressed—he tried to get out at the back<lb></lb>door—his head was bleeding at the side—Streems went and stopped him, and said, "Surrender, or I will strike you down"—he said, Oh, he would go—Streems told him he took him for assaulting a constable; he said, Oh, he would go—he attempted to getaway, but was taken to the station, after a good deal of resistance—Chaplen was taken to his own house on the morning of 5th May—he was insensible all the time, a surgeon was brought to see him—when Chaplen struck at Hickey, the blow took effect on his head—when Hickey and Cane first came up, neither of them were bleeding—I did not see Cane there at first; I first saw him when I attempted to take him into custody—I had never seen him before—I mean that I first saw him directly opposite Salamanca-street, when he struck Chaplen—Cane's head was not bleeding at that time—Hickey and M'Elligott were together; they were the first two that I spoke to—Hickey's head was not bleeding when I first saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Cole, who keeps this lodging-house, 49, Vauxhall-walk—Cane and Hickey, and several others, lodged there. On Sunday night, 4th May, I went to the White Lion—I left Cane and the others there—I was not in their company, I was in the bar—I got home before 12 o'clock, and went to bed—when I had been to bed some little time I heard my girl's voice, and men's voices—I got oat of bed, went into the passage, and saw Cane and my girl—Cane's head was cut—I saw blood on his face—I spoke to him and went into my room, and he went out—I was disturbed again about a quarter-of-an-hour afterwards—I got op, went into the passage again, and saw Cane, Hickey, and Harrington, and almost at that minute the police came—I do not know whether Cane had a hat or a cap. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the three go down-stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and so did I,</p>

               <p>for about two minutes—Hickey took a basin of water to fill a kettle to wash Cane's head—he went up-stairs with the basin and did not return—I saw no blood on Hickey's face when he first came in—I did not examine his dress—I was too frightened at being called out of my bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the White Lion on 4th May, the night of the collection for Clarey—Hickey was there, and his brother-in-law, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Shay—I left there with Hickey and Shay at a quarter to I o'clock, and came along Vauxhall factory into Glasshouse-street, and into <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Shay's house—it was then 5 minutes to 1—we ate our supper, and left there at half-past 1—we met Clarey at the bottom of Glasshouse-street—he did not accompany us to Shay's—he asked Hickey for his jacket, which he gave him, and Clarey gave Hickey his coat—I know Hickey's jacket—I have not seen it since that night—it was a black corduroy-jacket, with a broad <hi rend="italic">ray</hi>—this was after we had supped, and when we were about three minutes from Shay's house—we were going towards our lodging-house, 49, and Clarey was going back towards where the fight <hi rend="italic">lied</hi>—I have not seen him since—after parting with him I went home, and met Cane between Shay's house and our lodging-house—he was cut in the forehead—I did not notice what he had on his head—me and Hickey and Cane went in together.</p>

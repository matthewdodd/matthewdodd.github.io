On the 5th of October, I was working at Mr. Hall's shop. I left my tools in the shop at night, and my fellow workmen also. I fastened the doors of the workshop myself that night, with two bolts, and the next morning when we came to our work, the door that I fastened myself was open; a hole was cut through, so as to shove the bolts back. We looked for our tools; they were gone. We came up to Town, and made enquiry at the pawnbrokers, and in Compton-street, Soho, while we were in enquiry at the pawnbroker's a man came in with a basket of tools, and went out again; this was about half after ten. The shopman said, there, a man came in with some tools, he has gone out again; we went out, and saw the prisoner with my basket at his back; I ran after him; he dropped the basket directly I got up to the basket; I fell over the basket. The prisoner ran up a court where there was no thoroughfare; my partners followed the prisoner over the wall, and took him. I secured the basket; it is my basket, and my tools are in it. These are my saws; I can swear they are mine.</p>

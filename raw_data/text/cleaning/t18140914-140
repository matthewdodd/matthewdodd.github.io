            . I have no other partner. The prisoner was my collecting-clerk four years and a half. He was so in the month of July last. When he went out to receive monies this is the book in which it was his duty to make the entries of all monies he received. He had a book besides; he ought to made an entry in that book besides, at the time he received it; then he would bring his pocket-book into the accompting-house, and make the entry in that book of money he had received, and also his expences of what he had expended.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on the footing of that book he would have to pay what money he had received, and take the money that he had expended - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I observe there is sixpence expended at Mr. Haines, the prosecutor - A. I allowed sixpence or a shilling, or two shillings, just as he thought necessary.

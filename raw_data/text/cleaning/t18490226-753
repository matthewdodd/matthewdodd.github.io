                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, at 4, Chapel-street. On Tuesday week I had information that Mr. Evans' shop had been robbed, and on the Thursday or Friday the prisoner came to me and asked whether I was a buyer of 200 or 300 pairs of shoes; I told aim "Yes," and I would look at them, which I did; and the first he showed me was a pair of women's double-soled cloth boots, which I knew, by a mark that the constable had given me information of—I told the prisoner that I knew these; he said, "You do not"—I said, "They came from somewhere in the New-road"—he said they did not, and seemed a little agitated, and asked if I would have something to drink—I went with him to a public-house, thinking to get some more information out of him—I was confident the shoes came from Evans's, and I told him at the public-house that it was no use denying it, I knew by the mark they came from there—he then said, "Yes, they did come from there; and if we had not done it somebody else would, for nobody slept in the house"—he then came with me to another shop of mine, and asked me to look at them again; I did so, and picked out of one of them a label with "Evans and Son" on it—he took it out of my hand, said, "We have missed one," and put it into his waistcoat-pocket—he asked me again if I would buy them—I said, "No"—he 'offered them to me at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they are worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked for an officer, but could not see one, and after he was gone I went to the station, and gave information.</p>

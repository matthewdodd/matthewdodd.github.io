               <p>JOHN KINGSTON. I am a boatboy, and so are the prisoners - They belong to Mr. Mags's boat, which was in the canal. I saw the prisoners go to the warehouse, and break a board down at the end, the coals then fell out. They put them into a bag, and carried them into the cabin of their boat. I am sure they are the men. Harris and Cox were with them. I was going to get my father's horse, and saw them do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was about ten yards off. Two took the coals, and two were watching. I had seen them before.</p>

            . I am a boatman. I was dressing myself in the cabin-Turner was in the same boat with me. Fuller and Cox belong to another boat. Turner took the poker out of the cabin - I asked him what he was going to do with it? he made no answer. When I had dressed myself he brought in a small tub full of coals - I do not know where he got them from - I did not see them taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not near the warehouse - A. I did not see what they did with the poker. He brought a nose-bag full of coals in. I saw the board broken down at the corner of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was taken up for it. I was not watching. I did not see Kington there.</p>

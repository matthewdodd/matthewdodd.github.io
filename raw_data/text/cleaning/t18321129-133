             (Police-constable 144 F.) I saw the prosecutor at ten minutes before seven o'clock heavy with sleep, sitting on a step; I came on to White Hart-yard, and saw the prisoner standing close by: I kept my eye fixed on her, and saw her go to the prosecutor, stoop down, and put her hand into his left hand trousers pocket; she looked back - I went up, and saw a 6d. by the prosecutor's pocket on the step - I asked the prisoner what claim she had to that man - she said she claimed him as her husband - I said, till I got a more satisfactory account, I would take her to the watch-house; I noticed in her apron-pocket the chain of a watch - I took her to the watch-house, and sent a brother officer to arouse the prosecutor; I found this watch, 1s. 6d. in silver, and 1s. 1d. in copper on her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living by servitude - I had 3s. 7d.; I met the prosecutor, who said he knew me; I said I was sure he did not; he asked me to hold his watch, which I refused, and he laid it down; I waited ten minutes for him, he then sat down; several persons passed, and I said, "Please Sir, get up, and take your watch, for I must go" - the Policeman then came and took me - he wanted to search me in an impudent manner.</p>

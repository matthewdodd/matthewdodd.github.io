Hooper came into my employ about the 16th of January—he was engaged nearly a week before—I had reason to suppose I had been robbed of bread—I had a servant named Gates, whom O discharged, and Hooper came in his place—he gave me information the first week he was in my employment—I think about the Thursday or Friday—I am not certain to the particular day—he told me of his meeting with the prisoner, and what had passed—I was aware that he was about to call on the morning of the 29th, and I suffered Hooper to receive him, to see what he would do—from the time Hooper communicated with me, he acted entirely with my con<lb></lb>currence—the prisoner was never a customer of mine—I was present when he was taken into custody—the policeman asked him what he was doing there—he said he had come for some bread—the policeman said, "Are you going to pay for it?—he said, "No, but I suppose I must some time or other"—I saw him searched—no money was found on him—the price of a four-pound loaf was 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at that time—John Gates always went by the name if Jem in my service.</p>

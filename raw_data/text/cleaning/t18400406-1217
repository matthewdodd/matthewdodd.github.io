Brigg came in soon after, and asked if such persons had been there, I said, "Yes," and they were gone out the back-way—while they were in my house a woman came to the door and beckoned them out—they went out and left the ale and money behind—they at first called for a pint, and the prisoner told me to make a pot of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he say he took it?</p>
               <p>Barwick. He said he took it by about a tea cup full at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that?</p>
               <p>Barwick. In his box; he own'd he had robbed me of a great deal of liquor, which he had carry'd out of the house; on searching him, we found 10 guineas in gold, and a half, ten shillings and four pence halfpenny in his pocket; he confess'd he had taken it out of my cupboard in halfpence at divers times, and chang'd them into silver, and then into gold, and that it was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever keep gold in that cupboard?</p>
               <p>Barwick. I have had many a guinea in it; sometimes when I have chang'd money, but I never us'd to let them lie long there; and I never miss'd no gold from out of that cupboard, I us'd always to put halfpence in that cupboard. and have miss'd a crown's worth at a time. I took him before justice Wright, there he confess'd he took it from me in halfpence, and that it was my property; this was in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess to the taking the tea?</p>
               <p>Barwick. He did.</p>
               <p>Hen. Pain. I live in Broad-street near the prosecutor; I was with the prisoner before the justice, and heard him confess he had stole all that money from time to time from out of a dish in his master's cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where is that cupboard where you put your halfpence?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is in my bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value the tea at?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I value it at 4 s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

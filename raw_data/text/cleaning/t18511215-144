                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier. I was employed at Greenwich in Nov. last—I remember delivering a letter addressed "Captain Newton, R.N." at No. 34, Bridge-street—it was quite the early part of Nov.—it was the General Post delivery—a person accosted me in the street, and asked if I had a letter for Captain Newton, R.N.—I said, "Very likely I have; but not knowing you, I must deliver it as it is directed"—I went round where I had to go, and when I got to Mrs. Price's I found the same man close at my heels—when the door was opened he pushed in, and took the letter out of my hand—the door was half opened, and he pushed in—I do not know who the man was.</p>

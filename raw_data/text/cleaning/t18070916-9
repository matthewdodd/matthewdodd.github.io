            . On the 6th of September, between ten and eleven at night, I was returning home to John's Court, Upper East Smithfield; the prisoner came up to me, she wanted me to go along with her; I told her to go about her business, I was going home to my wife and family; she came up the second time and clasped her hand round my waist, and drew my watch; I threw her from me and she walked off; I immediately pursued her and made fast hold of her, I asked her for my watch, she told me she had no such thing about her; then I dragged her along to the watchhouse.

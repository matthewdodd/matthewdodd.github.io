I told her I was in a hurry, and had got no money, in order to get rid of her. She asked me to give her something to drink, I gave her some halfpence; she still kept hold of me, and put her hands round me; I found her hand in my pocket, on looking round-it was turned out; there was a clean shirt in it, and the rest of the things stated in the indictment. I caught hold of her, and gave her in charge. My comb, seal, and 4s. was found on her. I saw her drop 4s.6d. as she went along - I picked it up. I went no where with her.</p>

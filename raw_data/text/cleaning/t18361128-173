                  </hi>. I live in Wood-walk, Greenwich, and am a water<lb></lb>man. On the 15th of November, a little before one o'clock, I saw Wool<lb></lb>ford and Bircheno standing together on Garden-stairs causeway—I asked if they wanted a boat?—they said, "Yes, we want to go on board the hos<lb></lb>pital ship to see a person who is ill"—I put them on board, and left them.</p>

On the 17th of November I went to Anstey, and asked him if he had bought a ticket of some plate of Bircheno—he said yes—I asked him if he knew where the plate was?—he said no, but he would take me to a young man who went and sold it, the day before—I went in company with him to the prisoner Gill, in Banner-street—I asked Gill if he knew where the plate was?—he said no, he knew nothing of it—I told him he must go with me to the station-house, and there Anstey said, "Why not tell the officer the truth, you know that Bagley and you went and sold, it yesterday"—Gill said he could not tell where it was sold, but Bagley could—I went back and told Bagley—he said he knew nothing of it—then sergeant Seal came, I got a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and went with him and Bagley to Camomile-street, where I saw the property now produced.</p>

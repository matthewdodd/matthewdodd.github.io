My master took it up, and looked at it; she brought a stuff gown, and one blanket, she did not offer to pledge them; she offered to pledge one sheet, but she brought a pair.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of December last, Thursday, I was standing at the office door in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, there was a mob of people bringing the prisoner up, and they told me to take charge of her. I asked, what she had been doing? and they told me; and I was told where the property was; I went to the pawnbroker's, and he desired me to take the property away, as they had not taken it to pledge; it was that boy, (John Dillon) that gave me the property. I have kept it ever since; here are two sheets, one blanket, and one gown.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The woollen blanket is mine, I bought it, and paid for it, there is no mark on it. I can swear it to be my blanket, because it is mine; I lost it that day and hour; the sheets are mine; my name is not on them; I can swear them to be mine. The gown is my own, I have wore it; I put it out to be forebodied, and sleeved, it is mine, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All that I have got to say, is I lodged with this woman, and I was to pay a shilling a week for my lodging; my husband went to sea from me about a month ago, and I fetched these things to lay on the floor, them two sheets and blanket; and I being out in the country for a month, and when I came back, she would not give me the things; she had a guinea of mine, and I could not get the money from her; and so I was a little in liquor, and I went and took the things, as she would not let me be there. The pawnbroker seeing I was in liquor, he had some suspicion of me; so there was a croud gathered together about me, and alarmed, and made a piece of work, that I stole these here things; and this woman comes and owns these things, that they were her's. I had things taken from me by that woman several times. She took a linen gown from me, that I gave seven shillings and six-pence for, in Rag Fair, and she gave me that old gown there to put on, which is all tore. I being a stranger, she wanted to do me out of every thing that I had.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Skinner. I never saw her in my life with my eyes, till I saw her in the pawnbroker's. I never knew her husband, nor she.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before I had these things of her, I took off my cap from my head and handkerchief off my neck, and gave to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Buckney. Are you acquainted with Mrs. Skinner at all? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know any thing of this woman or her husband? - I am entirely a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got no friend in the world except God almighty and myself.</p>

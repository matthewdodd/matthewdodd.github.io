             brought me a pair of buckles, he asked me eighteen shillings upon them, I put them into the scale and weighed them; they weighed about four ounces; I said they were old-fashioned buckles and only fit to cut to pieces, I could not lend more than sixteen shillings upon them; I looked at the stamp, it appeared very perfect, and by that stamp I thought they were silver; I have been twenty years and upwards in the business, I did not doubt in the least that it was the proper stamp of the company.</p>

               <p>I am assay-master at Goldsmiths hall; these buckles were brought to me by Mr. Scott, they are brass silvered over, the stamp upon them is like the stamp used at Goldsmiths-hall upon silver buckles; it would deceive any one, I think I should be deceived by it by candlelight.</p>

               <p>The prisoner gave me these buckles to pawn, he said they were silver; I went to Mr. Scott and asked eighteen shillings upon them, he lent me sixteen; when I came out of the shop I gave the prisoner the money; I have pawned five or six pair of the same sort by his directions; I heard him say at the White-hart in Golden-lane, that he had taken a number of pawnbrokers in; he said one night, I must go home to work, for they cannot do without me, and you stay here; when he came back he brought me the buckles, I asked him who put this mark on; he said, sometimes I do, sometimes another man does.</p>
               <p>What mark did he allude to? - I took it to be a lion, and thought it was the hall mark; he told me it was a cat.</p>
               <p>What did he say he put it there for? - That the pawnbroker might take it for silver.</p>

               <p>I keep a public house in Fleet-street: the prisoner used my house about three weeks before this affair happened; I understood he had been offering to pawn a pair of these buckles, and was stopped; Moore came into my house afterwards, and said,</p>
               <p>"d - n me, I have</p>
               <p>"twigged them; I have worked the pawnbrokers</p>
               <p>"up this winter, they have had some scores of</p>
               <p>"dozens; the fools did not know a cat from</p>

               <p>"a lion:" and he said,</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for poor</p>
               <p>"Trotman, he knows nothing of it; it was all</p>
               <p>"my doing."</p>
               <p>Did he say to whom he had given these buckles to pawn? - To Trotman; when I found Trotman was tried for this last sessions, I thought it my duty as an honest man to send for a constable, and charge the prisoner, which I did; he was examined next day before alderman Plumbe.</p>
               <p>Did you see this mark upon the buckles? - I did: I should really have thought them a pair of silver buckles, and that it was the hall mark; he said,</p>
               <p>"I go of a night, sometimes I flap my</p>
               <p>"hat and sometimes cock it; sometimes I wear</p>
               <p>"a black neckcloth, sometimes a white one."</p>
               <p>Several gentlemen belonging to the Gold-smiths company deposed that the mark would deceive any body.</p>

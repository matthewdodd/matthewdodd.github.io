                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion and Punch-bowl, in the parish of St. John, Clerkenwell—the prisoner lodged in my house, but had left about a week before the robbery—last Saturday night I cleared ray house of every one, as I thought, at twelve o'clock—I and my wife then went out to see a neighbour—I came back, and found all this property gone from the bar—I searched the house, and found no one in it; but there was the print of a man's foot in the sand on the show-board, and over that there is a sky-light, and some one had gone out that way—they could get over the roof that way into Red-lion-yard, a kind of mews—I suspected the prisoner, and sent for the policeman.</p>

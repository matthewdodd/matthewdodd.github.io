                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Thomas Beeby, we are bristle-merchants, and live in Lombard-street—we have a ware-house in Lower Thanes-street. The prisoner was our porter and ware<lb></lb>houseman for about eighteen months, and was authorized to sell and re<lb></lb>ceive money on account of the firm. I had a customer named Edward Morgan—the prisoner has not accounted to me for two sums of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., each, as received from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the habit of purchasing bristles at the prosecutor's warehouse in Thames-street, for about six months. On a Friday in August I purchased 47lbs. of bristles of the prisoner, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—they were delivered at my house next day, by Howard—I called at the prosecutor's counting-house, and paid the prisoner 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and promised to pay the rest on the Monday, but being late home, I did not call; and on the Wednesday the prisoner called and I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, leaving a balance of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. still owing.</p>

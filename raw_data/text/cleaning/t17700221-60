On the 27th she asked her mistress to go out for about an hour, or an hour and a half. She did not return till the next day between eleven and twelve: this confirmed my suspicion. Then I accused her again with taking the spoon; at first she denied it, but afterward she owned she did take it, and had offered to sell it to Mr. Wood in the Minories, who had stopped it. The next morning she went with me to him: I asked him if he had a spoon offered to him to sell on the Saturday; he said he had. I described it; he then said it is your spoon.

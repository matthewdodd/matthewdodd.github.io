On the 22nd of February I took the prisoner into my service; after she had been there a week, I saw my gold watch in a trinket-box in the back bed room on the ground floor - the door was never locked; the drawers were kept locked, but I used to leave my keys about - I lost a cloak (not a clock) the first evening she was with me; I lost some articles from a trunk in an upper room to the value of 20l. - the lock was battered about; I had no other servant - no other person had access to the place where the things were; I lost a small box from there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Her child gave me the box. Witness. I never had it out of the box - it was with my gold watch and other trinkets; I never gave it to my child - the child never saw it - it was impossible for her to get it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The child gave me the box as she was going to school - I put it into my pocket, and forgot to return it. Witness. No, it is false; I missed two rings, a watch, and this box, worth eight guineas - I had taken the prisoner to my trunk, where she saw my clothes.</p>

             (Police constable F 56). I apprehended the prisoner, and found this box in her pocket, and a duplicate of a shawl for 3s. - I took this lady there, but she did not claim the shawl; the prisoner gave no residence, and I cannot find where she lives - I found on her this ring, this handkerchief, and one drop of an ear-ring; a soldier of the Guards gave the prisoner to me - she had slept at his house, not at the prosecutor's.</p>

My mistress was always in the habit of being in liquor, and another person with her - her husband said if I did not leave the house the other woman would cut my head off with a candlestick - there were three gentlemen came to lodge there the night she lost her cloak.</p>

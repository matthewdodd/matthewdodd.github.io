               <p>On Friday morning, the 26th of last month, in St. Ann's-lane, Westminster, I went with the prisoner at the bar, about half past twelve that morning; I met her in the Strand, and being intoxicated she induced me to go home with her at that hour; I had been at my friends that night; I went home with her to her lodging, where I remained till about half past seven, and at half past six in the morning I awaked in her apartment; when I awaked I found my watch in my pocket safe; and being amazed at the place I was in, I got out of bed and dressed myself, went to the window, and found the morning very disagreeable and wet, and did not like to go out at that time; I sat in the chair and dozed a little, and afterwards fell asleep, and in the same time the prisoner at the bar got out of bed, she drew my watch out of my pocket while I was asleep, and at her drawing it out I awaked, and I perceived it in her hand; but seeing a soldier in the room, and another woman, I was afraid to make much resistance in getting my watch from her; I told her to give me my watch, but she refused it; I asked her for the watch, she would not give it me; she said, she would pawn it for half a crown; then the other woman and the prisoner went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010099"></xptr>out together, and left the soldier and myself in the room; after some time the other woman returned, I asked her what became of the prisoner at the bar? she told me she did not know, but she believed she was gone to pay a chandler's shop score. Some time after the prisoner returned, I asked her what she had done with my watch? She told me she had pawned my watch for eighteen shillings; I told her I thought it was very hard, and asked her for the duplicate; she would not give it me; I asked her at what pawnbroker's; she would not tell me. After that the prisoner went out; I remained in the room with expectation of finding from the other woman what she had done with the watch, or where the chandler's shop or the pawnbrokers were; but the soldier told me that he believed there was a pawnbroker's in Sutton-ground, of the name of Brown; I went to Brown's, and there was no such thing left there that morning. Then I returned to the Strand again, and I met with the prisoner at the bar; on my seeing her I kept back that she might not perceive me, thinking to find a constable that would take her up, and I met with a man and I asked him if he knew of any constable in the neighbourhood, and I told him I would pay him any thing for his trouble, if he would go and call a constable, and the constable came, and took her to the public office Queen-square; I went with the constable; we were rather soon, and there was a mob of soldiers, about forty or fifty, and some that endeavoured to rescued her; one of the soldiers told me that he perceived the chain of the watch hang out of her bosom; I went up to her and asked for the watch, which she refused to give; I put my hand to her bosom and drew the watch out, in the presence of them all, and gave it the constable, which was produced before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he did not give it me to pawn for five shillings, because he had no money? - When I met with this woman I had five or six shillings, but that money I either gave to her, or she took it from me, I cannot, tell being so intoxicated.</p>

               <p>I am one of the constable of St. Margaret, Westminster. On Friday, the 26th of June, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, I apprehended the woman, we went to Queen-square office; there were a parcel of soldiers, and a scuffle ensued between the prisoner and prosecutor, and he took the watch out of her bosom, and delivered it into my care, and I produced it at the examination before Mr. Kirby, I delivered it there to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met this gentleman Friday morning, he had no money, and he slept till between six and seven o'clock; he gave me the watch to go and pledge to pay myself, and get some coals; I was to have four shillings; and his coat was all over mud, and he wanted it dried by the fire before he went out.</p>
               <p>Bowes. As I took her along she was very much intoxicated with liquor; I asked her what she had done with the watch; she said she had not made away with it. I was surrounded with a parcel of the guards, and I was very much afraid of a rescue.</p>

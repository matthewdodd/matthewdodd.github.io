On the 2nd of March, a little past one in the morning, I came home, I let myself in by a key, I observed a light in her bed-room, and thought she had gone to bed, and left the candle to the danger of the house; I knocked at the door twice, and called her by name, and received no answer. I looked over the curtain and saw a man sitting in a chair. One part of the shop is divided off, and the window looks into her bed room. I saw a man sitting in a chair, most terribly intoxicated; a a very rough and dirty looking fellow. I just touched his breast, and said, who are you, where did you come from, what do you do here; he repeated my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030031"></xptr>words, and said, what do you do here; I will let you know about that, I replied. I went to the door, shut the street door, double locked it, and left the key in, and get two watchman; I left them in the house, I returned with two watchmen; the man was taken in custody; I called the prisoner, she came up out of the cellar. I told the watchman to take her in custody, they took her to St. Bride's watchhouse. I gave charge of the man for being in my house at an unseasonable time, and as to her I could hardly tell what to say, I had lost a great deal of property, sheets, table linen, my shirts changed, others inferior placed for them. The constable searched her, there were found three keys and some duplicates. I had asked her prior to that concerning opening the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost your keys - A. I had, and the three keys found upon her was mine, which she had positively denied ever seeing. I then asked her if she would give me up the accomplice I would take the linen home myself, which she refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the duplicates that were found upon her was there any thing that turned out to be yours - A. One sheet, and that duplicate was found on her in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she afterwards say any thing else on the subject - A. No, she took it with a deal of fortitude, and refused that clemency I had offered her.</p>


               <p>Q. These keys that I had found upon her were yours - A. Yes, they are keys of a book case, and secretary, and a drawer that served as a wardrobe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any business with these keys, or did you trust her with them - A. I never trusted her with them; I have never given her any key to open any place; I generally kept these keys in the buffet, or behind the book case.</p>

The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse; I searched her, and found six duplicates, one was a duplicate for a sheet, pledged at Mr. Flemming's, and these three keys I found upon her, before I searched her she denied having the keys, after I found them she said nothing, but seemed sorry they were found upon her.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Flemming, pawnbroker, in Fleet-market. I produce a sheet pawned by a woman on the 14th of February, I cannot identify the prisoner; I gave a duplicate to the person that pawned the sheet, and the duplicate now produced corresponds with the one on the sheet, it is my writing, and it is the counterpart. I lent half a crown upon it. The sheet is marked J. D. No. 6.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The sheet is mine, it is my marking.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of February was the prisoner in your service - A. Yes, from the 13th of February, and two of the keys are certainly mine, one opens the wardrobe, and the other opens my book-case, and this key that I do not speak to opens a drawer in which I kept my iron chest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Has not the prisoner been in the habit of buying articles for your house - A. No, I would not pay for a farthingsworth of matches; she has brought me one false bill, and a very bad account it is. I told her I would not pay any thing but milk and rolls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Upon account of having no mistress Mr. Davis gave me all the keys there was, that was four. The drawers were never locked all the time I was there; the sheets were kept up in the garret, I never was there but once, when the bricklayers were there.</p>

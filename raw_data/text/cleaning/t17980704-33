             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Gordon: Last Saturday morning, Mr. Phillips bought a calf of my master, and it was hung up to be weighed inside the door; the prisoner had just before bought a side of veal and paid for it, and took it away; Mr. Phillips came just after, and when we came to weigh it, there was a side of Mr. Phillips's calf gone; when we brought it from Westminster, we took it to Guildhall, and it was identified there, it was so cut up, that there was more bone on one side than the other, I am sure it is the same.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gordon. The veal that was at Guildhall was the veal that I had lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you handled it? - A. Yes, before I sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the weight of it then? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not butcher it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Newton.) Q. When was it that you weighed it? - A. About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before any part was missing? - A. No, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the weight of that that was stolen? - A. The two quarters that were left, weighed eight stone and one pound, and what was brought back, weighed four stone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to buy a side of veal of Mr. Gordon; Mr. Gordon has had twenty sheep in a week to sell for me by commission; I bought this side of veal of Mr. Gordon, and told him, he must give me credit for it till Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gordon.) Q. Did you sell him more than one side? - A. No, he cheapened but one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Which side of the calf was it he bought of you? - A. I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you can take upon you to swear, that that was the identical veal? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there two lots of veal or one? - A. I believe there were two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Mr. Gordon? - A. I don't know who it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Your business did not lead you to look at what was going on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you don't know any thing about the weight? - A. No.</p>

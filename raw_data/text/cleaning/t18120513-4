            , and the prisoner, when he was going to get past me I saw his hand coming before me, he seized hold of my seals and chain, and rapidly pulled my watch right up, and took it over my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Took it over your shoulder, do you say - A. Yes. In consequence of the watch glass being broke I had turned the face of the watch downwards to secure the hands, the outer case fell on the pavement; I said to my friend, stop; and loosened my arm, and said, this man has taken my watch; I saw it in his hand, and I saw the watch go away; I saw it come out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The case fell upon the pavement - A. Yes. I turned sharp round, I saw the prisoner going away with the watch in his hand, I pursued him, and I catched him by the skirts of coat, his coat gave way; I halloaed out, and the patrol was coming up to assist me, and as he came to me the watch I saw it in some person's hand, whose hand it was I cannot say, and as soon as I seized the watch it came into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand was the watch, was it in the prisoner's hand - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the person that moved his hand towards you was the prisoner - A. I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear positively that the person you met, and who took your watch, was the prisoner - A. There was no other in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You got your watch did you - A. Yes, and I returned and found the case, and picked it up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner got away from you - A. He got away from me; he was taken at a little distance on the Westminster side, the contrary way I was going; he was seized by

            . I am a patrol of St. Clements Danes. There were four of us patrols standing together on the opposite side of the way, it was a moonlight morning, we could distinguish the other side of the way well.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it - A. The 23d of April. We were standing in conversation, there had been no person pass through the bar for near ten minutes; we observed Johnson and his friend attempt to go through, as soon as they entered under the arch way on the foot path I heard some one exclaim, my watch is gone, or something similar to that; I ran across the way, and the prisoner, John Brown, had gone about twenty yards from where the fact was committed. I took hold of him, and three of the patrols with me assisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130005"></xptr> in taking him to the watchhouse. I fetched Mr. Johnson back to go to the watchhouse to give charge; Johnson said he had lost his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In his hearing did Johnson state that he was the person that took it - A. Yes, he did; the prisoner said he was innocent of it, he was willing to go to the watchhouse.</p>

            . Q. Were you walking with the prosecutor on the evening they have been talking of near Temple Bar - A. Yes, it was the 23d of April, about half past two in the morning, Johnson and me were walking arm in arm conversing together on; entering the arch of Temple Bar, Johnson said, stop, I have lost my watch; he put his hand to his pocket, and felt for it; he said, it is gone, that man has taken it; I heard something drop at the time; he immediately ran after him; I stopped at the corner of the bar until the prisoner was seized at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the person that was seized was the person that met Mr. Johnson, and you - A. I am certain of it; Mr. Johnson came back after the prisoner was seized, and looked round and found the watch-case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to say I was passing by at that time, Mr. Johnson said, I had taken his watch, he laid hold of me, I said I had not, neither did I. I knew nothing of him or his watch.</p>

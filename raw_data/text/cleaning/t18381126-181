                  </hi>. I am a livery stable-keeper, and live in Percy-street, Rathbone-place. Two or three days previous to Sunday, the 5th of August, the prisoner came to me—I never had any dealings with him before, but I thought I had seen his face—he asked me if he could have a horse and chaise for the Sunday following, the same grey mare and chaise which a gentleman named Heath had been in the habit of having—I asked if he knew Mr. Heath—he said yes, he had been living in the family, or words to that effect—I asked him where it was to go to—he said to Hat<lb></lb>field—I told him I could not let it go to Hatfield and back in one day, but he being a servant in Mr. Heath's family, if his master could spare him two days, I would charge him very little more—I told him I could not promise him the grey mare till my foreman returned, not knowing whether he had promised it, he being out at the time, but if he called on Saturday he could have a conclusive answer—he did call, and it was agreed he should pay 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two days—it was taken away on the 5th of August—I let him have it, believing his story—I did not see the mare again till the 6th of November—the prisoner never came to pay me—I lost my gig, mare, harness, and whip—I value them at 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found them all again at Al<lb></lb>resford, a little on this side Winchester, nearly eighty miles from London—on the 4th of November, I went with an officer to Sandhurst, near Black-water, where I heard the prisoner was living in service—we saw him there, on the road to his master's house—I followed him, and instead of going into the village, he went over a gate away from it to avoid us—we at last took him in a public-house, into which he followed us.</p>

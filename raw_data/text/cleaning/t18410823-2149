                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and carry on business in High Holborn, in the parish of St. Andrew. The prisoner Tuckwell was in my service about six weeks ago, as town-traveller—he was not with me quite a month—he did not suit me, and I parted with him—Perkins was in my employment from the time of my commencing business, which was at the beginning of April, and continued so till this of<lb></lb>fence was committed—on Saturday evening, the 14th of August, I had property to the amount of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my cash-box—there were three</p>

               <p>5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, twenty or thirty sovereigns, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels of silver, made up in brown paper, and marked—I took my cash-box to my bed-room on retiring to rest, and on Sunday morning, about ten minutes to eleven o'clock, previous to going to church, I left it safe on my bureau in my bed-room—it then had that property in it—Perkins went out on Sunday morning about ten minutes before me—I went to church, returned home about half-past one, immediately went to my bed-room in consequence of my mother giving me information, and found the cash-box broken open, and the whole, with the exception of two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, missing—a fire-escape ladder which was put on boxes immediately under the trap-door of the roof, was gone—I searched the premises with an officer, but was not able to find any body—there is a loft on the roof, belonging to Mr. Booker, a fishmonger, a neighbour of mine, similar to my own—I merely looked into that loft, but did not discover any thing—Per<lb></lb>kins came in about five on Sunday afternoon—I let him in—I said nothing till he got to the drawing-room—I then named to him the circumstances of the robbery—he turned very pale—I went out with Perkins about seven that evening to look for the light-porter who carries out my parcels—I asked Perkins some questions respecting Tuck well—I made him no promise or threat—I merely put the question to him in con<lb></lb>sequence of a suspicion which crossed my mind—I did not say it would be better for him to tell, or worse if he did not—nor any thing of that kind—I did not at that time suspect him—I asked what he knew about Tuckwcll's character—I told him he had stated to my mother and sister that Tuckwell was a very bad character, that he thought him capable of any thing in swearing away a man's life—he said he knew nothing more of him than that he was addicted to smoking cigars—I asked him when he had seen him last—he said he had not seen him for some time—I questioned him further, and after some time he said, in a careless sort of manner, that he had seen him on the Saturday morning, and had not seen him after that time—the police inspector came about half-past twelve on Sunday night—that was after Tuckwell had been taken into custody—Perkins then remarked, "I should not wonder if Tuckwell said I had some concern in the robbery"—the keys of the inner and outer shop-door on Saturday night were taken to my bed-room, and hung on a nail inside the door—I found Tuckwell at the station about a quarter to twelve on Sun<lb></lb>day night—next morning I was standing near Tuckwell at the police-court —I did not make him any promise or threat.</p>

               <p>I went to dinner—Perkins was then to admit him through the shop to the sugar-vault at the back of the shop below stairs—that he was to be there, concealed till I came down from dinner—Perkins was then to go down to him, and cover him up with the sugar mats, to effectually conceal him, and he was to meet Perkins on the Sunday afternoon at four o'clock—they were then to divide the money, and he believed Perkins was to come back to his employ as usual—that he (Tuckwell) had come at the appointed time, that Perkins had admitted him through the shop, had been with him three times during the afternoon in the vault, that he came to him after I retired to bed on the Saturday night, took him to his own bed-room, and they slept together—that he concealed him in the cupboard on the Sunday morning, and Perkins then went out—he also said that while he was in my bed-room committing the robbery, he heard the lock tried twice—he did not say any thing more—he did not give me any account of what he did in the room, or how he got out of the house.</p>

               <p>Perkins went out five or ten minutes before eleven, five or ten minutes before master—he was dressed in his Sunday clothes, as he generally was—he came home about four in the afternoon—my master was the first that went up to his room after church.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's mother, and live with him. On Sunday morning, the 15th of August, I saw Perkins about half-past nine o'clock—he brought the milk to me—he had the keys of the inner and outer shop doors—he took the milk in, and brought it up to me—it was a very unusual thing to bring it to me—it should be taken into the kitchen, or left on the stairs for the servant—I let him out about ten minutes to eleven, and said, "Will you dine at home, Mr. Perkins, to<lb></lb>day?"—he said, "I think I will, ma'am"—I said, "Recollect, we dine about half-past one"—he said, "I thank you, ma'am, I think I shall"—he did not come home to dinner—he came about half-past four—he saw his master first, I afterwards saw him—he told me he lad got the head-ache, and had come home, intending to ask for a cup of tea, and to lie down af<lb></lb>terwards; that he had been to Knightsbridge, and passed our house about two o'clock, but thought it too late to come in to dinner—I said, "You cannot lie down, Mr. Perkins, for we have had a sad robbery"—he said, "Good gracious! I hope it will be found out; who do you think it can be?"—I said, "Of course we can have no suspicion, but on the servant"—(I did not know any thing then about Tuckwell being in the house)—he said, Have you had the house searched?"—I said, "Yes, we sent for the constable and police immediately"—we went down into the kitchen; and as we went down, or before that, he said, it must be the ser<lb></lb>vant, he thought, for nobody else could get into the house, as I had the inner and outer door keys—when they are both locked, nobody can get in or out—there is no area in front, but a small grating—a person from the kitchen might hand a small parcel up—when he went down stairs, he said, "There can be no suspicion but of the girl; but how could she get the money away? have you had the house searched?"—I said, "Yes, thoroughly, but can find nothing"—he said she might have an accom<lb></lb>plice, and hand the money up through the area—I said, "We are afraid that is the way it is gone"—my daughter was present part of the time, but not at that moment—we then said, somebody had gone out through the fire-escape, but could not conceive how it was possible they could get into the house to get out—my daughter said, "They have taken up the ladder of the fire-escape, and that, I think, makes the girl clear;" and Perkins said, "That is the worst thing against her."</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think I understood you to say, you did not know whether it was you said something about handing up through the area, or him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At first I did not, because there was so much confusion; but the suggestion was made, and agreed to—he did not say the best plan was to search the—house and the girl's boxes, and that would set it at rest—the boxes had been searched before; he asked if the house had been searched—I know Perkins's friends, they live at Eton—I was there for a few days—I have had my doubts of Perkins's character for some time—I did not tell his friends that he was going on very well, and was a good lad—I suggested enough to the contrary to Mr. and Mrs. Perkins.</p>

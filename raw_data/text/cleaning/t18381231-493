                  </hi>. I am a servant, but am out of a situation. On the 28th of December I was in Oxford-street, looking in at Mr. Rogers's shop-window—I saw the prisoner standing by the side of the counter—he put his hand two or three times to where a box was standing on the counter—he then took the box, put it under his right arm, and ran down Great Chapel-street and Compton-street, with another person—I lost sight of them—I went down several streets, and did not see them—in coming back I saw the prisoner—he went on to Charles-street—I went and took him—he had a bundle, which he threw into the road—I took it up, and found it was this bundle of cigars, in a white apron.</p>

My father, John Rogers, keeps this shop—I was up stairs at the time—I missed a box from the counter, containing about 2 1/2 lbs. of cigars—these cigars which are found are about 2 1/2 lbs.—the box has not been found—they are a particular sort of cigars—and I missed just this quantity—my father was in the counting-house.</p>

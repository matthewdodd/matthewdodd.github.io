He said, he hoped we would be as easy as we could.</p>

            . I am the principal of a company at the Docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it usual for a foreman to be searched - A. The labourers are searched every day; the foreman only now and then. The prisoner was foreman at No. 6, warehouse of the coffee department; the prisoner had a very good character; he has been at the Docks about seven or eight years. He was at work that day in the coffee warehouse. The coffee is worth about five shillings.</p>
               <p>- SINCLAIR. I am the captain of that warehouse. All the property in it is under my care. We had such coffee as that found on the prisoner in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry; I picked the property up.</p>
               <p>Sinclair. The prisoner had one pound fourteen shillings a week.</p>

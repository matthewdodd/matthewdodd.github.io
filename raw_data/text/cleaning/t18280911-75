            . I was in Mr. Colwell's employ - he discharged me about three weeks ago - I had lived two years and ten months with him; the prisoner was in his employ as a stove-grate maker, and left last April; Fryett and him were on friendly terms; I frequently saw the prisoner about the neighbourhood after he left, and in company with Fryett; about two years ago, I saw Fryett hand the front of a stove through the iron railing to the prisoner, who took it away - it was taken out of Mr. Colwell's shop; I have heard Fryett quarrel with him at times - I heard Ward ask Fryett for a coffee pot, some metal spoons, and a japanned waiter - I do not know whether Fryett gave them to him: I have heard them reproach each other about what was done, and have heard Fryett say, in Ward's presence, among others that Ward had taken things to Scoltock's shop; and that he had seen things in Scoltock's shop which he could prove were Mr. Colwell's; this was before he left - Ward made no observation about it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to swear he did not deny it? A. I have no recollection of his denying it - I have heard the same thing mentioned two or three times; I did not tell Mr. Colwell of it- it might be eight or nine months before I was discharged; I was discharged on account of Mr. Colwell losing so much property, he did not suspect me - I was not charged with it; I was discharged in consequence of what was reported in the papers, principally that Fryett should say I had stolen more than anybody else, and had shared in it; I have not seen the stove front since, and do not know what Ward did with it; it had come from the foundry; Ward finishes them - I do not know whether it has been found.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not tell your master any thing till after Fryett was found out? A. I did not.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodging, at Wharton's, No. 9, Crown-court - the prisoner was not at home -Wharton shewed me up to his room, which is a front room on the second floor; I saw his daughter there, and asked her for the key of a cupboard which was padlocked; she did not give it to me - I forced the closet open, and found a large quantity of goods of various descriptions, and forty-five packets of nails and screws, which I produce in the state I found them; the prisoner came in while I was searching, and saw what I had found - he said they were not his, they were his daughter's - the daughter was not them present; a quantity of old locks and keys were found in the closet - he said they were part of an old stock which he had brought from his shop in Belton-street, where he formerly lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you got the keys here? A. No, they were not claimed by the prosecutor; they were old iron, laying at the bottom of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his daughter tell you the things had been brought there three weeks before, by a person who she described, and in her father's absence? A. No, nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110065"></xptr>of the sort - I never heard it; I went to his house on Thursday, the 21st of August - Mr. Colwell was with me, and two other officers, and I believe heard what passed; she did not, in my preasence, say anything about the man not having called for payment.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the daughter say? A. She said her father always kept the key of the closet; I then broker it open - the prisoner never gave me the key of it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. I went with Upson to Wharton's house, and saw the search made; the daughter said her father kept the key; and on Upson saying he would break the closet open, she said he would be very angry if he did; she did not claim any property there - I believe I can speak to all these things - the papers enclosing the nails and screws are marked by my young man; there are twenty-four parcels of nails, and the rest screws - I never sold the prisoner any of them, nor authorized him to take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the daughter say the goods had been brought there by Fryett some time previous? A. I never heard it; Ward lived between two and three years with me - Fryett had access to all the property - he was allowed to go where these things were, and Ward was not; he was a porter, and Ward a workman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ward had no authority to go there, but could he go if he chose? A. If he went there, I should expect he was going to ask Fryett for something - he could go there in our absence.</p>

            .

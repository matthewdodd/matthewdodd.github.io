                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and a carpenter, and live at Lee, in Kent—I have a shop at Lee-green, in the parish of Lee. On the night of the 14th of Feb., 1839, my shop was robbed—it was left locked at dusk that night—my son locked it—I was with him at the time, and I took the key and hung it up behind some timber, where it was con<lb></lb>cealed—there was considerable property of mine in the shop—it was left safe between six and seven o'clock—my man went the next morning, and I had lost a mortise-guage, two hand-saws, a 3-foot rule, and other things—I took out a search-warrant, I think about the 26th, and the officer went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house and found some things, but I did not go with him—the property that was found was mine, it had been safe in my shop, and was stolen at the same time as the others—the property that was found is not here—it was pat into the hands of the inspector of the Lee police, and he has ab<lb></lb>sconded—I am able to say it was my property—there were two gimlets, and a mortise-guage, and two saws, which belonged to a man of mine, but they were in my shop—the place where they were found belonged to the prisoner—it was not far from my shop—the prisoner worked for me—I have seen him and his wife there, and know they lived there.</p>

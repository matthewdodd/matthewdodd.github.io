I am a native of Bombay, lately arrived from Bengal, I have been in London between nine and ten months—I know the name of the street where I met her—it was oppo<lb></lb>site a church—I went with her to a house in a street adjoining—I gave her 1s., and I had one shilling, one sixpence, and four sovereigns left, which she saw when I gave her the shilling—my money was bound up in a bit of paper she had an opportunity of seeing the paper and the money, and</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, in the ad<lb></lb>joining room to the prisoner. I recollect seeing the prosecutor in the prisoner's room, on a Wednesday—it might be about seven o'clock—the prisoner and the other man were in the room smoking—I had not seen him there before—the prosecutor said, "Give me any money", and held up his finger to her—the other man came out of the room, and I was going down stairs—the other man said to me, "Is the Lascar in the room?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "We have just drawn him", meaning that they had robbed him—the prisoner was sitting against the door, and the door open—I saw the man stoop down, but I did not see what he picked up—the man went out of doors—I did not see the prisoner of out—I saw her there again—the Lascar said he had been robbed—I said it was a pity he should be robbed, and told him to fetch a policeman—my husband was with me in the house, but I do not know that he heard it.</p>

On the 13th of April I saw the Lascer at the door No. 100, Wentworth-street—he had his hands across, and the tears running down his cheeks—Bush and several more were standing round a step.—Bush said he had been robbed up-stairs—I asked him as well as I could if he had been robbed—he pointed to me that he had been robbed from his pocket—I asked him if he could point out the woman—he said he could, and took me to the prisoner—bush said, "It is a scandalous shame to rob the poor fellow; and now he says if you will give him two sovereigns he will be satisfied. and you won't give him that"—the prisoner burst out crying, and said, "I have not got the money; Bob has"—there were no sings of her having been beaten—Bush's husband has been in the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's country, and she understands a little of their language.</p>

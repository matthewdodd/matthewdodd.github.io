On the 12th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening. I was returning from Piccadilly.

            . I am a watchman; my stand is at the corner of Market-street. I heard the prosecutrix cry Stop thief! I looked up Grafton-street, and saw the prisoner running towards there; she was running after him. I caught him by the corner of Hayes-court; he said, "What are you going to do with me?" I said, "You are the man who has robbed the woman;" he put his hand into his bosom and gave me the shawl; she came up and claimed it directly.</p>

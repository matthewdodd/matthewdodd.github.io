               <p>Q.How long had you been acquainted? - A. About three months; I have never seen my shirt or money since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not two other men who used to go through our room? - A. They used to go through our room to their lodgings, and who ever went down last, used to carry the key.</p>
               <p>Q.Did we not always go out first, and leave them in bed till ten or eleven o'clock? - A.Sometimes they went out first, and sometimes we went out first.</p>
               <p>ANN MILLWARD sworn. - I am the wife of Joseph Millward, and live in King-street, Seven-Dials; the prisoner, and the last witness, came to lodge with us about seven or eight weeks ago; they had the one pair of stairs front-room; there were two other lodgers, single men, who used to go through their room; the prisoner was on duty at the brewhouse on the Friday night, and came home on the Saturday morning; I saw no more of him till Monday about twelve o'clock; I gave him the key; he was up stairs about half an hour, and then brought the key down again, and said, he was going to work at a brewhouse over Westminster-bridge; he paid me one shilling and six-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280099"></xptr>pence for his share of the rent; he went away, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DONALDSON sworn. - I am one of the constables of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields; I went with the prosecutor to the Angel at Hammersmith; we found the prisoner with a good many brick-makers, dancing; the prosecutor pointed him out to me; I told him I had a warrant to apprehend him, for robbing his bed-fellow of nine guineas, and a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing, had you said any thing to him that could induce him to make a confession? - A. No; I took him out of the taproom into the bar, and he said, I took the shirt away, but as for the nine guineas, I never took them; I brought him to town, and took him to the office; going through the passage, I said to him, what have you done with this poor fellow's money; he then said, the money is all spent, I should not have taken it, if I had not been very drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the affair; when I was brought to the office, the officer told me to say, yes, right or wrong, and, being in liquor, I did not know what I said; he told me I should be cleared if I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. He was perfectly sober; it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

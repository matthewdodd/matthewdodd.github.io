            , I told him he was gone; we found the prisoner in a shop; the prosecutor says to the prisoner, ha! Tom! I want to speak with you; and he went home with him very peaceably; he told him to go up stairs in the club-room; at the top of the stairs he made a stand; says the prosecutor, I dare say you know how to open the door; the prosecutor said, I have been robbed, and I think you are the man that has done it, therefore pull out your money and lay it down; and he pulled out some copper, to the amount of eleven shillings in halfpence and farthings; the prosecutor asked him if he had any more; he said he had not; I said, Tom, you shewed me some silver just now; then after some time he pulled out this purse, there was five shillings and two sixpences in it; the prosecutor took up one or two of the shillings; says he, here is one or two I can swear to; one in particular he said he knew, he refused it the night before, and he shewed me a particular mark he had put upon it the night before; he asked him what become of the purse; he said he had burnt it.</p>
               <p>Had he been offered any favour or threat? - Not to the best of my knowledge; says I, Tom, you had better give back the money and things you have, it will be the better for you; he told us by what means he had got into the prosecutor's house; he was taken before the Alderman and committed; I saw the constable take the shillings and things into his custody.</p>

               <p>Had not you or the prosecutor told him it would be better for him? - He voluntarily confessed the fact; nobody offered him threat or favour to my knowledge; he confessed nothing more to me.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about the things that were on the table? - He confessed he had taken ten shillings worth of halfpence more than were on the table; those were the words; I saw the silver on the table, and I saw the prosecutor mark the silver; I believe he marked three shillings; I attended the prisoner to the sitting Alderman, and from thence the compter.</p>

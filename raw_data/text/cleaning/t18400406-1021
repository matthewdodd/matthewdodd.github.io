                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Thomson. I was walking with a friend in Fleet-street, from three to five o'clock, on the 19th of March—I had a purse in my pocket which contained three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and a little silver—the first thing that drew my attention was a pressure behind me, and then a second pressure—I walked on—a person told me I had been robbed—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse, but I did not see any one near me—I am sure my purse had been in my pocket—I had a white pocket-handkerchief, which was hanging partly out of my pocket, not as I had placed it—the prisoners were both taken immediately—I saw my purse in the hand of the police-man—this is it—it contains the money mentioned.</p>

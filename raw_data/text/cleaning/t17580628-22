            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner at the bar about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you work for?</p>
               <p>Harris. My mother is employed for Mr. Lamater, and I took some of his silk, which she was at work upon, and carried it and sold it to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your mother work?</p>
               <p>Harris. She used to wind his silk at her own home, I used to assist her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry it to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harris. I had seen one Mrs. Acton go there with some, so I went with some.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever desire you to bring it?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you carry in the whole to her?</p>
               <p>Harris. I carried about twelve ounces to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was about that quantity?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because my mother has wanted that quantity in her weight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she give you for it?</p>
               <p>Harris. Sometimes she has given me a penny an ounce, and sometimes three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that you was to have money for it?</p>
               <p>Harris. I saw her give the other woman money, and I thought she would give me the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How much an ounce did she give the other woman?</p>
               <p>Harris. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she use to say to you?</p>
               <p>Harris. She never said any thing to me, only took it out of my hand, and gave me money according to the quantity I brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever bid you come again with more?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; she never used to say a word to me.</p>

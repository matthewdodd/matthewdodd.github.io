            . I live at No. 49, Berwick-street, three doors from Mr. Gowland. One Friday evening before the 5th of October, my little boy was going to bed in the attic, and somebody asked him to let him in at the window, which was shut: I went up, and he asked me to let him in to go through the house; the prisoner is the person, to the best of my belief - he said his name was Mitchell, that he was a ladies' shoemaker, and lodged at Mr. Johnson's (who is a baker in our street) - that he had been sent on an errand, and staid a great while, and when he came home, his father was in a great passion, and he had got away on the top of the house. I was afraid to go back - I opened the window and let him through - I asked if he would let me see his mother, that I might be sure he was telling the truth; he said I should; he followed me down stairs; I walked with him as far as Johnson's, saw him go in, and I then returned towards my own house. He brought a woman, and said, "Mother, this is the person who has let me through the house:" she thanked me, and told me he had been sent on an errand, and stopped a long time; his father was in a great passion, and if he had caught him, would have beat him severely. I saw the prisoner in custody on the 5th of October; it was more than a week before that - I believe him to be the person. A parapet runs from Gowland's house to mine, and he could go no further than my house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 30th of September I found the prisoner at the watch-house - I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr. Mitchell's. where Gowland lodges. He said he knew I did, but Jem the errand-boy was as bad as him, for he let him through his master's house, and pointed out where the things were, and he went through the house, and took the boots and coat, and Jem was to go with him next morning to Solomon's, a fence, in Seven Dials - all this was voluntary - I got the articles from Fergues. I apprehended Jem next day, and after two examinations he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GOWLAND. This great coat is mine; it is lined with serge, and worth about 2l. - these two pairs of boots are mine; they were in the attic when I saw them last. The house is kept by Mr. Mitchell.</p>

Master is out." I went with him up to the top of Fergues' house; I went in, took the boots and coat, and laid them under the window; I returned and found Fergues' window fastened.

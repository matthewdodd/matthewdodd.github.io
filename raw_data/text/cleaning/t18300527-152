             - I am certain of him- they have the prosecutor's name marked on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Yes - we frequently have such things pawned; he came into the last box, which is rather dark, with his hat over his eyes, and stood rather back, but I took them from him myself, and noticed him, as he asked for 8s.; I could not give that, and gave them back to him; he was about ten minutes in the box - it was between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. I know these seven table-spoons by the crest; I missed them on the 7th of May, which was the day he left - he used to sleep in the house; the other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he come into your service? A. On the 9th of May, 1829, and left me on the 7th of May, as he was apprehended that day on this charge, at my complaint - I believe Tomlinson lived in the service of the person who preceeded me in the chambers; I bought the sheets from him - the plate was about in use: the female prisoner attended the chambers three or four months ago - I employed her as a laundress till within three or four months of the 7th of May; I once gave the prisoner a coat, but not the one produced - I had a good character with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You occupy one set of apartments? A. Yes, one floor exclusively - I sleep there; Smith slept in the garret, which I rent with the floor.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Mr. Dymock called his property over; I took the rest of the plate down to him, and he missed this - I explained to him; I said I had no suspicion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270074"></xptr>of any one except it was Tomlinson - I asked her if she had pawned it; she acknowledged that she had, and said as soon as she received her money from her employer, she would fetch it home - I returned, and told Mr. Dymock she had pawned it, and refused to give me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. He did not at first attempt to throw the blame on Tomlinson; he said she had a hand in it - he brought me down the plate, and examined it with me: I said nothing to him - he hegan by saying he had given it to Tomlinson himself to pawn - that she had pawned it, and she had the duplicates, and that he had part of the money for it; I had him apprehended that day - I did not mention this before, because I considered it a confession made previons to his having any idea of my having him apprehended - it was quite voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Smith. I knew nothing of the criminal conduct that was going on, till the property was called over; if I had a mind to be a rogue a few days before, I could, for I brought money from the Bank to him.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. I have sent him three or four times to the Bank for 20l. or 30l. - I had not given him notice to leave me; I suspected he had made away with plate, and ordered him to bring it down, which he delayed for a day or more, and then made this confession.</p>
               <p>Tomlinson's Defence. I did not receive them as stolen- every bit of plate that I pawned was brought at different times to my house; I was to get so much for it, and Smith used to wait at my house till I returned - he would never take the duplicates, but always the money; the next time he came he said he wanted to buy a pair of boots; I received every bit of the plate from his hands; and he had the money - I have been a mother to him; I mended his clothes and boarded him when he had not a shilling.</p>

            . Tomlinson lodged at my house; I saw Smith bring the five spoons there - I think it was in April last; he brought them up to the second floor front room, and put them on the ironing-board; Tomlinson was gone to the Temple; I went into the room, and took them in my hands - I sighed, and said, "Ah! I have been in possession of as much plate as this;" I am sure these are the spoons - he left them on the table till Tomlinson returned - he went out, and told her sister, who was in the room, that Tomlinson knew what was to be done with them; I said they were such plate as I used to have; the sister said, "Oh, they are brought here to be cleaned."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was this from Lincoln's Inn-fields? A. Not far; I knew Smith as the prosecutor's servant, but had no suspicion, as she said it was to be cleaned; Smith was at the house three times on the day he was taken.</p>

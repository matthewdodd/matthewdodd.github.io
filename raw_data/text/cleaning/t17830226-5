               <p>Do you know that gentleman? - It was candle light.</p>
               <p>Look about? - It was very much like that man's face (Stokes). I do think to the best of my knowledge, that it was that man came up to me; he came, and said, says he, I want a porter to carry that trunk a good way, says he, it is a very busy time for porters, and I have never a one within at this time, do you just step down to the New-Inn at the Old Bailey, it is not above twelve or thirteen doors at farthest; says I, I shall have something stolen out, says he, do you think I should desire you to leave your chaise and horses, if I did not take care of every thing that was there, he began to bully me, so I went and called a porter; I observed nobody else there: when I came back, the trunk was stolen.</p>

               <p>Where was you standing? - I stood with my back to the horses, and was unfastening the trunk.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the man that you suppose was the man that gave you these directions as to the porter, have you ever seen him since? - Yes, I saw him once since in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What was your recollection as to that man in Bow-street, had not you a good deal of doubt? - Yes, I had.</p>

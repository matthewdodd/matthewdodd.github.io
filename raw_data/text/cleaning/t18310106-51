               <p>TIMOTHY BRIEN. I live at Mr. Mullen's, Shoreditch. The prisoner and I slept in the same room, but not in one bed; my box was in the room - I went to dine with my cousin on Christmas-day: I saw my box safe between twelve and one o'clock the night before, but did not notice it in the morning - I know it was locked; I came back between four and five in the afternoon, found it broken open, and three half-sovereigns and a half-crown taken out - I had seen them safe on Christmas-eve; I received information, and went to the Bishop Blaze public-house, New Inn-yard, and met the prisoner there - I asked if he had my money; he said No, and I gave him in charge of Barrow - a half-crown and a farthing were found in his pocket; I think this was about nine or ten o'clock at night.</p>

I asked a little boy, and he pointed which way the man went, and Mr. Evans went one way, and I another, into Dyot-street and I saw the prisoner walking gently along with the floor cloth on his shoulder, and I secured him, and took him before Mr. Walker, the magiserate in Hyde-street, and Mr. Evans took care of the floor cloth.</p>

               <p>Court. How long after you heard the rustling was it before you went out of your room into your shop? - I went out in less than a minute or two.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the man that you carried it for? - He was dressed like a painter, I do not know the man.</p>
               <p>Have you him here? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to prove that? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses to your character? - No, I am a stranger in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This prisoner was found with stolen goods in a suspicious manner, and the usual course is, that he should satisfy you that he came honestly by them. The question is, whether this is within that act of parliament of King William, which takes away the benefit of clergy, and makes it a capital offence, where goods are stolen out of shops and warehouses, that is, such sort of goods as are usually kept there in their course of dealing, that sort of commodity in which they deal, to the value of five shillings, privately and without the knowledge of the party, then it shall be a capital offence. Upon all these acts of parliament the construction has been always exceedingly strict; in the case of a private pick pocket, the act of parliament says pretty often in the same words, privately and without knowledge of the party; if they feel but the slightest sensation before the property is removed from the person, it has been the constant rule, that that takes it out of that act of parliament; so in my apprehension, in the present case, this was not absolutely without the knowledge of the prosecutor, because he heard a rustling in the shop, and if he had gone out the first time upon that alarm, he certainly would have detected the offender; therefore, I think that the same construction should be put on this evidence, and you should acquit the prisoner of stealing privately.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on either of the prisoners? - No, I did not find any thing on them; I took Grist to the cage; when I came back his father wanted to know where he was; I went with him to the cage, I heard Grist tell his father that he did not do the robbery, it was Bryant did the robbery. I took him before the magistrate in the morning, I found nothing on any of them, but Bryant told me where the property was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What did you say to Bryant before he talked about where the property was? - I said nothing, only insisted on searching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him it would be better for him? - I did not, it was repeated to him, but I did not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear some body tell him that it would be better for him? - No, I do not recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, don't you know that somebody said, in your hearing, that he had better tell the truth, or something of that sort? - There may may be such words pass, but I do not recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. But you recollect the other part of the story, why don't you recollect that? upon your oath did it or did it not pass? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that some person, in your hearing, did not say so? - I don't know about the particulars of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You may as well, on this case, speak the truth, will you swear that such conversation did not pass; that there was expressed a promise of favour if he would confess? - I cannot tell particularly.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talked of shewing him favour, because he was a young man? - Yes, there was somebody told him that if Mr. Hudson got his property they dare say he would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any part of the property that was claimed? - Yes, I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it? - In the third, the further shed, on the second beam at the back of Mr. Richardson's hot house, I found there the two bank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190014"></xptr>notes, one twenty pound and ten pound, and the purse has been found since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look for them there? - Bryant told me to search there for them. In the first place he told me he had thrown them over the hedge; I told him I was sure he had not thrown the property away, and I insisted on searching of him; then he told me if I would go and look where I afterwards did, that I should find the two notes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the second beam in this shed? - He did, under a board in the hot house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bank notes? - I took them before the magistrate; I have got them now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these notes by this paper that they were wrapped in, being my own figuring, and my brother's; they were wrapped up in that paper when I put them in my purse.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. That is the paper they were in.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You had taken these notes that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Hawkins. What are you besides a baker? - A constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him? - About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He was quite sober, was not he? - No, I do not say he was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was not he very drunk? - He was not so drunk as what a man may be, he was capable of walking home.</p>
               <p>Q. And a very good way too; perhaps you have heard of a forty pounds reward? - Yes, but I don't want it.</p>
               <p>Q. There are three forties if these men are convicted? - I did it for the good of the parish where I live in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Hansell? - Yes, he was the man that gave me the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that Hudson was very drunk? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Hopton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him charge Hopton with being the person that robbed him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now my lord has asked you about this shed; he worked for Mr. Richardson, did not he? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. There are other workmen employed in the same place? - There are most an and in gentlemens gardens.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know there are other servants? - If I was to take my oath, to be sure I should say there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Bryant was found at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended him in his own bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not run away after committing the robbery? - He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body else might have put the notes there for what you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- DARK sworn.</p>
               <p>I know no more only picking up the watch chain; I found it on Sunday morning, near the place where Mr. Hudson was robbed, between the George and Mr. Hudson's lodgings, in the high road; I picked it up about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it here? - I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure that is the chain, I know the seal, the chain was broke off by the swivel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you see the prosecutor that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he drunk or sober? - I think he was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so drunk that he could not recollect any thing that he was about? - I am not used to the person, I cannot swear either one way or the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Hudson, the prosecutor? - Yes, he lives on his means.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on Saturday night, the night this affair happened? - Yes, he was very much in liquor when I saw him, when he said he was first robbed I went to him, to his own lodgings, and I asked him whether he knowed who it was? he said it was either me or Butler Grist; I told him I could give a good account of myself, and asked him whether he thought it was me? then he said no, it was Butler Grist, I asked him if he was sure it was him? he said yes, he knew him perfectly well, he knowed his person, then he said, go and get somebody to take him up, he said he would swear to him the next morning before any justice in the world; and this Butler Grist was taken up, and put into the round-house.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR HANSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gardener, and nursery man; I know the three prisoners, I know Bryant, I have known him many years, I never knew a miss thing of him, I have known Hudson about two years, he lives on his means in our neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Saturday that he talks of? - Yes, I went to smoke my pipe at the widow Thomas's, at the George, at Sunbury; it was about six o'clock, when I went in Hudson was there, and was very drunk indeed, and very abusive, with every person, I believe he came in very drunk, and the time he was there he drank three glasses of gin, and called for seven pots of beer, when he first came in he was very drunk, very drunk indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all this quantity of liquor did not help to make him sober? did you see him go out of the house? - I did not take particular notice, he went out several times in the course of the time, and came in again; the longer he continued the quarrelsomer he was with different people. I said to him as this, you are very troublesome in company, because he swore so very bad and often; I and another took down sixty nine oaths that he swore that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Hawkins say any thing about the three persons, Bryant and the other persons, when he had them in custody? - Mr. Hawkins could not find any thing on them, and he said he would acquit them; if that the prosecutor would acquit them; I said as you have taken them on suspicion, you have a right to keep them in hold, and you are very much to blame to acquit them, and we had words on that, about acquitting of them; the next morning I went to the justice's, to get him to stay at home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190016"></xptr>before he went to church, to give them an hearing, I went before the prisoners some considerable time, when I came before the justice, Hawkins accused me at the justice's of making Hudson drunk, and I never was in his company ten minutes; after that as I was coming from the justice's Mr. Hudson was having a glass of brandy, and after that I was accused of making him drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Hawkins talking about any reward? - Yes, when we came out of the justice's he said after a few words, he said you are only angry with me because I have cut you out of the blood money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Hudson had the three glasses of gin that you stated to the jury? - I am sure of it, I set in the room and see him call for it, and called for seven pints of beer, and he was very drunk when he came into the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bryant called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

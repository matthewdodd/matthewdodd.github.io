               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Cheek. No, if I had been sober I should not have done as I did. I went with them, and this good woman wanted me to undress myself and go to bed with her. I would not, but we sat together at the foot of the bed. I soon missed my money, and asked her to give it me again, but she denied having it.</p>

               <p>Cheek. I had it when I went into the room, a 36 s. piece and half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other woman near you?</p>

               <p>Cheek. I don't know that she touch'd me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it ?</p>
               <p>Cheek. Not till I got from sitting on the bed, when I charged her with it. I kept the door, and would not let her go out, when she went to a drawer and took out a knife and fork, saying she would strike the fork into me. Then she put the knife to my throat, and I held up my hand, when she cut the back of it, and had it not been there she would have cut my throat. The watchman coming by I charged him with her, and he took her to the watch-house, where we searched her, but found nothing. She denied having the money before the sitting alderman.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and as I was beating the hour ten I heard somebody call Watch out at a window. When I came into the room, there were the prosecutor, prisoner, and another woman; he charged me with the prisoner for taking a 36 s. piece and half a crown from him, but she denied it. I took her to the watch-house, the other woman got away.</p>

               <p>This man came to me and another woman, asking us to drink part of a pot of beer, which we did, and then he wanted to go to my room. We went thither, and he treated us with a dram. While the other young woman was gone for the dram he threw me on the bed, and wanted to be rude with me against my will. After that, he threw me down upon the stairs. I wanted him to go out of the room, and said my husband was coming. He said, d - n you, you b - h, I'll lay you sprawling. He pull'd me, and we fell down stairs together, and he drag'd me in the mud when the watchman came. I never saw any money.</p>

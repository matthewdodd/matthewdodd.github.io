            . I was employed with Cox at this place; I went to the shed between six and seven o'clock in the morning, just after him - there was snow on the ground, and I saw the foot marks of two men; the heel of one looked a good deal larger than the other; I traced them to the bottom of the garden, and then they got over the wall - I did not try to trace them any farther.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the marks? A. Down one side; we traced them about twenty rods from the window - the snow was all over the place; Cox locked up the garden-house in my presence - we took the key to Mr. Hill, and we did so every night; I am sure the marks were of men's feet.</p>

            , at St. Katharine's Docks, and he had to pay for it; it belonged to a carpenter, who came for 2s. 6d. for it, and I saw Piper's wife pay it - I was sitting in her house at the time; this was three years ago, when the Docks began.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is your husband? A. A carpenter, and he works for Mr. Slater, in Hackney-road - he was discharged some time ago when they were slack, but he is gone back again; I am sister-in-law to Piper - I did not look at the saw myself, but I heard them say there was the name of Hill on it. I do not know Mr. Hill, of Tottenham.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. No; I did not hear that an out-house had been broken open; I heard my brother was taken up - I now live at No. 9, Queen-street, Clerkenwell; it was three years ago he broke this saw.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER re-examined. Q. Did you have the accident to break this saw? A. Yes, sawing an appletree two years ago, and I kept it back some time that Mr. Hill might not see it - it is called a lock-saw.</p>

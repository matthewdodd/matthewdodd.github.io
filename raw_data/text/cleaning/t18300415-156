            . I am a constable of Bethnal-green. I went promiscuously to the meeting - I saw the two prisoners and two others with them, all in the same company - I have been a constable six years, and know such characters pretty well; Stockings went on the ground with another person, and met Davis and shook hands with him - they all hustled the prosecutor; Davis held up his coat, and Stockings took out his handkerchief with two fingers; I had seen them attempting several persons pockets before - I told the prosecutor of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Stockings. Q. Does it stand feasible that he could see this man hold up the pocket in such a crowd? A. Yes, I did.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoemaker, and a constable of Bethnal-green. I was at the meeting - I saw the prisoners meet and shake hands there; there were four in the gang - two backed up by two; I saw Davis lift up the pocket, but did not see Stockings draw the handkerchief - at that instant the mob began to separate; my brother officer went to the prosecutor, who felt and missed his handkerchief - I followed the prisoners, and heard Stockings say to Davis, "What have you got?" he said, "Only a snotter;" I seized one of them, and my brother officer the other.</p>
               <p>Stockings' Defence. I never saw this prisoner before in my life; the officer knows the man I shook hands with was not the prisoner - the gentleman at first said the handkerchief was worth 4d., and then he said 1s. 4d.</p>
               <p>Davis' Defence. I had no hand in it at all - I had never seen this prisoner.</p>

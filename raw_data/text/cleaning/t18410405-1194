On the 26th of March, about twelve o'clock, I was walking in Cornwall-street—the prisoner came up, and wished me to go home with her—I told her to go along, I did not want her—she continued walking on with me, wanting me to go with her, but I would not—I had about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in a bag, in my pocket—she took my bag from my pocket, and wanted to run away—I held her, and called out, "Police"—she shook the bag, and some money fell on the pavement out of the bag—the police then came up—this is my bag—there were two keys in it, which are here how.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Lucas-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. I went into King David-lane station, to speak to sergeant Harris on private business—while there I saw the prisoner brought in—she was placed in an outer room, near the fire—while sitting there I heard a sound like the jink of money, which attracted my attention—she was sitting within two feet of the fire at the time—I asked the reserve man on duty for a light—I took it, and looked underneath the grate, and there discovered some halfpence—I took them up, and on looking further I ob<lb></lb>served the bag which has been produced, and some keys—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, besides the halfpence—I have not the least doubt she is the per<lb></lb>son that threw them there—it was while she was waiting for the female to search her—I stated to the sergeant what I had seen.</p>

               <p>I keep the Brown Bear; and this prisoner is quartered there. Mr. Young came in on Monday, the 15th of March, and had a glass of gin and water, and sat down where there was a prisoner in the house; by and by he came to me, and said I am robbed? I said that cannot be; I accused the soldier; the other man was with him; he seemed very much flurried; they had taken this prisoner that was in the box; to the watch-house: I took the soldier into custody; I searched him, and found a shilling and some halfpence: Sir Sampson committed the soldier, and discharged the other.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hood, the last witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a shoe-maker, I believe; he comes to my house sometimes: the serjeant and corporal talked together; and they went to search a room by his direction; they found nothing: he said, search the room, under the bed; there I found two guineas, and a particular bad shilling, which the man had offered me before; a very remarkable shilling; I am positive this was the shilling he offered me before.</p>
               <p>(The shilling deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury: I have been quartered in the house since the 25th of last August always when I came off duty, I was in the tap-room: I never saw the man sleep, nor even saw him to my knowledge before, till this day: I am innocent of the crime: my witnesses waited till last night.</p>

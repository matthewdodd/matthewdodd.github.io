            .

            . I am an officer, on Saturday the 26th of August, about half after four in the afternoon, I saw the prosecutor and the other man come up Lambeth Street, with the prisoner; I took the prisoner, and searched him, he was without a coat in his shirt sleeves, I found upon him four one pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find upon him the property that Majora said he had lost - A. No, they turned out to be his own property, I then took him before the magistrate and he was committed.</p>

On the Saturday I was taken I was coming from Rag-fair going down the Minories towards Aldgate where I live, I saw that man crossing the road skipping, he ran down one of the turnings, I happened to run behind him another man came and laid hold of me and tore the jacket off my back, he called to the other that was running before me, they took me up to that gentleman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

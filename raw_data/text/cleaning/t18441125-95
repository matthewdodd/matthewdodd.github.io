                  </hi>. I live at St. Peter's-terrace, Hammersmith—I am landlord of the house, No. 1, Peter's Cottages—I let that house to the pris<lb></lb>oner Miller some time in Aug.—he took possession of it about the 10th of Sept.—he remained there till the night of the 26th of Sept. On going out in the morning on the 27th, I found people standing about the house, and they told me the tenants had gone away in the night—I rang the bell, and there was no one there—the police afterwards opened the house—I went in, and found nothing but three empty casks—Miller had taken the house for three years—he had not paid any rent—when he took the house he gave me a reference to Mr. Dell, No. 31, Windsor<lb></lb>terrace, City-road—I went there, and, to the best of my belief, the prisoner Charlotte Edge opened the door—I do not swear to her—I asked for Mr. Dell—she in<lb></lb>quired my name—I said I was a stranger to Mr. Dell, but I came about a reference, and I wished to see Mr. Dell—she asked me in<lb></lb>—I waited some little time, and the prisoner Samuel Edge came into the room—I had asked for Mr. Dell, and Samuel Edge appeared—I addressed him, and said I came to inquire about a Mr. Miller, who had taken a cottage of mine at Hammersmith, and I wished to know if I should be paid my rent—he said Mr. Miller was a very respectable man, he had rented under hit father for some years, and that his father and him were on very intimate terms—I then stated that mine was a small place, and the rent was not very large, it was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I described the place, and he said he should think it was a house exactly to suit the family—with that reference I was satisfied, and I went to a house occupied by Miller, where he had given me his card, in Ashford-street, Hoxton—the prisoner Dawers opened the door—I asked if Mr. Miller was in—she said he was not, he was gone into the City, and he would be at home about four o'clock—I said, "Will you tell him I am the person from Hammersmith, and the reference is satisfactory? "—I did not see Miller for a day or two, and I wrote him a note—I afterwards gave him possession of the house—I should not have let him had it if I had not had that account from Samuel Edge—the day before Miller quitted the cottage I saw Samuel Edge in the garden with Miller.</p>

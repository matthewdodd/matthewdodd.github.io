            . On the 10th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in London-fields, Hackney, and had a ridicule in my hand, containing this property, I was coming towards town, and near <placeName id="t18220220-128-crimeloc694">Exmouth-place</placeName>

               <p>"Stop thief! and was a good deal frightened. I did not see him laid hold of; but a young man who was before me, ran after him. I did not see whether he laid hold him - the prisoner was brought back in a quarter of an hour - my ridicule was produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. It was done so quick, you had no opportunity of seeing the person. - A. No; there were four or five examinations, I believe, before the magistrate. I did not understand that it was on account of insufficient evidence.</p>

            . I am assistant at Mr. Ayres' school, at Hackney. I was in the London-fields, and passed the prosecutrix, about fifty yards towards town; she had a ridicule in her hand, and was going towards town. I heard her call out, Stop thief! and saw a person run from her towards Exmouth-place; he was alone. I pursued and lost sight of him for about two minutes. I saw him come out of a private house, but had not seen him go in. I am sure the person who came out of the house was the same who I had seen running away. I went up and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man." Another person laid hold of him. I picked the ridicule up at his feet, and delivered it to Miss Gozard, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance was he when you first saw him running. - A. About fifty or sixty yards. I had passed both the prisoner and prosecutrix before I particularly remarked him as I passed, and have not a doubt about him. I am sure he is the person who ran from the lady.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live on Cambridge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200063"></xptr>Heath. I was at work in Exmouth-place, at an unfinished house, about one hundred yards from the footpath, and heard the cry of Stop thief! The prisoner had got by the house - he was running alone, and the only person I could see. I pursued him, and at the bottom of Exmouth-place, I lost sight of him for a minute or two. Mr. Hayward pointed him out to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man." I found him within twenty or thirty yards of where I lost sight of him. I believe nobody was in sight but the prisoner and Hayward. I saw the ridicule on the step where he stood - Hayward picked it up. I think it impossible for any body to drop it but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was he to it. - A. On the same step, about eighteen inches - it was on the step of a house enclosed with iron rails, and a fore court. I think no one could throw it there but him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he claim any acquaintance at that house. - No; it was Mr. Grout's house. - The door was shut.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Grout. I cannot speak to the prisoner. A person was taken at our door; that person had knocked at the door. I opened it, and said that I wanted nothing, and shut it directly; he then gave a double knock. I opened it, and he threw down this lady's ridicule, and appeared very much flurried. I picked it up, and threw it out directly, and believe he was taken at the door.</p>

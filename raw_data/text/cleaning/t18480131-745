                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Camberwell. Newton was in my service about eleven months—on the evening of 5th Jan., I was induced to watch him closely—I saw him go towards the slaughter-house between seven and eight o'clock, and heard him say to my brother, "I have just met Mr. Gillespie's cook, and she told me to bring a paunch down"—I knew he had taken one there the night previous—I thought it was false, and followed him down the yard, and when he had got into the slaughter-house I was just at the bottom of the garden, ten or twelve yards from the slaughter-house—I listened and heard him unbolt the back door of the slaughter-house, which opens to a passage leading to my slaughter-house, and to my neighbour's next door—it is opened occasionally—shortly after, he came out, and came past me—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "A paunch," and he told me the same story he had told my brother—I went into the slaughter-house—the back door was then fastened—I unfastened it, and went out—the passage was dark—I could not see anything—I felt about, and found a sack</p>

               <p>of fat a yard and a half, or two yards from the door, further up towards the end of the passage—I shut the door, and held it in my hand—I stopped a minute, or a minute and a half—I heard some one walk past the door up to the corner—I waited a minute or two till I thought he was ready to start, and then opened the door—it was so dark I could not see anything—I said, "Halloo! you are just the man I am waiting for"—I immediately felt Mat<lb></lb>thams—he had moved the sack from where it had been before—it was not a foot from him, close to his feet, and close to the door—it had been moved a yard and a half, or two yards from where it had first been—I am positive no one else had passed up the passage—I took him by the collar, and led him into my kitchen—I wanted him to bring the sack of fat—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said, "I know, and I will let you know shortly"—he said he had come up the passage for a necessary purpose—his clothes were not undone—I gave him and Newton into custody—a sovereign, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found on Newton, and four sovereigns in his box.</p>

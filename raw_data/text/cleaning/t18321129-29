On the 22nd of October I heard a person come in and go up stairs, who I thought was my son - I called to him twice, but he did not answer - I then heard my bed-room door open; I went up, and saw the prisoner in my yard - I said, "What do you want?" she said, "I came to see a lodger of yours;" I said I had no lodger - she then went round my yard; I went to her and said, "It is curious you should come into my house without asking me," and I saw my gown in a basket in her hand, and there were some plates and knives and forks in it; the gown had been in my bed-room, where I had wrapped it up about ten minutes before - she ran away, but in about half an hour she came opposite my house; my son and another lad ran after her - this is the gown.</p>

I went in pursuit of the prisoner - she ran down several streets, got into a stable, and hid herself, but the dog smelt her; I went in, and found her - when I got her out she fought and scratched my face very much, but I got her to my mistress', who took her to the station; the dog was poisoned on the Saturday afterwards.</p>

I was going with my brother's dinner, and on passing the prosecutor's I saw the gown rolled up - I took it, and put it into my basket; the prosecutrix snatched the basket from my hand, and said it was hers - I ran back to tell my mother, then went to her house, and went with her to the watch-house.</p>

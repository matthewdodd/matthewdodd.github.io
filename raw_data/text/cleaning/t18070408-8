On the 24th of February I was on the watch; after three o'clock it was my turn to go into the watch-house; I continued there till four, and then I went my round. I came up to <placeName id="t18070408-8-crimeloc45">the George ale house, in Pelham-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was any body standing with the dray at this time. - A. No, the whip laid on the curb, between the dray and the public house; in the course of a minute or two the prisoner Gun came out of the house with a bottle in his hand; he took up his whip, and drove off down to the store house with the seven barrels; where they were starting at the end of my beat. The store house belongs to Messrs. Hanbury and Co. In about twenty minutes afterwards I was sitting in my box. Gun came up to me with the empty dray; he says, what do you set there for, why did not you come and have something to drink. I said I did not know whether I might or no; he took hold of my hand, and shook hands with me. With that I found there was a finger wanting on his right hand. He drove off, in a direction to the brew-house; just before five o'clock I saw a dray coming from the brewhouse to go the store house, it stopped at the same public house; I stood up in my box, I saw a barrel go off the dray into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who took the barrel. - A. No, I was on the offside, I came out of my box and took my lanthorn, from which I took out a bit of chalk to mark the dray. When I came up to the dray, there was nobody then with the dray, the same as before; they were in the house; I marked the dray on the right hand of the horse, on the shafts of the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did you put upon it. - A. I went to make two crosses, I made one cross and a stroke, and then the chalk fell.</p>
               <p>Court. How many barrels were there on the dray. - A. Seven remained on the dray, and one I saw carried in. I heard somebody coming out of the house, then I walked away from the door. Gun quickly came out of the house, he came up to me, and said, why do not you come and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. About what time was this. - A. It was just before five when this happened. Gun said I shall be there in about ten minutes, come and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by there. - A. Where they were starting. I looked at my watch, it was just about five o'clock, then he drove off; I went my round, and then I went down to the store house, I staid there about two or three minutes; there were several <rs id="t18070408-8-viclabel46" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

            . - Mr. Alley. You are a police officer of Worship street. - A. I am. On Tuesday the 24th of February I apprehended Gunn, and then we went to the George public house, kept by Bowser, we found the cask and staves there; after I had seen them and found the beer in the cellar, I asked him how he came by them, he said he had paid three pounds for them; and he thought they were perquisites. I brought them to the public office, and they are here now.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. What are you. - A. I am a cooper by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last witness shew you a cask and some staves. - A. He did, a cask with one head in it and some staves, the cask was marked with Trueman and Hanbury's name upon it. I picked out the staves, and made two complete barrels.</p>
               <p>Gunn said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Bowser's Defence. When Gunn called on me the night before and had a pot of ale, he shook me by the hand and said, that he had heard say that I was a good civil fellow, and was well liked in the neighbourhhood, he should come and have his beer of me, and several more of his acquaintance; he ordered a pot of beer to be taken home to his house, which I took home myself. He afterwards wanted to say something to me in secret, we went into the kitchen together, he told me he could let me have a barrel of stout, he said they were perquisites. I asked him how much it was to be, he said a one pound note was the same as they had of others, he should not charge me any more. I asked him what I was to do with it, he said put it into the waste but, it would help the waste but very much; he asked me what time I would be up in the morning, for they were going to start beer, and they should give me a call in the morning. I understood that there was a good many of them, and it was worth my attention to be up early in the morning. I told him I would be up at any hour, he said he would bring the cask in the morning in his way to the store-house; accordingly he did, and ordered me to have a bottle of gin, which I gave him according to his orders; then they put the barrel down into the cellar, he said be could let me have two more, which he brought, one at each turn. When he went and put up his horses, he said he would come and empty them, which he did, and brought tools with him for that purpose; he knocked up the hoops so as he might be able to knock in the head; when he was knocking in the head the beer flew about; I left him and went into the tap-room for a considerable time, I went to see how he was getting on. he ordered a glass of gin, which I took him; he skimmed some of the froth off with his hand, and said it was very strong, and they ought to brew it all like that; he asked me how much I gave for a but of other beer, I could not say exactly, I told him near six pounds; he said that they sold that for nine pounds in about three months time; that was nearly all that passed at that time. We went into the bar, I asked him how much I was to pay him, he said four pounds; I told him that I understood that one barrel was to be only one pound, why was I to give him four for the three, he said I must give him a seven shilling piece then, or else he should be out of pocket. After I had gave him the three pound and the seven shilling piece, he asked me to give him change of a one pound note, which I did, supposing that he wanted change to divide it; I asked him how many there was, he said only three. He went away for some time, and then called again for half a pint of gin, and then he asked me to change him a one pound note, which I did. There were two came first in the morning, which I forgot to mention.</p>
               <p>Gunn called no witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Bowser called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 26th of December at half-past ten o'clock at night, I went out of my house, in Holloway place, and went down the Liverpool-road—I saw the two prisoners, who I have known some time, carrying a large deal plank from an unfinished house in Liverpool-terrace—I took Wyatt, and Warrener ran away—I be lieve they lodged together—I took the plank to the station-house with assistance.</p>

On the 29th of September, about five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner stand by the door of the privy, which is within twelve yards of my house; I saw another man crossing the yard, coming towards me, with the ducks in a bag, I opened the chamber window (which rather alarmed them) and called my brother, I told him to get up and run down stairs to stop them; when I called my brother out of bed I told him I saw some people in the garden, they began to run, I saw another man come out of the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. What house does your brother sleep in. - A. We both sleep in one bed; my brother ran down stairs and then he and I pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you take. - A. I took this man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is one of the men that you saw at the privy. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the privy when you took him. - A. About two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running. - A. He was running when we pursued him, but when we got up to him he got up to a corner as if to hide himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other men run. - A. Yes, they were running on when he stood at the corner; I took the prisoner up into Lower-street, Islington, and there I saw Austin, the watchman; I being in my shirt, I insisted on him taking this man to the watchhouse, he and my brother took him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290030"></xptr>watchhouse, in the mean time he was taken to the watchhouse, I went home and I saw I had missed three ducks and a drake.</p>
               <p>Q. They had no bag with them when they went off. - A. No, they stuck the bag in the privy, when they run off; in the mean time I was going up to the watchhouse to tell him what I had lost; the watchman came down to see what I had lost, and my brother found I had lost three ducks and a drake, they were stuck in the privy.</p>

On the 29th of September, which was quarter day, returning down that place, I went to the privy, but I never went into the privy; I never was in the place at all, I only stopped to make water, this man came and laid hold of me, and said you know where my ducks are, I said no, I do not; at the watchhouse, the constable wanted to discharge me, but he said he would not. In about half an hour afterwards he went and found where they were. I knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character,</p>

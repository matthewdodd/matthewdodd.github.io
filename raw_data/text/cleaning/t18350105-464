                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and live at Woolwich. I let a house to the younger prisoner—when they took the house, after having signed the agreement, I stated to them that there were fixtures belonging to the house, which were scheduled to me in my lease, which I</p>

               <p>was bound to deliver up—some were fixed, and some were in a room, the person who had the premises, having taken them down and deposited them there for safety—I went with the two prisoners and showed them these things—I said they were not to be taken down, but they might have them fox use—the salt-bin and the counters were down when they were let, but were fixed afterwards—there were four shelves; some were fixed and some were not—the four pieces of timber were not fixed; they were part of a recess—I went to the house on the 4th of December, having had information that they were in debt, and were about to remove—I de<lb></lb>manded the rent due on Michaelmas-day—they said they would pay me is three quarters of an hour—I said I should not wait—I went to take proceedings to seize their goods, and during the time I was gone into the town, one of the persons in the neighbourhood stood at the door and watched them—when I returned, I was told something—I then went to ascertain where some property was gone which I heard had been removed—I found three boxes at a beer retailer's, called The North Pole—I de<lb></lb>sired the landlady to detain them, which she did, till the Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, when I put in a distress warrant—on the Saturday following they paid the quarter's rent due at Michaelmas-day, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and redeemed the boxes—on the 17th a person of the name of Bowles, a broker, came and gave me some information—on the 18th I went to the house at eleven o'clock, and saw an errand-cart, with the name of "James Rogers" on it, standing at the door—the carrier was on the fore part of the cart, the elder prisoner was outside the door, and the younger prisoner was handing out boards, shelves, and different things to the elder prisoner, and he to the carrier on the cart, and he was packing them into the cart—I looked into the cart and saw a part of the salt-bin, and some shelves and fixtures—I had a constable there, and I ordered him to take it out, which he did—I had previously stated to the prisoners that they had got part of the property out of the premises which had been scheduled to me in my lease—they denied it—I have no donbt that this is a part of the property which I had let to them—they were taken to the magistrate, and ordered to be kept in custody till the following day, and they were taken to the cage—the constable demanded the key of the house from them, which they refused, and the elder prisoner said, "If you take it from my son, it will be a robbery"—the constable took the key and this book from the son, during which time the elder prisoner was fumbling about his pockets—he took out this book, took two leaves out, and began to tear them up, but the constable prevented him—I took up these bits of paper from the ground.</p>

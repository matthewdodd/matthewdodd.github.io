               <p>GEORGE PARRY. I live in Wood-street, Cheapside, and am a cooper. I know Mr. Piggot very well - He is now in France. On the 22d of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was with him, at Holborn-bridge, going into the City - We were walking arm in arm; Thompson came up, and asked if we had lost any thing? we each felt our pockets, and said we had not. Thompson produced a pocket-book, which I knew to he Mr. Piggots, I had seen him put it into his pocket about an hour before-Mr. Piggot claimed it when he saw it. The prisoner was then in custody. I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's. On the 22d of August, I was going up Holborn, on the opposite side to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner, in company with two others, on <placeName id="t18180909-44-crimeloc237">Holborn-hill</placeName>

Mr. Piggot and Mr. Parry passed them arm in arm; they got up immediately. One of them went up, and appeared to be trying their pockets. The prisoner and the other were about two yards behind; the other immediately left and joined them. They whispered together, and went up to the gentlemen again-the prisoner and the other appeared to be covering the first, who put his hand into Mr. Pigot's pocket, took something out, and handed it to the prisoner, who made a motion as if he put it under his waistcoat, and immediately crossed over. I seized him, and said, "You have robbed the gentleman," and asked him what he had got, whether it was a handkerchief, or what? he said he had nothing. I pulled him towards the gentlemen, and asked them if they had lost any thing? They at first said they had not. I requested them to feel again. I found the pocket-book in the prisoner's breeches-it only contained memorandums and a passport.</p>

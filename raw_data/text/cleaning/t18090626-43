There was a woman that worked with me, she ran out and called stop thief, and the prisoner called stop thief.

            . I am a constable. A little after ten at night, on the 8th of this month, I heard the cry of stop thief; I was in Bury-street, close to Duke's-place. I ran out of the door and saw the prisoner wrestling with two or three men; they charged him with the robbery. I seized him and took him back to the place where they said he had robbed; Mrs. Nash said the man had robbed her of two jackets; she produced the jackets before him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nash. The woman that followed him, is taken out of the way by bribery. That is the man that put his hand into my door. I am sure of it.</p>

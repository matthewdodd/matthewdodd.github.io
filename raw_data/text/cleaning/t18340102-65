               <p>EDWARD WATTS. I know Mr. Jerard - he is a customer of my master's, who is a butcher, in Leadenhall-market - on the 24th of December I left two pieces of beef, weighing nineteen pounds, and one pound of suet, at Mr. Jerard's - I did not fetch it back again, nor did anybody from our house; it was left for Mr. Jerard to consume in his family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons are in your master's service? A. One besides myself; he is not here - he is not my brother - he is twenty-five years old - he is not related to me - I did not fetch the beef back - I was going out with meat all the evening; what the other shopman might have done while I was out I cannot tell, whether he might have gone to fetch the meat again I cannot tell - I am not acquainted with the prisoner - I have seen him, and I think I may have spoken to him- I knew him about eight years ago, and I may have spoken to him since - I do not know that I have spoken to him within two years - I should be sorry to swear I have not spoken to him within six months; but eight years ago I lived near him - he was a butcher when I knew him - I have had no concerns with him within six months; not spoken to him to my knowledge - I cannot swear either way, because I am not certain - I have had no concerns with him, within eight years, that I know of - I knew him by living at a place - I do not remember speaking to him - I have not been in his company, I will swear, within six months - I do not think I have spoken to him - I did not say I had not spoken to him for eight years - I said I knew him then - I knew him when he lived with Mr. Scales, in Whitechapel. My fellow-servant is in very good health - I did not weigh the beef, nor was I present when it was weighed - I was sent with it - I know the quantity by the book - I left it at Mr. Jerard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been mistakes made in the conveyance of meat to different customers? A. At times we make mistakes - I do not know that one shop-boy has been sent to rectify the mistake - if I have left it in mistake, I have gone to change it, and sometimes a fellow-shopman has been sent instead of me, I being sent elsewhere - master ought to know whether my fellow-shopman was sent to fetch the beef away.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE ROGERS. I am servant to Henry Jerard - I recollect the beef and suet being brought by Watts - in half an hour, the prisoner came to the door - I know him perfectly well - he said his governor had sent him for the piece of meat which the young man had left by mistake - that the young man had taken the wrong piece off the block - I went and told my mistress, and she said it was quite right - I came down, and told the prisoner my mistress said it was quite right - he said it was not right; that it was another person's; and he would take it and bring another in exchange - I let him have it - he took it away, dish and all - I saw no more of it, nor the dish - I cannot be mistaken in the prisoner - I am positive of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you known the prisoner before? A. I never saw him before in my life - I have not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020037"></xptr>been in town long - I observed him - I did not take a fancy to him - I knew him when I saw him again - I looked in his face, and knew him again - I had no suspicion of him then - he is a particular-featured man - I should know him anywhere - I should know Watts again - I observed the prisoner, particularly his features and his dress - I had no reason for observing him - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; after dark - he stood at the door - there was a very strong gas-light at the door, that shone on his face exactly - I went down to the door to him three times - I received the messages from him, and went to my mistress and told her - I took no particular observation the first time; the second time, I gave the message, which took about a minute - I observed his features and dress - I should know him from all the men in the world - he has particular features - I did not observe that he was pockmarked; he might have been so, without my observing it - I cannot positively say what coloured stock he had round his neck - he had a light jacket - he had neither a cap nor hat on; I am sure of that - he had not a board on the top of his head - he took it away in the dish - he was not bald - I did not observe that he was - I cannot say whether he was - I know him by his features - I had never seen him before - I was not quite a minute the second time - I went down to him three times - I only took the meat down and gave it him the third time, which took a second or two - I have been about three months from the country - I was never in London before.</p>
               <p>HENRY JERARD. I saw nothing of the transaction - the butcher lives about the one-eighth of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Has your butcher sent different men to your house? A. Yes; certainly he has, for years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it all to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Abraham Keyner, publican, Bethnal-green, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

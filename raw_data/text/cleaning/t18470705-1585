                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live at Little Stanmore. On the 26th of June, about half-past three o'clock, I was called to my field—there had been a sheep there—I found a dead sheep in a wheel-barrow in a lane leading from the field—it was my sheep, I had seen it safe the afternoon before; I can swear it was mine.</p>

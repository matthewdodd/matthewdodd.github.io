                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer—I had seen the prisoner about a week before this happened. On the 29th of August I went into a public-house, and went into the back-yard to sleep—the prisoner came in about half-an-hour afterwards—I had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my left-hand coat-pocket—the prisoner was not there when I went to sleep—I lost my money, but the purse was left by my side—on Sunday evening I met the prisoner, and spoke to him about it—he said he had taken 9 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him in charge.</p>

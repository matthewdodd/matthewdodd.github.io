                  </hi>. I live in Brewer-street, Pimlico. On the 12th of June, about twenty minutes past ten at night, I met the prisoner at Buck<lb></lb>ingham-gate—she asked me if I would give her a drop of gin—I took her into the White Horse—we had a quartern of gin, came out together, and came down St. James'-street together, walking side by side till we came to William-street, when she turned up a dark passage—I put my hand in my pocket, missed my money, and followed her—she met me, and said there was no thoroughfare, I could not go through—I accused her of robbing me—she denied it—a policeman came, and I gave her in charge—I had had one sove<lb></lb>reign, three half-crowns, and one shilling and sixpence loose in my pocket—it was my wages which I had received, and an old coin which I had found three weeks ago—this now produced is it—I swear to it by this figure "7" on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable.</hi>) I took the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor—he had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was about—the place is no thoroughfare—I got a lamp, made a search, but found nothing—next morning, between three and four o'clock, I searched again—I saw two half-crowns in a piece of rag, pulled out from behind an old board, ten or twelve yards from the end of the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I search females at the Westminster Police-station. On Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I searched the prisoner, and found this coin in a pair of mittens which she had on, and a shilling, a sixpence, and a halfpenny in her pocket—after I undressed her completely, I said, "What have you got in your hand"—she said "Only an old dirty glove"—I do not know where she took it from, but I think it was from her bosom—I found this half-crown in it.</p>

            . I am a Custom-house officer. On the morning of the 27th of October, about eleven o'clock, I was on board a Spanish vessel in the Union-tier, on the Thames, - a Spanish boy gave me information; I jumped into the lug boat, and went on board the brig John, which was about twenty yards off; about five minutes before I went on board, I had seen a person leave the John in the revenue boat - I do not know whether he saw me; as soon as I got on board the John, I saw Miller standing in the cabin, with his head out of the hatchway, and I smelt a smell of whiskey coming from the hold; I said to Miller,"What have you got in this craft?" he said spirits, which he was going to take to Dundee-wharf: I said,"You have been broaching these spirits" - he said he had not; I said, "I know you have" - I was preparing to slip down a small space between the casks, when the boy Ramage came from underneath; I went below, and saw a bladder, containing about three pints of whiskey: one of the casks appeared to have been recently spiled, and it was in tears; I took the bladder on the deck, and went into the cabin; my surveyor came on board - he sent for an officer, who took Miller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you see Metcalfe's brother going along the river? A. I did; I inquired of him about the prosecutor, and he told me.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. I went on board the John, and found Miller, Ramage, and this bladder of spirits, I asked them how the bladder came on board; they said they did not know, if any one brought it, Metcalfe did; I saw Metcalfe at Union-stairs, and took him - he said he knew nothing about it; I should think no one could have gone on board the John without knowing that the whiskey was issuing out of the barrels: I took Metcalfe to the office, and in going along he told me his master had given him a shilling to take to Miller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When you say you saw Metcalfe on the stairs, do you mean the prisoner or his brother? A. The prisoner; I had seen his brother before, and told him I wanted his brother - I found the prisoner standing at the stairs, like other watermen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What time did you go on board? A.About ten o'clock, and then they mentioned to me about the spirits - the officer came and took me before I had gone to row the skiff up; I will swear nothing had been said to me about spirits before I went on board at ten o'clock; I had not asked Savage to go on board and drink whiskey with me - I know

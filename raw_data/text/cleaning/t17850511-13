               <p>About twenty minutes after eight, on the 5th of April, I saw the prisoner coming by with a parcel under his left arm, that answered the description of what Mr. Penny had lost, the bundle was something white in the front; he was coming towards Cheapside way; he was dressed in a light drab coat, his coat was closed on the right side; he just turned his head and looked at me; I saw no apron at all, I saw his bundle, I knew him before, I have known him a good while, I knew him when he came into St. Ann's school, I am sure it was him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. How far was you from the prisoner when he came out? - He just made way, and I made way for him, the bundle was under his left arm, I was not a yard from him, and his coat was closed on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Did you follow after the prisoner? - No.</p>

               <p>I had information that the prisoner had robbed this gentleman's shop of a quantity of gloves; me and my brother officer went in pursuit of him several times, at last we found him in Aldersgate-street, and took him into custody; he had nothing upon him; I told him what I took him up for, and he denied it, nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Court to Edwards. How came you to take notice of this particular parcel of gloves? - Because they were to be called for the next day; they were in a paper, tied round with one string; they were a pretty large size, about twenty inches long, and six or seven inches deep: I heard of the alarm about half an hour after I put the things by, then I found that parcel was missing; I found Shipley at the door, when I came down he told me there had been somebody in the house, and he supposed they had taken something out.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you this somebody was? - No, he did not know then, but this lad Askew told him afterwards that it was Metcalf who went to school with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, to Mr. Penny. Do you send your goods to the waggon by your own servants? - Yes, this parcel was looked out by a gentleman of Chichester.</p>
               <p>Shipley. My Lord, I told him then that I did know, I will take my oath that I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, when Mr. Clarke and that gentleman took me up, they said they would tell me by and by what it was for, when I came to the Compter, they said I should know by and by, they went and fetched that gentleman in green, and I was called out seperately by myself.</p>

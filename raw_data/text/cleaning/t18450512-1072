I live with my brother, Richard Daniels, who is in partnership with my brother Thomas as <hi rend="italic">cheesemongers.</hi> On Thursday evening, the 10th of April, I was at their shop—I had put two casks of butter at the door that afternoon—I missed one about half-past eight o'clock—I had seen it safe about a quarter past eight o'clock, and about five minutes after I missed it, it was brought back by a constable—it was my brother's property.</p>

I was in company with Mumford on the 10th of April, in Ratcliff-highway, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoners coming and crossing over the road by Bluegate-fields—Hay was about a yard, or a yard and a half, behind Dudley, who was carrying a basket in his hand, containing a tub—they came from West-gardens, which is not above forty or fifty yards from the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—as they passed up Bluegate-fields I followed them—Hay had a hat in his hand—he saw me, turned round, and went in front of Dudley, put his hand to Dudley's head, and pushed the basket from his head—it fell at my feet—they both ran away—I pursued, but lost them—Mumford stopped behind and detained the basket—I can swear to both the pri<lb></lb>soners—I knew them before, and have seen them frequently.</p>

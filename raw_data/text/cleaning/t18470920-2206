                  </hi> I am single, and am servant of all work at Mr. Thomas Furley's, a grocer, of Upper Clapton—I always go by the name of Piper. On the 9th of Sept. I came down about ten minutes to seven, and found the door lead<lb></lb>ing from the passage into the kitchen open—the washhouse-door was shut, but unbolted—I did not take any notice of it, the young men being down before me—while lighting the fire I looked up the passage leading to the street-door, and saw the prisoner standing there—there is a door from the passage into the shop, and another into the parlour—it communicates with the stair-case—I asked what she wanted—she said she wanted Mrs. Furley—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not living there then—she said she had been up to Mrs. Furley, and she was coming down directly—I went into the parlour, then into the kitchen, and then my master gave the alarm that the cash-box had been stolen—I came back and the prisoner was gone—about half an hour afterwards I went into the garden and found this basket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) filled up with things, and a wrapper tied close down over them—there appeared to be more in it then there is now—it stood just inside the back garden-gate, which leads into the street at the back of the house—I saw Miss Furley's shoes in it, some tea sugar, and other things—I pushed the gate open, it was unfastened—I found this work-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the basket—it is mine—I had it only the night before—this petticoat is mine—it was found in the basket.</p>

I saw her in the privy the policeman's custody.</p>

            . I was in the stable at the time the prisoners broke open the coach-house door, they picked the lock I suppose for, I found the lock picked in the morning, I took the prisoners in the fact; I heard somebody in the coach-house, I went to the door and found it open, I called out twice who is there, having no answer, I shut the door and fastened it on the outside, and then got a light and came and took Court; he bid me not ill-use him, for hang or not hang it was the same to him; after some little search, I found Ford, the glass and hammer cloth were taken from the coach and set down by the side.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I was called and charged with the prisoners; as I was taking them to the watch house, they attempted to make their escape, Court pulled out a knife, I observed it and took it from him and put it in my pocket, I thought it would be safer there; when we came to the watch house Ford pulled out a knife and cut me across the chin, and then made a stroke at my arm, and cut through two coats and my shirt; but as Providence would have it, did not cut the flesh; he made another stroke at my wrist and cut through my coat.</p>

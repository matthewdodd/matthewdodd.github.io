            . I live in Wilson-street, Somers Town. On the 1st of September I saw the two prisoners, Whittel and Wood, between five and six o'clock, they were coming along the road from Hampstead, just by the turnpike gate. They were driving three pigs, two little ones and a big one. The pigs were dirty; they appeared to be disguised with some stuff. I do not know what, and appeared as if they had been driven some way. I told the man at the turnpike I thought them pigs were stolen. I then fetched Avory, the officer; he took them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 1st of September. Truro called upon me; I went with him to the New-road, near Pentonville chapel. I observed the prisoner Wood coming out of a public-house door; directly he saw me he turned back and ran in doors. I met Whittel just as he was coming out of the Lord Vernon's Arms door, the same public-house. The sow and pigs at that time were laying opposite of the said public-house; they appeared very much fatigued. The pigs were very much splashed over with tar. When I secured Whittel, Wood absconded; he was brought to me by Dobson. I asked the prisoners where they brought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150018"></xptr>pigs from. They said they knew nothing of them. I took the pigs to my own home until they were sworn to at Bow-street office.</p>

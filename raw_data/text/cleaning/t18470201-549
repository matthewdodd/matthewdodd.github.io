               <p>night of the 8th of Jan. I was one of the last persons up, with my wife and housekeeper—it was the practice of the potman to leave between ten and half-past ten at night—I went to bed on the night in question about twelve, or half-past—I had seen nothing of the prisoner James Barker from half-past ten till the time I went to bed—the last time I saw him that night was at a quarter before ten—he was then opposite the bar—he was fastening up the shutters in the front of the house—there are places where he might have concealed himself in the house—I went over the house that evening to see that the fas<lb></lb>tenings were all safe—I saw the shutters of the front window, where I had seen him a little before ten o'clock—the screw was placed in the hole, and to all appearance fastened, until I went to try the fastenings, as I do every night, and I then found it was only placed inside, to deceive me—it was insecure—it was placed so on purpose, because I always found the place left secure except that night—if the shutters had remained in that way it would have been easy to get in at the front, without any noise at all—I made them fast—I then did what I usually do with my cash-box—I went round the back of the house, and it was all safe then—the back window leading into the garden was down and faxtened, and the blind in its proper place—it is a dwarf blind at the bottom of the window—I went all round the back, inside the house, not outside—I took up the basket with me and the cash-box, according to my usual custom, and locked up the other cash-box in an iron safe—I locked my bedroom door as usual, and, as far as I recollect, I left the key crossways in the lock ad it is now—(<hi rend="italic">the lock was Produced</hi>)—a little after six o'clock next morning I was awoke by Cowles, the gardener—I had not been disturbed during the night—as soon as the alarm was given I found my bedroom door half open—the gardener did not come into the room—he came to the door and knocked—I received a light from his lantern, then discovered that my cash-box and key were gone—I then went down stairs—I observed the piece of iron produced sticking through the key-hole of my bedroom door—I ran against it—I went down to the parlour, and found the iron safe half open, and my bunch of keys lying on the ground—it had been opened by those keys—I missed the other cash<lb></lb>box from the safe—the cash-box in my bedroom contained 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, chiefly silver—the cash-box in my contained one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and some silsver and gold; making altogether 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed a good deal of property altogether, about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—more than half of the money was cash—I missed two gold watches, a gold guard, a gold chain and key, and one silver watch out of the back of the drawer in my bedroom, some glass decanters, and pint rummers, a bottle of gin, and a hat—I found the bottle afterwards, broken, and about a gill of the gin left—the police came, and went round the back part of the house—I found my hat in the water-closet, burnt in the inside, as if a candle had been concealed in it—the name was burnt out—they had had the hat to screen their lantern, to examine the papers with; some dock warrants, and other papers, of no value to any person but myself, were found in the water-closet—I went round the house and fount no marks of violence outside—I went to the coffee-room window at the back of the house, and found it part of the way open—the dwarf blind was moved on one side, and the window open sufficient wide to admit a man, or two men, at a time—a person could get at the front window, the shutter of which was un<lb></lb>screwed without leaving any marks at all, but behind the house they must get into the garden, and come to the coffee-room window—they had piled some baskets to get up on to reach the bottom cill the window, which is about eight feet from the ground of the garden—there were about six one-dozen wine-baskets piled up to form steps to the window—they could get within one foot of the window from the baskets—there was nothing at all about the</p>

On the morning of the 9th Jan., about half-past seven o'clock, I went to Mr. Edmonds's house—I went into the garden and found a cash-box, and several papers under a tree in the center of the garden—I found another cash-box in the water<lb></lb>closet in the yard, and also the hat which Mr. Edmonds has spoken of—I went round the garden, and found footmarks in the north corner</p>

On the 9th of Jan., about eleven o'clock, I was at the station, and saw Sergeant Wood take off from George Barker a pair of boots—when he had done so I accompanied Wood to Mr. Edmonds garden, and found foot prints of two persons—they were in the left hand corner of the garden, and at the end of the path leading from the house to the fence—there were the footmarks of two persons at D and also at B—there were no footmarks from D towards C—the toes were towards the garden fence, and within the garden, as though of a person coming from the house on to the railway—those were footmarks of two person—they appeared to have got over at C, the place where I saw the double marks—in one other place there were the marks of footsteps both ways, coming and going, and in one place they were only in one direction, going towards the fence—there were the footmarks of two person going from the garden towards the fence, and then footmarks of another person going to and coming from—that was nearly opposite the back door of the house, in the garden, at the railway end of the garden, nearly in the middle—the plan accuarately shows the situation of the footmarks—there were the marks of the prints across some ground which had been dug up, between the garden and the railway—they were of two persons, and they were at D also—I should think there were half a dozen marks there—the foot marks at B were of two persons going, and the impressions of the one coming, apparently from the railway, of two going in a direction from the house, and also the footmarks of one person having gone towards the house—at D there were the footmarks of more than one person going away, all going towards the fence—I saw George's boots compared with the impressions at the point D—they were compared by making an impression at the side of them, and not by putting the boot into the impression already made—they corresponded exactly with the impression already there, both the right and left—they were nailed boots, and in the centre there were twenty-four nails in three rows, eight in each row—I also made an impression at the point B, where I observed the marks of going and coming, and they also corresponded—there were three large nails in the toe of the right boot—the footmarks of the one person coming corresponded with George's boots, and the footmarks of the one person coming corresponded with sponded with George's boots—there were three large nails in the right boot, which had been put in since the boots had been made—the nails had been worn away, and these had been substituted for them, in the toe of the right boot—I found in the impressions the marks of those three larger nails—there was</p>

               <p>row of small nails on the left, and they corresponded with the impression I found on the ground—I firmly believe these boots made the impressions—I afterwards took James's boots off—they had no nails—I have them here—I compared them with the footprints of the other person, and they corre<lb></lb>sponded exactly in length and breadth, and in the size of the toe—the im<lb></lb>pression fails towards the toe—they appeared to have been too long for the person who wore them—I went also to Horrow-lane and made an impression with the boots there—I should say both of the boots had made the impress<lb></lb>sions which were there—they were on the bank leading from the railway to Harrow-lane, in a direction as though from the garden fence towareds Har<lb></lb>row-lane, and from there towards the railway fence—it was on the bank of the railway into Harrow-lane—there were the impressions of both—we compared them, and they exactly agreed—they were going from the railway towards Harrow-lane—the ground on the railway line is hard gravel—we could trace the impression of the nailed boots both going and coming, in the vacant space between the railway and the garden, and the other footmarks only from the garden towards the railway.</p>

I have been cook at Mr. Edmonds' lately—I know the prisoner James—about a fortnight before the robbery I met him on the stairs, going up second flight—that was close by my master's bedroom—I said, "Hallo James!"—he made very little answer to that—he gave no reason for being there—he had no right to be there that I knew of—I know George—I saw him there on the Friday, the very day of the robbery—he was talking to James.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 3d of August, I found that we had lost between 20 and 30 lbs. of silk - some raw and some boiled; it was taken from a closet in our skeining-room. On examination, I found that the premises had been entered by the churchyard-wall, which joins the back of them - they must have entered our loft to go to the skeining-room door, which was in the dye-house; they had endeavoured to force the door open - the key of this door had usually been hung up at a distant part of the dye-house, which the prisoner knew, but it was not there that night. After failing in their attempt to open the door, it appears that they must have returned up stairs and taken out some four inch brick-work, which made an opening into a room over the skeining-room, where there is a flap-door communicating with it, which is not always locked; the key of the closet was in the foreman's desk in the skeining-room. This desk was wrenched open, the key of the closet taken out, and opened with it - the closet was not forced open, but all this silk was taken out of it. Next morning, when the people came to work, they discovered the loss, and on looking round, one of them found an old coat of the prisoner's in the lower part of the premises, where the door had first been attempted. I have never found the silk.</p>

In the morning I found the place had been entered and robbed. On examination, I found they had taken down a board, got into the loft, and broken a four-inch wall, and got through the trap-door into the skeining-room. My desk was broken open to get the key of the closet, as I found the key in the closet, which was not broken open. It must have been some one who knew the premises. I saw the coat which was found, it is the prisoner's. We lost about 30 lbs. of silk.</p>

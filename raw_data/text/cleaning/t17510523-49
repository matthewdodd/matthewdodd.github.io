            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Oram: On Saturday the 4th of this instant, my master desir'd I would go down below and see for some clean tea lead, and under the lead I found this parcel of tea concealed; I went up stairs, and fetch'd down the journeyman to let him see it; we both agreed to let it lie and see who would take it away, which we did after supper ; he and I watched, I saw the prisoner go down with a c andle, by which light I saw him go to the place; he came up again, and after he had shut up the shop he went down again with a candle; we look'd through the cellar window and saw him take the tea from thence; we let him come up stairs, and as he was going out of the house we stop'd him, he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing concerning this?</p>
               <p>Blechynden. I heard him acknowledge to Mr. Oram, he would make him satisfaction, but I was sent to fetch a constable, and was not there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Oram. Did he say from whence he had taken the tea?</p>
               <p>Mr. Oram. He pointed to a tea canister, and said, he had it there.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 28th of May, in the evening, I was coming out of the yard, and saw the prisoner upon the steps of the street door, going out; I ran after him, and met Mr. Meakins, I told him, I believed that man had run away with some things from our house; I went back to see if the things were gone, and missed the things in the indictment; Mr. Meakins and I pursued the man.</p>
               <p>When you came out again was he still in sight? - Yes, Mr. Meakins overtook him first.</p>
               <p>Was he ever out of sight before Mr. Meakins took him? - Yes, he had turned the corner, he had got rid of the things, they were never found, except the trimming of the cloak which he dropped in the passage of the house.</p>
               <p>Are you certain he was the person? - Yes, I know him by his walk and his dress.</p>
               <p>Was he running? - No, walking very composedly.</p>
               <p>How far were you from him when you saw him going down the steps? - About a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>You did not see him have the things? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - Yes, but nothing was found.</p>

               <p>Did you see whether he had the things when he turned the corner? - No, I could not, because his back was to me, but if he had got rid of them before he turned the corner I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>There was nothing found upon the prisoner? - No.</p>

            , April 21. *</p> 
               <p>Robert Berry. I went out on a Sunday morning, a month next Sunday; I left my watch hanging up on a nail in the Kitchen in the house of

            ; I went out, and returned in about half an hour, and it was gone. I heard the prisoner had taken it; I went to her house, and she confessed to me she did take it, and so she did also before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she took it?</p>
               <p>Berry. She told me she came into the kitchen to light a candle, and she took it from off a nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she belong to the house?</p>
               <p>Berry. She does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with the watch again?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, I never did; she said she went to the constable's house, and shewed it there; and one

            . I saw the watch hanging there when we went out in the morning, and it was missing when I came home. We took up a man that lodged in the house upon suspicion; but the next day she owned she had taken it, then we discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner own she took it?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going to a chandler's-shop for some sand, and there came a man and asked me to carry a watch to pawn. I went to carry it; going along,

             snatched it out of my hand. When I knew this man lost the watch, I went and let him know of it, and had Perry taken up. He was carried before the justice; he is a gambler, and there came about twenty Iriishmen to swear for him, and he was cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. to Berry. Did she come to you and tell you Perry had the Watch?</p>
               <p>Berry. No, she did not; another woman came and told me the prisoner had taken it, and I went to her, and asked her if she took it, and she said yes, I did; I took it to the constable's house, and

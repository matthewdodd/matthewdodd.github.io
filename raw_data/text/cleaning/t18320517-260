               <p>SUSANNAH LEESON. I am the wife of John Leeson. -On the morning of the 2nd of May the prisoner came to my house, to inquire after me - he had formerly lodged in the same court, and had shown some attention to my brother-in-law when he was in the hospital; I went down stairs to buy a bundle of wood, and left the prisoner alone in the room - on my return I met him on the stairs; I had not been gone above three minutes - I said, "Are you going?" he said he would return in a moment - on my going up I missed a watch, which I had left hanging over my mantelpiece - when I went down it wanted twenty-five minutes to nine o'clock; I had not been out of the house for the wood - I ran after him; he was running down an alley into Rose-lane, and then he took some of the back streets, and turned into Wentworth-street; I have never seen the watch since, and the prisoner never returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She went down the court, and said, "Are you going?" and I said "Yes, but I shan't be long before I come back," but I met a man, who detained me. Witness. I had not left the house.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER SANDERS. I am the witness' brother-in-law. I had seen the prisoner at their house once before; I met him, and told him my brother-in-law wanted to speak to him - he said, "I am going there;" I said, "Well then, I'll go with you;" we went on till we came to the top of the Minories, and then he ran away, in a different direction - I ran and took him; I got him to Somerset-street, but no farther - I then got an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not two yards from him from the time he first spoke to me. Witness. He set off to run, but I stopped him immediately.</p>

            . I was with my husband when he stopped the prisoner at the corner of the Poultry, and said"My brother-in-law wants to speak to you;" he said,"I am going there;" I said, "My brother-in-law only wishes you to give up the duplicate, if you have it; I know he will forgive you;" he went to the Minories, and then tried to run off; my husband seized him, and would not let him go.</p>

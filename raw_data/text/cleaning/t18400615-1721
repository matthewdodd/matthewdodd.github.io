                  </hi>I am in the employ of Rebecca Holmes, who is single, and lives at Hackney. On the 12th of June, the prisoner Imbert came to the shop, and asked for some ribbon—shortly after Lewis came in, and looked at some mouseline-de-laine dresses—she took up one, but it was too dear for her—I showed her some others, which she did not approve of—she bought some other things—the prisoners were near one another—I suppose Imbert was in the shop half-an-hour after Lewis had left—I found that Imbert had not made a purchase—I asked her if she wished to purchase—she said, "Yes, " and described a ribbon that her sister had had before, but it was a ribbon we never bad—she then made an apology, and left without buying any thing—I followed her, and found the two prisoners just joining one another on the pavement, and conversing—they turned round and walked up Clapton together, talking—I met a police<lb></lb>man, and on overtaking them, Lewis said that Imbert was just telling her how she had been treated in the shop—I told them I suspected they had some<lb></lb>thing—Imbert said she was perfectly willing to be searched, which she was—nothing was found on her, but this ribbon was found under Lewis's arm, by the policeman—it is my mistress's—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>I am a sergeant of police. I saw the prisoners walking close together—they were apparently talking, and seemed to know each other—I came up, and the witness charged them from their conduct in the shop—Imbert said I might search her, and Lewis said the same—she lifted up one of her arms, and a part of her shawl—I took up her other arm, and took this ribbon from her—Imbert had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and Lewis had 7¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

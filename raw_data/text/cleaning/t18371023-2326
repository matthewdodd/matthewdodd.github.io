                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a baker's shop, in Spencer-street. On Wednesday evening, the 11th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for change for a sovereign—I laid it on the book—it was a good one—I gave him a half sovereign, three half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence change—he laid his hand on the sovereign, and changed it, and put a piece of coin down instead—he took my money, and ran away—I immediately dis<lb></lb>covered the exchange, and called after him—the servant girl, who was watch<lb></lb>ing him, pursued him—he was brought back, and denied that he had been in the shop—I have not the slightest doubt of him—he was brought back in three minutes and a half.</p>

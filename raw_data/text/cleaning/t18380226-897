                  </hi>. I live at the Chequers tap, at Hayes Wharf, Tooley-street; it is kept by John Postance, and is in the parish of St. Olave. On the 15th of February I was in the tap-room, and saw the prisoner there with another person, about one o'clock in the day—I was cooking—I saw a door open on the stairs—it had been locked—I had locked it just before myself—it led up stairs to the bedroom—I had occasion to go up stairs, and then found the door wide open—I ran up into the bedroom, and as I came down I met the prisoner on the second story—he had no business there—we had no lodgers—I laid hold of him, and he broke from me, and ran into Mill-lane, without his hat—I followed, calling "Stop-thief" all the way—there was a brooch in a drawer in my master's room—that was gone—there were also six sovereigns wrapped in paper, a silver chain, a snuff-box, and a guinea—the chain is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the brooch 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I went up stairs, I found all the drawers wide open—nobody could have done it but the prisoner.</p>

I went up to the room which he had come out of, and found my gown there; my own door was open, and a strange key in it; I had locked it at four o'clock, and had the key in my pocket; I had left the gown in my own room; it was dark.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of January I saw the prisoner running in Cleaveland-street, as fast as possible; I stood till he came up to me, and then stopped him; Kepple gave him in charge. I took him back, but found nothing on him. The servant came down, and said her gown was gone, and she had found it in the next room - she shewed it to me. He had no shoes on.</p>

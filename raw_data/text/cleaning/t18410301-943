                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Maunder, and live in the school-house, St. James's-walk, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 13th of December my husband and I went to church together, about half-past six o'clock in the evening—I fastened the house, and left the doors and all secure, and the articles stated safe—we returned from church about half-past eight, and could not get into the house—this skeleton key was in the door—my husband got in at the back, and let me in—I then missed the money and property stated—some had been locked up in a drawer, which was broken open—in consequence of information, I afterwards went to Featherstone-street station—I do not remember the day, it was in the early part of February—I there saw a lace veil, which I had not missed before—I knew it immediately my attention was brought to it—I also saw some shirts which were produced by the pawnbroker—those now produced are them—here is my own needle-work in them—this lace veil is also mine, and this hair-guard, silver tooth-pick, and little coin—they were all safe in the house when I went to church—I had left all the doors fastened, and bolted with two bolts—we came out at the front-door, and locked that after us.</p>

Smith of Bedford"—she said, "It is all right, I am Mrs. Terry"—I left the parcel, confiding in the truth of her re<lb></lb>presentations—about five minutes after I found out that I had left the parcel at the wrong place—I directly went back to the same house and knocked at the door, but could not get admittance—I remained about the house till six o'clock (it was about eleven o'clock when I first went)—I got a police-sergeant to be with me—I afterwards saw the parcel in his posses<lb></lb>sion—it contained the same things I had seen packed up—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

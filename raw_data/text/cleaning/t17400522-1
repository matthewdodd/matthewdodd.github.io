               <p>Hen. Hales. Josias Brain called me up Stairs at that time, and told me his Wife suspected the Prisoner had taken a Spoon. I put one Hand down her Bosom, and the other Hand up her Petticoats, and took the Spoon from under her Petticoat- Strings, between her Skin and her Smock, and the Tightness of her Petticoat-Strings had bent it. This is the same Spoon I took from her, and which Brian own'd to be his. She deny'd the Fact, till I found it upon her; then she said she was sorry for it, and when she was before the Justice, she begg'd for Mercy.</p>

            . I am the Wife of the first Witness. The Prisoner on the 6th of May sent to desire me to come to her, and she would inform me that I might have a Child to nurse, of one Mr Foster in the Temple. But I had some Milk then boiling on the Fire, so I desired her to come to me for an Answer. She accordingly came, and while she was in the Room, I missed the Spoon from a little Stand at the End of the Chimney: I was sure I laid it there while the Milk was boiling, and therefore I taxed her with taking it. She denied it, and said she would make me suffer for challenging her upon such an Account, and told me I had only mislaid it: But I sent for my Husband, and the Prisoner was taken by him and Hales, into another Room, where (they told me) they searched her, and this is the Spoon which I missed, and which (they said) they found upon her. When I first charged her with taking it, she threatened me, and said, - whoever took it away would certainly have taken the rest, for there were two other little Spoons lay by it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did take it up, and I thought to have laid it down again before I went out of the Room, - but I did not.</p>

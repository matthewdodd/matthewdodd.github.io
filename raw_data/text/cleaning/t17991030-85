               <p>Q. Had you observed any body about your cart? - A. No; I saw the property again at the office, the first of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you state whether this is or not the same property that you lost? - A. I positively believe it to be mine; I am sure it has been drawn this year, that I am very positive of, because it gets thick; it now weighs eighteen pounds ten ounces; it has been shifted twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any thing else? - A. I am confident it was drawn either in August or September; this year there are not more than three about here that draw it I believe; I draw more than any body else; I have heard that there are some at York in that way; that quantity can only be wanted by a very respectable chemist and druggist or distiller, they use a great deal; the value when I lost it was sixty pounds eight shillings, and it has been rising in price ever since; a pint weighs a pound, it was sixty four shillings a pound at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe I heard you right, that though you have a very strong belief on the subject, you will not undertake to swear that it is your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost it, I believe, it was fastened up with corks of your own furnishing? - A. Yes; it was contained in six Winchester quarts, corked by myself, and put up by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it again was there the same corks or the same bottles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to a house in Old-street, kept by a person of the name of Jacklm, and charge it with having come to that house? - A. I went with two men, but I did not go in, for I was very ill treated; I was taken into custody and detained.</p>
               <p>Q. At Jacklin's house? - A. Yes; Mr. Nares very much reprobated their conduct; Rixen keeps a public-house, the Rodney's-head, in Old-street, just by Jacklin's door; he is a constable, and he used me very ill, and would not let me send for my friends; and when my friends came, he said, he would forgive me; but I did not chuse to be forgiven by them, and I went with them to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did you not indict them? - A. The Magistrate said, there was not ground, or else I would at any expence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How long might they contrive to keep you? - A. I suppose about an hour; I wrote a letter to my cousin, at Apothecaries-hall, and the letter was intercepted; Jacklin came out and said I was a thief, and charged me with a constable.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a chemist and druggist in Whitechapel: On the 27th of September in the forenoon, the prisoner Dacosta, and De Silva, brought me a sample of oil of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you buy from sample? - A. Yes; that is the usual course of the trade; we can tell from the sample what the quality is; I told them to call at three in the afternoon, and I would give them an answer; they told me there was about eighteen pounds of it; in the interim, about eleven in the forenoon, I went to the Magistrate's at Lambeth-street, having heard that a quantity was stolen in the trade; I mentioned the circumstance to them, that I had a sample of all the peppermint brought me for sale, which corresponded with the peppermint that I heard was lost; two officers, Griffiths and Nowlan came to my house, and at three o'clock Dacosta and De Silva came for their answer, and I told them to bring the goods at their price, sixty shillings a pound; at half past four, Dacoster and De Silva, brought one quart bottle; the officers took them into the laboratory, and charged them with knowing something of the goods; they said, they knew nothing at all of it; that Martin was coming, who belonged to the goods, with the remainder part of them; a few minutes after, Martin and Samuels brought five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300070"></xptr>half gallon square bottles more, they were not full; Martin said to Samuels, go to a public-house and call for something, and I will be with you directly; Martin asked him if Dacosta had been there with any oil of peppermint; I told him, yes; he then asked me who was the master of the house, I told him I was; he then said, the oil of peppermint belongs to me, you must pay nobody for it but my self; Griffiths, upon hearing that, took him backwards with Dacosta and De Silva, and asked him how he came by the oil of peppermint; he said, he had bought it, he did not know who the man was that he bought it of, but he should know him again if he saw him; then they were all four taken into custody; Samuels said, he was not concerned in it, but he would go with the officers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the sample, produced by Mr. Moore now, and the bottles, and the sample, brought to you, all agree? - A. They do, to the best of my judgment; it is impossible to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The mode of ascertaining the quality of oil of peppermint, is by mixing it up with other commodities? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that by taking a sample, you can form an accurate judgment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If oil of juniper is mixed with it, by mixing it with other commodities, you discover it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The weight is the same? - A. No; the oil of peppermint is the heaviest.</p>
               <p>Q. The difference is very flight? - A. It is considerably heavier.</p>
               <p>Q. Your searched Burgin's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the least trace of bottles, or boxes, or any thing of that kind? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is he? - A. A corn-chandler, and gingerbread baker, opposite Old-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know Dacosta before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had dealings with him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not always had a good opinion of his honesty? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is he? - A. A broker.</p>
               <p>Q. What dealings have you had with him? - A. Such as aloes, and things of that kind; he is a drug broker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Do you know what quantity of oil of peppermint is used by consectioners? - A. I suppose an ounce of oil of peppermint would make a hundred weight of peppermint drops.</p>

I apprehended Dacosta and Samuels; I apprehended Dacosta in Mr. Jordan's shop, and Samuels in the street; I asked Dacosta what concerns he had in the oil of peppermint; he said, he had no other concern in it, than being employed as a broker to fell it for Mr. Martin; I laid hold of Samuels, and asked him what he was doing skulking about the house, and then I asked him what he knew of the oil of peppermint; he said, he would take me to the house where Martin bought it, and gave seventeen guineas for it; I took him in a coach to Burgin's house, and I asked Burgin who he bought it of; and he said, he would not tell till he came before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You found no bottles, or any thing of that fort at Burgin's house? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I keep a fish-stall in Petticoat-lane: On Friday, two days before Michaelmas-day, I went to one Mr. White's, at Islington, he is a beadmaker; I was going to carry him some fish-scales; I was coming down Sun-street back again, about half past three o'clock and I saw Martin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - A. Yes; Mr. Burgin and a man that keeps the Blue Anchor, in Petticoat-lane, and Belasco.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; Martin asked me if I could lend him any money; I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out some silver and three guineas; he took the three guineas, and gave earnest for some goods to Mr. Burgin, he did not mention what goods; after that, Mr. Burgin returned him two guineas back, and said he did not want but one guinea earnest; at that time Martin and I went away together and

            ; Burgin said, you must call upon me in an hour, or else you will forfeit the earnest; we left Burgin and the publican together in the street; Martin said to me, get me what money you can, you shall have a guinea for your trouble; then we all three went to the Black-lion public-house, in Petticoat-lane; when we went in Martin went back wards to the parlour; Mr. Adshead, the landlord, was sitting in his parlour; Mr. Martin called out Mr. Adshead, and said to him, you promised to lend me seventeen guineas; he did not make any answer to that; Belasco said, as I have come all the way with you, and as I know you to be an honest man, I will lend you five guineas; when he had lent him the five guineas, I gave him back again the two that he had returned to me, and that made three; then Adshead gave him eight guineas, a one pound note, and one shilling, which made nine guineas; then we went away for the oil of peppermint.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know it was oil of peppermint? - A. Martin mentioned it after we came out of the public-house, and asked me to go with him to fetch it; I went with him to Old-street road; I saw Burgin standing about five or six doors from his house; then Martin went with Burgin to Burgin's house, he is a gingerbread baker; then I and Dacosta went to a public-house and had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find Dacosta? - A. At the Black-lion; Belasco did not go with us for the goods; I said to Belasco, you had better go and see where he stops so long, and he went out, and then I went to see where they were stopping, and I saw them in about two minutes after; I saw Martin come out with a basket upon his head, I did not see Dacosta; I went with Martin to Bunhill-row, and then Martin said, you had better go back, and see where Dacasta stops, I went back to Burgin's and Burgin told me, he was just gone down Golden-lane with one bottle; I came back to Martin, and took the basket upon my head, and carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Martin? - A. He deals in sugar and peppermint-drops, and sugar-cakes, and all these sort of things, and carries them about the streets in a box: then I went to the Black Lion, and asked if Dacosta was there; he was not there; then I went back to Martin, and told him he was gone to Mr. Jordan's, in Whitechapel; the people at the Black Lion told me so; then I carried the basket on my head to Mr. Jordan's, in Whitechapel, and there Martin told me to put it down; I did put it down, and he told me to go and have a time of beer, and then I was taken before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was given for it? - A. No, I cannot say; there were seventeen guineas borrowed, but I cannot say what they might give for it; then I went with the officers to Burgin's house, and he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were in the coach with Burgin and Griffiths? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any such thing as this, said by Griffiths to Burgin, that as the peppermint was found, he had better acknowledge it? - A. Griffiths did say to Burgin, you had better tell how you came by it, for it will be better for you, and the people that are taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a previous search made at Burgin's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And no trace of any thing of the sort to be found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you to have any of this peppermint? - A. I was to have a guinea for my trouble in raising the money for him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a confectioner; and one part of the year, when our business is dead, I am a dealer and chapman, and go to sales: On the 26th of September I saw Martin at the Black Lion, he shewed me a parcel of peppermint, he asked me what I could give for it; I told him I could give him 38s. a pound for it; he said, it cost him more money; I offered him two guineas; he said it cost him forty shillings, he should get but two shillings a pound by it; I desired him to give me a sample of it, which he did accordingly; I then went from him to Mr. Dacosta's house, and said, here is something that we can get a shilling by, if you can get a customer for it; he went with me to Mr. Adcock's, in st. Marry Axe; he said it would not do, for it was mixed with some chemical oil; I went to another place, and they did not want any; then I went to Mr. Jordan's, they told me he would be at home in the morning about ten o'clock. I got Dacosta to go with me; he said, what should I ask for it; I said, ask three pounds, and then I shall have room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300072"></xptr>to abate; when we got to Mr. Jordan's, we shewed him the sample; he said, what do you ask for it; says he, sixty shillings a pound; I knew the value of it nearer than DeSilva or Martin, I have used a great deal in my time. Mr. Jordan said, if we would call at three o'clock, he would give us an answer; we went, and Mr. Jordan said, if you cannot take any less, you may bring the peppermint; Dacosta asked me what he was to have for his trouble; I told him I would allow him one shilling out of every pound weight that was sold. Then I came to Martin, and told him he must get it delivered as soon as he could; I had another appointment, that I could not go then, and I told Dacosta if he would assist Martin in carrying the bottles, for fear they should be broke, I would make him a compliment of something farther for his trouble, and he said he would. I told him I would meet him in half an hour at the public house, which I did; and Dacosta came in with a bottle under his arm; I went with the bottle to Mr. Jordan's, and I was taken into custody by Griffiths; I told him I had it from Martin, and that he was coming with the remainder directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were admitted an evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The account you gave there convinced the Magistrate you were a fit person to be a witness here? - A. I spoke nearly the same then as I do now; but I was slustrated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no enquiry where Martin got it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I must beg the favour of you to recollect yourself: did you, or did you not ask him where he got it? - A. He told me of a very respectable gentleman that he worked for, and served with goods, that satisfied me that it was safe to buy it. Martin and Dacosta had been at variance together.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Martin tell you who he had it of? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The first you saw or heard of this, was on the 26th of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. How came you to ask him who he had it of? - A. Because I thought he might be imposed upon by some artful person or other.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. On a Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a Thursday? - A. Yes; it was on Friday that we were taken.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You have seen the oil brought here? - A. Yes, and I have seen the sample; I have compared them, and cannot find the least difference: I took the means that I always take when I mean to try a sample of oil that I mean to buy.</p>
               <p>Q. This commodity is, I believe, very apt to vary in colour? - A. Yes, it does; but I can discern no difference in the colour of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this genuine, or adulterated? - A. I conceive it is; I should be satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You do not mean to swear positively that it is the same oil? - A. Certainly not; but it is so like that I cannot find any difference.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a thing extremely liable to adulteration? - A. I dare say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. To an ignorant person a mixture of oil of juniper might appear to be nearly the same? - A. I should consider not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this was adulterated, one in four, with oil of juniper, might it not appear to be nearly the same? - A. It might to a person not conversant with the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. All that you say is, that persons not understanding either might be imposed upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Seventy-two shillings; it was worth sixty-four shillings at that time. The same peppermint would differ, both in colour and in smell, drawn from the still by two different operators.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you, in your mind, satisfied that it is the same? - A. It is the same in quality, in flavour, and in smell.</p>

My Lord, and Gentlemen, I am a confectioner by trade; I have served Mr. Burgin for several years with confectionary goods; and coming one day to his shop, he asked me if I could do any thing with oil of peppermint; I did not know the value of it; I told him, if he would let me have a sample, I would try to get him a customer for it; I carried it to De Silva, and he told me, the next morning, that he had sold it for sixty shillings a pound; I went to Mr. Jordan's, and told him that it was left in my care, and begged he would pay me. I have a wife and five small children; and if a poor man cannot buy goods of a responsible man, not in the street, but at his own house in safety, how is a poor man to know what to do.</p>

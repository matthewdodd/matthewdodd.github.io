               <p>THOMAS LAWSON. This boy came up to me, and said he wanted a man with a hat-box; the coachman tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Why, I have a person in my coach with a box;" I opened the door - the prisoner ran out, and was stopped at the corner of Baker-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a watchman., and was at Clarencegate; I received charge of the prisoner from a soldier, who had stopped him; he said he had done nothing, and begged me to let go of his collar, as I should spoil the collar of his coat; this lad came up, I went with him to the coach, and saw the box taken out of the coach; I found five half-crowns, a sixpence, and a cigar-tube on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got into the coach at the Yorkshire Stingo, and the box was in it.</p>

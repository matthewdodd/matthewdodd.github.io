            : On the 5th of March, about half past one, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and asked for a quarter of a pound of eight shilling tea, for which he gave me half-a-crown; I told him he would get it changed at the accompting-house; I observed what he had been doing, he went to the accompting-house, I then desired

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Reynolds. I took hold of the prisoner, and he dropped the tea between me and him; he had the tea under his arm inside of his coat, I produce the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to swear whether he had it under his coat or under his arm? - A. He had the tea in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, will you undertake to swear it was under his coat, and not outside of his coat under his arm? - A. It was under the inside of his coat, I could not see it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Mr. Twvning's tea? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I went into Mr. Twyning's shop to purchase some tea, my wife not being able to go herself; I met with a friend by the way, I drank rather too freely, and became intoxicated; I gave the young man half-a-crown to change, he went away from me, and then accused me of taking the tea; it was never in my possession, there was some fell down, but not from me, I never had it under my arm.</p>

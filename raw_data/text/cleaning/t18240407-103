            . I am an Excise-officer. On the morning of the 6th of March, about five o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the prisoner sitting in a cart at Brentford, driving it - a person was with him - he was about three miles from Twickenham. I stopped the cart, and asked what he had in his possession; he said, nothing that he need to be ashamed or afraid of - but on my coming up and putting my hand to the horse, he set off, and left the cart. I found it contained a leaden cistern and pump, and other pieces of lead. It was shewn to the witnesses.</p>

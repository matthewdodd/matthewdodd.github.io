                  </hi>I am a bottle-merchant, living in Great Wild<lb></lb>street, in the parish of St Giles-in-the-fields. The prisoner took a lodg<lb></lb>ing in the back-room on the third floor of my house, on the 1st of April, in company with another lad rather less than himself—they continued there upwards of four weeks—they left early on Friday, the 1st of May, I cannot say the precise time—after they left, I went into my parlour about eight o'clock in the morning, and found a drawer of a chest had been broken open—it was locked again, and I cannot say in what way it had been broken open—Mrs. Gardner tried it first with her key—she could not open it—I tried it with mine, and could not open it, but in shaking it the lock dropped down—I missed from there a leather bag, containing sixteen sovereigns, a pocket-book containing a ₤5 note, and a pair of gold studs, and sundry papers, a silver pencil-case, and some silver coins, which I could not number exactly—the studs were gold with a turquoise stone in the centre—I had seen the leather bag, and the pocket-book last about eleven o'clock on the Thursday night, the 30th of April—I went to the prisoner's room about nine o'clock that morning, and discovered in the fire-place, covered with a towel, the pocket-book, and the leather bag which had contained the sovereigns—there✗ were no sovereigns, or Bank-notes, or studs, but all the papers were in the pocket-book—they were not dis<lb></lb>turbed—I saw the prisoner in custody about a month afterwards—I had not seen him in the meantime—his companion was sentenced last Sessions—they both went by the name of Mitchie at my house—I have the silver pencil-case in my possession, which I had when the other prisoner was convicted—I am not sure that that had been in that drawer.</p>

                  </hi>I am Borough officer for Edinburgh, and live at Edinburgh. I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 12th of May, at Roastan, a small village eight miles from Edinburgh—I charged him with robbing Mr. Gardner, of Great Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, London—on commencing to search him I saw him take from his pocket a gold stud, which he handed to my assistant, who handed it to me immediately—I did not tell him it would be better for him if he would confess what he had done, or worse if he did not—I asked him how he committed the robbery—he said the boy who lodged along with him, of the name of Gilbert, stole the key of the cellar—he said he had lived at Mr. Gardner's, in London—he said he had observed Mr. Gardner putting money into a drawer of a chest of drawers, in the back-parlour, and they both agreed to break open that drawer, and carry off the property, and that Gilbert stole the key of the cellar, underneath Mr. Gardner's shop—they entered the cellar, and there is a hatchway from the cellar to the shop, and that he held Gilbert on his shoulder up the hatchway to the shop, and that he himself had considerable difficulty in getting up; that they lighted the candle in the shop from lucifer-matches, which they had procured, looked round the</p>

Bank of England note; and that be got for his share six sovereigns, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and the two gold studs; that they placed the pocket<lb></lb>book in the fire-place, came out of the room, locked the door, and pushed the key underneath the door—I only got one stud from him—he said he had lost the other—another gold stud was delivered to me by Gilbert's father—they are both here—the prisoner is a Scotch lad—I carried him the same night before the Magistrate, he was committed, and detained till an officer came from Bow-street for him—this is the stud I received from my assistant.</p>

On Wednesday morning last, when I came from Ramsgate, I found Sir Sampson Wright had sent for me to go to identify this man, I never found my watch again; I am positive the prisoner is the same man, I had him in my hands for a quarter of an hour, and in the shop of the upholsterer, where there was light sufficient; if I was not quite sure, I would not give the least hint in the world, but I am positive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. You are absolutely sure that you felt somebody take your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now as to your certainty of the prisoner, you have no doubt but he was the man that was a quarter of an hour in your hands, I can easily conceive that? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>And you have as little doubt that he was the man who was in the upholsterer's shop? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Will you have the goodness, Sir, to tell the Jury in what situation you found the prisoner at the publick office; was the prisoner marked out to you in any particular way? - He was brought to the bar whilst 75 I was in the room with several of the Justices.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was brought to the bar? - There were several people in the room.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else at the bar? - Nobody, there were some people near.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner was brought to the bar and charged as a felon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100149"></xptr>When you slipped down, part of the prisoner' coat remained in your hands? - Yes, all the skirt, I believe it was plucked out of my hand by some people that were in his company, I know it was a frock coat.</p>
               <p>Has any apartment of the prisoner been searched at all? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that any coat of a description answering to that has been seen at his lodging</p>
               <p>There were a great many people, it was a favourite tragedy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were in the passage leading to the two shilling gallery? - I was.</p>
               <p>I fancy there is no great degree of light in that passage? - Yes, it is light enough.</p>
               <p>You will believe me, Sir, when I say, I do not mean to impute any thing unfair to you, it is my duty to put these questions to you; How was he dressed? - He was dressed in black, and his hair was powdered, I believed he had a cocked hat.</p>
               <p>Were not every body's hands pressed by the crowd as well as your's? - He had his hands down.</p>
               <p>It did not occur to you to seize the hand of the person that was your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Was is possible for you to observe the hand that was directed to the pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>You seized the collar of somebody that you suspected to be the person that had his hand in your pocket? - So I did, but in the situation I was, I could not be any other way than positive. I had two gentlemen in my company behind me, on the right hand side was the prisoner and before him there was a lady in a straw hat and red ribbon, I did not take any particular notice of the people on the left hand side, the prisoner's face was rather turned towards my face, he was stopped immediately, and searched immediately, and nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake positively, in a case like this, to say that you did return your watch into your fob after you looked at it? - O certainly so, I not only put it in my fob, but I turned the chain within my fob.</p>
               <p>Then the struggle to get your watch must have been very great? - Yes, and the person that took it was very clever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As well fitted for a lady's hand in a striped hat as any body's else, I should have thought.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. A great crowd at the theatre this evening? - Yes, it was one of the nights that Mrs. Siddons performed.</p>

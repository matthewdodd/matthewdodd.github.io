               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say you missed any shoes at all? - A. No; the prisoner, when he was taken, said nothing, he would not.</p>
               <p>JEFFERY CURTIS sworn. - I am a tailor; I came up at the time, and caught hold of the prisoner in High-street, St. Giles's; I saw him as he went into the shop throw a shoe from him with his left hand; a little boy picked it up, and brought it into the shop; I then saw some shoes in his pocket; he asked to sit down upon some chairs, and put the shoes behind him, which were delivered to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Molloy). Were your candles lit at this time in the evening? - A. Yes, they were; it wanted about ten minutes to seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before? - A.About a quarter of an hour before I went to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in after you left the shop, and before you heard the noise? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming by, this man knocked me down, and took me into the shop, and then he came out with a candle and lanthorn, and said, he had found all the shoes.</p>

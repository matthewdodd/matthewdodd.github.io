On Friday morning, the 22nd of April, I was with Death in Warwick-lane—I know the prisoners by seeing them together for three mornings previous to Friday the 22nd—on Friday, the 22nd, I saw them together about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning in Warwick-lane—I saw them pass each other in Ave Maria-lane—they joined each other in Warwick-lane—Ellis went first towards Newgate-street, and Amos followed him—I saw Ellis turn round several times—I saw Amos go into the Jolly Butchers public-house—Ellis followed him—I ran behind a cart, got to the door, and peeped through an opening in the door, and saw them both standing by the bar, side by side—they each had something to drink—while I was looking in, I saw Amos put his hand towards the inside of his pocket and hand a parcel to Ellis—I did not see what it was—I saw the motion of it—I am quite sure I saw something pass—when Ellis went in he had nothing in his pocket, and when he came out his pocket was bulky—when Amos went in his left-hand pocket was bulky, and when he came out there was nothing in it—they remained at the Jolly Butchers three or four minutes—I afterwards accompanied sergeant Death to Amos's lodgings—he gave his address at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City police-sergeant. On Friday morning, the 22nd of April, I placed myself in a shop in Warwick-lane—I saw Ellis go down towards Ludgate-hill, and about five minutes afterwards I saw him come back again, and Amos about three or four paces behind him—they both came back together, went round by Warwick-square, and went into the Jolly Butchers public-house in Warwick-lane—they staid there four or five minutes—I saw them come out—Dear was with me—I gave him some instructions—the prisoners separated—I watched Ellis—he went towards the new market—I followed him into the market—when he came out of the Jolly Butchers I observed that his pocket was bulky, and he carried his hand under his coat—I was in plain clothes—I went up to him and told him I wanted to have a few words with him—he said, "Very well"—I took him through the market—he asked me where I was going to take him to—I said to the Smithfield station—he asked me what for—I said I would not tell him then—I did not tell him I was an officer till I got him to the station—I then asked what he had got about him—he said what he had got was his own—I searched him, and found in his right-hand pocket this roll of silk—it had no paper or any covering round it—any body must have seen it was silk—I asked where he had got it—he said he had bought it of a man—I asked what man—he said he should not tell me, he bought it, and paid for it—he gave his name John Ellis—I asked him for his address—he hesitated a moment, and then said he had several addresses—he would not give one—Dear came to the station while I was there—we left Ellis there, and went to the prosecutor's—Amos was cleaning the brass-plate at the door—I told him to come in<lb></lb>side, I wanted to speak to him—I did not tell him why—I took him in, and took him up stairs—I asked him if he knew Ellis—he said no, he knew nothing about him—I asked him if he knew any thing about the silk—he said no, he knew nothing about it—I did not say any thing more to him till after I had seen one of the firm—I then searched him in the shop—I told one of the firm, in his presence, that we had reason to be<lb></lb>lieve Amos had been robbing them, that I had taken a piece of black silk from a roan named Ellis, and we had a suspicion that it was taken by Amos to Ellis, as we had seen them together two or three different times—Amos said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station—he gave his address there No. 8, New-street, Finsbury—I went there, and searched the first-floor front-room, and found a pair of blankets, two quilts, two pieces of bed-furniture, five sheets, two pieces of brown-holland, which I think are new, one toilet-cover, three table-covers, and one pair of gloves—I afterwards went to Ellis's lodgings—we found some keys on him, and one of the keys opened the door—I found there 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank-notes—I heard Ellis afterwards say he lived at the White Horse public-house, Cripplegate, which was the place where I found this money.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business on my own account at Worcester. I was formerly in the service of Messrs. Wynn, Ellis, and Mr. Everington—there are three partners—on the 22nd of April last my department was at the Manchester silk counter—that counter is close to the door in St. Paul's Churchyard—Amos was at that time one of the porters—there were some piles of silk in the piece called Gross de Naples on the counter, close by the door—it is the practice of the house to mark goods of that kind in pencil—this piece of silk produced is marked "No. 19"—it is Messrs. Ellis and Everington's property—there are 97 1/2 yards of it—it is not an en<lb></lb>tire piece by about ten or twelve yards—it has been cut, which, as well as the mark, enables me to identify it—if it had been sold it would have passed through the books in account—I have examined to see if it has done so, and it has not—there is no such thing—the books are here—it is a very unusual thing for a wholesale house to have a piece cut off—I cannot tell when the piece was cut off—there is a small green mark on the silk, which I recollect very well—every entire piece of goods that comes to our place, has the manufacturer's ticket on it—the usual length of an entire piece it from 108 to 112 yards—there has been about as much as would amount to a dress taken from it—I have since examined the goods in the warehouse for the purpose of finding the piece from whence the dress was cat off—I have not been able to find it.</p>

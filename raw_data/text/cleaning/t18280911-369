               <p>Prisoner. I did not take it from his person - I am an unfortunate girl, and was with him for half an hour - he told him to feel in his pocket to see if he had any money; he said I carried him across the road; and he said "You hussy, if there was a watchman I would give you in charge;" I was on the other side of the way - he saw a watchman by the Adam and Eve - he crossed over, and gave charge of me; I have no parents or friends.</p>
               <p>JOHN JAMES HODGSON. I was not in her company at all - she did drag me across the road, and asked me for 2d.; I would not give it her, and she took my handkerchief.</p>

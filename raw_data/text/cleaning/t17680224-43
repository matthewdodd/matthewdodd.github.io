            . I am a constable. On the first of February, about two in the afternoon, an information was brought to me, that a man was overheard at the Crooked Billet at the bottom of Wych-street, offering a sword that had been advertised, and that it was secreted under his coat; I got assistance and went; there was the prisoner and Mr. Wood; I clasped the prisoner round, and found this sword under his coat; ( produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

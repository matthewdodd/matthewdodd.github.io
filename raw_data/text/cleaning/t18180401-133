I turned round immediately, and saw him the nearest person to me, except some females. I gave the alarm, several persons called out Stop thief; I turned round and looked at him, and said"I have lost my pocket;" he said "it is not I, most likely you have lost it;" he ran off immediately, and was taken.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010040"></xptr>My pocket contained two 1l. notes, and the other property; the string of my pocket was cut.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I heard the cry of Stop thief, and found a great many people pursuing the prisoner; he was coming towards me, a neighbour stopped him. I found two half crowns, and a pen-knife, in his pocket; the prosecutrix said she had lost a purse; I told the prisoner to pull his trowsers off; I found the purse and key, at the bottom of the lining; it contained two 1l. notes; three 3s. pieces; one half crown, and 4s.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Camden's Head, Church-lane, Lime-house. On Tuesday, the 6th of October, the prisoner came to my house with three others, at about eleven o'clock, and continued there until about three o'clock, sometimes in-doors, and sometimes out in the yard—they called for some beer, and Mrs. Rogers served them—I had occasion to go to my bed-room before they left, and when I entered the room, I saw two large bundles on the bed—bed one was tied in a yellow silk handkerchief, and the other in a blue handkerchief—I do not know how they came there—when I first entered the room, I thought my wife might have tied them up—I was cleaning myself in the room to go to the West End, and thought I heard footsteps in the lobby up stairs—I turned round, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at the bed-room door, with his shoes in his hand—I said, "What do you want here?"—he said, "I have made a mistake, and have come the wrong road"—he turned round, and ran down stairs immediately—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him down as fast as I could, and saw him enter a small passage forthy or fifty yards from the house—I followed him enter a small passage, across the next street, and down another street—when I got pretty near him, he dropped a black silk handkerchief—he was stopped by some people in the street, and I brought him home to my parlour—he was very desire<lb></lb>ous of having his shoes; but as he had run without his shoes, I thought he should return without them—I put him down on one of the seats in the parlour close to the fire-place—he tried to get up two or three times to go to the other side of the parlour after his shoes; and I shook him, and a mahogany box, with money-scales, fell from his clothes—I said, "That is my box, you rascal, you have been into the bed-room before;" as that had been in the drawer of my dressing-table—I put my hand down to his trowsers, and felt something in his pocket, in which I found a knife with my name engraved upon it, and another knife belonging to my wife—he was taken to the station-house by a policeman, searched there, and part of a gold seal was found in a handkerchief tied round his leg under his trow<lb></lb>sers—they belong to me—when I returned, I went to the cellar, and found another bundle just against the trap—that contained a silk plaid dress, a silk shawl, and a camel-hair shawl—the bundles were taken to the office, with what was found up stairs—an inventory was taken by the policeman—I cannot say the prisoner had any thing to do with the bundle—he must have been in the room before I saw him there, as he had arti<lb></lb>cles on him which had been taken from there—all the articles in the dif<lb></lb>ferent bundles had been in that room—the value of all the property is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, I serached him, and found a handkerchief and part of a gold seal on him—I got a box and scales from Rogers—I asked the prisoner where he lived, and what was his name—he told me to go and find out—I saw the bundles brought to the station-house by the prosecutor—the sergeant took an account of them—Rogers has a copy of it—the sergeant is not here.</p>

             (Police-constable G 145). I received information that the house had been broken into, and two men had been seen to leave it, and one of them carrying a number of sashes - I went one way, and saw the prisoner carrying these sashes; he went with them some distance, and then another man joined him; they then parted - I still followed the prisoner till he came near the station-house, and then I took him; he said a gentleman had given him 6d. to carry them to Bishopsgate-street.</p>

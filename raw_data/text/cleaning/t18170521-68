            . I live at St. Pancras. On the 2d of May I sent the prisoner with the things to the King's Bench - He is a <rs id="t18170521-68-deflabel343" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18170521-68-defend479 t18170521-68-deflabel343"></join>; 2l. was sealed in a letter, which I desired him to leave at Mr. Oxenham's, in Oxford-street. The next morning, I went to the Bench and, found he had not been there; I then went to Mr. Oxenham's, and he had not been there. On the Monday following I received a letter which I believe to be the prisoner's handwriting - I have seen him write several times; it stated that he had made off with the property, and wished to resign himself up to justice; and that he would be opposite St. Giles's church between seven and nine o'clock in the evening, to surrender himself. I went there and took him into custody; he said he was willing to resign himself, and went with me alone; he said he had pledged some of the property, and sold the rest. He was porter at an auction room.</p>

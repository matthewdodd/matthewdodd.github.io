On the 14th of June I was in the house, about ten o'clock in the forenoon. I observed the prisoner, he was standing about the window looking into the street; he was first looking one way and then another; I was going up stairs to fetch some clothes for my baby, I looked to the shop to see all was right, on my looking towards the shop door I observed the prisoner looking to see if any body was looking, I did not observe that the window was broke; in two or three minutes I observed his hand within the window, I saw him moving some silver thimbles with his forefinger; the silver thimbles were in a drawer close to the window. I went out and took hold of him by the collar; he pushed me back against my left breast; I let go my hold, he ran away across the road; when he got of the opposite side he attempted to go down Feathers-court, a woman sat there with a fruit-stall he could not get down; he turned back, ran a bit and then walked slowly: I holloaed out stop thief all the time; a gentleman in a chaise or gig jumped out and ran after him; he was never out of my sight till the gentleman took him; I was standing at the corner of the pavement opposite of my own house; in a few minutes he was brought back again; then I looked at my window there was a piece of glass entirely out. It was cracked a few days before, it was broken about five inches in length and two inches in width.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before you saw the man standing at the corner of the shop was it that you had observed this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260015"></xptr>pane of glass, so as to know whether it was whole or any broken out - A. A very little while before; the shop was not open till near nine o'clock; I put the jewellery between nine and ten in the window, there was no hole then only a crack; the thimbles were not half an inch from that window; if the window had been broken I should not have put the jewellery there. I am certain there was six silver thimbles and a silver shield gone out of the tray, they were laid upon pink cotton wool. When the prisoner was brought back he was taken into the middle room; he was searched, not one of the articles were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his pockets - A. Not till after he was searched, I observed the lining of his left pocket sticking out, I saw a little of the of the pink cotton wool sticking to the lining of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any pink cotton laying about your shop - A. None, except behind the counter, no one could get at it except myself.</p>
               <p>MR. HOPKINSON. Q. Were you in Holborn on this day that the last witness spoke of - A. Yes, I was coming down Holborn along with my friend; I saw the prisoner struggling with the last witness, he broke away from her and ran across the street; I kept my eye upon him and seeing nobody stop him I jumped out of the gig and stopped him; I am sure the person that I saw struggling with the last witness is the person that I stopped; I brought him back to her shop. I got away as soon as I could; I just observed the pane of glass was broken as I passed the shop.</p>

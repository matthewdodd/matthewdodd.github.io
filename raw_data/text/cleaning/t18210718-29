            . I am patrole of St. Sepulchre. On the 25th of June, between two and three o'clock in the morning, (it was day break) I saw the prisoner coming out of the back door of the <placeName id="t18210718-29-crimeloc168">Red Lettuce, public-house, Frogwell-court, Charter house-lane</placeName>

I went up to the door which is in a kind of passage, and they rushed back again. One of them had a clock, and Richards had some other things. There was three of them but one escaped. They all had something. When they saw me, Richards threw the funnel at me, the clock was dropped. I called for assistance and laid hold of Richards, he got from me in the scuffle, and threw his coat and handkerchief off. The watchman secured him. I am sure he is the same man. I only lost sight of him on turning the corner. Whitaker got behind me, and passed by me as I was scuffling with Richards - he was secured within fifty yards of the place. I knew him before, and am certain of him. The clock was found just outside the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner RICHARDS. Q. Are you sure I came out of the house - A. Yes, I struck him as he came out.</p>

            . My sister Charlotte keeps the Red Lettuee public-house. I slept there. I was up last on the night before the 25th of June, and fastened the house up; the back door was fastened with a bolt and chain inside - every thing was safe when I went to bed. I was alarmed about half-past two o'clock by the cry of Thieves! I jumped out of bed, and came down stairs, and found the back door open, and the bar window open. I found the back door had been opened by a small instrument, the chain could be unbooked by putting a wire between the door and post. There were marks inside the front door, as if they had tried to get out there; the clock laid in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the clock before - A. It was nailed up to the wainscot in the tap-room. It was hooked to the wall at the top, and nailed at the bottom with a nail three inches long.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. It was nailed to the timbers of the house - A. Yes.</p>

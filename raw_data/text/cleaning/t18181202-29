            . I am a constable. I was on duty in Bridge-street; a gentleman pointed the prisoner out. I was close to him; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with taking his snuff-box, which he denied, and then produced it - the prosecutor claimed it; I took him into custody, and found four handkerchiefs, two in his waistcoat pocket, and several duplicates, a 1 l. note, two sixpences, and a bad shilling on him. Two other handkerchiefs were either in his breeches or breeches-pocket.</p>

I lodged in the house of Hannah Tanner, in the parish of St. Marylebone, last November—I work at night—on the 17th of November last, I went out about eleven o'clock at night, and locked my door—I have a key to the outer door—I returned between half—past eight and nine o'clock in the morning to breakfast, and found my lodging had been robbed—I lost a coat, trowsers, waistcoat, a box off the table, and a watch locked in it, and a money-box out of the cupboard—the door had been unlocked, apparently, not broken open—I found my watch in pawn at Cord well's.</p>

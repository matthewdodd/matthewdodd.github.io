               <p>These things deposed to by prosecutor, having, all but one or two articles, his mark on them; the snuff-box and pocket-book having his mark, and the watch had his name on, but part was taken out; the agate box and instrument case have his mark: could not speak to the purse.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This seal, and trinket, like a boot, are marked, and the opera glass also: the rest are like those I had.</p>

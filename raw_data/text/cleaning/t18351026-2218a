                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Ann Bell, of the Flying Horse, in Oxford-street. On the night of the 14th of October, when I was going to shut up the house, at a quarter to twelve o'clock I missed three shutters from inside the bar door—I had put them there at six o'clock in the morning—I had not seen them after the prisoner frequented the house—he came and insulted me on the following day, and <hi rend="italic">blackguarded</hi> me—I told him he should not go out till he was in custody—he was taken to High-street, and we found the shutters by seven o'clock that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in shop and house-fixtures, at No. 11, Castle-street. Long-acre. The prisoner left these shutters at my shop as a deposit, at about three o'clock in the afternoon; I do not know the day—the property was claimed the next day, and we went to the police-office the same evening—I advanced 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on them—he did not bring what he promised—he said he would bring the frames belonging to the shutters—to replace them, I suppose would cost 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he wanted the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to bring the frames, they were at the further part of Marylebone—he appeared like a man in business—he gave me his name and address, which appeared to be nearly right—he told me his name was Cornelius Connell.</p>

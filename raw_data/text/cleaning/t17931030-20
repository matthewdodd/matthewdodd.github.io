               <p>Q. Did they pass you and your wife? - No, they did not, but I thought they wanted to pass, they were in such a hurry. A gentleman came up and tapped me on the shoulder, he said sir, you have lost your pocket handkerchief; the gentleman's name is Joet. Sir, says I, if you have got any handkerchief it is not mine, because I have not pulled out my handkerchief; no, says he, the two men that past you have pulled it out of your pocket, and if you will go with me I will shew you the way they went. I went with him, they got into the next street from Wardour-street; they walked on very smart before us, and when they found that we walked on smart after them they began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the street? - Noel-street; they got into Wardour-street, and I bawled out stop thief! and I came up to the prisoner at the bar, and knocked him down at a building in Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it this man you knocked down or the other? - This is the man, the other got on before me, he made his escape, he was not taken at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found on the prisoner? - I took my handkerchief from under his arm forcibly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your handkerchief? - A cotton one.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was your's? - It had three or four darns in it, and in taking it from him he tore it; I did miss such an handkerchief the very minute the young man spoke to me, I am sure it is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it in your pocket? - In Monmouth-street; he wanted me to let him go, and I said I would not, he turned about, and by the light of the lamp I see he

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him after that? - I did, he got away from me after that, he cut me before he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What street was this he cut you in? - Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him after you lost sight of him? - In a very few minutes, near Wardour-street, in a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that was the same man? Was there other people in the public house? - Yes, there was many more; Mr. Johnson heard the word stop thief! and he pursued him as I am informed, and took the knife from him, and gave him to the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to the public house? - There was a man that came to Mr. O'Conner's, the apothecary, in Wardour-street; I was there to get my hand dressed.</p>

               <p>Q. Who came to you there? - I don't know. And he told me the prisoner was at the public house, and that I must come and make my appearance and know the man, or else the runners could not keep him, so I was obliged to run through the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the runners point him out or did you know him? - I knew him by his dress and appearance and being pock marked; I had had him by the light of a lamp that I could see him plain by.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time might there be between the time he cut you, and the time you saw him in the public house? - About five minutes. Then I went back to the apothecary, and got my hand dressed and stitched, and have been lame ever since; I have no doubt but that is the man that took the handkerchief from me, and that he cut me in my wrist.</p>

               <p>Q. You felt nothing about you to induce you to think you was robbed? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of this handkerchief be? - I gave three and sixpence, three and nine-pence halfpenny we call it, about seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Joet. I saw these men, the prisoner and the other man who is not here, who escaped, just coming behind O'Brian and I saw them keep looking back to see whether O'Brian noticed their having taken any thing from him, they had the handkerchief in their hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them? - I am not certain, but I think it was this man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them take it? - I did not; I went on making belief as if I did not notice them, then they crossed over the way, then I ran back and asked O'Brain whether he had lost his handkerchief? he felt in his pocket and found he had. so I went with him and went down Berwick-street and turned down Noel-street, and seeing this man and another before us, I said there were the men, just after I said so they set off running and turned round into Wardour-street, we caught this one just at the top of Wardour-street, O'Brian knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that you saw the prisoner and the other man with the handkerchief, till the time you saw him knocked down, was he out of your sight? - Yes, he was while I turned round to tell O'Brian.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see him again? - In Noel-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner, the man that was knocked down, is the same that was in Oxford-street passing the prosecutor? - Yes, I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you got to Wardour-street? - I see him knocked down by O'Brian, the prisoner got up again, and O'Brian took the handkerchief from the prisoner after he was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing to O'Brian? - He cut his wrist, he made two attempts, he first cut his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the handkerchief? - O'Brian.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him, did he get away or did he not? - He cut him and then O'Brian was forced to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pursued by any other people? - I don't know who pursued him, he was pursued by other people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the witness whether he can swear which was the pocket that the handkerchief came from? - No, I did not see the robbery committed.</p>

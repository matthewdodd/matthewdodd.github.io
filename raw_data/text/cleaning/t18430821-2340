From the 10th to the 13th of April last I was in my shop, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning—I saw two men carrying a glass—to the best of my belief, Burrows was one of the men—I have no hesitation in saying it was this glass—they were coming down Crown-street, in the direction of the Seven Dials, as if they had come from Rose-street—they crossed over towards Phœnix-street.</p>

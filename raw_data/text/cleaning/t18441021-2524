                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Villiers-street, Albany-road, Camberwell. On the 11th of Oct., 1843, I was foreman to Peter Shield, of High-street, Shoreditch—he had some doe-skin, which I missed from the door—I attended here at a former session, when the doe-skin was produced by Kemp, and 1 swear that was the doe-skin belonging to Mr. Shield, which was lost—here is the ticket which was on it—it has our private mark.</p>

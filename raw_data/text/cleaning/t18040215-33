I put the lace in the window in the morning; the square of glass had a crack in it for many years, but not nigh where the lace was put; when I was informed of it, I looked at the window, and saw the glass had been cut with something, and the old crack was remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the hole? - A. About five or six inches long, and about two inches wide; it was long enough to put the hand in, in this direction, (showing how); I and the lad pursued them, and took them; we searched them, but did not find the lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did it happen? - A. On the 31st of January, near five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. Quite dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark enough, if you had seen me at the door, that you would have known me? - A. Certainly I should have known you, or any man, at my door at that time, or any time.</p>

               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. I was sixteen last November: I was going of an errand for my master, and coming back, about five o'clock, I saw these two boys standing at the post, the corner of Union-street, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these two boys before? - A. Yes, I had seen them playing before; when they stood at the post, they were wrangling with each other who should go and take it; the biggest said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150025"></xptr>to the youngest, you go; and the youngest said, I will not go, you go; the biggest went forward, and put his hand in the window, and took out one card of lace, and put it under the left side of his coat; in about a minute after, while the man went round to put up the shutter, he put his hand in a second time; I did not see him take any thing then; there were three of them got together; then they ran up towards Bishopsgate-church; I am sure these are the two boys.</p>
               <p>Q. How close were you to these two boys? - A. I was close to them when they took the lace, I have seen them frequently; there are a number of them tossing up from morning to night in the Broad-place, Petticoat-lane; I have seen the prisoners with them when I have been going to dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us you see a great many boys playing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard there is a reward, if you convict them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know that there is a forty pounds reward for the conviction of a person that breaks open a house? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never been playing with them, I dare say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so light, that you were able to see the boys? - A. No, not at a great distance, but I had seen them before.</p>

I bid him a guinea; he said 30 s. I went to Bow-street and told Mr. Kennedy; I went to the house and got the clothes in my bag; I told him to come with me, and a friend of mine should pay for them. I went out of the house and he with me; Kennedy came up, and the prisoner ran away; he was taken next day; he is the man; he did not say how he came by the coats.</p>

             came for me, and I went to the Noah's Ark in Dyot-street, St. Giles's. Barnard went into a back-yard, and I saw the prisoner deliver these two coats to Barnard, and he put them into his bag. The prisoner made his escape; I took the coats and advertised them; these servants came and said they were their master's property; next morning I went to Dyot-street, and took the prisoner out of bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Whitechapel-road On the 5th of November, I lost a looking-glass and stand, which was standing near the door—on the 10th of December, from information, I counted my tables and missed one—I applied for a search warrant, and went to search a house in a court in Essex-street—I did not know the prisoner then, but I found her there, and she said she lived there—I found this table and glass there, which are mine—we asked the prisoner if any other person lived in the house—she said no—she kept the house—we took her into custody.</p>

About five or six weeks. ago I remember a man and woman being at his shop—the man cane into the shop and asked some question, the woman who was the prisoner was at the next shop—I did not see them go away, but my mistress came out and said, "I will be bound there is something gone," and the looking-glass was gone—it had been there a few minutes before.</p>

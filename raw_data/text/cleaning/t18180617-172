            . I am servant to Mr.Robson, of Brompton. I saw the prisoner jump up behind the carriage-he stopped two or three minutes. I saw Mrs. Bates was alarmed - I was close by the carriage. While she turned her head to speak to her servant, the prisoner put his hand in the carriage, and took out a black ridicule. I ran after him-Howe stopped him. I never lost sight of him. He dropped the ridicule before Howe got up to him. A boy picked it up and gave it Howe. Several boys came round. He threatened me very much.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HOWE. I was driving my mistress out - She was speaking to me; I turned round, and saw the prisoner jump off the step - He ran with his arms folded. I kept looking at him for five minutes. My mistress missed her ridicule. I pursued him, but lost sight him - He laid down by another boy. I went back to the place, but could not find him. I at length caught sight of him with another boy - They both ran very fast-one of them dropped the ridicule; I took the prisoner. The last witness charged him with being the boy. He swore, and made use of very bad language, and attempted to get away.</p>

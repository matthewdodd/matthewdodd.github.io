I thought I often missed whalebone, but did not find it out till the 27th of June. I was gone that day to Chelsea; when I returned I was informed that I had been robbed by my other servants of a quantity of bone, they could not tell by who. There came in

            , who told me he saw the prisoner with some bone on his back, all dirty. I went and got a warrant, and then went to the alehouse in Change Court, where he lodged. I took him before Justice Fielding; he owned nothing. This was on Saturday, and on the Monday after came a porter. (He is since dead of the small pox.) Then Mrs. Taylor, behind St. Clement's church, came and said, she had some whalebone, and a letter, which she said she had received; it is directed to her, at the Little Blue Anchor. She said she bought the goods of the prisoner. I missed twenty-five pounds, and this weighs twenty odd pounds. Produced in court.</p>

            . I live on the backside St. Clement's, and am a piece-broker. I know the prisoner, and have bought goods of him; I bought this whalebone of him. It was advertised the 30th of June; I bought it the Saturday before; it was brought by a porter in soldiers cloaths; the prisoner came with him. I asked him whether he came honestly by it, he said he had it to sell for one in the Strand; it weighed twenty three pounds and a half, the half pound I did not pay for. Two men brought me a letter on Sunday night; I do not know who wrote it. After hearing it was advertised, I went to Mr. Jones, and told him I had bought some bone at that time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Wednesday the 20th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Petticoat-lane, Isaacs was first, and he had a bundle of leather upon his shoulder, he had no hat on; Belasco was behind him, close to him, with this bag under his arm, and a man's hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat upon his head besides? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the leather prevented him from wearing a hat? - A. Yes; I made a snatch at Isaacs, and he dropped the leather almost upon my feet, and attempted to run; Belasco also attempted to run, and I called out to Armstrong to stop him, I pursued Isaacs; he ran about four or five yards, and then Peach caught him, he was not above three or four yards from me all the time; I brought him back to where the leather was dropped; I picked up the bag and the hat that Belasco had dropped; Isaacs then said, give me the hat, it is my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man was carrying the leather publicly upon his back? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you make any observation of Belasco's back? - A. Yes; there was the tan of the leather upon his back.</p>

My wife is in the infirmary, ill—I lodge in a room in Horris-street, The prisoner lodged in the lower part of it—I saw my wife put two half-crowns and two shillings into a bit of rag, and put them into a box which was not locked—in the mean time the prisoner came up stairs, and asked if she would let her make a fire, and do what she wanted, as she had had no victuals for two days—my wife said she might, and she would give her a breakfast, and get to wash a few things for her—she went to the box to get out two caps to wash, and while she did that she took the money—I did not see her, but she acknowledged that she took the money at that time—I left her in the room, and my wife was ill in bed.</p>

I live in Horris-street, I met the prisoner at the top of the street—she told me she had two half-crowns and two shillings given to her by a man in the street, and asked me to go and drink with her; and when we came out of the public-house I went with her to buy a shawl and what she wanted—I drank some gin—we had a quartern between the two—she bought a gown, a shawl, and some other things.</p>

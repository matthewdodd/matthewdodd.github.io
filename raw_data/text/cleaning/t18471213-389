On the 1st Nov. the lodger up stairs spoke to me, and I went into the prisoner's room while they were absent—in the bed I saw the model of a little silver cow—I replaced it—the next morning I went again into the room, in the absence of the pri<lb></lb>soners, and saw in a box, a silver tea-pot, a silver cream ewer, and a great quantity of rings, besides other property—this is the tea-pot—I communicated with my husband, and he went for a policeman—the prisoners came home while he was gone—they went up stairs—the man then came down to my parlour door, and said, "You have been in my room"—I said, "I have"—he said, "How dare you go there?"—I said, "I have a right to go"—he went into the yard and began to pull the water-butt about—I said, "Good gracious man, what are you about?"—he said, "I have something here"—he pulled the butt away, and took away a great quantity of knives, but how many I cannot say—he went up stairs, and put the cream ewer and the rings into his pocket, and the other plate he put into a carpet bag—the female said, "The policeman is coming"—he said, "I will go and face any police<lb></lb>man; I am not afraid"—he went off, and the woman too, while I was in the room—he left the tea-pot in the box—the policeman came in about three minutes.</p>

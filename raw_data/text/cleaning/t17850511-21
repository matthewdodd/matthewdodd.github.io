I asked him for the key, he said he had left it on board; I said that was surprising; I asked him what it contained, he said it contained a pillow, two Scotch blankets and a bed, and two pair of shoes, and some things; I detained them, and the next day they were taken before the Magistrate, and Smith came to give them a character, and Smith swore before the Magistrate, that the chest and contents were Manevil's, and signed his hand to the paper, and directly as Maneval saw him sign the paper, he gave an item, and Smith was ordered out; then Manevil confessed how they came by the chest; and I went in consequence to the prosecutor, in Wapping, in Milk-alley, he was in a very deplorable situation, having lost his all; I took him to Mr. Staples's, and the prosecutor described the property; then the three prisoners were all detained, the chest is in court, it has been in my possession ever since sealed up.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol, the watchman stopped these men, and he called me to aid and assist him, they said they brought it from New Crane, from on board a ship the Betsy, and we asked them for the key, they said they had left it on board the ship, we took them to the watch-house, and they were committed.</p>

               <p>On Friday night Mumford and me went to Tower-hill, and he left me to go to fetch his chest up, and I was not well able to walk; it was near nine o'clock; and they brought the chest, and Smith set down the chest to go for more things, they staid so long, that I was afraid some accident would happen to the chest, and for fear of that I told Mumford it was best to take it to Red Lyon Court, and leave it there till morning, then we would go down and tell them where it was, and in going along the watchman took us up; he asked us what it was, I did not know what to say, I was frightened; I said it was mine, I was afraid of any accident coming to the chest.</p>

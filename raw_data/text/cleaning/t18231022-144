The prisoner Sullivan was in my service. In consequence of information, on the 9th October, I went to Glover's shop, in Vine-street, Mutton-hill, about three or four o'clock - he is a <rs id="t18231022-144-deflabel775" type="occupation">dealer in marinestores</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18231022-144-defend1245 t18231022-144-deflabel775"></join>. I took a cut cruet off his board, and asked him the price - he said 5 s. 6 d. for three of them. I said I would have them, if he would get me a frame, and I would call for them to-morrow - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have plenty ordered, and expect them in every moment, and you shall be sure to have it." I called again, about six o'clock, the same evening, and said, that since I saw him, I had seen a friend of mine, a publican, who would take two dozen dram glasses, if he could get them exactly to measure - he went out for a measure, and measured one; I said that would do. I then went home, sent for an officer, and informed him. I looked out all my dram-glasses, and laid them straight, so that I could tell if any were removed; and about half-past seven o'clock I went out, telling Sullivan, to lock up the warehouse as usual, and then go home. I went out before him, and told the officer to watch him. I returned in a few minutes, and found some of the dram glasses gone. I went to Glover's about eleven o'clock next morning, took up a cut castor, and cruet in a frame, which I had ordered, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you will get me a cruet of the size of this, I will take them;" he said I might depend on having them. I went home, counted my cruets of the size and pattern I had ordered, and found the drawer contained one hundred and twenty-eight - they were in the upper warehouse - I took care that nobody should go up there that afternoon but Sullivan. I did not go out until seven o'clock, and desired Sullivan not to leave till half-past eight. I happened to return about ten minutes past eight, he had then left. I went up stairs and counted the drawer, and missed six cruets.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday did you and the officers search Glover's house - A. Yes, and found these six cruets there, and all the property stated in the indictments. He was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who went up stairs after you went out you cannot say - A. No. I marked four or five of the cruets, but they were not taken - they are made to my pattern. I never saw any of this size elsewhere - there are patterns very like it, but not exactly. Sullivan was an industrious boy - I never heard of my children putting things into his basket in a frolic.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What quantity does the cruet contain - A. I never measured it. The one hundred and twenty-eight were all one size - I swear to this by the size, pattern, and quality of the glass, and the cutting.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 9th of October I watched Sullivan from the prosecutor's house. He came out about eight o'clock. I followed him down to the door of Glover's house; he stopped there; turned round quick to look at me. I turned round not to be noticed, and on turning back missed him all in an instant, and went away. I watched him into a public-house in Type-street next night, and on Monday evening went with the prosecutor to Glover's.</p>

            . This property is mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you a private mark on it - A. No. Here are thirteen castors; I missed six that night. I should know them find them wherever I would, by the size, quality, glass, and pattern. They were made for me by Johnson and Co., of Birmingham, who are in a large way. It is customary not to make goods of one pattern for two houses; if they did my custom would leave them immediately. I have sold none of them. They came in about six weeks ago. I received one hundred and forty-four. I do not know what became of the rest.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. I took eighteen of them to Wolf, a glass dealer, by the London Hospital, a week before I was taken.</p>
               <p>GLOVER put in a written Defence, denying all knowledge of Sullivan; that he had shewn the goods to the prosecutor publicly, and every thing was exposed openly for sale; that it was strange any house should manufacture for the prosecutor exclusively; that he sometimes bought at a wholesale house, and sometimes of hawkers, and when goods are put together could not tell one from another.</p>
               <p>JURY to SOLOMAN. Q. Had Sullivan an opportunity of seeing Glover after you gave him an order for the cruets - Yes; he went to dinner, and went out after that into Glover's neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>QUESTION to SHIRLEY. Is there any passage near Glover's where the boy might have gone down - There is a turning six or eight yards from the house, but he had passed it and got close to the door when I missed him.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN - GUILTY. Aged 21.</p>

            . I served her with a yard of lace, she paid 2 s. but I cannot remember in what coin; I believe in silver. She asked the price of another piece of lace; I told her 3 s. she offered a less price; Mr. Faulkner answered, rather quick, that he could take no less; she was going out, Mr. Falkner brought her back within two or three yards from where I stood. I had removed from behind the counter, and came and stood at the end of the counter, the further end of the shop. I saw this piece of lace, (producing it,) drop from the prisoner; where it dropped from I cannot take upon me to say. I took it up and said we need not search her, here the lace is.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. I was in the room behind the shop about seven o'clock in the evening - a person came in, and asked if I missed any knives; I looked, and missed them - I ran and took Maoney, brought him back, and he took this knife and fork from up his sleevs, and laid them on the counter - Phebe came up afterwards to look for him, and the constable took him. When I first went out, I saw them both together, looking at a pawnbroker's window at the bottom of the court.</p>

            . On the evening of the 22d of November, I saw the prisoners standing at Grubb's window; I am certain of them both - I saw Phebe put his hand into the window, and take some knives and forks - Maloney leaned against him, to prevent his hand being seen to enter he window: I went in and told the lady, but did not see the prisoners taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father—when I wanted petty cash, I was in the habit of drawing checks on Cocks and Co., where we kept an account, and sending them by the prisoner to Mr. Piper, to get cashed—I drew the checks in the name of King and Son—I did not draw this check, dated 24th Jan., or know of its being drawn, till it was returned by my banker's, with the pass-book, on the 12th of April, as having been paid—I also received these two other checks, dated 5th of Dec. and 1st of Jan., neither of which were drawn by me, or by my au<lb></lb>thority—I have looked at my check-book, in which I have my printed blank checks, and I miss five checks, which have been completely torn out, margin and all—I always kept it in a drawer, locked up—I did not ob<lb></lb>serve anything the matter with the drawer—the checks were taken out of two check-books—the prisoner had opportunities of seeing me draw checks in the name of King and Son, and he has taken them afterwards to Mr. Piper's, to get cash for them—I think this is a bad imitation of my handwriting—I never received the value of these checks from the prisoner, or gave him any authority to get the money on them—I have had oppor<lb></lb>tunities of seeing him write—I cannot say that these checks are his writing—I cannot form any belief on the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How soon after he came into your service did you begin to employ him to take checks to Piper's to get cashed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think eighteen months—I do not put any number on the checks or mar<lb></lb>gins—I sometimes sent him with a check to Mr. Piper's once a week, sometimes onee in two weeks—very seldom twice in one week—I did not discover anything wrong till the 12th of April, as I did not have my book made up till then—we have offices in London—I think I was in London on the 18th of April, the day before the prisoner's last examination—and about eleven o'clock I saw the prisoner's aunt, near St. James's church—I asked her if she was going to see the prisoner—I do not remember asking her to get what information she could out of him—I told her to ask him how he had squandered the money—I did not say, that at the trial I would recommend him to mercy—I keep no clerks—only a maid-servant had access to the place where the check-books were kept—there is no shop, it is a count<lb></lb>ing-house—bill-stickers and porters come to the counting-house occasionally.</p>

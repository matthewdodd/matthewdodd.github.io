               <p>On the 25th of December, which was Christmas-day, between three and four in the afternoon, we had fifty-one ells of work cut out of the loom, two pounds of unwound silk, and thirty two ounces of double silk, it was silk lining, I worked for Messrs. Gearing, Vaux, and Taylor; about four I was informed my shop window was open, I went up to see and took the key of the stair foot door, that goes up to my work shop, and found all my work was taken away, the stair foot door was locked as I left it; I said, the prisoner was the person that robbed me, I went to the prisoner's house and asked for him, nobody was at home but the sister and a girl; I found the prisoner in Balls-alley, with a girl that he kept company with, I heard a scuffle withinside the house, I heard them shove up the window, and they kept me at the door for a minute or a minute and half, then the door was opened; he threatened to punish me, he followed me home, but upon my mentioning to search the loft the prisoner ran away directly; in searching the lofts we run over four houses, I found no property there, but I found one trap door open that went into the prisoner's house, and I dropped down upon the prisoner's bed, which was under that trap door; I there made a strict search, and his brother in law came down, and I looked behind an old pair of drawers, there was a net and this bag, and a shoot, and the unwrought silk, I pulls up the end a little more, says I, thank God here is my piece; the Justice ordered me to subpoenea this brother-in-law, but he is got out of the way, I carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120044"></xptr> the subpoenea, I went to search for the prisoner and found him at one Helder's, which was about two hours after he run away, I found him concealed in a closet, I asked him how he came to do such a wicked thing; he said, for God's sake have mercy upon me, you have your property let me go; says I, I cannot, it is my master's property, I brought him to the Crown alehouse, and sent for an officer and gave charge of him, and in my hearing he confessed he did it himself and nobody else; I made him no promise, he was going to tell us of one Jones, the father and son who were waiting for him, at the corner of Cox's-square, in Petticoat-lane, a man that buys stolen silk, little or much; I have never enquired after him, Mr. Wilmot said we could do nothing to him, without he had bought any thing, he uses a publick house the corner of that square.</p>

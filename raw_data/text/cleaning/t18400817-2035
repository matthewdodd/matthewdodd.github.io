                  </hi>. I am in St. Martin's workhouse. I am the wardsman of the room; six persons slept in the room. On Saturday morning I heard of the loss of the money, and asked them all about it, the prisoner among others—he did not produce any money—they said they knew nothing about it—they were all in the room but Seagrave—when he came in I challenged him with it, and said, "We shall all be blamed for it"—he told his father and me that he saw the black boy get out of bed, and take the money out—I said to the prisoner, "You young thief, you have got the man's money;" and upon him was found two half-crowns, five shillings, sixpence, and a penny, in this bag—he then said, "I found it"—I took him to the master, and he told him the same.</p>

Q.</hi> We understand he was kept in confinement in the workhouse a whole week before he war taken before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but he was breaking the place all to pieces, and trying to break the windows—he was locked up the day after this took place, about two o'clock—the father did not apply to me to be allowed to go before the Magistrate with him—I did not see him there—I did not see any strap put on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>James. I believe they are mine, but the linen I can swear to the boy forced the things upon him, and put them in his pocket. I took the boy up, he confessed he had taken them me. They both blamed each other. The boy the presence of Fennimore, that he had told him, if he took them I should never them. I took them before my lord mayor, which was Mr. Alderman Jansen: the any thing there. The other did not own any thing there.</p>

            . Yes he was. I asked Fennimore if he knew the goods were his master's. He said he did, but the boy would force things upon him, and he took them to his own house at several times. The boy said Fennimore said to him, do you go and fetch the piece of linen to me, for you can't cut it to as I; and that Fennimore cut it off. The boy said Fennimore gave him sometimes 2 d. and sometimes 3 d. and sometimes 6 d. for the goods he brought to him.</p>

               <p>Fennimore told me he had a pair of breeches to make, and he asked me if I would give him some buttons. I told him they were not mine to give. He said I could get them, and I might give him them, for he was a poor man: and with a great many persuasions I gave him them. Then he asked me for several things more. I told him my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040006"></xptr> would find me out; then he would give me money, a penny or two pence, and told me he would learn me my trade. After that he found my master had missed a few pieces, and I was gone, then he pretended his conscience pricked him.</p>

I saw the prisoner's hand take a handkerchief from Mr. Spode, the prosecutor's pocket; I was close to them; I tapped Mr. Spode on the shoulder, and told him he was robbed, at the same time pointing to the prisoner, whom I never lost sight off; he merely walked across the way; Mr. Spode and myself followed him, and just as Mr. Spode was going to collar him, he dropped the handkerchief at his feet that he took out of Mr. Spode's pocket; we secured him, and took him into a baker's shop; he there confessed that he had done the robbery.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On Tuesday, the 8th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Newton-street, Holborn - I saw the prisoner and two others; the prisoner was exhibiting a handkerchief to the others - he had his hat off at the time; I saw him put the handkerchief into the hat - I took him, and found two handkerchief on him; I was taking him to the station-house, but when we got to Took's-court he ran away - I pursued him, and did not lose sight of him till I saw him stopped by two persons, one of whom had a basket, and the other appeared a gentleman - one of these handkerchiefs is red and yellow, and has the name of

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was on Tuesday morning? A. Yes - the other two persons went away; I asked his name, and he said Oram - I do not know whether it is usual for persons of the lower classes to carry handkerchiefs in their hats; I have done so - I knew nothing of the prisoner before; he said he did not know the other persons - I did not see him take this handkerchief from his hat - he might have received it from one of the others; I am quite certain he did not offer to go with me after either of the other persons.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When was it that the prisoner answered to the name of Oram? A. I took the handkerchief from him, and said, "What are you going to do with this?" he said,"It is mine;" I said, "It is marked Oram" - he said,"My name is Oram."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know his friends? A. Yes, they are respectable - I do not know that he went by the name of James Oram; I did not know his silk handkerchiefs - he bore the name of Oram; he was Christened so after an aunt of his, who died with a cancer in her breast about five years ago - I was not surprised at his answering to the name of Povey - she was called Mrs. Povey; she did not bear the name of Oram to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Three other witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, and stated his name to be Povey.</p>

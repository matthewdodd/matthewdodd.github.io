I sent him up stairs to where the poll rings were; Hammond was above, he came down and said, he saw the prisoner take a ring out of the drawer, and after that he said, he saw him take Mears's handkerchief: I was by when he was searched, and saw a poll ring, 5 bolts, and the silk handkerchief found upon him: I heard him own before the Justice, he had taken and sold some rings in Newtoner's-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. I manage the business for my mother. Mary Jackson who lives in Titchfield-street—the prisoner Boote was in her employ—I received an anonymous letter, and on the morning of the 24th of September, I went into the shop, and looked into a basket which belonged to Davidson—I believe he had it in his hand—I found in it three pieces of mutton and one piece of beef—It weighted 5 1/2 lbs., and was all good and saleable—I told Davidson we had been waiting for him, and he should have all the law could give him—my brother called the officer, and we gave him into custody—I saw a sixpence and sixpenny-worth of half-pence of the ledge of the bar—the meat was worth half-a-crown—Boote was authorized to sell, and if he sold, he might have put the money at the ledge; but this was very early, before the shop was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I placed myself opposite my mother's shop that morning, and held an umbrella before my face—at five or six minutes before six o'clock, I saw the prisoner Davidson come down the street, with a flag-basket under his arm—by the description I had seen in a letter. I supposed him to be the man I wanted—he went to my mother's door, and tapped; but receiving no answer, he went on; and then came back, and stopped till Boote, who was my mother's foreman, looked out and Davidson walked in—I crossed over; and before I got across, Davidson ran out, and was walking up the street—I said, "You have been robbing my mother"—I drove him back to the door; and as soon as Boote saw me he ran back, and put something on the window-ledge—Davidson had a basked of meat on his arm, which was worth half-a-crown at least—I called my brother, and he told me to get the officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Boote</hi>. Davidson came and asked me to let him have sixpenny-worth of pieces—I gave him a small piece of mutton and beef—he then asked for sixpenny-worth more—I said, "Here is a bit of beef you may have for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he paid me a sixpence, and sixpenny-worth of copper—the meat was not worth half-a-crown. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was worth half-a-crown at least.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Hill, a linen-draper, in Oxford-street. About a quarter before twelve o'clock on the 18th of October, a lady drove to the door—I went out to attend to the carriage—the moment I laid down some gloves before the lady, I cast my eyes across the road and saw the prisoner lift Mr. Harris's pocket up with his left hand and insert his right hand—I did not see what he took out—I imme<lb></lb>diately ran across and inquired of Mr. Harris if he had lost anything—I then followed the prisoner—he ran down Oxford-street, down Duke-street, Henrietta-street, and up Gray-street—I there laid hold of him—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am independent, living in Park-street, Grosvenor-square. I was walking in Oxford-street a little before twelve o'clock on the 18th of October—Kyle seized me by the arm and asked if I had lost anything—I put my hand into my pocket and missed my purse, containing one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and three shillings—I saw a man running with a cloak on his arm—I could not see whether the pri<lb></lb>soner was the man, his back was towards me—Kyle said, "Follow me," and ran after the prisoner—after a considerable chase he was apprehended—he said, "Let me go, let me go, it is a mistake"—the Magistrate asked him why he ran—he said, "Because others ran."</p>

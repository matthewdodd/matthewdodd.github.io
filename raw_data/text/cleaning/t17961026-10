               <p>Prisoner's defence. This prosecution is founded merely upon malice, for the goods I never knew that I had, when I went away with them in my great-coat pocket; they were some how or other put into my pocket, because I would not work for him at the wages that he wished me, he has, out of revenge, framed this bill against me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hewlet.) Had you any quarrel with this man? - A. No, not at all, his wages were rose last Saturday night, and he was satisfied.</p>

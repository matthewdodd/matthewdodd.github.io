            , and he being to go from Graves-End in the Tilt-boat, she provided as much Beef as she thought sufficient for the Voyage, and tying it up in a Pudding Bag, packt it securely in the Hamper. It was about one of the Clock in the Morning when Mr. Raymond came to Billings-Gate. He had scarce landed when he was ply'd by a Waterman, (but he cannot swear that it was the Prisoner) with whom he agreed to go to <placeName id="t17260114-9-crimeloc54">Kings-Bridge, Westminster</placeName>

He observed the Number of the Boat, took his Hamper in and away they row'd, and quickly came to Kings-Bridge. Mr. Raymond stept on Shore, and the Waterman went abast, and said he'd bring the Hamper out, but instead of that he row'd away. By the Number of the Boat Mr. Raymond found out the Owner of it, tho' to but little Purpose; for says the Owner, My Boat was stole the same Night that you lost your Hamper, and I suppose by the same Rogue too. About 2 a Clock, on the same Morning that the Hamper was lost, the Prisoner came to the House of Mr. Clark, in Ashen-Tree-Court, in White-Fryers; where he was let in by

He brought a Hamper with him, which he open'd; and Mrs. Spur saw it was packt with Silk and other Goods prepared for Dying, which made her suspect that they were stoln. The Prisoner took them away again the same Morning, but however she desir'd her Landlord to enquire among the Callenders and Dyers, if no such Goods were lost, which he did, and heard of Mr. Raymond's Misfortune, at Mr. Crew's in Black-Fryers; who (as it happen'd) was the Prosecutors Callender. The Prisoner was traced out and apprehended, and the Goods found at the Baptist's-Head, in White-Cross-Street, where he had pawn'd them.</p>

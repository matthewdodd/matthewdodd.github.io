                  </hi>. I am a publican, but am out of business. I was at the Brewer's Arms, Pancras-road, between seven and eight o'clock on the 30th of July, sitting in the front room on the top floor—I had a shift and shirt on a line—I had seen the shift half an hour before—I heard a noise on the landing—I got up, and the door being a-jar, I caught the glimpse of some person going down stairs—I looked out and missed the shift and shirt—I saw the prisoner going along the street—I went down and brought her back—I got the officer, and saw the shift taken from her basket.</p>

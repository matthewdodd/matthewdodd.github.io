                  </hi>. I keep the Rose public-house, in Farringdon-street in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On Tuesday, the 18th of September, I had a bag of silver in my till, consisting of crowns, half-crowns, shilling, sixpences, and fourpenny-pieces, to the amount of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about seven o'clock that morning the three prisoners came into my house, and ordered a pot of beer, and laid down 31/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said it was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they disputed about paying the other halfpenny—they wanted Peckham to pay it—he declared he had no money, and showed them his pockets—about a quarter to eight o'clock my bag of silver was safe in the drawer, and they went drinking and smoking in front of the bar—I had occasion to go back for a second, when I returned they were there, still but went away in an instant—when the newspaper came, about seven minutes before eight o'clock, I went to the till to get money to pay for it, and missed my big of money—they had been gone a very few minutes—there was nobody but them drinking at the bar—I immediately named it to my wife—the bag was the sleeve part of a lady's kid glove—there was a bad sixpeace among the money, and a cracked sixpence also—anybody standing" front of the bar could reach the till—the counter is very narrow-about a quarter past nine o'clock, while at breakfast, an individual came in and gave me information, in consequence of which I went to the Fox and Knot public-house, and found the prisoners there—the officers went in before me, and found the money before I entered—they told me in the prisoners' presence that they had found the money on them—I then stated that among the silver they would also find a bad sixpence, which I had taken the night before, and had bent it on the head side, and they would also find a cracked sixpence, which was good silver, but which many people would not take—they were taken to the station-house, and there separate lots of silver produced—the bad sixpence was found in one parcel, which Scott produced, and the cracked one in another—Waller produced two parcels, and Scott one.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Fox and Knot, in Fox and Knot-court, King-street, Smithfield, within a quarter of a mile of the prosecutor's. The prisoners came to my house a little after eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th of September—they appeared the worse for liquor—they stood round the fire-place—I observed Winter with a light-coloured leather bag in his hand, full of silver—Gardner and Winter went into the parlour to tettle an account, and I heard the silver rattle—they asked for ink and paper—I could see into the room, through the window—they sat down together—I heard a great quantity of silver shot out of the little bag—after being in the room some time, they came out, and gave Peckham some silver, and told him there was nothing but copper in the bag—I called Peckham aside, and asked him if there was not something wrong, and in a little time he told me there had been a robbery committed in a public-house in Farringdon-street—I took him to my bar, and said, "Show me the manner the robbery was committed"—I did not know him before—he came to my bar, drew out my till, leant over the bar, pulled the till for<lb></lb>ward, pointed to a partition in the back part of the till, and said, "That is the part where the purse was when they took it away"—I went up stairs to Mrs. Barham, who was not up, and stated the circumstance, and wanted to go and give information—a friend came in—I told him to go and inquire at the public-houses if such a thing had happened, and with—in a quarter of an hour Smith and two officers came to my house, they ap<lb></lb>prehended the prisoners, and found silver on each of them.</p>

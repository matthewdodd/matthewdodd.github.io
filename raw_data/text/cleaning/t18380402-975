                  </hi>. I am a journeyman ironfounder, and live at No. 18, in Windsor-street, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; it is my dwelling-house. About eight o'clock, on the 10th of March, I went into the parlour—I saw the prisoner standing against the table, the door was open—he got on the table and jumped out of the window the moment he saw me—I jumped out and followed him—I did not lose sight of him for a moment—he had got about thirty yards—when I got up to him he said, "I am innocent"—I had not charged him with any thing—I brought him back to my house and gave him into custody—my wife was in the room before I went in, and had put the child to bed ten minutes before—I found thee articles stated packed up in a bundle, ready to carry away—my door was fastened with a spring lock.</p>

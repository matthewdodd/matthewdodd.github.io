            . I went on board this ship; I found she was broke open, I struck a light, and went down into her; then I heard a foot walking softly above; I went up, there was the prisoner; I secured him, and took him on shore to the watch-house, he told us if we would let him go, he would produce all the things, that they were all done up in a blue jacket; I told him, if he would produce the things that night, I would not hurt him; he wanted me to make oath that I would not; we never got the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to M'Daniel. What things were missing?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. There were all the things mentioned in the indictment missing, and as I had the care of the ship, I am liable to make them good; there were, of my own property, two jackets, a white shirt, and a pair of pumps missing; the prisoner pretended there were two men concerned with him, one was taken, but it appeared before the Justice that he was innocent, and he was cleared there.</p>

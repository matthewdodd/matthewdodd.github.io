On the night of 13th Jan., at 1 o'clock, I was watching with Stent in Park Wood, belonging to Mr. Clark, in the parish of Hillingdon—I saw four men in the wood at the far-end of it—the prisoners are three of them—they were about ten yards from us, coming up at the end of the wood—we were coming up the side—they saw us and set off to run; we ran after them—when they got out of the wood we were close to them—there was a gate at the border of the wood, Randall and Sims fell as they got over it—when I got over, I ran right in amongst them—Randall was the first nan I got to—he hallooed, "Hold hard!"and then struck me a blow on the head with the stock of a gun; he had hold of the barrel—Sims then came up, and struck me several times over the face with a small stick—while I was scuffling with them, one of the others hit me over the head with the butt of another gun—I do not know who that was—the gun broke short in two; I picked up the stock, and called out for Stent—he came up, Randall ran to him and threw him down, and Stent threw him down—the blows I received did not knock me down, but I was wounded in the head, and the ear, and forehead—Randall was struggling with Stent, and I was struggling with Sims—Stent hallooed to me, and I ran away and left Sims—I went to Stent's assistance, and when I got within about a yard or two of him, Randall and the other one whom we do not know, got up and ran away—when I got up to Stent he had got Pizzey down, we kept him—there is game on that land, which is there.</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went before the Magistrate the next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had not heard before that, what Sims was taken for; I knew he was taken—his father came and fetched me to go before the Magistrate—I made the statement which I have to-day—no one examined me before I went, and no one since—the stairs are in the kitchen—the room opens into the street—there is no passage—I was up and down all night—I did not sleep at all—from the position I was in, no one could have unbolted the doors and gone out without my knowing it; neither back nor front—I am certain neither of those doors was left open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live at Uxbridge; I occupy the house; Sims and his father occupy the garret. I recollect the night before Sims was taken—he came home that evening at half-past nine, and went</p>

               <p>to bed a quarter before ten—I slept in the same room—I saw him get into bed—I was in bed at the time—as far as I am aware, he did not come out of that room again—I recollect the policeman coming to fetch him in the morning; I saw him get out of bed then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A labouring chap; he was working for nobody at all at that time as I know of—he has never been in constant work—I cannot say when he had a job—he sat up to watch some meat for David Neal, sometimes one night in a week, and sometimes two nights—he came to bed at a quarter before ten o'clock; I am sure it was before ten—I have a watch, and I looked at it when I went up, about half-past nine—I had been in bed about two minutes when he came—it did not take me a quarter of an hour to undress and go to bed—I had to say my prayers first—Sims' father was in bed with him; I cannot say whether he was awake, he is not here—I did not sleep all that night; the child crying awoke me—it did not cry all night—I cannot tell what time I was awoke by it—I did not strike a light—it was dark—my bed is a few yards from Sims'—the room my wife was in with the nurse is a little back-room—Patterson went to bed between nine and ten—the door of the room where my wife was, fastens with a lock—I did not notice what sort of weather it was—my bed is on the ground, about one yard from the door, opposite the door—the door fastens inside, there is no lock on it—I went from the room where my wife was that night—I shut the door after me—I did not hear the door open or shut when the nurse went in or out—Sims has a brother, about ten years old, who slept with him—he is not here.</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you paid your own expenses to come up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it has cost me about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—I made the same statement before the Magistrate that I have to-day—Sims' father came up on Monday, and stopped all Tuesday; he could not stop longer—he has regular employ—the room in which my wife was confined is rather close—there is a window in it, about forty feet from the ground.</p>

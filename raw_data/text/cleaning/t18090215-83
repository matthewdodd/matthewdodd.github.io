On the 27th of January last, about half past five, the two prisoners came into my shop, they asked to look at a pair of stockings, which I shewed them; the young one, James, said they would not do; asked to look at others, which I shewed him; he put his hand in the window, and took out two pair of little children's; I took them from him. I told him I never permitted any body's hand but my own in the window. He then asked to look at others, which I shewed him.</p>

In a quarter of an hour I saw them pass the window, with a number of other people, and on my going to see what was the matter, I saw a scarlet cloak, my property, in the hands of a neighbour, Mr. Bignall; on which I went and seized both the prisoners.</p>

Passing by Mr. Squire's door Mr. Squire came out and owned the cloak which I had in my possession. At Mr. Squire's door the young one ran in between us, and asked me what I wanted with his brother. The oldest said he had bought it of a dustman and gave four shillings for it. James said he bought it of Mr. Squire and gave three shillings for it. The cloak has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes; he took lodgings of me a few days after Shrove Tuesday, a furnished back room up one pair of stairs, at four shillings a week; he staid with me rather better than four weeks. He owed me nothing. To the Monday he was taken up, he had not left my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you discovered there was any thing missing. - A. No; he was taken up in the city on Saturday the 21st of March, and two officers came with him to my house; they called me up stairs, and asked me if any thing was missing from the bed. I went up in the room and missed a sheet from the bed where the prisoner had slept. The officer ordered me to attend on Wednesday at the mansion house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sheet. - A. Yes, the pawnbroker's servant produced it; I knew it was my sheet.</p>

            . I am a city officer. I had the prisoner in custody upon another charge; on Saturday the 21st of March he was examined before the lord-mayor, and I was ordered to take him to the other end of the town to see if I could find the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean the property of this woman. - A. No; before I took him to the other end of the town I searched him; I found this duplicate in his breeches fob; I asked him what sheet it was, he told me it was the sheet of the bed where he lodged, at No. 5, Prince's-court, Drury-lane. He had a key in his pocket which he said was the key of his room; I took the key from him. Sherry and I and the prisoner went up to the lodging; after we were in his room I sent for Mrs. Martin to come up; when she came up, I desired her to look round the room to see if she had lost any thing; she missed the sheet from the bed. I told her the prisoner was remanded for examination on the next Wednesday at the mansion house, and requested her to attend. We came from there and went to the pawnbroker's; I asked the young man in the shop if he knew the prisoner; he said he did. I produced the duplicate, I desired him to produce the sheet at the mansion house on the Wednesday following. He appeared there with the sheet, and the prosecutrix identified it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Martin observed to you if you would give her the ticket, she did not want to go to the mansion house, she did not think I was the person to wrong her of the sheet.</p>
               <p>Leadbetter. The prisoner said he had some crockery in the room that would satisfy Mrs. Martin for the sheet; Mrs. Martin seemed inclined to be favourable to the prisoner; she did not wish to go to further trouble.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

On the 29th of December the prisoner took a bed-room of us, on the ground floor; he said he had a house at Clapham - that his wife was a laundress, and he should want the room till April, as he had to go home every night, and return every morning; he came the same night, and went to bed about ten o'clock - at five o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the noise of a trunk drawn from under the prisoner's bed; I awoke my husband, and told him to get up and take the key out of the street door, which he did - my husband then went to sleep again, but in a short time I heard the prisoner go along the passage, and open the door; I got up, and found him at the door - he had neither coat, hat, nor shoes on; I asked what he was going to do - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060021"></xptr>said to see what o'clock it was; my husband got up, and said he had better go back to his room, and see if all was right: I felt about the room, found a pair of trousers, and then a great coat - I got a light, and sent for the Policeman; the coat and trousers had been in the trunk, which had been locked - I then asked what he had done with the other coat, which had been in the trunk; he said it was on the bed - I then missed some silk handkerchiefs out of the trunk: I asked where they were - he said by the bedside; I found them there, and the next morning I found a piece of iron in the fire-place - I have since discovered that he had attempted to force the locks off some doors; there were some pieces of them broken off - I had seen the trunk safe at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

I had been there after the clock struck twelve. I knowing nobody could get them but they must go through the next house, I ran there; I asked if the woman's husband was at home, she said he was in bed. I told her, her doors were both open, and that I was robbed. I suspected the prisoners, knowing they lived abandoned lives. Thorman lived with his father at the next house; and the other lived upon Puddle-Dock Dunghill. I did not see them all the next day. I took them both up on the Saturday morning. I charged Thorman with taking the things, he denied it, then I took up Thomas. I took them to the Mansion-House; Thomas would own to nothing. I found the things in the house where

I was coming home that night from my club, I met the two prisoners in Church Entry, just by where I live, close to the prosecutrix; I said to Thorman, is it not time for you to be at home in bed; he said yes. They both came with me to the door where I live. I desired Thorman to come up stairs with me: he said he would come presently. I left them both at the door, he lies in the same room I do; he did not come up.</p>

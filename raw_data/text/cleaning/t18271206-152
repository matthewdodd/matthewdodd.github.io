            . I am an officer. I was sent for; the prisoner said she had nothing of her mistress'; her mistress asked if she objected to my searching her trunk, and, after a little time, she said No; she opened a trunk, took up this red cloak, and said, "Here is nothing here" - I took and opened the cloak, and felt something in the hood - I said, "Here is something;" she said, "Yes, and it is my mistress;" I found the lining had been unsown and pained up again, with all these articles in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

No, Sir - the woman went to the watch-house, but I have never seen her since; my clothes were in the same state they are now - I will swear that, or else I could not have run fast enough to catch him; it was not a very obscure place - the woman dragged me into the place on the side of the road; I did not give her into custody - she did me no harm: I do not know how the prisoner came to say, "Halloo!" he said, "This won't do;" I will swear that, to the best of my knowledge; my clothes were buttoned - my watch was found just at the place where I caught the prisoner, up against the dead wall, at the end of the court, thirty yards from where I was with the female; the watchman saw that I was sober - I did not strike any body with my umbrella to the best of my knowledge; I swear I was not tipsy - three of us had had three glasses of gin and water in the evening: that was all I had had after dinner - I had porter at dinner; I live at No. 40, Great Wild-street - I had been by the New Bethlem; I returned over Westminster-bridge. and met with a respectable old gentleman by the Horse Guards, who asked me to direct him to Holborn - I said I was going near that way, and went with him to Holborn; I was returning home, and it being rather late I cut down this place for the nearest - I did not drop my watch from my clothes; I saw the prisoner throw it from his hand and he said, "I have not got your watch - I have not got your watch."</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm, and went down to the bottom of my beat, where I saw the prosecutor in Chapel-place with the prisoner in custody - there were a good many more there; the watch was given to me - I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and asked how he came to do such a thing; he said it was done, and it could not be helped - that was his expression.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he speak English? A. Yes; and I understand English - the prosecutor did not seem to me to be drunk; he was able to make out his way - I did not notice whether he was in liquor; he was able to walk, run, and stand - there was a female with him; she went to the watch-house, and said she would go to the office and prove that this was the man who took the watch; I did not keep her, and she did not go before the Magistrate - the prosecutor went one way and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160037"></xptr>the other; his clothes were all right when I came up - I do not know that that lady walks about there.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of April last, about three in the afternoon I was in Thames-street, I saw the prisoner just by the watch-house door; he had this bundle on his shoulder, I had a strong suspicion of him, and I stopped him; I asked him what he had got, he made a very civil answer; I took him into the watch-house, and asked him where he got that from, he said he had it from Black Friar's-road, and he was taking it to Old-street to be washed; he said it was his mother's, I said it was clean linen, it was odd it should go to be washed; I asked him how he came there, he said he crossed the water, I asked him where he landed, he said he could not tell; I said it was very strange; he said it was nothing to me which way he came by it; says he, I met a man on London-Bridge and he gave me a shilling to take it to Blackfriar's; I found that he had eighteen sheets, a napkin, a red cloak, and a piece of a curtain: I searched him, and found withinside his breeches, a pair of silver salts, two silver spoons, and a pair of sugar tongs.</p>

               <p>Court. Where had you been all that time? - I had been in the kitchen; I suppose he got up the wall and got in at the back parlour window; I did not hear anything.</p>

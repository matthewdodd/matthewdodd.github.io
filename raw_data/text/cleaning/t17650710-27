Yes, said I, I will do that: I did; then I thought I had a right to lie down. I had 7 guineas and a half, and 6 s. in silver, tied up in a corner of my handkerchief, which I had about my neck: I lay down, and put my handkerchief under my head; I don't think she lay down; they had felt, and knew I had money about me; I was pretty far gone in liquor; I heard my money fall off the bed, and I believe she heard it too; but I thought it was safe. In the morning I awak'd about a quarter before four, and look'd about the floor for my money: I saw my handkerchief lying at the foot of the bed, and the money all gone: I thought it time then to make a report: not one of the women was in the room: I went down stairs, and made a report to

I told her she had robb'd me of seven guineas and a half, and 6 s. She put on her cloths immediately, and went out to look for her. I desired her to secure her, and keep her fast till she sent for me; she said she would. I said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100014"></xptr> will stay in the house till you come with an answer from her. She came again a little after five o'clock, Sir, said she, I have been over to the White Hart in the Borough; her name is Essa Morrison; she was seen going over London-bridge, and is gone down to Portsmouth. I said I would write down there, and have her adververtis'd and find her if in England. By looking about, I found Morrison at the Ship, one Anderson's, in East-Smithfield. As soon as I saw her, she said, There is the cull that I robb'd; I wish it had been a thousand pound. The constable was with me. I took her up: she was search'd, but not at that present time; there was 12 s. 6 d. and a ring, found in a box upon her. We took Waller in the afternoon about four o'clock; she came to her home in a coach, with a bundle of new cloaths that she had bought. Morrison told me before Justice Scott, at the Angel in Whitechapel, that she gave her two guineas in gold, and Waller answered it was but 25 s.</p>

He made me a present of 4 guineas and 5 s. and desired me to make the best advantage of it: he said he was going to sell his ticket, and would bring me more. I had lain with him before that.</p>

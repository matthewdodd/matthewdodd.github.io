                  </hi>. I live in Regent-street, Kennington-cross. I was eighteen years old last October—on the 2nd of December, 1883, I went to live with the prisoner as porter, to carry out parcels, in Leadenhall-street—I slept in the house afterwards—I remember the prisoner coming to live at the house in Leadenhall-street—he carried on business in Basinghall-street before—some time after that I became pattern-card-maker and shop<lb></lb>man—he was a woollen-draper—one evening, after the shop was shut, I went to the prisoner's desk—it was about the month of April—he called to me after the shop was shut, and said, "John, as my clerk is out, I must make you clerk to-night," and then wrote across a piece of paper the name of Joyce or Rice, and desired me to copy it across two blank stamps, which I did—he said nothing more about it—about six weeks or two months af<lb></lb>terwards, after the shop was shut, he called me again, and wrote the name of Joyce or Rice, and desired me to write it—I wrote this "C. Still," across this bill by command of the prisoner, about the month of September, and about eleven o'clock in the day—he took me up into the drawing-room, shut the door, and desired me to sit down till he was ready for me—I be<lb></lb>lieve he locked the door—I sat down—in about five minutes he produced two blank stamps, one of them a printed one, which is this one—he wrote across a slip of paper "C. Still," and desired me to copy it across the two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183503020138"></xptr>
               <p>blank stamps, which I did—one of them is the one produced—he said nothing to me after I had done it—this is the one which had printing on it, and I am certain that the other was not printed—there was no writing on it whatever, except "C. Still," which I wrote by his direction—on the Sunday following, I mentioned this at home—I believe the house of Bentley and Co. had not failed at that time—there was a person in the prisoner's employ named Jeremiah Mitchell—in consequence of what I heard of the transaction of Bentley and Co., I mentioned this transaction to Mitchell—up to that time I knew nothing of the nature of accommodation bills—I have frequently seen the prisoner write—the filling up of the body of this bill I firmly believe to be his handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never quarrelled in Mr. Little's house with any of the family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, not with any of the family—his wife never accused me of any thing, to my knowledge—she never accused me of theft—I can bring wit<lb></lb>nesses to prove that he placed the greatest reliance possible on me—his sister never accused me of theft, nor was any thing of the sort mentioned all the while I was there—she never accused me of pilfering pence and halfpence from the change—I was never charged with keeping back 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I got in change, for potatoes, nor with the beer money—there was never any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had to pay a bill with—I was in the habit of taking up bills for Mr. Little—he never had permission to use other persons' names in bills, to my knowledge—I was never accused, by any body in the house, of secreting a sovereign out of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had to pay a bill, nor of secreting the least thing, not even a pin—I paid a great many bills towards the last six months, and never saw a bill without the word "Accepted" to it.</p>

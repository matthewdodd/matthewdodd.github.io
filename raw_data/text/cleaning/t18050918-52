               <p>Q. Were you carrying any thing near Shoreditch a little while ago? - A. I was taking two bundles home from a gentleman in Shoreditch, on a Wednesday, about a month ago as nigh as I can guess, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know what were in the bundles, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body say any thing to you as you were going along? - A. Yes, Sir; she that stands at the bar took them out of my hand. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was she meeting you, or did she overtake you? - A. I met her by <placeName id="t18050918-52-crimeloc280">Shoreditch-church</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did the man go away with them? - A. Yes; she took me up a nasty place.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after the bundles were taken away from you, and given to the man? - A. Yes, and she said if I did not hold my tongue, she would chuck me in the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was gone with the bundles then, was not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come by at the time? - A. Yes, Mr. Durmaine came by.</p>
               <p>Q. You were crying, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.

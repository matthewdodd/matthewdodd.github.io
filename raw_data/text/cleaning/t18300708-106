               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ask Clark how he came possessed of the property? A. Yes, he said it belonged to a friend of his who would be there in a few minutes - he pointed out Jones; he did not say then that Jones had received them of another person, but he did before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. About half-past two o'clock, on Wednesday afternoon, I was going along Long-acre; the prosecutor called me to take Jones - Jones said it was Mr. Davis' property; I took the two prisoners to the watch-house, and in Jones' hat I found the duplicates of two saws, which had been pawned that day - I found no duplicates on Clark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then Clark never owned the property? A. Not in my hearing; I went on the opposite side, and took Jones - he did not come across; I went to the Blue Posts - Clark said before the Magistrate that they had the saws of a man, who was inxtoxicated, at the Blue Posts - I did not hear there had been three persons there; only two.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN BIRDSEYE REEVE. I am a pawnbroker. I have two saws, pawned by Jones, on the 5th of June.</p>


               <p>Jones' Defence. I hope you will look mercifully upon me - a man at the Blue Posts asked Clark or me to pawn some tools for him; I agreed to pawn two saws for 4s. 6d., and gave him the money - he said if the dupli<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080061"></xptr>cate was of any use I might keep it; he afterwards got us to pledge more things, and gave the basket to Clark, telling him to walk on, and he would overtake us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am keeper at Dr. George Burrows's establishment at Clapham. About four o'clock on the evening of the 15th of January, I saw two cloaks safe at the house—one belonged to Mr. Vincent Prosper—I did not notice it again that day—I missed it about seven o'clock next morning—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the prisoner had lived in the establish<lb></lb>ment as a keeper, but had left on the 8th of November—he had come on the 22nd of October—the police were sent for, and examined some footmarks—they were those of a person who wore straps—I gave directions to the policeman, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

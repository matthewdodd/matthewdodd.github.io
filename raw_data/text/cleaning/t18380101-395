                  </hi>. I am a private in the 2nd Battalion of the Cold<lb></lb>stream Guards. On the 28th of December I met the prisoner in the street, and asked him my way—I had two handkerchiefs, and I put them into my pocket—we went on to Albany-street—he there bid me good night—he then put his hand into my pocket and took the handkerchief from me—I got the silk one from him—he got from me and ran—I called to the policeman to stop him—I ran and caught him by the hand—these are my two handkerchiefs—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 46.) I came up, the soldier had hold of the prisoner, and charged him with stealing the handkerchiefs out of his pocket—he had got one handkerchief in his Land—the prisoner did not say any thing till he got to the station, and then he called the prosecutor a false man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that you used to put it there - A. Not to my knowledge. I returned home about five o'clock in the afternoon, I found the garret door broken open, the trunk lock was broken open, and the contents were gone, and I missed my watch from the other trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your discovering this, did you see the prisoner - A. No, he was gone; the joiner was in the house. I told the joiner that I had been robbed, I went to Bow-street, and gave information. The prisoner came to his work the next morning, I asked him, if he had seen any stranger in the house, or go up the staircase on Tuesday; he said, he had not. I asked him, if he was in the garret, or went up the garret stairs that day; he told me he had not. From suspicion, I had him taken up on the 24th of January.

I went up stairs to go into the two-pair, I met Passmore coming down the garret stairs; I asked him, if Dudley, another workman, was in the two-pair; he seemed very much confused, which made me take notice of him, and in a faultering voice he stammered out, I do not know. I asked him, if Elijah, another workman, was upstairs; he recovered himself a little by that time, he answered me, No; then he went down. The prisoner had nothing to do at that time upstairs, nor for a great while before: he ought to have been at work below in the vault. The next morning Mr. Williams acquainted me of the robbery.</p>

Yes, a one pound note; he told me, that he was low in circumstances, that his wife had wrote to him for two guineas, he could not make it up, he should be obliged to me for a one pound note towards it, he would work it out.

He brought a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches. He asked my mother's leave to let them be there while he went and fetched a trunk, she gave him leave, he went and brought in a leathern trunk; he said, I will put the things into the trunk, and I will leave them here awhile, by your leave; he took the key, and went away. The trunk had his initials, T. P. upon it. He came again on the Monday, about five o'clock in the evening, and brought some more clothes: I believe, they were women's clothes. He put them into the trunk, he locked the trunk, and took the key, and away he went. On the next evening I saw him again, he had a bundle with him; he put it in the trunk, and went away. I produced the things to Mr. Williams on the same evening that the prisoner was in custody.</p>

I told him what I apprehended him for; he said, he knew nothing about it. I found upon him this watch. It is not the prosecutor's watch; it is a silver watch. He said, he gave fifteen shillings for the duplicate; the watch had been in pawn for two pounds. In his box were six seven-shilling pieces, thirty-six shillings in silver, and about ten shillings in halfpence. On the next day, we went with a search warrant to No. 17, where Neale lived; there we found this trunk (it has T. P. upon it), and all the articles described by the last witness; the articles consists of new mens' and womens' apparel; the whole together are worth between fifteen and twenty pounds. When I had found the things, the prisoner said to me, you old file, what can you do, there is nothing there that you can swear to.</p>

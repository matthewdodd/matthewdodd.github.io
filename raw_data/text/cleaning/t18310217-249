I was on duty in Hastings-court, and met the prisoner running from High-street, Shadwell - he stepped aside, and I saw a watch-case in his hand; I seized him - he tussled with me for about two yards, and then dropped the watch - I got him down, and called out, "There is the watch;" I could not get to it myself, and thought some honest person would take it up - I sprang my rattle; a Policeman came and secured him, but the watch was gone; several persons had come up the court.</p>

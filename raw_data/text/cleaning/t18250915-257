On the 17th of August, I received sixty sovereigns; I paid away thirty-four or thirty-five, and had the rest in a Scotch plaid bag, in my pocket; I was a little fresh in liquor, but perfectly sensible. On leaving the East India-house I went along Whitechapel, and bought two neats' feet and a calf's foot, which I put into a bundle handkerchief, and carried in my hand; I walked down Church-lane, and in turning the corner into Cable-street, my hat was taken from my head by a woman - it was about two o'clock in the afternoon; I called out "You hussy, bring me my hat;" I had never seen her before - she said nothing - I followed her up <placeName id="t18250915-257-crimeloc1379">Cable-court</placeName>

I think they said it was between three and four o'clock, when I came to my senses. I am sure my bag and money were safe when I was dragged into the house. I had made a purchase just before - I saw my bundle at the watch-house, with the handkerchief, and neat's feet in it. I am certain of the prisoners' persons - all of them. Holland had a hairy cap on, but in the course of the scuffle he appeared in a red cap, which he had on under the hairy one - I cannot swear which of the women took my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who had you drank with? A. A man named Farrier, in Little-Bell-alley, about half-past eleven o'clock. I drank part of two bottles of ale with him and another - I had a glass of gin and water; that is all I had that day; it was called Scotch ale - it made me a little fresh. I did not see three women till I got to the house - I was dragged in instantly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150096"></xptr>and was no sooner in than down - I resisted being dragged in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call for assistance? A. It is nothing but a den of thieves - I have discovered that since; it is about thirty yards from the main street - I could not have been heard - I was not half a minute at the door, before I was pulled in. I was terrified, but not so much as some people might be - I held the door-post as long as I could; I had no opportunity of seeing either of the prisoners, after I was pulled down; I am positive to all their persons.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing them, while they were pulling you? A. I had - several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. After drinking with the person, did you call elsewhere? A. Yes, at three places - but had nothing to drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HOLLAND. When the handkerchief was at the office, it was not torn. Witness. I produced it at the office torn in this state.</p>

            . I live in Cable-place, Cable-street; this place is called Cable-tier, or Long-alley - it is six or seven yards from the alley, to the top of Cable-court. On the 17th of August, near four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Holland, and three girls going down the court - I knew two of them - they came out of Cable-tier - I saw no more of them after they went out to the main street. I saw Smith, who goes by the name of Kit Lips and Hall, who goes by the name of Davis, and another young woman, whose face I did not see; I heard Holland say to them, "Get on, or go on," he used an improper word, and said, "Get on, let the **** lay;" or something of that sort. Mrs. M'Ardell, came round the corner in a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes - and in consequence of what she said, I opened my yard-door, and went out into the waste ground, and there saw Randall lying on his back - a bundle lay at the back of his head in a belcher handkerchief quite torn, with cowheels, or neat's-feet, and cucumbers - his hat was nearly off his head - he was a few yards from the door of No. 21. I have frequently seen Smith, Holland and Hill, going in and out there. I always knew Hill, by the name of Davis. Randall lay there sometimes. A man of colour fetched Jackson from the watch-house; he appeared quite insensible, there was no movement in him. I know nothing of Edwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were cucumbers in the bundle? A. Yes. I did not open it, but saw them.</p>

            . I live in Cable-court, and am married. I have seen all the prisoners, at the house where this happened - I do not know who lives in it. On the 17th of August, between two and three o'clock, I saw Edwards take Randall's hat off - she was at the top of the court. Randall was just at the end of the court, ten or twelve yards from the street; he followed her, and I saw him go into the house after his hat. I saw the three female prisoners go in at the door before him - and I saw him walk in. I stood at my door, which is three or four houses off, for more than half an hour, before I saw the three women go out of the court. I saw nobody with them - I then went by the door, and saw the prosecutor laying on his back on the ground in the room; I looked in, and saw Holland trying to lift him up - I said, "Dan, can't you lift him up?" He said, "Hold your tongue, he will get up by and by, let him be," or something of that sort. I went home, and afterwards saw Randall laying on the waste, at the back of my house; he was five or six yards from their house - and while he lay there, I saw Holland moving his things out of his own into another house. I am certain of the prisoners' persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, you could not tell whether Hill or Smith, were two of the women? A. I do not know the names they go by - but they are the three women. I did not hear any noise in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Randall was ten or twelve yards inside the court when his hat was taken off; not in the main street? A. No, not in the street, there was no man with the three women when they passed me - they had time to go into the main street before Holland joined them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many rooms does the house consist of? A. I do not know - the room and street doors were open when I passed.</p>

            . I am married, and live in Cable-court, Cable-street. Holland lives at No. 21, Cable-court. On the 17th of August, between three and four o'clock, I went to the back of my house to take an apron in, and saw Randall laying at the bottom of the ground, near No. 21. I went to Mrs. M'Ardell, she came, and looked at him - he seemed dead. I saw Holland come out of the back door of No. 21, and drop a bundle near Randall's head - he went into one of the back doors again. I did not know Randall, and did not see further into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take the pains to see whether he was alive or dead? A. No.</p>

            . I keep a mangle in Cable-place. I and Hill went into the waste behind the house, and saw the prosecutor laying on his back, with one arm out of his coat. Holland came and put a bundle down about a yard from Randall, who was insensible. We made an alarm after Holland was gone, and the people came. I have known Holland three or four years, and I believe he lives in the court, but I do not know at what number - I have seen him lately at No. 21 - he has no family, but a parcel of women live there - the female prisoners live in the court, in different places I believe - I saw them up and down the court - I do not remember seeing Holland that day, except at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your making an alarm were you instantly attended to? A. Yes, persons came out of their back doors; the court is long, and goes sideways; I do not think a person calling out would be heard in the main street.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. George's. I apprehended Hill on the 1st of September; I think in Hyam's-buildings, Blue-gate-fields; and told her I wanted her concerning a robbery committed in Cable-tier; she begged of me to take her as private as possible; I called her by the name of Davis, which she usually goes by; she said she would not go by that name, but by her right name, Hill. Next morning, about three o'clock, I apprehended Edwards, and asked her how long she had left Cable-court; she said she had left it two or three months; I took her in Blue-gate-fields; I asked the landlady, in her presence, how long she had been there; she said not more than a fortnight, if so long.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George's. On the 17th of August I went to No. 21, Cable-tier, about four o'clock in the afternoon. I found the house locked up, and shutters fastened. I went through the next house, and found Randall on the waste ground on his back, with a bundle laying by his side - he appeared quite insensible - I got assistance, and conveyed him to the watch-house, where he recovered - his coat was on then - I cannot say whether he had been beaten - he might have had some liquor - when he came to himself he complained of being very stiff - a bundle laid by him, containing neats' and calves' feet, and some cucumbers - I broke open the house, and found all the goods, except the bedstead, moved from the lower floor - I know that Hill and Holland lived there - I have often seen them in bed there - a person passing the door can see into the room if the door is open - I should think this house is about forty yards from the main street - there are noises so frequently there, that if the man had hallooed it would not be noticed - I know the other two women by their living in the court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Randall leave the watch-house? A. I saw him in the morning - he had recovered so as to speak; I saw no blood or bruises; he overhauled his pockets, and said my book has been changed from one pocket to the other, but there was nothing for them there; but they had taken his bag with twenty-five sovereigns.</p>

            . I apprehended Holland in Wells-street. I saw him run through the lane, followed him into a public house, called him out, and told him I took him on suspicion of a robbery in Cable-place; he said he knew nothing of it, but he supposed it was in consequence of his former life; he had a brown short coat on, and a hairy cap.</p>

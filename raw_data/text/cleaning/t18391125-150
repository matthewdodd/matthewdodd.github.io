                  </hi>. I live in Whitcombe-street, Leicester-square, at Mr. Saphill's, who married my sister—I am a working jeweller, in the employ of Brown and Kay, manufacturing jewellers, Tavistock-row, and have been nearly eight years in their employ. On Monday, the 30th of September, I was walking to my lodging from Brown and Kay's, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I think nearer eight, and saw the prisoner Henry—I stopped to look at some books at a shop in St. Martin s-court, and he came up and remarked on the cheapness of them—I said, they were so—I put the book I had in my hand down, and walked on to Leicester-square—he walked with me as far as my own door, and then wished me good night—he had followed me and entered into conversation—on the evening of the 1st of October I had just come from my own house to go out for a walk after business, about half-past eight o'clock—I was passing down my own street, and at the corner of James-street Heny came up to me and said, "How do yon do, sir?"—this was about four houses from my own house—I acknowledged the compliment and walked on—he followed, and entered into conversation with me—I went down</p>

               <p>the street towards Charing-cross, and passed on through Charing<lb></lb>cross past the Horse-guards—he still continued walking with me—I kept straight on down the street towards the front of Westminster<lb></lb>abbey, not Parliament-street, hut the street on the right hand side—I went on down Dean-street, and when we got down Dean-street, near the corner of Peter-street, he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and he remarked that a friend and himself were going to open an eating-house, that the men were at work on the premises, and be would go and see how they got on, and would I go with him—I went with him to No. 66, Peter-street, as I have since ascertained, it was about the middle of the street—when we got to the door, he took a key from his pocket and opened the side door in the passage close to the street door—he went in first, I did not follow him immediately—I did not intend to go in, but he turned round and asked me to step in, which I did—the moment 1 had stepped in, he closed the door and seizing me by the collar, said, "Now you are in my power"—there was a candle burning on a little shelf in the corner in the shop, which was under repair—there were workmen's tools there—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "I will show you what I mean; let us see what you have about you"—I struggled with him to get loose—he said, it was of no use, he would call the police, and give me in charge for unnatural practices, if I attempted to make the least noise—he then tore open my waist<lb></lb>coat and trowsers, turned my pockets inside out, and took from my trowsers' pocket 1 sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some halfpence—at that moment 1 heard footsteps in the passage, and a man's voice call out "Henry"—Henry did not answer, and I heard footsteps go to the back of the house, and I saw Taunton throw open a sash-window, and come into the place where we were—I am certain he is the man—Henry was about removing my watch<lb></lb>guard from my neck at the time he 'came in—it was a black ribbon—Taunton said, "Holloa. Henry, what have you got there?"—Henry re<lb></lb>plied, "Oh, it is all right, a regular b---"—after that Henry proceeded to take the rings from my fingers—I resisted him rather faintly, I confess, for I was in great trembling and fear—Taunton then said he would fetch in the policeman, and give me in charge—Henry said, Oh, never mind, let him go, we have got all we can"—he let go of me, and I then made my way into the street, and got home as well as I could.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Wednesday, the 16th—Taunton was taken after that—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when he was taken by Cooper—I found him in his shop—it is an eating-house—it is the same place I was at—it was undergoing repair at the time I was there first-all I saw of Taunton, was during the tine he came in at the window, and till I got out—I am positive the words Henry used were, "It is all right, a regular b—," they are too fully impressed on my mind to forget them—I am quite positive they were the precise words—I have not strengthened my recollection at all since they were appre<lb></lb>hended—I never said it was to that effect, to my recollection—I gave the words repeated by the prisoner—I am quite confident of the words—it—was six weeks afterwards that I first gave an account of the words he used—I did:</p>

               <p>not make a memorandum of them—I am quite certain Taunton said he would give me in charge—I have always been quite sure about that—I was very much confused and agitated—the door of the room could not have been fast, for directly I put my hand against it, it opened outwardly—I did not say he locked the door—I said he closed it—that has always been my opi<lb></lb>nion—I struggled with Henry before Taunton came in—we did not make much noise, except the noise of our feet—it was after that that Taunton came in at the window—I never saw Taunton from that time till he was taken into custody—he never came to me, nor asked for any thing—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>

I took Henry into custody by the advice of my superintendent, on Saturday, the 16th of November—I also went and took Taunton—I found him at No. 66, Great Peter-street—I have known the house for above twelve months—it was open as an eating-house, when I took Taunton—he had opened it about nine weeks—I told Taunton what I took him for—I took him to the station-house in New<lb></lb>way, Westminster—I did not at any time tell him it would be better for him to confess, or worse if he did not—he denied the charge—he said he did not know Mr. Poulson at all—Poulson was with me at the time—I then took Taunton to Bow-street station-house—he then told me he recol<lb></lb>lected the gentleman, and seeing him at his house with the prisoner Henry, that he heard a noise in the room, and went and tried the door, and found it fast—that he entered at the window, came into the room where Poulson and Henry were, and he said he (Taunton) used threatening words, but he did not Bay who to—that was all he said—he said nothing more to me about Henry or himself—he did to Mr. Hall.</p>

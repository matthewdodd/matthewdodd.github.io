            . I am fourteen years old. I live in Great Peter-street, Westminster. I was in Fleet-street on the 25th of April, about four o'clock, and saw the prisoner pull his hand out of the prosecutor's pocket, as I turned round to go into a shop - the prosecutor turned round, collared him, and then he dropped the pocket-book - the prosecutor put him into the shop that I was going into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the prisoner? A. Close to him - I was on the curb-stone - I was going into a shop - I think he put the hand into the nearest pocket to me - when he was taken, he said it was not him, and at the watch-house he said he had shown the gentleman a man who was running, but he would not go after him - I did not see him till he was pulling his hand out of the gentleman's pocket - he was shuffling past.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge, at 94, Fleet-street, from General Mawby, with the pocket-book.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I left the Borough on my way to Smithfield. I had to go to my uncle's with a parcel, and from there to Drury-lane Theatre; and in Fleet-street, about half-past five o'clock, I was walking very fast on the curb, when the prosecutor came up and accused me of it - I went with him into a shop - they sent for a policeman, who came in about ten minutes, and the lad came in at the same time - he heard the prosecutor's evidence, and instantly said he had seen my hand in the gentleman's pocket; he knew nothing about it till he heard the prosecutor's statement - I had my hand in my coat pocket when the gentleman caught hold of me - when he took up the book he was ten or twelve yards from me.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JAMES COX re-examined. The prosecutor called me, and asked me what I had seen - I told him - he did not tell me that the prisoner was the man - he said,"Did you see the prisoner do it?" - I said, "Yes" - that was all - I am sure I saw what I have stated.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man - A. I do not know. It was not the prisoner. I told him that I believed Mr. Jordan in Whitechapel wanted one. From that information, he said, will you take share of half a pint of beer. I accepted the offer, and said, I was going to the Old Change with this trunk, we would walk down there; we went there. After we came out and had drank the pint of beer, I found my trunk gone. I left my trunk within the door, rather inclining to the outside of the door of the tap.</p>
               <p>Q. What beer did you drink - A. One pint of beer between us two. When I came out I said to the man that was with me, by the great God my trunk is gone; he said, d - n it, that is a queer thing. I went into the yard to see whether any of the porters had took it, he said he would go and see after it; I stopped at the door, and when he came back Mr. Lee said he saw a man run down the Old Change, and go into Moor's-yard. I found my trunk in Moor's-yard, in Mr. Phillips's house.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know is, that you lost your trunk, and that you found it afterwards at Mr. Phillips's. Are you a Londoner - A. No. I have been in London five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you ought to have more sense - You know nothing of the prisoner, do you - A. No.</p>

            , carwoman. On this day, about two o'clock, I was standing with my cart, I saw a man run across Old Fish-street Hill with a trunk on his shoulder. He took it up Moor's-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the Queen's Head - A. About an hundred yards. My fellow-servant said he had suspicion he had stolen the trunk; I did not think so; the man came back again in the space of a minute, without the trunk. I knew every person in Moor's-yard. I did not think there was any body in the court that would take a stolen thing in. There was an outcry that the trunk was stolen, I and my fellow servant followed the man up Old Change, met with him, and took him into custody. I am certain the same man we took is the same man that went up Moor's-yard with the trunk. When we stopped the prisoner he asked what was the matter; we told him a person wanted to speak with him concerning the trunk; and coming along I gave him into the custody of the officer that met us.</p>

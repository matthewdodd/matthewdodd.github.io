                  </hi>. I live at the Plough, in Carey-street. On the 2nd of June I was in Fleet-street, at about twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the evening—I perceived something at my pocket, and turned round very quickly, and challenge the prisoner with stealing my handkerchief—while I was doing that, he pt it down by his side, on the pavement—I saw him do it, and gave him into custody.</p>

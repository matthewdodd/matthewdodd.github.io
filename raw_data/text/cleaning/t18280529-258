            . I am the wife of Thomas Jennings. On the 6th of May I saw this property safe in a box in my room about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner at the bottom of the court at ten - I saw him again in my room at half-past eleven o'clock, getting out of my window; I was going into my room, and he pushed against the door - I waited some time, and saw him go from behind the door and stand in the middle of the room- I cried out, "Lord have mercy upon me;" Stephens came from the water-closet, and the prisoner made his way out at the window; I went in and shut the window, put the fastenings on it, and sent Stephens to tell my husband; I went and fetched Mr. Worrall to go into my room with me; I found my trunk broken open, and the articles stated taken from it; I saw the prisoner in about three hours.</p>

I have known the prisoner about eight months - he lived in an up stairs room of mine about eight months ago; he has borne a good character. On the day he was taken up, he came to my house to ask me if the landlord had a room to let; I said Yes, and he said he would wait for the landlord; he waited from ten minutes past eleven o'clock till near two, and then went away, and I never saw him any more; I do not know what day of the week it was, but it was the beginning of May, about the 5th or 6th - I am quite sure it was the day he was taken up, because his father came the day after, to ask me if he had taken a room in the house - I am quite certain he did not move from the step of my door till two o'clock that day.</p>

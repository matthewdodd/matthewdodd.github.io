               <p>On the 9th of November, about four in the afternoon, I was in my own shop opposite the wharf gate, and I saw the prisoner go once or twice, I am not sure which, but I am sure of once, I think twice; I saw him go in and take up a bag of nails in his arms, and I saw him carry them along the street, and lay them down in the street against the rails; he stooped, pitched his shoulders underneath the bag, and they were too heavy for him, he could not raise them; he took the nails up again in his arms, and carried them along the street, and the prosecutor having information, pursued him.</p>

               <p>I was leading my cart; I am porter at the wharf, I pursued the man in St. Catherine's-lane, with a bag of nails on his back; he gave me no answer, but dropt them down, but I kept him fast.</p>

               <p>I swear to the bag, and the tally on the bag; and the nails are of the same sort.</p>

               <p>I came from on board ship: coming down Tower-hill; I went into a public-house and had two pints of beer; a man followed me out, and asked me to carry the bag of nails, and he would pay me; I went to the wharf, he told me to stop, he pointed to the nails, and I took them up.</p>

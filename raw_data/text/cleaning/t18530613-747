                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Plumstead. On 17th May, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, I had a time piece—this is it—it was on the mantel piece in my front parlour—I went to bed, and in the morning I went out to work, and previous to my coming home to breakfast I received information, and went to the station house, between 8 and halfpast 8 o'clock—I there saw my time piece—the prisoner was there—I was told I had lost such a thing, and the prisoner was seen coming out of my house—this is my property.</p>

               <p>witness. On Wednesday morning, 18th May, I came out of my house about 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner coming out of the prosecutor's house—I had never seen her before—I am certain she is the woman—she went to the Sussex Arms, and I told her it was no use to rap at that door for an hour; there would be no one up—I went to a shop for a few things—I returned in twenty-five minutes, and found Mr. King's door open—it was open in the same manner as when the prisoner came out—I knocked at the door, and saw Mrs. King—I did not go into the parlour, or look in—I spoke to Mrs. King at the door, and in consequence of that I gave information to the constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi>, Had you ever seen this woman before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prosecutor's door and my door join—she was coming out of his doer as I came out of mine—she walked to the Sussex Arms, which is about thirty yards—I did not rap at Mr. King's door at that time; I did when I came back, about twenty-five minutes afterwards—I left the prisoner at the Sussex Arms when I went away.</p>

I live about 100 yards from Mr. King's—I know his house very well—on the morning of 18th May the prisoner came to my father's shop about half past 7 o'clock—I did not know her name—she had a time piece in her hand, wrapped in an apron—I saw there was something—I could not see what it was—she said, "Let me leave this; I will call for it in a few minutes' time"—I said, "Put it down," and she put it down in one of my father's baskets—my father is a greengrocer—the basket stood on a box in the shop—the prisoner went away, and did not come back—soon afterwards a constable came, and had the parcel the prisoner had left—my father was there, and he took it up out of the basket—I saw the parcel undone—this timepiece was in it.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Coventry. Last Tuesday morning I was cleaning the shop; I was behind the counter, and my back towards the door - I just saw the prisoner going out; these two umbrellas had been on the counter, six or seven feet from the door, and I saw that he had two - I did not see any body with him; I rang the bell for my master, and ran out, but could not find him - I saw him in about ten minutes afterwards in a public-house, and am certain of his person - he had not been stopped; my master went in with me; the prisoner had the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150092"></xptr>umbrellas under his seat - I believe these to be my master's, because he had wrapped them up in papers, as these are - we lost four.</p>

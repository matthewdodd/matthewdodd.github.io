                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Edward Evans. I was drawing a truck with some parcels in it in Cheapside, on the evening of the 23rd of Aug.—I was near the corner of Gutter-lane—I had three parcels in the truck, and was going to deliver them at different booking-offices—just as I got to the corner of Gutter-lane I felt the handle of the truck give a sudden jerk—I turned and missed the middle parcel out of the truck, and I saw the prisoner—I dropped the truck and pursued him—he threw the parcel down in Gutter-lane—I passed by the parcel and pursued the prisoner—he was stopped in a turning near Gutter-lane, by a young man belonging to one of the warehouses—we brought him back to Cheapside and gave him to a policeman—the parcel contained thirty-two printed books, and some printed music.</p>

               <p>Lisson-grove, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On the 26th of Nov. the two female prisoners came to the house and took a furnished room-Susan<lb></lb>nah represented herself as the sister of Elizabeth, in her presence, and wrote her name down as Mrs. Norman, under the direction she gave as a reference—she said her husband was a fishmonger, working at Tottenham-court-road—the male prisoner came in the evening—my husband told him he understood the room was taken for himself and wife only—he said Susannah was a servant out of place, and would be backwards and forwards a great deal—he said he would pay the rent every Wednesday—they came in that night, and left in a week, without notice or paying the rent—we had the door opened next morning—I found all the drawers broken open which I bad left my things in, and the clothes gone—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—they were worth about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

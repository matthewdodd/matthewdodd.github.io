                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Henrietta-street, Hackney-road. On Saturday, the 7th of September, I was in Old-street-road, about twelve o'clock at night, and going towards the London Appren<lb></lb>tice to buy a pie, I saw the female prisoner—I did not know her before—she said, "Where are you going, my dear?"—I said, "I am going home" she said I had better accompany her home, and took hold of my arm—we proceeded towards Storeditch church, and turned into a street at the back of the church—she took me to a house there—she opened the door herself, and went up stairs to get a light—I staid below—she returned with a light in three or four minutes—I then proceed up stairs into a back-room on the first-floor, and saw a man going up the second flight of stairs as I went into the room—I had not seen that man before—I went into the back town—there was a bed there—when I got in she asked me what I was going to give her—I said, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she replied, "You have more "money than that," and attempted to ink my money in the pocket—she thrust her hand in, and took out 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got hold of her hand to get it from her, and she immediately called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—I heard a footstep coming, and flew to the door and bolted it—the male prisoner constantly burst it open, and seized me—I tried to rescue myself from his old, and seized him by the neck handkerchief, threw him down, and called out for the assistance of the police—the female prisoner then took</p>

On Saturday night, a Sunday morning, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in Bird Cages-walk, and saw the prosecutor coming along, holding his arm, and com<lb></lb>plaining of it very much—he made a complaint to me, in consequence of which I got another officer, and we proceeded to the house, in Nichol-street, which he showed us-we went to the back of the house, and then was a light burning in the first floor room—I went to the door, and knocked more than once, but no answer was given-we assisted my brother officer on to the wall, and he knocked at the window with his staff—the female called out, "Who is there?" and in about five minutes the male prisoner came down and let us in—he was undressed—he said, "What do you want?"—I said "I want you and the woman up stairs"—the female prisoner said, "I suppose it is about that b row we had with that man just now"—the prosecutor identified them both as the persons who had ill-used him, before we got a light, by their voices-we followed the man up stain, and the female was sitting up in bed—the male prisoner said, "Any b----man would burst a door open to protect his wife"—I asked what money they had about them—the man said he might have 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he did not know—could I found 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on him, but nothing on the female-we searched the place, but not find the rule—I have known the female prisoner as a prostitute for the last six months.</p>

             (Police-constable H 50). On the 17th of June I was in Whitechapel, about half-past three o'clock - I saw the prisoner and four others - he was close to the prosecutor; I saw him quit him, and run off - I spoke to the prosecutor, and then ran after the prisoner down Essex-street; I saw him put this handkerchief into his pocket - I pursued him into Wentworth-street, and from there to George-street; I observed the corner of this handkerchief out of his pocket - I stopped him in George-street, and took it from him; he said he had picked it up - I then met the prosecutor, and he claimed it; the prisoner sells wood in Whitechapel; I never knew any harm of him.</p>

            . Some time after Blackmore was taken I came up, and heard him own he had taken the firkin of butter. I asked him if he knew any thing of a half firkin that we had lost, and he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Barnes. This was at an alehouse where he was taken, on the 15th of December. Before we went before my Lord-mayor he owned he took the butter that he was carrying away, from Smart's Key, and I knew it to be Mess. Shakspires's property by the mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a firkin of butter worth?</p>
               <p>Barnes. It is worth twenty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before my Lord-mayor?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I heard him own the same there, but it was an alderman, my Lord not being there. He told me Rowley and he were concerned in taking it, and gave me information of half a firkin that we had lost on the 5th of December. I got a search warrant, and went, by his directions, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176001160016"></xptr> searched a house in Westminster, and there I found the tub, but the butter was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was it?</p>
               <p>Barnes. It was at a chandler's shop in the Broadway, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be the same tub?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I can swear that to be Mess. Shakspires's tub by the mark. The woman that keeps the shop said she bought the butter of three soldiers. [The two prisoners were <rs id="t17600116-18-deflabel93" type="occupation">soldiers</rs>

               <p>Q. Did he own the taking of the butter?</p>
               <p>Barnes. No, he did not; but said he was with Blackmore and Taylor. [Taylor is another soldier, not taken ] Rowley said they had all three half a crown each. Blackmore had told me that they were all three concerned in taking the butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say when they took it, and from where?</p>
               <p>Barnes. He said they took the half firkin on the 15th of December, from off Smart's-key, and sold it in the Broad-way, Westminster.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you buy it of them?</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Uxbridge. Six or seven months ago I was in a public-house, and Biggs, who was there, said he had been to Ryslip, and had been raffling with six others for these knives and forks at 1s. a piece, and he had got them for 1s., - he offered them round, and I asked what he wanted for them - he said 5s., and I bought them; there are knives and forks of the same appearance sold about, at that price - I did not know he was in Mr. Benham's service, but as soon as I heard that Mr. Benham had been robbed, I went and asked if these were his - he said they were.</p>

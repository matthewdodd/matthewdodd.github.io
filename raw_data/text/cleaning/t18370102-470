                  </hi>. I live with my father, Charles Colliver, at Deptford-green, in the parish of St. Nicholas. On Sunday, the 31st of July I went to church, at six o'clock in the evening, with my father—we left nobody in the house—the doors and windows were fastened—we returned at a little after eight o'clock, and found the door was fattened inside—when we got in, we found a pane of glass taken out of the back<lb></lb>parlour window, which was opened—I missed the articles stated, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—1 have not seen any of the things since.</p>

                  </hi>. On Thursday night, the 22nd of December, I apprehended Sherwood, and took him to the station-house—I did not threaten him or make him any promise—I told him I took him for a robbery at Deptford-green, and also a robbery at High-street—he said, he knew nothing about it, but going along he said he had nothing to do with the robbery himself, but Bark with got in at the window by the post, and took the rings and money, and he owned he had given him half-a-crown and two<lb></lb>pence out of it—he then said he got up to the window himself but he saw the place was furnished so beautifully he was afraid to go in, and he got down and ran away alongside of the ditch—that he went down into that country himself, and Barkwith went away with one Driscoll—I had been looking for him for six weeks and more.</p>

One Sunday evening in the summer time, (I cannot tell what month it was,) about half-past six o'clock I was playing with some children near Mr. Colliver's, and Barkwith gave me two cherries to go away, and take the children with me—I knew him before—I took them all away—I went a little further, and went down again, and saw Barkwith standing on the privy of the stable in Mr. Gordon's yard—he had only to get over a wall, and he would be at Mr. Colliver's house—Sherwood was with him standing on the privy—I did not see which way they went—I could not see them any more as the fence was too high for me—they <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi> down when I went to look, and I could not see where they went to.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was cleaning out Mr. Percival's chambers, in <placeName id="t18000115-28-crimeloc149">Lincoln's-inn</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. Was this man a stranger to you? - A. Yes; but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEATHERBOURG sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Nunn, bookseller, in Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I know the prisoner perfectly; I have seen him before; he came to my master's house, as near as I can guess, about a quarter before five, on the Monday before Christmas-day, he brought a boy with him, with some books, and asked Mr. Nunn if he would purchase them, and he said, no; I recollected his person then; he had some time before brought Mr. Marryat's books; I told Mr. Nunn that was the man that had brought Mr. Marryat's books, and said, I would go and take him; I followed him down Wild-street, into a bookseller's shop, where I took him; I told him they were not his property; he said, they were, he had bought them; I sent my master's son, who came down Wild-street with me to Bow-street, for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the books when you stopped him in this shop? - A. Upon the counter, close by him; the officer came and took him to Bow-street, and I took the books, which were delivered to the constable, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH sworn. - I am one of the persons belonging to Bow-street: On Monday the 23d of December, between five and six o'clock, I was fetched to take charge of this man, for stealing some books; he told me the books were his, that he gave twenty-five shillings for them; I then secured him, and took him to Bow-street; I have had them ever since. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>HON. SPENCER PERCIVAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I lost all these books, and this one I can speak positively to, because there is a great deal of my own hand-writing in it; it is the second volume of Burrow; the first witness is my laundress's daughter; there are five volumes of Burrow, and three of Brown's Reports in Chancery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing at all to say.</p>

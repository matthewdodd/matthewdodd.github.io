               <p>Rich. Russel . On the third of March last, I lost a Tin watering-pot, a wire Sieve, and a Bird-cage, out of my Garden, in <placeName id="t17400416-30-crimeloc181">Castle-street, behind Shoreditch-Church</placeName>

The Garden is walled round, with a Brick-wall nine Foot high, yet we lost Things from thence. Upon missing the Things mentioned in the Indictment, we had them cry'd in eight different Places, and offered a Guinea Reward for them. At last a Gardiner at Bethual-Green gave us some Intelgence of the Things, and we apprehended the Prisoner about a Week after the Robbery; and he acknowledged he stole them all out of the Gardens at several Times. He owned he stole the Watering-pot, the Sieve, and Birdcage, out of my Garden, and had sold them to a Birdcage-maker in Whitechaple ; and according to his Directions I found them there, with a Search-Warrant. I heard him make this Confession the Night he was taken, and also the next Morning before Justice Chandler , at Hoxton ; but he would not sign his Confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was before a Justice before; and I told them of all the Things, and where they were, because they said they would clear me, if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Russell. We have had the Grounds continually robbed, these three Years last past, and have lost Things of 20 Times more Value than these.</p>

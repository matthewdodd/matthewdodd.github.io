I heard a rattle spring at Queenhithe, went towards it, and saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the road parleying with Cornick, and saying, "You b----r, if you come near me you are a dead man"—when he saw me making towards him, he presented the pistol at me, and said, "The first b----r that comes near me is a dead man!"—I said, "Wait a minute, don't be in such a hurry"—he retreated, and placed his back against the wall of Queenhithe Church, saying, "Keep off, you b----rs, or I will shoot you; the first b----r that comes near me I will shoot him"—while his attention was directed to me, Cornick stepped up on one side and struck him a blow with</p>

I was on duty that night—I examined the pistol and found in it two balls, one larger than the other at the bottom of the pistol, and the smallest one and a piece of brown paper at the top—there was a small quantity of powder at the bottom of the pan, so as to have discharged both balls had it gone off—it has a screw barrel, and I found the screw on the prisoner—there was no cap on the pistol when it was gives to me—the cock was down, as if the trigger had been drawn—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner where he lived, and he said in the neighbourhood of Tower-street, but he could not say where—I asked how long he had been in this country—he said about three weeks—he did not say where he came from—I have ascertained that he came from Roscommon, in Ireland, about a month before—he said he had bought the pistol at a shop for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked where—he said he did not know—I asked why he pointed it at the policeman—he said he had been pushed about by the police the night before, and he intended to go and shoot the policeman—there was some gunpowder remaining in the pistol—I put on one of these caps next day and fired it off; it went off very loud.</p>

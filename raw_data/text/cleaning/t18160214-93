            . I am an officer. On the evening of the 12th of January, I was in company with Woodroffe and Barrett. We observed the prisoner Perry in company with another, in Soho. Presently the prisoner Johnson came from Comptonstreet, and joined them; they went through different places, trying various shops, until they came to the prosecutor's. They then walked to and fro before the door. Barret, I, and Woodroffe concealed ourselves. The two prisoners stood outside while the other man went in and brought out something like s copper saucepan; but we could not distinctly see, as we were a considerable distance off. Woodroffe followed that man, and the two prisoners stopped behind. We did not take them then, in hopes that the other man might again join them. The two prisoners walked round Park-lane, and through the square to the prosecutor's house again. After being there some time, both prisoners went into the shop; then they came out; I was standing at the square end of the street, and Woodroffe and Barret at the other end. Before I could get up to them, Barret had got Perry, who had chucked a saucepan away, and was fighting with him. I called him by his name, and told him to be quiet. We did not take Johnson until two days after. He made his escape, and I found him at the Wheatsheaf, Drury-lane. As we followed them, it rained dreadfully, and we were wet through.</p>

            . I am not an officer. On the 12th of last month, I was in company with Johnson and Woodroffe. Knowing the two prisoners and the other man, we followed them. They made several attempts at a number of shops, and when they came to the prosecutor's, they walked to and fro; the account Johnson has given is perfectly correct. I caught Perry with the saucepan. He made great reresistance, but I took him into the shop.</p>

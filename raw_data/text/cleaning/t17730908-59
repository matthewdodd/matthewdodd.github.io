               <p>Mr. James. I am sure the prints are mine; the frame is of a particular kind made by special directions from me; the coat is likewise my property.</p>
               <p>- Wright. I am a broker: the prisoner came to me to know if I would buy any furniture; I said I would if it would answer: the prisoner was dressed like a gentleman, in a green coat, and called himself James; he carried me to the chambers; there was James over the door; he shewed me a card table, and another table, and I bought them. After this he came to me another time in the same dress, and offered to sell a chimney glass, a carpet, and a mahogany table; I bought these things of him in the chambers of Mr. James.</p>

               <p>A man that I know that lately came out of Wales desired me to assist him in disposing of these things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and reside at 6, Crawford-street, Bryanston-square. About two months ago the prisoner came to my house—I did not know him before—he introduced himself as Lord Barnard—he gave a note to the servant, it was put on the mantel-piece—the prisoner came in afterwards—I do not know whether he saw the note—my watch was on the mantel<lb></lb>piece at that time—it was very much out of repair—he said he would get it repaired—I said, "No"—he said he would buy me a new one—he went away soon after, and I believe he took the watch with him—I did not authorize or allow him to take it—I met him about a month afterwards, in Regent-street—I accused him of taking the watch—he said he had done so to get it repaired—I did not call him Lord Barnard—I told him I thought he was a thief—he gave me a note—I have not got it here, I have forgotten both the notes, but I have sent a person for them—his sister brought the watch to my house last Sunday—that was since the prisoner has been in custody—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not try to find the direction of his lordship.</p>

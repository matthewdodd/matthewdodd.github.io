Between four and five o'clock, on the 25th of January, I was on duty in the London-road, and saw the prisoner go into the Prince of Wales public-house, with a great coat on, and this shawl on his neck—I went in and had some beer, and said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, what have you been at?"—he said, "I am driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> now"—I said, "Where is your <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?"—he said, "It is on the stand, I shall take it home"—the great coat was rather dirty, and had a velvet collar.</p>

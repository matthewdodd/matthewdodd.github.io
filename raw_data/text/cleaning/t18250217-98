The lead was stolen from a shed adjoining the house - I locked up the premises between four and five o'clock on the evening of the 20th of December - it was all safe then. A little before six o'clock that evening I heard a noise on the tiles - I went out backwards, and saw two persons on the top of the gutter of the shed, which is covered with lead; I went into the shed; they were still outside, and as I went in a piece of lead fell nearly on me - one of them then came down, and made towards the gate of the yard. I went into the street, and just as I got to the gate I met the prisoner going out: he dropped the lead and his hat: I took him into custody. The lead he had with him weighed about 28 lbs.; it was the same piece as had nearly fallen on me. I put him into William Smith's hands while I fastened the gate - we then went to Hatton-garden. When I came back the gate was opened again, and we suppose the other had escaped. I had seen him some time before, lurking about the premises.</p>

            . I keep a coal-shed near Mr. Ford's; he gave me the prisoner to hold while he got a constable. The prisoner asked me to let him go and get his hat - I took him to a constable, then went back, and found the lead and the bat close by the gate. I went and found a knife on the top of the building; it appeared to have been cutting lead. The lead appeared as if fresh cut. Next morning I went with the officer to compare it with that on the roof; it appeared exactly to correspond. I took a piece off the top of the building, and carried it to the office.</p>

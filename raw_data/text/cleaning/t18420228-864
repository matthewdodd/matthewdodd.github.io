                  </hi>. I was, up to last Monday, a carman, in the employ of Mr. John Reilly, of Maidstone-wharf—I live in Walker-street, Long<lb></lb>acre. On Monday afternoon, the 31st of January, between three and four o'clock, I was at Brook's-wharf-lane, Upper Thames-street, loading a cart' as I was about to leave, I found I was stopped by a cart which was loading at Mr. Leschallas' warehouse, in Brook-wharf-lane—before I noticed the cart standing there, I saw Smith come down the lane with the key, and another man with him—Smith unlocked the door of Mr. Leschallas' warehouse, and went in—after that I saw both the prisoners inside the warehouse—I knew Sheey as being then in the employ of Mr. Leschallas, and Smith as having been in his employ—Sheey was then delivering the goods from the loop<lb></lb>hole of the warehouse to another man in the cart—it was the man who ac<lb></lb>companied Smith to the warehouse—there were four persons there in all—they continued to load the cart till it was overloaded, and it broke the wanty,—the horse was hung up by the collar, and I took hold of the cart to prevent it—Sheey gave me a small piece of rope to make the horse seem (he appeared rather tipsy)—I told him the rope was not strong enough, and I heard Smith speaking to him, as if reproaching him for not exerting himself to get another rope—another man, a brewer, then came up, and wanted to get by—he held the horse, and I ran to my own stable, and got a piece of rope—another man and the brewer made it fast, and it was drawn out—I did not stop to see the prisoners fasten up the warehouse.</p>

            . On the 15th of April, at about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming up <placeName id="t18240603-141-crimeloc757">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18240603-141-crimeloc757" type="placeName" value="Bishopsgate-street"></interp>

I walked on, and as I approached two or three steps (at the <placeName id="t18240603-141-crimeloc758">corner of Angel-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18240603-141-crimeloc758" type="placeName" value="corner of Angel-alley"></interp>

I quickened my pace, and he came before me, then came round behind me, and struck me on the left arm - the blow did not hurt, but numbed my arm, - he snatched my bundle directly, and ran up Angel-alley - it was on my left arm, and contained the articles stated in the indictment. I pursued him, calling Stop thief! but nobody was kind enough to stop him. He took a turning on right of the alley, and at the top of that turning I lost sight of him. He was taken by Liman in a quarter of an hour - I pointed him out myself in the tap-room of the George public-house, which is a few steps from the spot on which I lost sight of him. I am confident he is the person - I charged him with the theft - he denied it - I have not found my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you seen the girl since - A. No; people were passing in the street. I noticed them for about a minute or two. He appeared to lear at me as I passed, which attracted my notice. I thought he meant to insult me, and passed on quickly. I looked at him sufficiently to know him - it was a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening - I am sure of the time - it was not later - I looked at Bishopsgate Church clock - it was then better than ten minutes past seven - I was taking the waistcoats home to a gentleman. The transaction did not occupy above a minute or two. I only looked at him once, when he leared at me - if I notice a person, I can speak to them again - I am confident that he is the man. I may have taken one person for another in the course of my life, but I am confident of him. I described him to Sapswell, the patrol, before I went into the George public-house.</p>

            . I am a constable and patrol of Bishopsgate, On the 15th of April, I was going upon duty, and was told this young woman had been robbed. I found her at Sapswell's door; she described the prisoner to me as a full faced young man, dressed in blue trowsers and coat. I took her to the George public-house - the prisoner was sitting there, leaning over a chair, and the moment she entered she said to him,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with my bundle?" he said</p>
               <p>"Me!" she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are the man who took it, and nobody else;" he said," I have not been out of the house for an hour and a half." I said to the people present,</p>
               <p>"How long has he been here?" nobody present would answer. I went to the bar, and asked a person there in his presence - he said he did not know - I took him to the Mansion House - he told the same story there, and was remanded till Monday, to bring persons to prove it; in which case, the Lord Mayor said, he would not commit him; but nobody came forward.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 28th of June, a little after seven o'clock, I was in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner cross just by Bow-church-yard; he was not exactly in company with the man who has been convicted, but six or eight yards from him; I had some suspicion, and went down Bow-lane, and on turning into Bowchurch-yard I met the prisoner with the basket; I caught at him - he jumped back, and the basket fell against my knee; I did not secure him, but the other man; I have not a doubt of the prisoner being the man who had the basket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say you have no doubt of him? A. None at all; I have seen him before in Smithfield-market, five or six times; I did not see him again till the 19th of July, when he was in the Compter, on another charge; I swear positively to him.(Basket produced and sworn to.)</p>

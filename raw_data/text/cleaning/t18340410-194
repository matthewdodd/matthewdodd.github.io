            . I live opposite the prosecutor's shop. On the 27th of March I was cleaning my mistress's window - I saw the prisoner and another boy against the Jew's Hospital gate - they stood there about five minutes- they then went past the prosecutor's window, and came back again - the other boy then left the prisoner and went and stood against a butcher's shop - the prisoner went and stood against the prosecutor's door for two or three minutes - he then went in and went round the counter - he came out with his apron full of something, and went up White Horse-lane.</p>
               <p>MARK MOUNTAIN. I keep the shop, but I was then confined to my bed - I lost the shoes mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>MARTHA PETIT. The prisoner told me he had sold one pair for half-a-crown, and he had confessed it to his aunt first - I made him no promise.</p>

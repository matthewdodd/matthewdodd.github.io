                  </hi>I keep the Red Lion public-house, Wilson<lb></lb>street, St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On Sunday night, May 10, I went up to my bed-room a little after ten o'clock, in consequence of my wife com<lb></lb>ing down and telling me something, I found the window thrown open—I bad been in the room that afternoon—I had a chest of drawers in the room, and on it laid a saucer with some fourpenny pieces in it—here are fifteen fourpenny pieces and a brace-button—I had the fourpenny pieces in the saucer on tbe drawers that night, and I believe this brace-button was in the saucer with the fourpenny pieces that night—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—we have two empty houses adjoining ours—a man could get in at the window from the adjoining house—when I went up stairs the fourpenny pieces and button were gone—I came down, went to the first empty house, and found the door fastened inside—I tried the other one, and by turning the handle I got in—I held the handle for one or two minutes, and then somebody wanted to come out—I held the handle fast till a policeman came along—I spoke to him—he went in and brought the prisoner up—he was searched in my presence, and two crow-bars and a dark lantern were found on him, and a box of matches—I asked him if he had not some fourpenny pieces—he said he had not—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out six or seven, and said he had got no more—the policeman then found on him fif<lb></lb>teen in all, and the button—there were from fifteen to seventeen fourpenny pieces in the saucer—there was a mark on the drawers which corresponded with one of the crow-bars.</p>

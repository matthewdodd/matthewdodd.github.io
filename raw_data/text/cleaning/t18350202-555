                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Old Broad-street, in the parish of St. Peter-le-Poor, in the City. On Tuesday afternoon, the 27th of January, I left my shop about four o'clock—I rent the wholehouse—it is my dwelling-house but I let out part as offices—I returned about twenty minutes or half-past four o'clock, and observed the prisoner Lock in the middle of my shop, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020089"></xptr>
               <p>is the darkest part of the shop—it was quite daylight—I went into the shop, and Lock retired to the head of the cellar stairs—it was darker there than where I first saw him—I said, "Who is there?"—he made no reply—I repeated the question again, and said, "What do you want? come out, and let me see what you are like"—after some hesitation, I saw him take two bars of solder out of his left hand breeches pocket, and put them down by his side against the cellar stairs—he then came to me, at I stood in the middle of the shop—I saw two more bars of solder in his right hand breeches pocket—I asked him what business he had there—he said he had been to ease himself, and shrunk his shoulders up as if he was ill—I said, "It appears you came to load yourself instead of easing your<lb></lb>self"—I took him towards the shop door, then collared him, and drew the two bars of solder out of his pocket—he then began begging for mercy and said one of my men bad given him the solder—I said he was one of a gang which infested plumbers' shops, and I would make an example of him and give him in charge—I had about 12cwt. of solder in a pile in my shop, and from that pile I missed about 1cwt., which is six casts—a cast is four bars together—I went into the cellar, and found Crawder concealed in the dust-bin, and observed some solder bars there—that was not the place they should have been in—I kept some of my solder in the counting-house, but never kept any in the cellar—Crowder worked for me last summer—I lost more solder than I found, either in the cellar or on Lock—feeling it could not all be taken at one time by one man, mode me look in the cellar—I found three casts close to where Crowder was concealed in the cellar—the solder found is mine.</p>

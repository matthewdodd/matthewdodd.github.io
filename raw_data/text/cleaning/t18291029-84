            . I am an officer. On the Saturday after the robbery I had a man at the office, and as I was going along I saw the prisoner and a boy with a bundle in his hand; the prisoner said to me, "What has become of the man?" I said, "He is ordered for re-examination:" I then said to the boy, "Where did you get this bundle?" he said first his mother gave it him, and then he said the prisoner gave it him - I took the boy, and went into the office; the prosecutrix there claimed the property: I went out again, and took the prisoner - she had then parted with a child which she had had in her hand, and hid herself in a field.</p>

As I came out of the shop, I saw three men standing there - one of them snatched my bundle, and was gone in a moment; one of the others ran after him. The prisoner held me fast while the others got away - he held me full two or three minutes; it was moon-light, and the lamps were lit; I screamed out for assistance, and he ran towards the others, but was stopped before I lost sight of him - I am certain of him. My bundle was produced in a few minutes; it had been picked up in the direction they ran.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I heard a young woman scream out, and ran to her - she said,</p>
               <p>"They have got my bundle, there he goes, that is him." The other two ran up Chigwell-hill, and the prisoner ran up by the dock wall, and took to the left. I secured him; she immediately said he was the man who held her. I went to Chigwell-hill, and picked up the bundle. The linen belonged to a Captain, and was given up to him. I asked how he came there, he said he went on an errand from his master, Mr. Ward, French-alley, Goswell-street, and afterwards said he went on his own pleasure.</p>

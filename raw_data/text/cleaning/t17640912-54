               <p>Buckee. I saw the watch and gold ring that very morning on the dressing-table, when I got up. My wife came to me, where I am in partnership, and told me the girl was gone away, and had taken a bag of money with her: when I came home, I found she had robbed me of these things: after that, my wife found she had taken several of her wearing apparel, which I have not laid in the indictment. I went to Goldsmiths-hall, and had some bills distributed; and we have recovered the plate and all the things again: the plate was found in the prisoner's lodging. ( The plate produced and deposed to.)</p>

I took her on Saffron-hill; she confessed she had robbed her master; she had this ring upon her finger; she gave it to me; she had the spoon about her: she stripped herself, and pulled off her mistress's gown, and put on a gown of her own; then she told me where she lodged; there I found the plate: it was in Tash-street, Gray's-Inn Lane.</p>

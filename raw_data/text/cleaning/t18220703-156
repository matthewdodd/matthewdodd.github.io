            . The prisoner lodged at my house, from the 4th of March to the 22d of May, on which day he had agreed to pay me all he owed, which was 2 l. 11 s.; he said he should be ready with his attorney, at eleven o'clock, to settle it; but he went out in the morning, and never returned. I broke his door open four days after, and missed the articles enumerated in the indictment, which were let to him with the room; some feathers were gone out of the bed.</p>

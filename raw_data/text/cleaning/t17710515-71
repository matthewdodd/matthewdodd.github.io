               <p>Q. What time did you go together?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I did not tell Murphy of my intention till I came to the house; then I bid him wait at the chapel: he said he did not like it, but he would do as I bid him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get in?</p>
               <p>Jameson. We forced the kitchen windows open.</p>

               <p>Jameson. Yes, he said he thought I never intended to come out of the house; he thought I had been taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long he waited for you?</p>
               <p>Jameson. He said he waited half an hour for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Murphy any of the goods?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave him some of them to take care of for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he no share in the plunder?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave him half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this trunk was yours that had these choice things at the Hole in the Wall?</p>
               <p>Jameson. No; it belonged to Murphy; I gave them to Murphy to take care of, and he locked them up in his trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never a trunk of your own?</p>
               <p>Jameson. I gave them to him at the time Mr. Stevenson's things came into the room.</p>

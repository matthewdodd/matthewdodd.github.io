                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Smith, a cutler, in King William-street, London-bridge. On the 9th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, (I think after the gas was lighted,) the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a tooth-pick—he was not dressed as he is now—I showed</p>

               <p>him a tray full—he chose one, and gave me a sovereign—I gave him half-sovereign and eight shillings change—he had said nothing about the price—he examined the change, and said, "Do you charge me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? I never paid more than 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price; we never sold them for less—he said, "I will not have it—give me my sovereign"—I did so, and he put down on the glass what I supposed to be the change I had given him, and left the shop in haste—I looked at the change directly, and found a gilt sixpence had been substituted for the half-sovereign—I am certain I had given him a half-sovereign, I had looked at it—I went to the door to look after him, but could not see him—I put the coin at the back of the till, in a compartment which had no money in it—it remained there till about the 30th of March, when I took it out, marked it, and put it into my pocket—I am certain it remained there till I took it out—I had not marked it before—I know it to be the same—I took so much notice of it, and the place where I put it was never opened only on certain occasions—there was no other money in that part of the till—the till is under my control—there is no key to it—Mr. and Miss Smith had access to it, no-body else—I had received one counterfeit half-sovereign once before, but on the 9th of February I had none in my possession but this—it has been in my pocket, in a piece of paper, ever since the 30th of March, and I can swear it is the same.</p>

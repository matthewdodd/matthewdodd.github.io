               <p>I was out of the shop when the prisoners came in; I came in while they were in the shop; I was in doors about five minutes; then I was sent out; the prisoners went out first; Mr. Harding sent me out to bring the prisoners back; I suspected they would take something, and I looked strictly to them; I observed a bustle, but could not see them take any thing; I looked as strictly as I possibly could; I follow- them; when I stopped the prisoners, they were just above Ely-place, on the other side of the way, about two hundred yards from our house; I went up to the prisoner Johnson, and told her, I was persuaded she had something about her that was not her own property; she immediately told me if I supposed so, she would go back with me; she immediately turned back; I observed her to put her hand into her pocket hole as she went in at the shop door; I desired her to walk into the back shop; she went forward till she went into the middle shop where she had been looking at these goods; she immediately made a stop and said, look here, may be the goods are here; and she attempted to pull some of the goods off the counter, and drop this by them; I desired her to walk forward, and she dropped the goods from her lost side; I took them from the side of her left leg; I saw them drop, and took them from her quite warm; I saw them slip down from the side of her petticoat; they were standing under her petticoat when I took them up.</p>
               <p>Do you swear you saw them drop from under her petticoat? - I saw them drop, and took them up immediately as she was endeavouring to get away from me.</p>
               <p>Did you or not see them drop from her petticoat? - I saw them drop under her petticoat, and took them up immediately.</p>
               <p>Did you see them drop from the lower edge of her petticoat or not? - I saw the end of them below the edge of her petticoat; I saw them drop; I observed they were warm.</p>
               <p>Supposing they had not been warm, should you have been certain they had dropped from under her coats? - I took them standing up under her coats.</p>
               <p>Whether were they in a package or loose? - They were loose.</p>
               <p>Then how could they stand up against her legs? - They were just as they are now, not in a package.</p>
               <p>Who else were in the shop besides you and Hardy? - There was another young man in the shop; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Why not? - He did not see any thing of it.</p>

               <p>You could not see them drop through the petticoat? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not to go up to the woman at that time? - It is what we never do; I did not know but what they might have bought something; it did not strike me so go up to the woman.</p>

               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. On the 13th of October, I was employed to watch at the door of the prosecutors,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250024"></xptr>on account of a suspicion which was entertained against the prisoner; he came out of the shop at about ten minutes past seven; he went into the Sugar Loaf public house; I went in after him; he remained there ten minutes; he never was out of my sight. When he came out, I stopped him at the end of White Lyon street, I told him we suspected he had something about him what he ought not to have; we then took him into a public house, and in his coat pocket we found about a pound of ginger, loose, and about two pounds three quarters of currants in one breeches pocket, and the other was clammy and sticky, as in something of the same kind had been in that. He described his house as No. 8, Crabtree row, Bethnal Green; we went there, and found a quantity of candles, twine, sugar, a great quantity of sacking, and a sack, marked 4788; the twine and sugar were up stairs; the candles were part hanging up, and part concealed.</p>

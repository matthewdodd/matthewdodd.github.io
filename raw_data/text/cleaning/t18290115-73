            . I am a watchman of St. George's, Middlesex. On the 1st of January, I fell in with the two prisoners, in Wapping-street, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, in company - Donald was carrying this box; I asked where they brought it from, and where they were going - Donald said he did not know exactly where he was going, but that he brought it from Cherry-garden stairs; I said "I must take you into custody:" he said I might do as I liked about that; he then said he found it at the corner of Hermitage-street: Cockfield also said they had found it - I took them to the watch-house, and found the prsoecutrix - it had not then been opened, but the prosecutrix produced the key the next morning.</p>
               <p>DONALD'S Defence. We had been drinking with two shipmates, and came home at twelve o'clock, and then went out again to go to another house; in coming home, I saw this box in Burr-street, and a sailor standing by it:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150034"></xptr>I had taken a glass or two, and I asked the man what he had got - I could not make out what he said; he then went away, so we took up the box, and went to our own door, but could not get in; I then took the box to a young woman's mother, where I thought we could get a lodging.</p>

The first time I saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, was on the 23d of March last. About nine o'clock in the evening, I was leaning upon the bar-door, he said, Mr. Bulkley, how do you do? ( he was dress'd in the manner he is now) I said, Sir, I beg your pardon, you have the advantage of me, I do not recollect you; said he, Don't you know Capt. Johnson? I have been out of the kingdom three or four years, and now you don't know me! Said I, I am glad to see you well. He said, Shall we not drink together? I came from Portsmouth this morning, and am just got out of a post-chaise; and I am obligd to go off to-morrow morning on his majesty's business. I asked him after some people at Portsmouth, and Godalming; he said, he knew them extremely well. He said, Well, Bulkley, I am going up to Mr Clevland, and here is about three thousand pounds worth of notes. that I must deliver to him; let me have a few shillings, and I'll call to-morrow morning, and pay you; and if you have any demands to Godalming, or Portsmouth, I'll deliver them. I let him have six shillings. After that, I read an advertisement from Mr. Fielding, of such a person, that had defrauded several people; I went to Mr. Fielding's; I found he had defrauded Mr. Parker, who keeps t he Globe tavern, in the Strand, in the same way, and he happened to see him afterwards, and laid hold on him, and charged a constable with him. When I was at the justice's, I think there were about thirty-two of our business, that keep taverns and coffee houses, that he had served the same; and when he was committed, there were ten detainers against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what did you give him credit?</p>
               <p>Bulkley. Upon his saying he came from Portsmouth, and calling me by my name, and producing a book with a large parcel of papers; saying, there were about 300 l. that he was to receive in the Navy-office.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. In what manner did you grant me the money? Or whether ever I left London, or offered to defraud or dissemble with any man or woman in London? Did I speak any thing, but what I spoke openly at the bar? Or did I call you aside?</p>
               <p>Bulkley. I was standing at the bar; it was all done in a quarter of an hour, he was in such a hurry, and so fatigued, he pretended, just getting out of a post-chaise, and expecting the ship to sail the next morning. All these pretences appear'd to me as realities; upon which, I lent him the money. There were two mariners at the justice's, that knew him; they said, he once was before the mast, but never any thing else.</p>

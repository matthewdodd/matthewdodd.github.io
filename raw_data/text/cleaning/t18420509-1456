About four o'clock on Friday, the 15th of April, I was in the shop—Lawrence came in, and requested to look at some watches, I showed him some—he selected four—I showed him some chains also—he selected four chains also—I put the watches in a small bag, and tied the chains up in paper—I was about to pack them altogether in brown paper, when he produced a box, and wished to have them put into it—after they were packed up, Lawrence went out of the shop—he returned, and two or three minutes afterwards Wasserman came in—he asked for a 1. brooch, which was marked in the window—I turned to get the brooch down, and while Wasserman was paying for the brooch, Lawrence got up, and went out—immediately Wasserman had paid for the brooch, be got up, and went out also—I opened the box, and found the box produced had been substituted for the one the watches had been put into—I ran out immediately, and secured Wasserman, brought him back to the shop, and gave him into the custody of an officer—on the Monday following Lawrence was brought to our shop—some copper coins were substituted in the other box, in place of the four watches and chains—the value of the watches is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the guards 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw them safe just before Wasserman came in—the boxes must have been changed while I was taking the brooch down—I did not see them changed—the prisoners did not appear to know each other—about two minutes after Wasserman had gone, I saw that some<lb></lb>thing was wrong—no one had been in but the prisoners—when I took Wasserman I told him I wanted him—he asked what for—I said he must inquire of some one else—I called for an officer, and gave him into custody—I am sure the prisoners are the two men that came in on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, in Leadenhall-street. These watches are mine—in consequence of information I went to the police-station in Bishopsgate-street—I there found Wasserman in custody—I told him I strongly suspected him of being a party concerned in taking my property, but if he could show me who he was, and could send to any respectable person to give him a character, I should not press the charge against him—he immediately said he could, and threatened me in a manner I did not approve of, about his solicitor bringing an action against me if I did keep him in charge—he sent for Mr. Pringle, a grocer, in Bishopsgate-street, a respectable man—Mr. Pringle came, and said he knew nothing more than that he was an accidental customer, and he could not say any thing to him—I then gave him into custody—he was immediately searched, and on him was found some foreign coins, some sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—I compared the coins found on him with the coins found in the box, and one of them corresponded with some of the coins found in the box—I then asked. him if he knew of any other individual, and asked his address—he said he did, a very respectable wine-merchant, Mr. Squeerbanks, 84, Old Compton-street—he said he lodged at No. 32; Old Compton-street, at Mr; Lyas's—we proceeded to his lodging, and we found that he did lodge there—it is a coffee-shop—I made inquiries of the coffee-shop keeper—I then went to Mr. Squeerbank's, and could learn nothing satisfactory res<lb></lb>pecting him—the next morning he was brought to the Mansion-house—he was examined there, and a memorandum was found in his pocket-book—in consequence of that I went to Messrs. Caldecot and Company, and found Wasserman had been there—it was addressed to Mr. Lawrence, No. 1, Curzon-street, May-fair—the property has never been found.</p>

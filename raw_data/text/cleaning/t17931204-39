               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, in Shoreditch, facing my own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the prosecutor's house? - Four or five hundred yards, or better; I found on him this pewter, that I have got; he had got it in a pail, which they usually take to get their yeast in, it was all cut to pieces as it is now. I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at the time you took him? - Afterwards I had; I took him about two o'clock, or half after, last Saturday; while I was sitting in the public house with him, because the magistrate was gone to dinner, says he, I will give you a guinea, if you will let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you foolish enough to make him any promise? - No, I threatened him, that he should see the face of the justice before I could do any thing. He said, the pewter was his own, and if I would take the pewter and the guinea, I might let him go; I did not chuse to do that, but I took him before a justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Oh, your honour! that is as big a falsity as ever was spoke; what a lying old man that must be.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Miles, and have been many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his pewter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it, if you was to see it again? Look at that pewter, and tell the gentlemen of the jury, whether you know it? - I have looked at it before, and I have compared it with Mr. Miles's other plates, and from what knowledge I have of it. I think it is my master's property to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a rim of a pewter dish, have you seen that? - I have, and think it belongs to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the plates again? - I think it is my master's property; I have cut out on them so long, and there is the same mark on some of the plates, as on my master's plates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master lose any property to the number of those that were found in this man's pail? - We have lost a good many, but how many I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live in your master's service? - About a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was all the property lost in that fortnight or three weeks? - All that we know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the dish that the rim belonged to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would be glad to know, if they lost none, but in this fortnight or three weeks; because I lived there about two years and three quarters before, and then, while I was there, they were always losing plates. Mr. Miles has trusted me with many a twenty and thirty pound note to change. I might as well have robbed him of plate as pewter; I have been in London these twenty-five years; I have been a master and journeyman, I have never been summoned in a riot, arrested, nor served with a warrant, nor any thing these twenty-five years. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040098"></xptr>lived with Mr. Miles, two years and three quarters ago, for six or seven months, and Mr. Miles cannot say any thing against me; I have been a master for myself; and this is some old pewter that I had left.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any man that is a proprietor of pewter, break it all to pieces? - I meant to sell it; the value of it was not above two or three shillings; it is very hard to prosecute such an old man as me, when I have saved him thirty or forty pounds in flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Miles? - He keeps a private mad-house.</p>

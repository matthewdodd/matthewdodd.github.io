The prisoner said I was not worth 5s. - I took my three 1l. bank notes out of my pocket, and said, "Will that pay 5s.?" and put them back into my right-hand waistcoat-pocket. I left the company, and went and sat on the other side of the tap-room. I had not sat there above a minute, before the prisoner came over and sat on my left side, then shifted to my right-and said, "Well old man, will you give me a drop of beer;" I said, "I have none to give away." He took up the pot and drank, and then knocked my pipe out of my mouth; as I stooped down to look for it, I found his hand in my pocket - He said he would light me to find my pipe. While he was looking down, the notes fell out of his hand-he picked them up, and went out immediately. I could not stop him; I am sure his hand was in my pocket. I saw no more of him till the 17th of August, when he was taken.</p>

The prisoner and another man were quarrelling about their servitude, and were going to make a bet of 5s.; the prosecutor pulled out three 1l. bank notes - He got up and sat on the same side as I was.

I was in the house, the prosecutor and a soldier were talking about who had seen the most service, and were going to lay 5s.; the prosecutor pulled out three 1l. bank notes, put them into his waistcoat-pocket, and moved to another box-the prisoner followed him. The prisoner broke his pipe; and as he stooped to pick it up, I saw the notes in the prisoner's hand. He immediately left the house without saying a word. The prosecutor said he had lost his money.</p>

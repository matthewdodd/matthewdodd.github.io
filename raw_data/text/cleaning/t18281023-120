On the 15th of September, about two or three o'clock, I missed a mahogany dumb-waiter from my door; I had seen it about ten o'clock that day - I made inquiries, and told the porters to look about; I received information that there was such an article at the door of a shop opposite the reservoir - I went there, and got it.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Marshall's on the 13th of October, and there I found the prisoner offering another article for sale; I took him to the watch-house - he said the waiter belonged to his brother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not steal it from the door. I called at a public-house; a porter came in and said, "I have got an article to dispose of, which I bought where I was in possession, and it was not down in the inventory;" I said I would try to sell it for him - I went to Mr. Marshall's, and sold it him - I brought the money to the man, who gave me 1s.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DONALDSON re-examined. Q. When did you loose it? A. On the 15th, and on the 18th I went to the shop, and saw it, I told him if he should see the man, I would prosecute him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 18, Hunter street—I have a surgery attached to my house on the ground-floor in East Compton-street, in the parish of St. Pancras. On the night of 27th Jan. I was the last person up—I west into the surgery and observed that all was right there—I saw the window was closed with three fastenings, one at each side, and one in the middle, closing with a spring—the shutters push up in three parts, one above another—the two upper ones were up, the other was down—a Venetian blind falls between the window and the shutters—the window appeared to be fastened as usual—I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and was called up about four in the morning—I made an examination with Sergeant Boardman, and missed from the shop the till, which had about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I found the surgery shutters disarranged, the house was broken open, and the property mentioned in the indictment was gone—the prisoner John Phillips was is my service as errand-boy—he came as usual at eight o'clock in the morning, and I observed to him that a robbery had been committed—I sent him for a policeman, and gave him into his custody—the policeman asked him when he slept that night, and he said, with his brother—he did not say where that was.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prosecutor's wife. I had a work<lb></lb>box up-stairs with some money in it, among which were several new shillings, dated 1845 and 1846—these coins found on Jackson are <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much like those I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jackson. Q.</hi> Are they yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief—I cannot swear to them, but I had some of that date.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">George Phillips's Defence.</hi> The policeman swears I lived in this house where the property was found, and the landlady was before the Magistrate and stated there were a quantity of <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> came to see two females; she was then asked whether she had seen me; she said once, and that was that day week, and she had not seen me since; Harris has known me for some time; he has warned me several times for different things; he threatened he would have me whether he could get me or not; I have been doing the best to get my living; I did not say I would give myself up to acquit the two <hi rend="italic">dolls; I</hi> told him I knew nothing of the case; I did not live with either of the girls; 1 lived at West<lb></lb>minster till the day I was taken; I never slept at the house a whole night, since I knew the females.</p>

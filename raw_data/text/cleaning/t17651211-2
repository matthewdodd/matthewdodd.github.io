            . The prisoner came to me on the 13th of last month, where I live, in Hungerford market, and desired me to carry some bottles for him: he sent me down, and said there were three prittle baskets, the farthest of them was his. He did not go quite to them, I went and took them up; Mr. Hounsworth helped me up with them. I went to the prisoner, he led me through Church court and Round court, and into Southampton-street, where I had a fall with them, and several were broke; he swore at me and helped me up with them. I carried them to a pitching-place at the corner of White Horse lane, there he gave me three-pence, and I left him and them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge. After they were missing, Mr. Hounsworth informed the porter of me, and they came to me, and I went with them to the house of Mr. Hoy, where the basket and bottles were found.</p>

(a basket and bottles produced.) These are the same. After that, Mr. Watts's man, name Grant, came and owned them.</p>

            . I am one of Mr. Watts's porters. There was a prittle basket with six dozen bottles of our master's lost from Black-lion stairs; I came with them there in the boat, so did the prisoner: they were missing about 3 in the afternoon on the 13th of November; while I went with some to Albemarle-street, they were taken away from the landing place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any one in the care of them?</p>
               <p>Grant. No, I did not, it is not usual so to do. Mr. Hounsworth told me a porter that lives in Hungerford market, had carried them away; we went and found Wilkins, who went with us, and we found the prittle and these bottles at Mr. Hoy's (here produced) I know the basket to be the property of our master, and the bottles also, there being none like them made nay where else in London.</p>

               <p>I was at Bow-street when these men were brought in; a person came to me, and gave me information, and I took this waistcoat off M'Cauley, at Bow-street, and this coat I took off Ridge; I never saw Shaw or M'Cauley in my life, I am not the apprehender of any one of them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my coat and waistcoat, and all these things; they were on the counter a few minutes before I got up, I am sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>PRISONER RIDGE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been seeking for work, and could not get any, I saw some men coming over Hounslow Heath, and they asked me if I had lost a jack-ass; they gave me a jack-ass, loaded with hampers, and they desired me to take and find an owner for it, so I drove it along, and I overtook this lad; the waistcoat and coat were at top; it rained, and I took the coat and put it on to keep off the rain; before I came to Acton, I overtook the other prisoners, and when we came to Acton, we were stopped, the man came to the jack-ass, and owned it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BAKER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to Brentford, my father was extremely ill; I went with two of the other prisoners, I arrived there the Friday afternoon, I slept at the Bull, and got up about four in the morning, I was very ill, and came to Town, and I met these men, and this boy, driving a jack-ass and hampers; he asked what it was o'clock, it was past five; he said, which road are you going? I said, towards Acton to go home; then I went into the Red Lion, to get a pot of beer, and some bread and cheese, we came out, and Mr. Cole stopped us.</p>
               <p>PRISONER M'CAULEY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I got up to go to work about three in the morning; I went to the Bull, at Hounslow; I could not find my aunt's, and the man overtook me; says he, here is a jackass strolling along, it was the gentleman in blue, that overtook me; but it rained, and he said, as it rains, we may as well put on these things; so I put on the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Acton from Brentford? - Rather better than three miles.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Did any conversation pass about this business? - They owned one ass; Ridge owned that which was loaded, but not the others.</p>
               <p>Did the others take any part? - Two of them tried to make their escape; that was Shaw, and Baker (the boy), they were all together, before I overtook them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Lloyd called two witnesses to his character.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Eastcheap. I saw the prosecutor pass my door, and three young lads together, following him - the prisoner was one of them; my house is right opposite the weigh-house; I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and pull out a handkerchief - the other two were with him; I have seen one of them in the press-yard, while waiting here; I ran up to Mr. Hoskins and told him to follow me- the prisoner ran across the road to St. Mary-at-hill, a different way from the others - he ran fast - I called Stop thief! he threw the handkerchief out of his cap, and was stopped by Hoskins; I only lost sight of him for a moment, and am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>- Doncastle. I was present at the taking of the prisoner. He was so resolute he would not be examined; we were obliged to tie his hands and legs, we laid him down and I lay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130048"></xptr> upon him: I searched his right hand pockets and Squires his left, Squires shewed me the watch.</p>

            . On the 10th of March I was coming from the Exchange, and just before I came to <placeName id="t17600416-15-crimeloc95">St. Paul's Churchyard</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Axford. It was near three o'clock. I look'd over my shoulder, and saw the prisoner at the bar. I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had lost nothing at that time. I walk'd on into the churchyard, where I look'd back, and finding he followed me I thought I would stay and see a little of his performances. I stop'd at a print shop, and he came and fix'd himself at the rails of St. Paul's, where he made his observation (seemingly) whose pocket he could play upon best. I saw him eye other people's pockets as well as mine. He came up by me after he had stood there a minute or two, first on my left hand and then on my right. I observed his motions, altho' I looked earnestly at the prints; my handkerchief was then in my pocket. After he was behind me a little while he went away, and then I found my handkerchief was gone. I went after him and took him by the shoulder, saying, Now I have you. He then drop'd the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he gone from you?</p>
               <p>Axford. Not above three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he drop'd it?</p>
               <p>Axford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Axford. I can't swear I felt his hand in my pocket, tho' so intent on observing him ( the handkerchief produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

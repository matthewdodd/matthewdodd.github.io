                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and lodge on Garlic-hill. On the 5th of April I was in St. Martin's-place, looking at some soldiers—Obbard gave me information—I examined my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which I had safe about ten minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news-vender, and live at Westminster. About half-past eleven o'clock I was looking at the soldiers, near Charing-cross, and saw the prisoners together for about three or four minutes—I saw Asbury put his hand into Metcalf's pocket, pull out a handkerchief, wipe his face with it, and then drop it on the ground—I saw Greenslade standing by his side, holding his coat over him to conceal it—Metcalf came out of the crowd—I asked if he had lost his handkerchief, and he missed it—the prisoner were secured—they stood still, and did not attempt to go off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live in Denmark-terrace, Camberwell. I was at the back of the National Gallery, and saw Greenslade going along—he made two attempts at two gentlemen's pockets, which caused my suspicion—I saw a constable close by, and told him what I suspected—immediately after, when I got to St. George's barracks I saw them go behind the prosecutor, and keep close behind him—Asbury took a handkerchief, as I thought—I saw him put his hand close to the pocket, but did not see him take it out, as I was behind Greenslade, who stood close to him, and held his coat out to conceal him.</p>

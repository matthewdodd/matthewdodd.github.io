               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure those were his words, that it was all right, and he had left it at the banking-house? A. Yes; he did not say it was not all right, but he would explain it to Mr. Parsons - the prosecutor was indited to drink a little more than he ought somtimes - he was sober the day he gave this money out, and the day following, I think; I never heard Mr. Parsons tell him he might purchase some clothes, as he looked very ragged and distressed, and I am sure it was never intended - the prisoner staid away two or three days, which excited suspicion, and when he came he was very much intoxicated; the last day he came was Thursday - he breakfasted with Mr. Parsons; he did take up the bill for 18l. - I do not know of his being at any races, where he was knocked down and ill-used, nor did I hear him mention it.</p>

On Thursday, the 28th of July last, I was at Marylebone Police-office for a beach of the peace, and I saw the prisoner there, employed writing at the desk - on the same evening,I I went to the watch-house again, to inquire of Mr. Lazenby, the superintendant, if he could recommend me a person as a clerk; I saw the prisoner, and I told him I wanted to see Mr. Lezenby, and the purpose I wanted him for - the prisoner said," Why Sir, I have got a good deal of leisure time upon my hands, and I think I could do what you want very well;" I said very well, he might come into my service - the prisoner came to my house; I placed him in my counting-house, and put him to his duty - I proposed that he should dine at my table, thinking him to be a respoectable person, from him being empolyed in Mr. Lazenby's office; while at dinner, on Wednesday last, (I think,) the prisoner was with me, I desired my housekeeper to bring some money down stairs, for the prisoner to go and take up two bills, one for 18l. odd, and the other for 50l., at Messrs.

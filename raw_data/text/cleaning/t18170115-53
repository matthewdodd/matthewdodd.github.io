The prisoners lodged in the back room, which is parted from mine by a lath and plaister wall. On the 4th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, I and my wife went to Paddington. I locked my door with a common lock, and a padlock. I returned about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of January, I found the door-lock had been picked, and the padlock forced; I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment, they are worth 5l. The next day I found some of my things at two different houses in Great St. Andrew-street.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the afternoon of the 6th of January, I examined Gates's room; there was a great deal of crockery on his bed, and a hole burnt through the door, apparently with a thick wire. I found the wall broke down, and the lock forced. I waited all night, but the prisoners did not come home. The next morning I went out with Gates, we found a picture and a milk-pot at Mrs. Yate's, in Great St. Andrew-street, which he claimed; we found some more things at Mrs. Gray's. In the afternoon I found Gates had got the prisoner,

            . I afterwards took the other prisoner at a coffee-shop in St. Giles's. He told me that he had sold the things in Great St. Andrew-street. I then went into the prisoner's room, and found a piece of black silk which the prosecutor's wife claimed; there was a large hole in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150021"></xptr>the wall which would admit a hand through, it had a piece of carpet hung over it. I also found a piece of iron which had been in the fire, and fitted the hole in the door.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am constable of St. Giles's. I went to Mrs. Yates' house with a search-warrant, and found some mugs, and knives, and forks; she sent me to Norfelk-alley, to her aunt's, and I found some cups and books there. I afterwards went to Morrit's, and found some more things.</p>
               <p>SUSAN YATES. I keep an old iron-shop. On the 6th of January, a young man sold me the things; he said they were his mother's, and that she was going out to service. I gave him 5s. for all the things; he had more things with him. I do not know the man. I live in Great St. Andrew-street. I bought some things on the 6th of January of a man, who brought them in a bag. I do not think it was either of the prisoners.</p>

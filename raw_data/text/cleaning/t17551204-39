               <p>Death. It was produced to the prisoner at the bar and his clerk.</p>

               <p>C. for Prisoner. Did you acquaint Mr. Grierson there was a father?</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they married?</p>
               <p>Sevane. At the Savoy chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Who married them?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, by what I can recollect of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now, and tell us as well as you can?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I think it was him.</p>

               <p>Sevane. She lived in the parish of St. Anns.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Savoy chapel in the parish of Covent Garden?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I don't know what parish that is in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any questions asked about consent?</p>
               <p>Sevane. Yes, there was. The last evidence and I, the night before the marriage, had heard the mother say her daughter was at liberty to marry whom she pleased. I believe she had made some endeavours to persuade her against the marriage before that; but she said her daughter was at her liberty, and the daughter called the last evidence and I in, to hear her mother say that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040049"></xptr>Q. Where was the father?</p>
               <p>Sevane. The father and mother did not live together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the father's opinion at that time?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I never heard the father's opinion before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you heard of it since?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I have heard since that he disapproves of the marriage. The mother said to us, you may tell the parson that marries them he never will be troubled by any of our family.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. You say you was present at this marriage?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the minister refuse to marry them till he heard of the consent?</p>
               <p>Sevane. He did. We told him what the mother had said, and he said, he thought that consent was not sufficient, but if we had it signed by the mother, that he took to be sufficient; and upon that he married them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by her of having authority from her husband?</p>
               <p>Sevane. She said we might assure the parson that married them that none of her family would trouble him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand by that declaration that there was the consent of the father as well as the mother?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I imagined there was a kind of an understanding between the mother and father.</p>
               <p>Q. How an understanding?</p>
               <p>Sevane. That she spoke from what she had heard the father say.</p>

               <p>Q. to Sevane. Was there either, can you tell?</p>
               <p>Sevane. There was a kind of a licence, but I don't know what that was; it was something upon parchment, and the vacancies were filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Filled up by whom?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I believe by the clerk.</p>

I did not knowingly do it to offend against the laws, of my country; it is not probable I should do such a thing knowingly when I married my own son there.

             by licence, 1687. Here is a great many by publication of banns, and some by licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you still continue putting them down in this manner?</p>
               <p>Philips. We do, but do it more perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see in any register any alteration, where it was by a different licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I think I have seen two instances, one by licence from the archbishop of Canterbury, and the other from the bishop of London; all the other licences are by the minister of the Savoy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you thought you was aiding and assisting in any fact contrary to act of parliament, when you assisted in these marriages?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I did not. I thought them good licences.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you ever knew any jurisdiction as to the bishops of London or Canterbury to be exercised in this chapel ?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I never.</p>

               <p>Philips. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what light did you look upon it?</p>
               <p>Philips. I look'd upon it that the minister himself was ordinary, and sufficient to grant licences.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the form of your licences?</p>

            , '' ordinary and minister.'' (He produced a licence on parchment.)</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. What is that?</p>
               <p>Philips. This is the licence the pair were married with.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Was that fill'd up before they were married ?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Was it sign'd by Wilkerson before it was fill'd up, or after ?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was before it was fill'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the marriage of Vernham ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I do. I remember it was very remarkable. Vernham and miss Porteir came three or four days running, and desired to be married; they were refused because she was something under age. They could not be married unless she had her friends consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Who refused it?</p>
               <p>Philips. Mr. Grierson and I did. The last day they came, they brought two gentlemen along with them (who have been sworn ) to facilitate the marriage. She said she had a father, but her father and mother had been parted several years; but she said, as for me my father does not care if I go to the devil. We said you must have the consent of them, or else you must not be married. Then Mr. Death and the other gentleman went to the mother with a paper; for miss said she would never go home till they were married; and upon this the two gentlemen returned, and produced the mother's consent, and they both testified it, and said they saw the mother sign it; and we made them sign their names and places of abode. Then we fill'd up the licence, and they assented to every part contain'd there. The one declared himself a batchelor, the other a single woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you don't think Mr. Grierson used such caution for fear of offending against an act of parliament?</p>
               <p>Philips. He was very cautious.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you beleive that to be a good licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did believe it to be as good a licence as any from the archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use such caution in general?</p>
               <p>Philips. He did. There is the utmost care taken not to break into the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, whether Mr. Grierson did not appear as a person that took the greatest caution not to offend against this act of parliament?</p>
               <p>Philips. He acted with great caution, rather to excess.</p>
               <p>Q. How many couples have been married in the Savoy chapel since the commencement of the act?</p>
               <p>Philips. I reckon about 1400 couple</p>
               <p>Q. How many hundreds of them lived in the precinct?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040052"></xptr>Philips. There were many came distress'd from out of the country, big with child.</p>
               <p>Q. How many families live in the precinct?</p>
               <p>Philips. Really I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell to the best of your knowledge.</p>
               <p>Philips. There may be thirty or forty families.</p>
               <p>Q. How many couples do you judge might come distressed out of the country?</p>
               <p>Philips. There might be 900 come big with child, some who could not be married any where else.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Was you appointed surrogate ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I was appointed clerk, not surrogate?</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Did you take your oath to do your duty as a surrogate under the bishop?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I did not. I did not apprehend I had any thing to do with the bishop.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Where might Mr. Wilkerson himself be at the time of this marriage?</p>
               <p>Philips. I believe he was not far off.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Did he appear publickly then?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the occasion that he did not appear?</p>
               <p>Philips. There were bills of indictment and warrants against him, and he thought proper to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. What might these bills of indictment be for?</p>
               <p>Philips. They charged him with clandestine marriages.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away on the account of these bills?</p>
               <p>Philips. He went away some time towards the la tter end of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the time that he applied to this honest innocent gentleman to solemnized marriages in his stead?</p>
               <p>Philips. In May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the bills of indictment or after?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was after. Mr. Grierson married his own son at that chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Wilkerson keep a curate before these bills of indictment were found?</p>
               <p>Philips. He has had some.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Grierson officiate in the church in reading prayers, or preach?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, there is one Mr. Brooks does that; he neither reads prayers nor preaches.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Wilkerson a curate to solemnize marriages before?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, he always did that himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it possible he should think of Mr. Grierson ? how did he find him out? is he a settled minister ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I really can't tell; he used to appear in his gown as a clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever marry other people before; because I think Mr. Wilkerson would look out for an expert hand ?</p>
               <p>Philips. He did not look out for him at all; as he was obliged to abscond, application was made for a person to fill up that part. People would come to be married, and we must have somebody to do it, or they would think themselves very ill used.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made this application ?</p>
               <p>Philips. He was sent for by Mr. Wilkerson's order.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to think of Mr. Grierson?</p>
               <p>Philips. Because a little before he married his own son there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the licence of the marriage of Vernham and his wife set forth that they lived?</p>
               <p>Philips. It sets forth that he lived in the parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden, and she in St. Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever take down where they come from?</p>
               <p>Philips. Always, that is put down in the minute book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you married them let them come from what parish they would?</p>
               <p>Philips. We did, let them come from what parish they would in England and Scotland. We married one couple that came from Dumfreis, and another from Dunbar in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever prove wills?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever grant letters of administration?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been there?</p>
               <p>Philips. Only about five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Wilkerson's salary been stopped by the lords of the treasury?</p>
               <p>Philips. About two years before I came, as I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Grierson know the reason of Mr. Wilkerson's not being able to do the duty himself?</p>
               <p>Philips. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they conceal it from him?</p>
               <p>Philips. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to him for this licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever take an oath concerning persons under age?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you fill up the licence without an affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. When he is absent I fill them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040053"></xptr>Q. Did these two gentlemen make affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. No they were willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who takes the affidavit when Wilkerson is absent ?</p>
               <p>Philips. The minister that marries them does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance where Wilkerson or Grierson took an affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. There have been some; I never took any.</p>
               <p>Q. How many out of the 1400 ?</p>

               <p>Philips. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were saying something of banns, were they that were married by banns people of your own precinct, or of other parishes ?</p>
               <p>Philips. They were of other parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Mr. Wilkerson or Grierson proceed against any of these 900 women, that came big with child, for fornication ?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Grierson did officiate any where else before?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear he married people before he came to the Savoy?</p>
               <p>Philips. I have heard say he did marry people at May-Fair chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear himself say so?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't recollect I ever did.</p>

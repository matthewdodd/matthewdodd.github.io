                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John and Francis Lloyd, to<lb></lb>bacco-manufacturers, Snowhill. On Thursday evening, the 29th of May, about five o'clock, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and presented an order—he said he was going to Friars, Smithfield-bars, (which is a tobac<lb></lb>conist's,) and would call as he returned—the order was signed "Joseph White, Clare-street," who is a customer of ours—I looked at it after the</p>

               <p>prisoner was gone, and sent it to Mr. White—the prisoner returned before the person came back—I said the tobacco was not packed—when the person returned from White's, the prisoner was told the order was not White's, but was forged—he was taken to the station—I was handing the order to the clerk at the station—the prisoner snatched at it, and got part of it, and I suppose he must have eaten it in the scuffle, as his person and the place were searched, but we could not find it—I have the other part of it—I believe the words were, "Please send by bearer 12lbs. of fine shag, and if you are sending by our way on Saturday let me have 12lbs. of birdseye returns; let the shag be good. J. White, Clare-street"—I am sure the order produced at the station was the same the prisoner pro<lb></lb>duced to me—I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

Lloyd many years—the prisoner lived with me for about a month, and has left a year and half—a piece of paper was brought to me—it was then entire—this now produced is part of it—I am satisfied it is not my handwriting—I have every reason to believe it is the prisoner's writing—I have seen him write, and am satisfied it is his writing—I gave him no authority to write it.</p>

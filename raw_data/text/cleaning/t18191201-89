On Sunday, the 14th of November, about six o'clock, the bell rang - I went down. Elliot, who slept in the shop, said he had found the shop door wide open, and that he had lost property. I said it was very strange. Nothing passed till the Tuesday following, which was the 17th of November. When the Excise officers came they asked if I had heard of a box of candles which was at Marlborough-street? I found the box and candles at Mr. Pain's, in Tom's-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, and knew them to be mine by the hand-writing on the box, in chalk. Mr. Pain said it was left there some time before by a man who was to call for it again, but that he did not call.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Pain is a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES PAIN. I am a shoemaker, and live in Tom's-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 24th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, my wife went into the yard; she came in and said there was a box in the yard which appeared to be a tallow-chandler's box - my boy went into the yard and brought it in. I untied the cord and opened it, and found it full of candles. Just as got it open a boy came and said he knew who it belonged to. I kept the box. I then went to two tallow-chandlers, but could not find the owner. About a quarter before eleven o'clock that morning, which was Sunday, the prisoner came to my house, opened the door, went into the yard, and then went up stairs. I do not know which room he went into. He came down, knocked at my door, and asked if I had not got a box which was left in the yard? I said I had, and asked if it belonged to him? He said Yes. I asked him how he came to put it in my yard, for I might be taken up for receiving stolen goods? He said nothing particular. I said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, give me your name and address, and if it is all right you shall have the box." He said he lived at No. 71, Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. I told him I would go and see. I went and found it was a private house. They said they had no lodgers. I went to different tallow-chandlers, but could not find the owner. They said they would make it known in the trade. On the 16th of November the prosecutor saw the box at my house, he and his man claimed it. I am sure the prisoner is the man who came for it. He acknowledged it himself when the constable took him, and said the young man who slept in the shop gave it him to take out.</p>

               <p>JOHN ELLIOT. I sleep in the prosecutor's shop. On the 24th of October, at night, the box of candles were stolen.

I did not give the prisoner the box.</p>

I lost a 1 l. note before that. I sleep close by the door at the end of the counter. The box of candles were in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You was charged with the robbery yourself - A. Yes, and lost my place through it. I had not seen the prisoner for six weeks before. I have lost the use of my right ear, and if I lay on my left I do not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other residence - A. I boarded at the prisoner's brother's, in Bird-street, Manchester-square. I keep my things at my master's, and live with my master now. I have got my place again.</p>

I came to London from Cork by a steamer, on the 1st of July—I came on shore between half-past six and seven o'clock—I had a square deal box—I saw the prisoner on the stairs at Wappihg—I was agreeing with a boy to take my box for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the prisoner came up and offered to take it for</p>

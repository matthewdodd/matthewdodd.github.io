               <p>MARGARET EASTON. I know Mr. Spicer; he is the father of Emily Spicer - she is sixteen months old. On the 1st of May I took her out; she had a row of beads round her neck; we were at the corner of <placeName id="t18290611-335-crimeloc1762">Gerrard-street</placeName>

               <p>ROBERT PRIDHAM. I was going along with a board of fish, and saw Easton running with the child - the prisoner ran down Porter-street, and looked to see if any body was running after him - he then turned down Newport-street towards St. Martin's-lane; I lost sight of him - I heard, when I came back, what had been lost.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I was sent for about four or five o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody, from the girl's description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing in St. Martin's-lane; the gentleman came and asked if I knew any thing of the beads - I said "No, I am innocent."</p>

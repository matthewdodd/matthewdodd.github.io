All was fast over night; and I found the bar of the kitchen window in the area forced up, and the shutter open, and the sash up, when I got up, which was about eight in the morning. The maid got up a little before, and came and called me. We missed a large quantity of plate, to the amount of two or 300 l. worth, which we have not been able to discover since. I missed a pair of leather breeches that hung up in a back room by the kitchen. I did not miss them that morning, they being among other things; but I had had them in my hand the Saturday night before the house was broke. Sir

            . On a Sunday morning, I cannot tell the day of the month, the prisoner came to me between seven and eight o'clock, with these breeches on; he said, they were too tight for him. He said, he would be obliged to me if I would go with him to Monmouth-street to change them. I do not know how he came by them. I went with him; he chose a pair of new ones, and changed them with Mr. Dawson. He put them on in the shop.</p>

I found the kitchen window broke open; the bolt of the window-shutter was taken off; a pane of glass was broke, and the sash up. I had fastened the windows and door over night; we missed about 70 l. worth of plate. (Naming them as in the indictment.)</p>

             and I, went out together from Mr. Freebody's, a public house, the Coach and Horses in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Fanning?</p>
               <p>Kenney. He is gone to sea. We went out a little after eleven at night. We went up and down the Strand, and at last pitched upon this house; I don't know the name of the street; it is within two or three streets of Hungerford-Market. This was on a Sunday night, but it was the Monday morning that the robbery was done. We got in at the area gate; we were disturbed before it was done; I think it was Fanning that broke the window shutter. I ran through a court for fear of the watchman, and had not an opportunity of returning for some time; when I returned it was transacted. It was dark, we could hardly find our way back again. Fanning brought me some of the plate, and handed it over the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Bird at that time?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I did not see him; I believe he was in the street. I had been up towards Redfordbury, and did not see him till all the plate was taken. We carried the plate to the Back-lane, beyond Rag-Fair. We went away all one before the other. When we got there, I saw none but Fanning and

            . Fanning gave me 5 l. and 1 s. or 18 d. I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. What share had the prisoners of the money?</p>
               <p>Kenney. They had none, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Graham give for the plate?</p>
               <p>Kenney. He gave 20 l. and 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d. I can't tell which, as Fanning told me. Fanning and I were chiefly together.</p>
               <p>Q. What house were you at when Graham bought the plate?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Fanning told me it was Bird's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. When Graham was sent for, how did you get in at Bird's lodging?</p>
               <p>Kenney. An old woman let us in; Fanning went in directly; Bird was not come home.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went first down into the area?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I do not know; I did not go down at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window broke before you ran away or after?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I do not know whether it was before or after.</p>

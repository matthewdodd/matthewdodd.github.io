            . I am tenant of this house; the lead was all safe on the 1st of February, as I was on the roof: on the 2d of February it was all cut ready to be taken away - a neighbour came, about seven o'clock that evening, and said there was a man on the top of my house; I went up and found a parcel of lead, loose, on the top of the dormer; it was not rolled up, but cut off, and in about half an hour I again heard there was somebody on the house - I went up with my son, and found another piece cut off, and saw it matched, and it fitted exactly.</p>

On the 2d of February, I came from Hackney, and heard some lead was gone: Scott said he thought there was somebody on the house then; I went up and saw the prisoner on the roof, I followed him over the tops of the houses; he got in at a window, and was taken on the first floor of No. 5, Church-lane - it was then near eight o'clock.</p>

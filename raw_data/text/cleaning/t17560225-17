On the Sunday night she went away, and came again on Tuesday morning. On Wednesday we had occasion to wash, we had got another woman to wash for us, when my wife ordered her to go for the soul clothes, the things mentioned in the indictment were missing; I went to where the prisoner lodged and found she was removed, but got Intelligence where she lodged in Wych street; there I saw the prisoner's sister with one of my wife's aprons on. I charged her with it, and said, if she would not produce her sister I should take her before the justice; she took me to Mr. Penrice's, and there we found a shirt and neckcloth, (produced in court, and deposed to.) then I found an apron and child's shift, at Mr. Brigg's in Great Russel-street, (produced in court and deposed to.) I took up the prisoner the 11th of this instant; she denied every thing at first, but she own'd these things, and said before justice Fielding, if I would forgive her she would work them out.</p>

When I went there about nine the next morning I found the door open and all my goods and tools gone, 16 pair of old shoes, 6 pair of leather cloggs, nine lasts, even so much as my spectacles, strap, and a bit of leather I have to put round my hand to do hard work with, and my cutting board. In the afternoon a young man came and told me the things were at the constable's; I went, and there I found them. Produced in court and deposed to.</p>

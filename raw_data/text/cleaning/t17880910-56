               <p>On the 1st of June, I was coming from the Lyceum in the Strand; waiting for the carriage, the prisoner Short walked up to me; upon my desiring him to stand out of the way, he immediately stopped, and I felt his hand at that moment at my watch; I directly seized him by the collar, calling out, that this man had got my watch, and gave him to my servant; my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else near enough to your lordship to have taken the watch from you? - I saw nobody near at that time, but the moment of my collaring him, there was a crowd came round; I know nothing of the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe he was immediately carried into the Lyceum? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Was he searched in your lordship's presence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was no watch found upon him? - None.</p>
               <p>The performance was at an end? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great number of persons near the door? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>You had a child in your hand? - I had.</p>
               <p>And you found it difficult to get to your carriage? - No; I should not have found it difficult at all; the only obstruction I met with was the prisoner walking up to me.</p>

               <p>Your watch has been since found? - Yes, it is in court.</p>

               <p>Have you the advertisement here? - No.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the watch described to have been lost, that you advertised; - It was described to have been lost in Oxford road; that a gentleman was riding on, and pulling out his watch, dropped the case; I did not see the advertisement; the prisoner Burlton brought this advertisement in his hand to me, and said three guineas; he gave me a direction, and where he said he lived, he did live; he said he found the case between ten and eleven o'clock, at the Lyceum in the Strand; he did not say what day; he very readily left the watch-case; he went further, and called again in twenty minutes afterwards; in the meantime I sent down to Bow-street, and the clerk had forgot it; so then I drew up this advertisement to advertise it.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner found by means of the direction he gave you? - He was immediately; he gave me a very true direction; he was taken into custody immediately; I told him at first that he had made a mistake, and brought the wrong case, he came back again nevertheless.</p>
               <p>Lord Southampton. This is the case of my watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow Did you search Short thoroughly? - I did.</p>

               <p>Was there at that particular moment, any body else between you and his lordship? - Not a soul; I touched my lord with my right hand almost.</p>

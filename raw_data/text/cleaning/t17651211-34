Sometimes I used to lie at my place, and sometimes at home with my wife, near Holborn-bridge. On the 18th of October, at 11 at night, I was coming down Holborn, I met with the prisoner and another woman. They both laid hold on my arm; she asked me how I did, calling me fellow servant.

Then she asked me what I would give her, I said, if that is all you have to say, I have done with you. There was a door to the court; she put to the door. While I was struggling to get out, I felt her hand at my breeches pocket. I had four guineas and a half in that pocket, which she took out; I struggled to get it from her. She held her hand up, and the other woman stood at the door, and as it was half open she gave the money to the other; I heard it chink. The other ran away. The prisoner beat and abused me, and swore she would stick me if I offered to say any thing. She held me till the other was out of sight; then she let me go out of the court. Then I called for help, and a gentleman came and we took her to the watchouse, and before Justice Welch the next day, and she was committed.</p>

When he could not have his will, he said you have robbed me: I said then come over the way to the watchman. I was searched, and had but a halfpenny in my pocket.</p>

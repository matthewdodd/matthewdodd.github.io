               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are quite sure it was not quite separated? - A. No; it was confined by an iron hold-fast to keep it close to the wall; it was confined by bricks on each side.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead does not go into the bricks? - A. Yes, it does, two or three inches.</p>
               <p>- FRANKS sworn. - On the 3d of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I went out at my door, which is almost opposite where Mr. Grey lives: I saw two of Mr. Grey's servants with a lighted candle at the door, looking at a leaden pipe; I went over, and observed the pipe pulled out of one of the joints, with a good many of the hold-fasts pulled out, and likewise from the front door into the area, about seven or eight feet down, and there were a great many of the bricks torn away with it; it was fast at the lower end; it was almost twisted off within an inch. In coming back, I saw the prisoner looking past the end of my house; I went back, and told them to go in with the candle; they did so; I went back again, and saw the man come back in about five minutes; he ran over very quick indeed to the pipe; he took hold of it, and twisted it about half a dozen times; some bricks fell out of the wall, he ran away, and I took him; I was not above three yards off, and he ran towards me; it was as dark as pitch; I knew him to be the same man, because I had at my own door two very large lamps, which made it as light as day; he was very quick for a minute or two; some bricklayers labourers came up before the watchman came up, and then he was threatening to strike them; I delivered him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

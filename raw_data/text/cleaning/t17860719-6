            , and he went out of doors, and Pike came in, and he came in directly after him, and said, Oh you are at home now; they talked together, but I cannot tell what they said; I heard them say something about twelve; this was about a quarter after eleven at night; the prisoner staid about five or six minutes, he went away and left Pike there, after he was gone

             asked me for a light, and instead of taking one, he doubted mine; the prisoner was in the house, and I saw Pike take the muslin, which was in a frame, out of a chair, and give it to the prisoner, and a muslin neckcloth they dropped in the entry; this was twenty yards of my master's property; my master first valued it at 5 l. 18 s. then he said, as I was a poor girl he would abate something; it was worth more than 40 s.; we took the prisoner on Friday night; I have not been able to find Pike; they staid in the entry till they folded it up into the frame; I alarmed the neighbours; I saw the prisoner one night before, he came and asked for Ben's work? the muslin was never found; the neckcloth was picked up in the entry by a young woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's counsel. Pike asked you for a candle? - Yes, they took away the frame with the muslin, it was in the room in the arm chair, in one frame; it was very dark when the candle was out, but I could see by the light of the muslin; it was very dark, and the window was shut; nobody came in but this young woman that picked up the neckcloth; I have twenty-four women lodge in the house, but they were all in bed; I always examine them all the last thing at night; the candle was out when this young woman came in; I was very much frightened when they came in; there was a young woman laid asleep.</p>
               <p>It was rather lightish out of doors that you could see by the street door. - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190012"></xptr> light enough to discover any body in the entry, I discovered Ben. Pike going to the chair, and giving the muslin to the prisoner; I had seen the prisoner about a fortnight before this, only once, I believe it was the 30th of May; the street door was wide open, but they stood in the entry.</p>

               <p>As I was coming home I saw Ben. Pike and the prisoner going into the prosecutor's house, where, I believe, they went in about eleven o'clock, within about five minutes as near as I can guess; I heard no cry, only a little talking as Ben. Pike and the prisoner talked together, but the prosecutrix made an alarm, and said she was robbed of her property.</p>
               <p>Did the cry out for some person to come to her assistance? - Yes; I saw Ben. Pike and the prisoner come out of the door with a bundle, but which of them it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What sort of bundle? - A hoop at top with an iron at bottom.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecurix. You say you saw Pike take this muslin out of the chair? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What has been his character for this last twelve months? - Very good, he is known to be an upright man; these people that act in such a cruel manner would have compounded this matter in a notorious manner, they made me that offer, they wanted 6 l. 5 s. and said it was a pity; on the 2d or 3d of July, I was in court, he sent for me, I came, I was informed that two men had robbed Mr. and Mrs. Ballance, they offered to take 6 l. 5 s. for the whole.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Ballance. Is that true? - No Sir, I told Mr. Staple what had been offered me, and he said, do not take any money by any means.</p>

On the 22d of July I found this shilling and the marked copper in the officer's possession - I had directed him to search for my daughter's cap, which was missing; a key of my bar was found in her room - Rawlings called me up stairs; I went up and called the prisoner - she was coming up, and when she got about half-way, she ran down; two women caught her and brought her up - I shewed her the money, and said "Now Mary, are you honest?" she fell on her knees and begged my pardon.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I have a quantity of halfpence and silver which I found on the sacking of the bedstead in the prisoner's room; Richards pointed out these two halfpence and a shilling, which he said he had marked; I found another parcel of halfpence and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I often found money, and gave it him; I took this copper, and said I would frighten him, because he should not put money in my way any more; there was no key in my room, but his niece said to me,"There is a key in my room" - I took a key from there, it would not open my door, and I put it into the cupboard - they often mislaid keys; I did not know what door it would open - I found this copper on the club-room table.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 10th of February Cunningham and Willes came to my place to get some bills discounted—one of them took the bills out of his pocket—they were both in the room at the time, but a little distance one from the other—the second bill wanted an endorsement, it being specially endorsed to Jacob Ruffy, Esq.—I asked him whether his name was Ruffy—on his saying no, I asked him whether he was the holder—he said he was—on my saying I could not make up my mind about the bills, they said they had got another bill of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which they promised to bring me the next day—I hesitated, feeling suspicious of the matter, and yet not liking to impeach anybody, I suspended my judgment till I saw that bill which they were to bring next day—it was stated that Mr. Ruffy's endorsement could easily be got—I believe they bothe said so—I was ill in bed at the time, and could not exactly state, but I think it was said by both—Willes placed himself more towards the window after</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. On the evening of the 23rd, when Clarke, Saint, and Davis were taken into custody, I was going along Bishopsgate-street with Willes—it was raining at the time, and he voluntarily said, pointing to the umbrella I had, "I saw as many papers burnt belonging to Mr. Ruffy, as would fill that umbrella if it was in<lb></lb>verted"—he said he had seen two bills burnt over a b—y quarrel between the parties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Willes's Defence.</hi> As regards the forgery, I know nothing about it. It was taken away either by Lloyd or Cunningham, to get endorsed, and brought back again to the Auction-mart; and Cunningham hesitated to leave it with Wood. I said to Wood, "Give him an undertaking that you will return him the bill or money." I left the place and went to Brixton, where I had business. When I returned, I understood I was wanted, and I gave them every information I could, being in the habit of getting bills discounted. It was not for me to ask them about the bills. I introduced the parties to the party to discount them, and I have nothing more to do. They learn from the parties how to get them. As to the third bill in question, it never went to Cobet, but to Wood. With respect to asking them how they come by the bills, I have nothing to do with that; the party who discounts makes all these inquiries, and takes all the responsi<lb></lb>bility. I had it not in my possession five minutes. There seems to have been a mistake as to my seeing the papers burnt. I did not. I was told so by the landlord of the house; and it must be a misunderstanding of the officers. I might not have heard distinctly, being deaf. While they were gone to get the bill indorsed I was on business with other people at the Auction-mart; and when they came back, I said, "Leave it with Wood; if be gives you an undertaking to return the bill or the money." I have a character to lose, and I acted in the way I have said. I was not in the secret of the transaction; I only had to introduce the men to get the bill discounted; and it is hard I should be considered a party who stole the bill. It was morally impossible for me to tell how they came by them, and I was not to ask them; that was the business of the party discounting them. They should have gone to Mr. Ruffy, and asked if it was correct. I have not the slightest knowledge who did endorse it, or of the parties who committed the robbery, only from hearsay, from the landlord of the house, and the parties with me. I do not frequent the house. Lloyd came with his brother, and asked if I knew where he could get money on the bills; that he was in distress at the time, having his goods seized for rent. They were introduced to Wood in an indirect manner by me. I thought the thing was straightforward, and acted upon that impression as innocently as possible. While they went to get the bill endorsed, I stopped in the Auction-mart, in the tap-room, with other parties on business. When Wood was in custody I gave every information I was able; but was not aware there was any thing wrong till the policemen sent for me. I was out four or five days with them, till the parties were taken; then they turned round, and I was placed in custody with them. I forwarded every information I was in possession of to the proper quarter. I leave it in the hands of the Jury to decide if I was wrong—I did not know I was doing wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, and live in No. 37, Cumberland-street, Hackney-road. I have known Willes fifteen years—I know he has been in the habit of getting bills discounted for parties—I have myself handed him thirty or forty bills in that period; some he has returned, not being able to get them discounted, and others he has got done—I know he was in the habit of going to the Auction-mart, to Baker's coffee-house, where a number of agents go—I have seen bills passed across there for the purpose of getting discounted.</p>

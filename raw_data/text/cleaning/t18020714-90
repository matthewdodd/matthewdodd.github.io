            , junior: On the 5th of June, the prisoner came to me in Town-court, Cheapside, about five o'clock in the afternoon, saying that he came from Wells and Co. Fleet-street, and wanted apiece of mode, at about five shillings per ell; I told him, I had not got one at that price; and he wished to see one as near the price as I had got one; I let him see one at 4s. 3d. per ell, which he said, would do very well; and he wished to take it with him, because it was wanted immediately; he was asked what his name was, and he said it was John Hall; he took with him, a piece of mode, about 62 ells, making about 77 yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to part with this property? - A. He said, he came from Wells and Company, who are customers of our's; it is very customary in the silk trade, for gentlemen to send a porter, or some other person, without a note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you parted with your property, believing the person came from Wells and Company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear positively to my person? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN GILCHRIST sworn. - I am partner in the house of Wells and Company, haberdahsers, Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other house of Wells and Company, in Fleet-street? - A. There is no other house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner? - A. I knew him about four years back, I bought some fans of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him at any time, about the 5th of June, to Smith and Clay, for some mode? - A. I never did, at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Or give him any directions for that purpose? - A. Never.(

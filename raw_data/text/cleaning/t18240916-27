               <p>GEORGE ARNOLD. I am twelve years old. I had two pairs of drawers to carry for my uncle; they were under my arm, in paper. About half-past ten o'clock, just by Bloomsbury steps a man snatched them from me - I could not see who he was. I turned round, no one was near me, but we saw a man running, and pursued him - I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped by the watchman; it was the prisoner: he had not got them - they were picked up about twenty yards from where he was stopped. He did not say anything; I did not charge him with it. There did not appear to be any other person running in company with him when we were calling out Stop thief.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Denton and Bartlet, of Gray's Inn-square. On the evening of the robbery I was in Kingsgate-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner, who appeared to be running from the cry, and several persons were pursuing him - I saw him stopped by the watchman, and went with him to the watch-house; I saw him throw the parcel down close at my feet - I picked it up. I never lost sight of him till he was taken.</p>

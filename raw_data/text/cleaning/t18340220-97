             (police-constable E 91). On the evening in question I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running in an opposite direction - I followed, and caught him - he appeared much confused, and said,"What is the matter?" - Mr. Cruse came up and gave charge of him - the prisoner said, "Upon my word you are mistaken, it was not me" - I took him to the shop, and the prosecutor gave him in charge - he threw himself on the ground - cried, "Murder" and "O Lord" - he struck me in the face, and was so violent, that we were obliged to put him into a cab to get him to the station-house - whilst he was in the shop, he said he lived in Rathbone-place - he afterwards gave another direction - they were both false.</p>

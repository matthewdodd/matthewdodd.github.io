On the evening of the 24th of November, the prisoner came to my shop with a lady, and asked to look at some ear-rings; I produced them. They looked at several pair; at last the lady chosed a pair of cornelian ear-rings; the gentleman said, take them if you like them, if they are a shilling dearer then you can get them elsewhere. He took out of his pocket-book a bit of paper; he paid me: it appeared to be a two-pound note; I asked him for his name, and address; he said, he would write his name on himself; he took the pen, and wrote the name that now stands on it. That is the note; he wrote on it.

I asked him if he had any more notes, we wanted some; those that we had were so pale we could not offer them; he said he believed he had none except five's; he would look, and if I would return the others he would alter them for me. He asked me if I could send my son with them, and he would alter them for me against the evening; he shewed me a two-pound note; he asked me if I thought it would do; I said, yes, it would do, and took it. I understood that he had done them with Camel's hair pencils, and Indian ink. He delivered me the two-pound note; I brought it away. I told him I was going to the Royal Oak; my husband was there; I asked him if he would go there with me; he said as he was in his dishabille, he would rather not. I went to the Royal Oak; Foy took the note from me. I had no other in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor of the Thames-police. On the 14th of November I was on duty about half-past two o'clock in the morning, and noticed a boat, sailing through the centre arch of London-bridge—I pursued it, and saw the prisoner get out of it at Thorp's-wharf, Southwark—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the boat adrift, and got behind some timber—he put up his hand, I and threw what I supposed to be a lot of sovereigns out of his hand—they jinked against the timber which he got behind—there appeared a great many more than was found—Godfrey was with me—I secured him, and about two yards from him I found two sovereigns-and a Victoria medal—Godfrey brought me a half-sovereign, and King a sovereign—the place was very muddy, and some of them might be lost—I searched the prisoner, and on his person found another Victoria medal, and a box of Lucifer matches—I took him on board my boat—he said he belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Chris<lb></lb>tian,</hi> which I found was lying in the same tier as the <hi rend="italic">Fox Maule</hi>—you could step from one vessel to the other—I went on board that vessel, and found the drawers in the cabin broken open—I looked into the grate of the cabin, and found two Lucifer matches of the same description as those found on him, and which had been burnt—I noticed marks of blood on a</p>

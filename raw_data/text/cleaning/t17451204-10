             came up and said, that there was a Woman very sick, and that she wanted a Lodging: I ask'd her, how she came out of her Lodging, and she said that she wanted Money. This Gardner wanted to take her away to her own Lodging, for she said the Watchman would be about by and by, and I was afraid that she would take her Clothes away. She had two Shifts. This was about Twelve o'Clock at Night. After this she carried her into Brown's Gardens, and this was the 2d of November; and she was at the Door, and no body with her but Eliz. Gardner. I thought no more of it. I know this Gardner very well. I know nothing what became of the sick Woman, until I heard that she was in the Round-House, and that the Coroner had sat upon her. I know that this Gown was upon the Woman that is dead.</p>

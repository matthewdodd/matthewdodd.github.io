            . I live with Mr. Railton. On Sunday morning, the 1st of August the prisoner asked me to go up stairs and fetch his box; I asked him why he could not bring it himself; he said it would dirty him, and desired me not make a noise in doing it - he said it had his clothes in it. I went up and brought it two-thirds of the way down the garret stairs; he then took it of me, and asked me to go and get the key of the door from Miss Railton - I told him to go himself, and heard him ask Miss Railton for it, but I do not know whether he got it or not.

            . I was in my brother's house on Sunday morning, at ten o'clock; the prisoner asked me for the key, and said he would let himself out, he had a large paper box with him, I went to let him out, and asked him if he was going to take those things away, he said</p>
               <p>"What do you say?" my sister said,</p>

               <p>"If you are, you must let us see them," he said,</p>

I called one of my brothers to see what he was about, my brother called him, I heard him call, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I shall be a quarter of an hour," we sent for an officer, (Humphreys.) I did not go up with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160027"></xptr>him, but after he had searched, I saw the prisoner again, my sister, my brother, and Humphreys were then present - I saw no bundle there, but when I came down again I saw one tied up in this handkerchief, and a cord round it; it had been thrown out of window. I saw it opened, and examined the goods; they were my brother's - the prisoner did not say how they came there. There was some money which he said was his, and the other things he did not wish to see; the handkerchief was a little wet, but not the goods - it had been a rainy morning, and if they had been there long the goods must have been more wet.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and went up to the room. I saw the prisoner there, and told him I was sent for on suspicion of something being in his boxes; there were two boxes, one was a paper box with a pair of trowsers and a jacket in it. I looked out of the window, and saw the bundle tied up with a rope, on the leads of the next house. I sent the young gentleman to throw it down; when it was opened Miss Railton saw the goods, and claimed them as her brothers. The prisoner said there was 2 l. 10 s. in it, and I said</p>

               <p>"You had better take it out for you know where it is;" it had been a very wet night, and it was evident that it could not have been there long - these things were in the bundle.</p>

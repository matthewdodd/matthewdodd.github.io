                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I was in the ser<lb></lb>vice of Messrs. Davey and M'Murdo, wholesale drug-merchants, in Gould-square, Minories—the prisoner Smith was their porter—I live with my father, in Nicholl-street, Shoreditch—I first took things from my master's warehouse about six months ago—I was taken ill on a Wednesday, the latter end of August—it was the Wednesday before Smith was taken into custody-from the beginning of the six months till I was taken ill I took away goods from my masters' warehouse, about once or twice a week-Smith desired me to do so—I remember on one day taking some cochineal—I cannot say exactly what day it was-Smith desired me to do it, and I took about 10lbs. of it—I fetched it from the drying room, and put it into a canvas bag-Smith was at that time in the back yard of the premises, washing bottles—when I had got the cochineal into the bag I gave it to Smith—he kept it till the even<lb></lb>ing,</p>

               <p>I believe, in the magnesia room, and gave it me to take to the prisoner Clift, about seven o'clock-Smith called him Hutchinson-Smith told me to take it out, and give it to Hutchinson—I went out, and found Clift at the comer of John-street—he was not far from my master's pre<lb></lb>mises—I had seen Clift five or six times before—I had seen him with Smith-Clift used to come and meet me about dinner-time, and once or twice he met me at the same place in the evening-Clift did not give me any money when I took him the cochineal—he had before asked me to get him some things, unknown to Smith—I said, no, I would not get him any thing, unknown to Smith—he said he would give me the same price as he did Smith, and then I should not have to share half with him, but I should have as much again as Smith gave me—he said he would pay me on deli<lb></lb>very, if I would get him things unknown to Smith—on the day I took Clit the cochineal he did not give me any money, but said he would pay Smith—no charge had been made against me, or any proceedings taken, before the Wednesday on which I was taken ill, and on that day I voluntarily made a statement to my father—I then went before the Justice, and was examined as a witness on the Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am turned of fourteen years of age. I live with my father in Phillip-lane—I am errand boy to Messrs. Davey and M'Murdo. On Saturday evening, the 1st of September, I saw the prisoner Clift in Crutched-friars—I had seen him before in a public-house with Thomas Whipps-Clift came right in front of me, and called out to the other lads, and then he said he thought I was Thomas—he asked me which way I was going—I said I was going home—he asked me whether Thomas was come out—I said, "Yes, some time"—I asked him what he wanted with him—he said he had got a ticket for the play—he then said he had been in a public-house, and he had heard a man say there was a robbery at Davey and M'Murdo's—that he asked him if he knew any thing about it, and he said "No"—he asked me if I knew any thing about it—I said "No"-Clift then said the man's name was Smith—I said, "Surely it is not Smith"-Clift then said he thought it very strange that I should be in such a firm and not know there was a robbery—he then walked; with me some distance and said, "I dare say you are an acute lad, do you go to that public-house for your dinner?"—I said "No, I go where I like"—he then said, "Between you and I, I want an article at present"—he mentioned the name of it, but I do not know what it was—he then asked what capacity I was in in the firm—I said, "The same as Thomas"—he said "Between you and I, if any thing should be done, you would not let any one know it, not let Thomas know it"—I said, "No"—he then said</p>

I said we always kept a good stock of them—he then said, "Out of two cwt. of opium, you could take about thirty pounds"—I said, "How?"—"Oh," he said, "put some into your pockets, some on your groin, and some under your arms, and bring it out by degrees"—he then said I could bring about ten pounds of saffron, and I could bring some Tonquin beans, and when it came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, he would wrap it in a bit of paper, advertise it, and offer 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward, and I should take it to him and receive the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him what price he would give me—he said, the same as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—that was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for saffron—he did not mention the price for Tonquin beans—I said, "Two shillings for opium that is worth a guinea a pound?"—he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was what he gave <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, but he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium and saffron, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for Tonquin beans, and I was to meet him at the public-house in Duke-street, with as many articles as I could get him—I told him I would talk to him on Monday-(this was on Saturday)—I was going to leave him, and he offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I would not take it then; I would take it on Monday—he wished me to take it and drink his health—I said, "No"—he said, "Come and have a pint of beer"—I said, "Then you can give me the prices what you will give me"—we went into the public-house, and he wrote down on this paper, (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>,)"3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for opium, 3<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. for saffron, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt for Tonquin beans"—he wished me to drink, and I put it to my lips, but would not swallow any—he wished me to finish it—I said, "No," it was bad—I asked him how he first came to know Tom—he said he was sleeping with a girl at his house, and then he said, "If you must know, I keep a b-y-house"—I then said, "Perhaps you can get us a girl?" on purpose to find out where he lived—he said, "That could be done;" where could he meet me on Sunday—I told him I bad some business to attend to—he said, "Could you meet me at the Half-way House, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road, on Sunday evening?"—I said, "Yes," and with that I left him—I went home and told my father, who took me to the foreman, and he to to the inspector—I met Clift on Sunday at the Half-way Houses—he was talking to a young man—I went and shook hands with him—he said." Excuse me for a few minutes"—he went and spoke to the man, and then he came to me, and walked down the road with me—he said he had been talking to <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi> about me—I said I had no money—he asked how much I had—I said, "A penny; that is all I am allowed"—he said, "Come on," and he took me down the road, and turned off down a turning to the right—he told me to stop there, and he would talk to some young women who were there—I heard one young woman say to him, "That can be done," and the young woman went into a house-Clift followed her, and they called me in-(the officer had desired me to go wherever Clift took me)—I went in, and sat down—I saw Clift give a shilling to another woman, and she went out—I came away, and made an appointment to see clift again on the Monday, about one o'clock, with some opium, corrosive-sublimate, ginger, and nutmegs—I mentioned that to the officer and to Mr. Davey, my master, and on Monday I was furnished with some opium. which was marked—I carried it to the place where I was to meet Clift—he ran up to me, and I said, "Take the opium"—he said, "Don't you be seen with me"—the officer then took him.</p>

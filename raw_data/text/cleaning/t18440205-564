                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Silver-st., Golden-sq. I was the owner of the house 41, Silver-street, some time ago. I sold that house to the prisoner—there was a trifling dispute between us about the fixtures—subse<lb></lb>quent to that, on the 26th of Jan., I was passing No. 41—the door was open—I stopped, looked in, and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I said, "Old fellow, are you going to let us have the fixtures?"—he said, "What do you want?"—I repeated it—he rose from the chair, and advanced to the door where I was standing outside—he came within a yard of me, I should Say—he then drew a pistol from his pocket, and presented it at my head—seeing the pistol, I turned round, and made my escape into the next house, No. 40—I went direct through the passage to the yard at the back of the house—I went into the yard, and closed the door after me—when I was closing the door, I heard the report of fire-arms—I saw no more of the prisoner till I saw him at the station—I afterwards observed that something had gone through the door.</p>

When I returned, the Bundle was gone. [The Witness recounted the Things in the Bundle, and named the Proprietors.] Mrs. Hibbin not knowing what was become of them, I advertised them, in the News-Papers; after which the 2 Prisoners were taken, and one of the Shirts which I had lost, [and was Mr. Cartwright's] was taken upon Eakins's Back; it was taken off, before the Justice, and Madam Cartwright own'd it, I knew it by the Mark I put on it before I put it into the Wash. Since this, we have found several other Things, which I know were in the Bundle, when it was taken away. Here's a Pair of Sheets, but I can't be so positive to them, as I am to this Table-Cloth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cartwright. I can swear to the Sheets.</p>

            . I was in Mrs. Hibbin's Shop when the Prisoner Brown came in and asked for a Pair of Garters; (she keeps a Haberdasher's Shop.) I shewed him some Garters, and asked him 6 d. for a Pair; He bid me 3 Pence for them, which I told him I could not take. Then, says he, give me a Penny-worth of black Worsted. I gave it him, and he threw the Penny behind the Counter, and I took the Candle and stooped down to look for the Money. When I got up, the Bundle was gone. I saw no Person in the Shop, but Brown, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174001160019"></xptr> told me, while I was looking for the Money, that one of the Half-pence was this Way, and the other, was that Way; so while I was looking for them the Bundle was taken.</p>

            . One Harris, and Proctor being taken up, and sent to the New Goal, Harris informed us of this Robbery, and said he believed if we took the Prisoners soon, we should find two of the Shirts upon their Backs. We took them both, and the Shirt upon Eakins was own'd, but that upon Brown, was not sworn to. They each of them desired to be admitted an Evidence, and Brown said if the Favour was granted him, he would tell where all the rest of the Linnen was. Accordingly by his Directions, we found the Sheets, and the Table-cloth.</p>

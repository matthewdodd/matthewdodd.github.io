On the 16th of April, at near nine o'clock at night, I drove a coach on the stand for the coachman - I had my great coat on my arm, the prisoner was standing by the side of the horses, but he had nothing do to with the stand; I waited, and the coachman came up with a coat on his arm, which he gave me, and told me to throw it on the box, which I tried to do, but as I had the whip in my hand, and my own coat on my arm, I could not do it; the prisoner said "Give me your coat, and whip to put the coat on the box;" I did so, and got up to put the coat on the box, and while I did that the prisoner laid the whip on the horses, and ran off with my great coat - I have never seen it since, but the prisoner was taken the next day - I swear he is the man.</p>

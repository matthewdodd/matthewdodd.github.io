               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand? - A. No; he said he came there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get into your yard? - A. He came through the passage of the house; I cannot say whether the door was shut, for we have many lodgers in the house, and they might leave it open, as they do frequently; I seized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What tools were they? - A. Six saws and two planes were lying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had they been? - A. They had been on the bench, I left them on the bench; I locked the shop door myself on Sunday afternoon at two o'clock, and there were no tools on the floor then; I cannot say the saws were in the chest, but the planes were; the chest was not locked.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS BERKLEY sworn. - I am a watchman; I was called in by the last witness; Mr. Crow informed me there was a thief in the house; I went backwards, and found the prisoner in the yard; it was a little after twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing on him? - A. Only some keys; the workshop was fastened by a padlock, and the staple that was screwed in was forced out without unlocking the padlock; a little after I laid hold of him he leaned down, as if he was putting something down; I stooped, and found it was an iron hammer; the handle was iron, and at the end it was flat, something like a screw-driver; I asked Mr. Crow if the iron hammer belonged to him; he said, it did not; I looked in the workshop, and saw some saws, and something else, lie close together at the door; I conveyed him to the watch-house; I have the saws here.</p>

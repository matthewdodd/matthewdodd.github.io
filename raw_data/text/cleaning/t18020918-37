               <p>Q. Look round and say if you can see that gentleman? - A. Yes; that is him, (pointing to the prisoner;) he told me, Mr. Davis had sent him after me, that I had four pounds odd more to receive, and I said, thank God for it; then I went with him to the Baptist-head, Chancery-lane; he said, Mr. Davis used to give a great many bad Banknotes, and as I could not read or write, he would tell me whether they were good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to go to the Baptist-head for? - A. He said, there was an agent there, who was to pay me; I gave him the notes to tell me if they were good or bad; then he told me to take notice of a public-house opposite, the sign of the Grapes, where he said, I should receive a weekly allowance for my children; I looked across the way, and when I turned round again, the prisoner was gone; I put myself against the wall, and said, I am done; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and knew him again immediately, he was taken up upon another charge.</p>

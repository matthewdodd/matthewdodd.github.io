               <p>Had there been any discourse about finding it? - None at all, the little man, which I think is Patch, said I will agree to let him have a hundred pounds; I will go to my banker's directly, I hope you will be here when I come back, I will not be long; he was not gone two minutes, and came in, and said his banker was not at home, his banker's clerk was; and he could not have the hundred pounds that night, but he would bring it the next morning at eleven o'clock; I then got up to pay for my pint of beer; my hands were very cold, and I took a canvas bag I had, and shook my money loose in the window; I had five guineas, one half guinea, four half crowns, and a sixpence; I took it out to look for a sixpence, because my hands were numbed; the prisoner, after I gave the waiter the sixpence, came up to me, between me and where my money lay, and asked me to sign my name to a piece of paper in two or three folds folded up, which I suppose was the same piece of paper; the other man had been writing; they were all three in the room; then the waiter went out after I paid him; I wanted to get my money to put into my bag; the man that sat writing, whipped up and shut the door; the prisoner stepped up to me, and asked me to sign my name to the paper, and I refused it; he directly took the pen from the other man, and insisted upon my signing it; he did not explain what the paper was; I did not know what to do; I wrote my name on the paper; I did not know what I wrote it to, nothing was read to me; then I got up to go out; the prisoner says to me, give that man your money that lays in the window; I answered no; he then says go and take it; accordingly the man that I took to be Patch took it; he came behind me, whipped up my box, and this man, and the other man came behind me, keeping me from following them; the man at the bar put his hand upon the back of the man that had the box, and bid him run off with the box; and the prisoner and Patch ran out together, the other man followed; I run to the window and took up my hat, and cried stop thief, but nobody came to my assistance; I lost sight of them; I put the parcel which I had in my hat, in my waistcoat pocket; I went to the Green Man and Still, where I lodge; I went to a friend that I deal with.</p>
               <p>What became of the paper you signed? - They took it with them; when I got to my friends in Carnaby Street, I opened the parcel which was tied in three different knots, and I found this ring.</p>
               <p>Did you give the ring to any body that is here? - No, I went to Justice Bond's at Bow-street, and gave a description, and the prisoner was taken some time after, about three weeks ago Mr. Lucas knows.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300071"></xptr>Did you at any time part with your goods on any occasion, either for a ring or any thing else? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you consent either to their taking the box or the money? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are positive you did not give your box as security for your producing the ring, or any thing of that sort? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the same man? - I am sure this is the man that pushed out Patch with the box, and bid him run off; I have never seen him before; I was with him a quarter of an hour; he was taken the 22d of July.</p>
               <p>That was four months after; can you undertake to swear positively to the person of a stranger at four months distance of time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. You was not willing to lose this purse? - No, Sir; I stooped to pick it up, but a hand interposed.</p>
               <p>When you came into this cold room, where you wanted to warm your hands, where there was no fire, what made you stay? - I staid to drink my beer; I never said a word about his going to his banker's.</p>
               <p>If the hundred pounds had come, you would have received it, would not you? - Yes, I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did this box of your's stand, when the man was writing? - At the door; it stood close by my foot, and Patch far opposite me, the other two men sat opposite me.</p>
               <p>You was not afraid of losing your box? - I was not careful enough at that time.</p>
               <p>I seems the ring was of too much value to bring here? - I do not know the value of the ring.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you to be a very good ring? - I did not understand it.</p>
               <p>What would you have thought it worth? - I thought nothing of it; I carried the ring to Justice Bond, and it was given to a man named Morris.</p>
               <p>But what directions did you give him? - This Morris sent me a letter to come to the office in Bow-street; and I went to attend an appointment from a letter; there was a Mr. Morris; he took us to another house; there was a man that was to produce the property, not the man that took the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Morris got the ring under pretence of getting your laces? - Morris is an attorney's clerk; he said to the man, I will draw up an agreement if you will sign it; we staid till near four o'clock, and the haberdasher persuaded me; accordingly my box was brought in, and I looked over it, and cast it up, and found it thirty pounds deficient, in case my laces were not cut; some of them appear to be cut; when I said there was a piece of nineteen yards wanting, then they brought me in nine pounds worth of lace more; then there wanted twenty pounds; I gave the ring up with that view, to have my property; I was to have received all my property; the paper I signed, was to say nothing about it, provided I got all my property within five pounds; the haberdasher advised me.</p>
               <p>Was Morris acting for you, or for those that had your laces? - He was acting for the rogues.</p>

               <p>Court. If it is subject of criminal enquiry, it must be made out, and there must be a warrant for taking him up? - The haberdasher said, the best way would be for me to employ an attorney; and the attorney came there by the desire of me and the haberdasher; the haberdasher carried me to the attorney, and Morris was his clerk.</p>

               <p>You found at last, you had twenty pounds worth missing? - Yes.</p>

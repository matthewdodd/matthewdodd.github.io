On the morning of the 12th of May, the prisoner at the bar, called upon me and told me Viglezzi had had a piece of lace stolen, and he told me that Viglezzi had a strong suspicion of him. In the course of the afternoon Viglezzi called on me, and communicated to me the circumstances, together with his suspicion; hearing that the prisoner had got a birth on board a ship lying at Graveshend, to go to Italy. I went to Hatton Garden office, and dispatched an officer thence for the purpose of detaining the prisoner; the officer went down to Graveshend, and brought him up; at his commitment at Hatton Garden, I heard him acknowledge that he took the things out of the room of Viglezzi, and pawned them in Piccadilly. The prisoner is a <rs id="t18150621-61-deflabel355" type="occupation">Citizen of Milan</rs>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of Lewis Anwell. He was alive at the time of this robbery, but very ill indeed—my house is the Halfmoon and Punchbowl, in Buckle-street, in the parish of St. Mary Matfelon Whitechapel—I know the prisoners—they, with two others, named Nathan and Gardener, were at my house on the 14th of January—Lawson was em<lb></lb>ployed in the house as pot-boy—at one o'clock, on the morning of the 14th of January, he helped me to put the shutters up—I heard some noise in the course of the night, which alarmed me—I suppose it was about ten minutes before three o'clock—it was as if something heavy had fallen into an empty room—such a noise as a man would make in falling from a window—I came down, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and went into the bar—I found my cash-box broken open, and missed from it a gold watch, four silver watches, a quantity of spoons, a trinket-box, with rings and different things in it—the value of all I lost is about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since seen one of the watches, but none of the other property, except what was in the possession of Lawson's brother—I had taken nearly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up stairs with me the night before, and that I had with me up stairs—I went into the long room, where there is a sky-light—I found the pulley of the sky-light drawn up, and the birch-broom put up, to keep it up—that win<lb></lb>dow opens by a pulley inside—by pulling a rope, the window would go up—I had left that window shut, when I went to bed, and all the house shut up—I had done it myself—Lawson went round with me—I had left that room safe at half-past one o'clock—Lawson did not sleep in the house—there is a wall and a water-butt outside the house.</p>

               <p>JAMES COOK. I live at Hyde Park-corner gate. On the night of the 18th of July I had been dining with some friends at the Slaughter coffee-house, and I was, on my return, in <placeName id="t18320906-50-crimeloc298">Piccadilly</placeName>

            . I am a silk-mercer. I was crossing from the County Fire-office towards the end of Titchbourne-street; the prisoner was running and the witness pursuing him - he ran against me; the officer came up and took him; he took from his person a gold watch, and threw it down, with a view to throw it down the area of a butcher's-shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say I threw it on your foot? A. No; I said it fell on my foot, and Mr. Tucker took it up.</p>

             (Police-serjeant C 15). I was on duty at the end of the Quadrant; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner the foremost person, running with great speed; I ran to stop him, and a person laid hold of him - a gentleman then came up with this watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not running, I was held by the collar - he came up and said, "What is amiss?" and it was said a watch was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he came to the office a man stood behind him, and told him what to say; one said that I threw it on some railings, and another that I threw it on his foot - I deny that I threw it, and they cannot say it with a clear conscience; the prosecutor had been to a party, and had his cargo of grog.</p>

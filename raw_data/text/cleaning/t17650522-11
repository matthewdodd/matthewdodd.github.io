She had lain in the parlour where the five gowns lay, bundled up, mentioned in the indictment, which I made for Mrs. Rickaby, and were ready done up to carry home. I went out about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176505220011"></xptr> the time she did, but returned in about five minutes, and then missed the five gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand French?</p>
               <p>S. Shelfe. No, I do not, but she spoke English so that I could understand her: there was nobody in the parlour the morning that she went away, but she and I. My husband and another man went about to the pawnbrokers, to give notice, if such should be brought, to stop them; I went about after that, and found the gowns at another pawnbroker's; they sent to us, and we went and secured her.</p>

               <p>MR. PAULL. I did not promise not to prosecute; I told him if he gave me the duplicate that night I would not, but I did not then know he had robbed me of my tools - he was still in my employ; I was paying him wages- I settled with him every Saturday, but he generally drew all his money before; he had 28s. a week, and his tea - I was not in his debt at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they come into your house? - A. They did; I asked Gunn if he knew any thing of the China man; he said yes; I asked him if he had been to his house with a girl; he also replied, yes; I further asked him if he knew any thing of the dollars; he said, the girl must have taken them; I then told Gunn, you had better return this poor man his money; he replied that he was a poor man, and how could he afford to do it; he then asked me what the amount of them would be; Erpune said he had lost nineteen; I had a pen in my hand about to cast them up, when Gunn said, mind they are not 5 s. dollars, they only pass for 4 s. 2 d.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I am an officer of Shadwell: On the evening of the 1st of November, I was sent for to take the prisoner Gunn into custody, about half past nine in the evening; I then left him in charge with Mr. Gole, in Mr. Anthony's parlour, and went instantly to search his house; I first searched his person, and then his house, but found nothing; I then returned to Gunn, and asked him where the dollars were that the China man had lost; he told me he did not know, but he believed the girl had them, but that he would make up the loss, and begged of me not to take him into custody; I told him I could make no bargains with him of that kind, that I was under the necessity of taking him into custody; he several times said he was innocent, in his way to the Office, but he would still make up the loss, if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you find the prisoner Alsey? - A. Several days, eight or ten; I traced her to Spital-fields, and from there to Lambeth; I found her at a public-house, under a false character, on Tower-hill; I told her I took her for robbing a China man of dollars; she denied it; I took her into custody, I searched her, and found nothing upon her; as I was taking her to the Office, she said it was hard she should suffer for Mrs. Gunn; about ten minutes before I took her to the Magistrate, which was the next morning, I had her in custody all night at a lock-up house near the Office, she sent for me, and told me she wished to tell the truth; I neither used promise nor threat, but desired her to be sure to stick to the truth; I told her to be cautious, for what she told me I should repeat to the Magistrate; she then said she had taken sixteen of the dollars, and had taken no more; she said she had divided the sixteen dollars with Mrs. Gunn; I then brought her before the Magistrate, and she said the same before the Magistrate; it was not taken in writing.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, Alsey, put in a written defence, which was read as follows:)</p>
               <p>"My Lord and Gentlemen, I humbly address you in the hope you will humanely consider my statement as the truth. The person who is tried with me kept a common lodging-house for the reception of men and women; I went with the prosecutor, and he gave me a dollar and a sixpence; Mrs. Gunn stopped me in the way, and told me he had plenty of money, and advised me to go up and rob him; I, unfortunately for myself, followed her advice, and shared the dollars with her; they not being stamped, and not considered the current coin, I could not part with them for more than 4 s. 2 d. a piece; I went to service for the purpose of retrieving my character, from which place I was taken up; I humbly throw myself on your mercy, and hope by your clemency to alter my mispent life.</p>
               <p>Gunn's defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>

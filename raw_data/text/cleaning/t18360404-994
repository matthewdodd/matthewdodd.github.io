                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Rudolph Ackermans, of Regent-street, a print-seller and water-colour-manufacturer. The prisoner has been two years or more a colour-grinder in his employ—he was an upholsterer before we took him—property has been missed at different times—this is Mr. Ackermann's box of colours—there is a label inside the box by which I know it—I suspected the prisoner, in consequence of which I got an officer—we went to the prisoner's lodgings on the 16th of March—I found him there in bed—I found some things there, but did not give him in charge, as they were too trifling—I immediately went to differ<lb></lb>ent pawnbrokers, and found several boxes of water-colours, pawned by a person answering the description of the prisoner—in tracing them, I also found boxes belonging to Ackermann and Co., in the Strand—I told the prisoner I had found some boxes of water-colours at different pawnbroker's, but this box was found afterwards, at Mr. Richard's a pawnbroker, and these water-colour drawings and frames were pledged at the same pawn<lb></lb>broker's on the same date, and in the same name—it is my employer's.</p>

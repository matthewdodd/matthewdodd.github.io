I saw something in his Apron, so I seized him, and found his Apron and his Right Pocket full; we weighed the Hogshead, and found 49 lb. wanting; sixteen Pounds we took out of his Pocket and Apron, and upon comparing it with the Sugar in the Hogshead, it prov'd to be the same. He told me it had been given him by a Sailor, and begged I would let him go; but I took him into the Capsel Room to my Partners, and they sent for a Constable. The Sugar belonged to one Mr.

            , Constable. I was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner, and the Sugar that was found upon him. I asked him how he came by it? He said a Cooper had given it him, and that he only went up into the Buildings to pick up a few Hoopsticks; but at last he rapp'd out an Oath, and bid Weldon take Care what he did, for he could not swear he saw him take it. He shamm'd being drunk, - but so he has done very frequently upon the Keys. I have seen him with something in his Hat-several Times upon the Wharfs, and have had several Runs after him, but could never take him 'till now.</p>

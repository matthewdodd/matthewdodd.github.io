                  </hi> I am the wife of William Fisher, and live at Poplar. On Monday afternoon, 3rd April, I got into an omnibus at Blackwall, for the purpose of going to Lambeth—I sat on the left-hand side as I got is, and there was about room for two or three persons between me and the door—a person sat between me and the door—there was room far one or more between me and that person—I had about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, wrapped up in a piece of paper, in my pocket on my right-hand side, which would be nearest the door—it was a pocket made in the dress—the prisoner got into the omnibus in St. Paul's churchyard—I had ascertained that my money was safe just before—I had occasion to use my handkerchief, which was in the same pocket, and I felt my money safe—I am quite sure of that—the prisoner sat on my right, between me and the party next the door—I am quite certain that she got in at St. Paul's-churchyard—there were more persons in the omnibus, but not on my right side—they were sitting opposite, and at the other end—it was nearly full—the prisoner sat quite close to me—the omni<lb></lb>bus went straight on to the end of Bridge-street or Farringdon-street—the prisoner got out there—I went to use my handkerchief again, when she got out, and found it hanging to my pocket, and my money was gone—I named it to a person in the omnibus, and she advised me to tell the conductor to stop—the omnibus was stopped, and I got out—I had not observed which way the prisoner went—the conductor told me, and I went in that direction—it was towards the bridge—I met the prisoner coming back from the bridge—she was about us far up the street as Bride-court—I told her that she had taken the money from me—she said she had not, that she had plenty of money—she showed me her purse, and wished me to go home with her to see her respectability—I declined doing so, and gave her into custody—there was one half-crown among my money, and shillings and sixpences—I am quite sure the prisoner is the only person that sat close to me, and she threw her dress over me several times—she had a plaid silk dress with flonnces, and a visette, which she has on now—she threw her dress over my knees two or three times, spreading it out.</p>

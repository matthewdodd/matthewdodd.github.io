            . I live at Winchmore-hill. On the 6th of June, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking in <placeName id="t18230625-14-crimeloc85">Long-lane</placeName>

I put it inside, and saw the prisoner behind me - Pettifer passed me on the left hand; Morgan came between me and my friend. I walked forward, and looked Pettifer in the face; he turned his head from me - an officer came and took him, and desired me to hold him, which I did, while he ran across Smithfield and brought Morgan back. My handkerchief had been drawn quite out - I caught it in falling. Nobody but them were near enough to take it; it could not have dropped by accident. I think Morgan was nearest to me.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I was in Long-lane, and saw the prisoners in company with another, and watched them from Charter-house-lane, down to Smithfield. I saw Morgan lift up Mr. Radford's pocket, put his fingers in, and draw the handkerchief a little way out; he went twelve or fourteen yards further, and Morgan took it quite out - the other two were close behind, covering him; I was on the other side, and saw Mr. Radford put his hand back, and lay hold of it. I ran over - he went and looked Pettifer in the face. I said, "Hold him while I fetch the other;" I ran across Smithfield-bars, and caught Morgan. The other escaped down Long-lane.</p>

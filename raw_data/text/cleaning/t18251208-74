The officer came up, and took his hand out of his pantaloons, and he had my handkerchief in it - he said he had found it - it was safe in my coat pocket just before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was eight or nine yards behind the gentleman, and saw this handkerchief on the curb; I picked it up, and put it into my pocket: I wanted to pass the prosecutor, who was walking with a lady, rather slowly, and in passing I touched the lady's heel; she turned round; the gentleman said I had robbed him - I said I had found a handkerchief, and if it was his he might have it; the officer came up, and insisted upon his giving charge of me.</p>

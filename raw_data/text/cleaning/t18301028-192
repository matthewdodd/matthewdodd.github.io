               <p>EDWARD COHEN. I live in Great St. Helen's, and at Suffolk-place, Islington. I had been round the coast, and returned to town on the 21st of August, by the Margate steam-boat - we landed about four o'clock, at St. Katharine's; Cooper, by my direction, met me there - my wife and two daughters were with me; I had nine large packages, containing the articles stated in the indictments - I had seen them packed up, and they were in the steamboat with me; Cooper was my porter - he had a truck with him to carry them in; I saw them all in the truck, and Cooper went to Great St. Helen's with them - he said to me that a person whom he had known some time, had offered, just at the dock gate, to assist him, and they both came together to Great St. Helens with the truck; Cooper there asked me if I would allow Smith, the person who was with him, to take the luggage to my residence at Islington - he said he knew him to be an honest man, and he would go part of the way with him; I allowed him so to do - I then went with my family to Islington, and reached there about half-past six or seven o'clock; I waited till nine, and, as the luggage did not arrive, I sent my servant to town to inquire if it was coming - I went to town myself, about half-past ten o'clock, but could get no account of my property; I went in the morning to Lambeth-street office, and gave information, and three or four days afterwards Lee produced some articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280085"></xptr>trusted them to Cooper? A. Yes, and he recommended Smith at Great St. Helens - I did not say at the office that Smith met me at the wharf; I did not see him till he was at St. Helens - he went with Cooper; I gave my consent that he should take the goods - Cooper said he was an honest man, and he would take them safely: I suppose he had to go two miles and a half - they were in a common truck, not more than my own porter could conveniently take care of; Cooper said he himself wished to go away -I saw them in St. Helens, and Cooper and Smith were there together; a few articles and some wrappers were found where Smith lived - I have seen Jane Smith several times at Lambeth-street, and once or twice at the prison, where I went to ascertain where the property was; she had a shift, which was among this property, on her back - she went up stairs with the matron and my wife, and they found it on her; I was before the Grand Jury when she was examined - I did not say I would have her transported if she did not tell the facts; I said most likely she would be transported if she did not state the facts.</p>

            . I am a porter in the employ of Mr, Cohen. I went to meet him on his return, on the 24th of August - I took the nine packages into a truck; this was about half-past four, or a quarter before five o'clock - I saw Smith just at the time the steam-boat came up, and he shoved behind the truck in going to St. Helen's -I then found it was so late that I was obliged to go elsewhere; Smith there took charge of the truck from my recommendation - all the things were then in it, and he was to take it to No. 3, Suffolk-place, Lower-road, Islington: I did not know where Smith lived - I went with him to Liverpool-street, and there left him; I had a pint of beer before I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What made you recommend him? A. I always took him to be an honest hard-working chap - I dare say I had known him twelve months or longer; I had not seen him before that, perhaps, for two or three months - I did not know what was in these packages; there were two hampers, two portmanteaus, two large boxes, and a bag - there were nine in all; I cannot exactly give you the description of the others - there was a white cloth over them before I saw them; there was one cloth over each of two packages - I left Smith about the middle of Liverpool-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you come from? A. From Newgate - I was taken with these prisoners, and have been there ever since: I have not seen Mr. Cohen in Newgate, but I did at Clerkenwell - I saw him there a good many times; he asked me a good many questions - he asked if I knew Lyall; I said I did not - he said he would give me fourteen years if I did not tell him all about it; he did not threaten me with any thing else - he did not touch me at all; I told him at first I did not know Lyall, but after he spoke to me I told him I did - I said before the Magistrate that Mr. Cohen had threatened me, and I was frightened; I did refuse to swear to what I had said in consequence of Mr. Cohen's threats - I said nothing against the other two, and did not know the name of Lyall till it was suggested to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know what was brought to the place? A. Gowns and linen; I put some of the linen on- it was claimed by Mrs. Cohen; I told the Magistrate I was frightened - the things were at my husband's on the Tuesday before I was taken.</p>

On a Tuesday evening I saw Smith bringing a load in a truck - I do not know the day of the month; he stopped at his own door, took out a very handsome small box, a carpet bag, and a white deal box; he looked over, saw me looking at him, and let down the end of the truck on the curb; I was standing with my baby in my arms - he then took out the other things which seemed to be boxes, but I could not well see what they were; on the following morning, between six and seven o'clock, I saw a cart come to take away the things - there were two men and a woman besides the carter; I cannot tell who either of them were except Sheen, he was the carter, but I did not see him take any thing from the house - he was in the cart guiding the horse; I did not notice any name on the cart; it went away and returned not long after - I cannot tell the time - it took some things away then; there did not seem to be much - it might have taken them all at once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the cart larger than the truck? A. Yes, it would have held twice as much as the truck did; I cannot tell whether there was any necessity for it to return.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and lived at the corner of Angel-passage. One Wednesday morning, about seven o'clock, or a few minutes after, I was sitting at work, and heard a cart; I looked through my window, and saw a cart unloading by two men, who were Lyall and Stewart - I saw two parcels taken out of it; there was another man, but I cannot tell who that was -I saw one woman with them; I did not see any name on the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see more than two parcels? A. No; I saw one was a largish bundle with a kind of blanket outside.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, in about a fortnight.</p>

            . I live in Flower and Dean-street.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. In consequence of information, on the 28th of August I went to No. 14, Cheshire-street, Waterloo-town; I found Mrs Smith there, and under the bed I found a quantity of handkerchiefs, stockings, napkins, and other articles of wearing apparel; there were eight muslin handkerchiefs, five pieces of muslin, four stockings, a shift, and a number of other things - I found a knife and a clothes-brush; that was all I found then - I took the woman to Lambeth-street, and found on her two keys; I then went to No. 1 or 2, in Flower and Dean-street - I there found the pieces of a deal box, and the embers of what appeared to have been a hamper, burned in the fire; my brother officer found a handkerchief with Mr. Cohen's initials on it - I did not see any man at either place; on the 11th of September I went to Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, and took Sheen, where he lived with his father - I inquired if he had taken any goods of any description from a house in Flower and Dean-street, on the 25th of August; he said he had - I asked how often he went; he said once with a cart, and he took them into Bishopsgate-street, as far as the halfpenny toll - he there met two men with a horse and cart, that the men told him they were tired of waiting, and they thought he was not coming; he said their cart came from Westminster and had oysters in it - he said he put the things into that cart and he was to have 1s. 6d. for the job; he also stated that it was at half-past seven in the morning when he moved those things - he did not say from whom he was to have the 1s. 6d.; on the 16th of September I went to Stewart's house, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street, in company with Shelswell and another person - I found Stewart, and told him I apprehended him on a charge of receiving goods, knowing them to be stolen; he said very well, he would go - I searched the room, and there were four square pieces of deal which appeared to have been a deal box - he and his wife were in bed; Shelswell took from under the bed a piece of a deal box with some chalk writing on it; it got rubbed out, but I can nearly recollect what was written on it - there were four or five silk gowns, twenty-five other gowns, eighteen towels, stockings, handkerchiefs, caps, and a variety of articles; and 16s., 1l., 14s., and other sums put at the end of each lot, as if they had been sold for that - I found in the box two skeleton-keys, a picklock-key, a crow-bar; on a further search, when I was there, there was a hole in the ceiling, and Shelswell and another person got through the hole and brought down a great quantity of house breaking implements, such as jemmies, crow-bars, &amp;c.; I took them, and then went and took Lyall, in Castle-street, Whitechapel, very near where Sheen lives - I searched his promises and saw a bottle of oil, but I did not take it at that time: I described it to Mr. Cohen, who desired me to bring it away - this is it; I told Lyall what I took him for.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Mr. Cohen did not describe the bottle till you had told him of it? A. No; this is the board that had the writing on it - I do not know how it got rubbed off; I did not take a copy of what was on it - I will swear it was not in pencil - I mentioned at the Police-office what Sheen said about the cart and the oysters.</p>

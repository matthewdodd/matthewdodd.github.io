On the night of the 3d of August I went into the yard about seven o'clock, and on my return I missed a watch from hook, which I had seen not five minutes before - it cost me between 2l. 10s. and 3l. about a month before; I had made an exchange with a person, who is not here, and it was never valued at that - I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>JAMES BLAKE. On the 3d of August, at ten minutes past seven o'clock, I passed by Singleton's shop door, and saw the prisoner run out, about a yard before me - a boy called Stop thief! - finding a watch was missing, I followed calling Stop thief! - I lost sight of him while he turned the corner - he was secured.</p>

            . I serve in my brother's shop. On this evening the prisoner and another person came in, and asked for some tobacco - the prisoner said, "Dick, we shall want two pipes;" he immediately reached over the counter, took the watch, and ran out; Blake asked me what he had taken - I told him - the prisoner was secured afterwards; I had seen him before, walking about the street; the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you never said that the other person came in first? A. Yes - he did; I was serving him with tobacco when the prisoner came in - he was about a minute in the shop.</p>

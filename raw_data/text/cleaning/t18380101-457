                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, and live in Grove-hill-terrace, Grove-lane, Camberwell. There is a gentleman in the neighbourhood named Ryder—he is an independent gentleman, and lives just below me—I have known him some time—I saw the prisoner at my shop on the evening of the 18th of November, about six o'clock—we had candles lighted—I was sitting at tea in the parlour, behind the shop—he came and asked for change, as we understood at first, for a person named Wright—he came, and held the shop door in his band, and pushed it back against my desk, holding the hasp in his hand—he put his head in, and asked for change for a £5 note—I thought he said for Mr. Wright—I got op from my table, and walked towards the parlour door, to go into the shop—I said, "Change for who?"—he said, "For Mr. Ryder, a little below"—Mr. Ryder lives in Walworth-place, which is a little below my house—I put my hand into my left hand pocket, and pulled out five sovereigns—he had a £ note in his hand—it appeared to me a bank-note—I took the five sovereigns from my pocket, gave them to him, and he wrote the name of Ryder on the note—he did it of his own accord—he wrote "Ryder"—nothing else—he took away the sovereigns, and I saw no more of him—I took the note, and marked it with a mark—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a note.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think you had seen the prisoner before, and take him for another man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh! the face is very familiar to me—I took his face to be one I knew when he came into the shop on the Saturday night—I thought I knew him, but I found out I was wrong—I know his face is very familiar to me—I did not say I thought I knew him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you hear that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the reason I said that was, because another person's face was familiar to me, and I thought I knew him so well, I did not hesitate in giving him the money—I looked at him very bard, and when I came to see him again, I knew his face again, and it is the very same person I gave the money to—the person I thought it was lives at Was worth—I was mistaken, but the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long after receiving the note did you see the prisoner again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I saw him at the police-office, before the Magistrate—I do not know how long that was after I changed the note—I suppose it is a month ago that I went up the first time, but I did not set it down—it was on a Tuesday—I recollect that—there was more than a week between the two occasions—I should not think there was a month, but I will not swear it—I will not swear one way or the other—I will swear it was not six weeks.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is said you took him for another man, how long did that opinion last in your mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not longer than till I saw him again—when he first came into the shop I took him for one Parsons, but I recollected by looking at him that he was not Parsons—I looked hard at him, as the candle was close by me, and found it was not Parsons—I took more par<lb></lb>ticular notice of him to ascertain whether it was Parsons or not—my boy was in the shop at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Montague. On the 18th of Novem<lb></lb>ber I was in the shop when the prisoner came in for change—he opened the door, and I first understood him to ask to change Mr. Wright a £5 note—master got up from his tea-table, came to the door, and said, "Mr. who?"—he said, "Mr. Rider, a little below"—master came round to the counter, put his hand into his left-hand pocket and pulled out five sovereigns—I stood at the further end of the counter—I saw him lay a paper down on the counter—he said, "Shall I write Rider on it?"—master said, "Yes," and while he was doing so, master put five sovereigns on the counter—I did not see what became of the paper—master took it—he did not show it to me—I saw the prisoner afterwards at Lambeth-street, and knew him again.</p>

               <p>for three months imprisonment, and he asked me to read the particulars to him—that is about six months ago—I should say he had asked me to read the paper to him half a dozen times within six months—he came to a public house I used in an evening, and when he wanted to know the particular I read it to him—on another occasion he gave me a stamp, and said it might be of service to me—I said, "What stamp is it, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or what?"—he said, "I don't know"—I took it up, and looked at it, and he said, "Look at him, he is looking if it is a <hi rend="italic">January</hi> one," instead of a genuine one.</p>

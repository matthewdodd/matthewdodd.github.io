On the 22d of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him leave work, he passed me; I was at that moment inquiring if my orders respecting the cuttings of lead had been complied with. I called to him as he passed, and said,</p>
               <p>"Plumber, have you brought down any cuttings?" He did not attend to me, but kept walking on. I called again, he said,</p>
               <p>"Sir;" but kept still going on. I followed, and overtook him just beyond the gateway which leads out of the premises. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you stop, don't you hear what I say to you?" On looking at him I saw he had something concealed under his dress, and on laying my hand on his side, I felt something which I had no doubt was lead, brought him back a short distance towards the premises, and called Churchill and Welch. While I was endeavouring to get the lead from him it fell from under his waistcoat. He said he hoped I would look it over. I said I should make an example of him, as a warning to others. He was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked there - A. One week; the lead is mine. I had given orders that the cuttings should be brought to the counting-house, which is inside the gate, he had passed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He said he went outside the gate for a necessary purpose - A. No. He had come down a ladder sixty feet high from where he worked; the men usually carry lead on their shoulders.</p>

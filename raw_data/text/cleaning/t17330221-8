My House was robbed in the Night between the 22d and 23d of June, but none of the outward Part of my House being broken, I imagin'd that the Person who robb'd me had got in, in the Evening, and lay conceal'd till I and my Family were a bed, and then committed the Fact, and went out at the Door, for the Door was found a jar in the Morning. I had some Suspicion of the Prisoner, because she was seen in the Neighbourhood the Day before, and was well acquainted with my House. Upon which I went to her Lodging, and heard that she did not lie there that Night as I was robb'd. On the 28th of September I went after her to Shrewsbury, and -</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you stay so long before you pursued her?</p>
               <p>Crow. Because I expected her up again in a Month, and so thought to have saved that Trouble and Charge; but hearing she had taken a House at Oswistry in Shropshire, in order to settle there, I went, as I was saying, to Shrewsbury, where I got a Warrant to search her House. When I came thither, I found her at Home, and as soon as she saw me, she open'd a Chest, and took out a Pair of Stays that I had lost, and gave 'em to me. Jenny, says I, Where's your Mistress's Cloak and Hat? She said she'd fetch them; and so she did. And then she took the Tea-Spoons and Tongs out of the Chest, but told me, they were none of mine. I believe they were the same that I lost; but I can't swear to them, because they were not mark'd. I charg'd her with stealing these, and other Goods from me; but she said, those Goods and 20 l. were given her, by the Person who did the Robbery, that she might not discover it, and that she had nothing that belong'd to me, but what she had return'd to me; but next Day (Sept. 29.) when she was carry'd before the Justice, she said, she had bought the Goods; and her Father and Brother coming to intercede for her, I shew'd them a List of what I had lost, and ask'd them, if they knew any thing of those Goods? They said, Yes; and (while her Father staid) her Brother went and fetch'd my Coat, Waistcoat and Breeches, and she said, she bought them too.</p>

I hired the prisoner about eleven months ago to take care of one of my shops. About two or three months ago, I went into Mr. Bullock's auction-rooms, and saw two lamps which I knew; here is one of them - I can swear it is mine; I think it had been on my premises the week before, but I cannot state on what day; I gave charge of the prisoner for stealing this lamp, and he said "For God's sake have mercy on my family."</p>

            . I believe this lamp was sold at one of my sales; it had been brought by a young woman about twenty years of age, who I believe is the prisoner's daughter; it was brought in the name of Loveland; the same person had brought a lamp and an ink-stand in April last, and a few days afterwards she brought this letter: she stated that her father was a manufacturer of these articles,</p>

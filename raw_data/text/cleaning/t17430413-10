            . I live at Ruslip. On the 15th of March the Prisoner broke my House open between Ten and Twelve, in the Forenoon, when I was out at Work; there was no Body in the House; I was informed, by the Neighbours, that she went through a Farm-Yard, about a Quarter of a Mile from my House, that she had nothing with her then, and when she returned again she was loaded; I followed her by the Description only, and she was in Bed, when I found her, at a House where they lodge Travellers, at Westhide, in an Outhouse; I desired her to let me see what she had in her Bundle; she pulled them out, and I found them to be my own Things; - there was the Bacon, a Bit of Butter and Cheese, and the other Things mentioned in the Indictment: I had her before a Justice, and he sent her to Hertford - When the Neighbours charged her with breaking open the House she did not deny taking of the Things; and said, she was sorry for what she had done. - She said, the Glass of the Window was broke before, and that she put her Hand in at the Window and unbolted the Door.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a Window was it?</p>
               <p>Weatherly. It was a Glass-Light: The Window was broke, and the Glass and Lead were turned up.</p>

               <p>PETER MASON. Q. You are an officer - on the 27th of November last, did you in company with Armstrong and Bishop, go to the house of Metcalfe. - A. I did; between eleven and twelve o'clock. We went to a house in Red Lion market, leading out of Whitecross-street into Golden-lane; Metcalfe acknowledged it was his house. Mr. Armstrong went in first; we went through the first room into the back room, and there Metcalfe, the woman, and Benjamin, the three prisoners, were all standing in that back room, and a quantity of linen was laying in the middle of the floor. Armstrong asked who the linen belonged to; they all denied it belonged to them. Mr. Armstrong said as there were none of them that owned it, he would take and see if he could find an owner. Bishop, I believe, found something in the bed; we took them and the linen to the office.</p>

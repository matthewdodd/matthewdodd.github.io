                  </hi> I keep the Coach and Horses, at Greenwich. It is my dwelling-house—on 19th Oct., about eleven in the morning, I left in my bed-room, on the third floor, a watch, a chain, two brooches, and a ring—the watch and chain were on the mantel-piece, and the brooches and rings on the table—I left the door shut, but not locked—I went up again about five in the afternoon, and they were gone—about ten in the evening the witness, Evans, called on me and produced the watch and chain—this now produced is it—this gold brooch is also mine; it was given me by Mrs. Matthew—I know the prisoner by sight—I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the watch and chain, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the brooch, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the ring.</p>

                  </hi> I live in East-lane, Greenwich. On 19th Oct., about a quarter-past seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Greenwich—I knew him before—he had a watch and chain round his neck—I afterwards went into the Red Lion public-house, and saw him there—I saw him give the watch to a young man named Fitzgerald, who gave it to a man named Daley to look at—I said I though I knew the owner of if—Daley, upon that, gave it to me, and I took it straight to Mr. Buckland.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Matthews. On 19th Oct., about five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house—I had seen him before—he had a guard round his neck, a watch in his bosom, a ring on his finger, and a brooch in his shirt—this is the brooch—he asked if I would give him a bit of bread—I gave it him, and he said, "Do you want to buy a brooch?"—I said, "What do you want for it?"—he said, "What will you give me?"—I said, "Sixpence"—he said, "Not sixpence"—I said, "I will give you a shilling," and I bought it—I asked how he came by it—he said he found it at the fair—he asked me to buy the ring, but I said I had no more money—I did not ask him how the came by that—on the 20th a neigh<lb></lb>bour came in, and in consequence of what she said I took the brooch to Mr. Buckland.</p>

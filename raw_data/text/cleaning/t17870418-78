               <p>Is there no other women's hose put down the same day? - There are after that was found out, and after the prisoner was taken up; there are two more entries in his hand writing; he was taken up three or four hours after; there appears to be five or six different entries by the prisoner, the rest was made by a brother of mine who is now in the shop; when I found the deficiency in the account, I went out and informed Mr. Lock and another person, that I supposed he had the money upon him; they came in and I charged him with it, and he immediately pulled out two shillings of the marked money, and threw them on the table, there was another shilling he had in his pocket, and he said that was his own; Mr. Lock took up the two shillings, and said, those were them he sent

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. How much was in the till at the time this happened? - There was half a guinea in gold, three half crowns, and three sixpences, and eighteen-pence in halfpence; I left it so the night before.</p>
               <p>Court. Then what became of the other 4 s? - I had paid them away in change, I took them from the till, they were in the till the same morning they were compared with the other two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My question to you is, when you called in Mr. Lock, and enquired into the state of your till, what money was there in the till? - There was three half crown pieces, half a guinea and five marked shillings, and I believe another shilling and two sixpences, which was taken for a quarter of a yard of baize.</p>

               <p>Did you see what he did with the till afterwards? - No, I came out of the shop immediately, I am quite sure he put them in the till, I took notice, because I understood I was sent to try whether he would take this money or no, therefore I observed what he did.</p>

The offence of servants in general, robbing their masters, and more especially those that are entrusted with the property of their masters, is a crime which so entirely cuts up every bond of civil society, that it is the duty of the Courts of Justice, at all times to punish it with severity; the Court therefore think you ought not to remain any longer in this country, and the sentence upon you is, that you be</p>

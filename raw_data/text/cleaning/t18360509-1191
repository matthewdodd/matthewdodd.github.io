                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Hall of Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street. I was in the shop on the 5th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came in for a skein of silk, and while I turned my back to get it out of the drawer he took thirteen handkerchiefs with his own handkerchief under his arm—I saw them through the corner of his handkerchief—he drawn them close to the edge of the counter, but they were not off the counter—I took hold of his collar—his arm was on the handkerchief on the counter—they were off the pile, and his handker<lb></lb>chief was rolled round them, but the corners were not tied—they were ready to put under his arm—they might have fallen from the pile by acci<lb></lb>dent, but could not have got rolled up.</p>

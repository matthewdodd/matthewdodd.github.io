                  </hi>. I live in Plumber-street, City-road, and am a window. The prisoner was employed by me at his own house—I had given him this leather at different times to make shoes—I did not ask him for the shoes or the leather—I used to give him two dozen, and then he would bring in perhaps half of them, and he has <hi rend="italic">cabbaged</hi> the leather—this is my leather, and ought to have been made into shoes—I was nearly losing my work from my master.</p>

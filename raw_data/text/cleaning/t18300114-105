The two prisoners came together to my shop on the 18th of December, and asked to look at some black worsted stockings at 10 1/2 d. per pair; they said they were not good enough - I then showed them some at 1s. 6d.; Smith talked about a variety of things, but did not ask for goods, but McCollin did- she said the stockings at 1s. 6d. were too high, and she should like some at 1s.3d. - I said I had none at that price, but I should have some the next day, and I would let her have a pair of them at 1s. 4d.; I at last agreed to let her have a pair for 1s. 3d., but she said she would call next day - she then turned to Smith, and said, "You want a pair, don't you?" Smith said Yes - I said, "I have plenty that will fit her;" they said they would wait till next day, and they both left the shop - soon afterwards, I missed three pairs of stays from the corner of the window which Smith had been standing near; the officer afterwards brought the stays to my shop - I had never seen the prisoners before; McCollin offered me a bribe, which I refused.</p>

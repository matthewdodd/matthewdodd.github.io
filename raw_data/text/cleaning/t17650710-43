               <p>I took the lodgings, and I paid the rent for three weeks; the things went one at a time; but I did not know where they were gone. The reason of my disguise was, I being unfortunately upon the town, that situation was not agreeable to me, and I disguised myself to get from it. I have lived some time in a brew-house; there I was discovered by a person that knew me; since that I have employed myself as a taylor, where I was apprehended.</p>

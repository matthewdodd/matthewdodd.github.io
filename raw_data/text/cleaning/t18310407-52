            . I was going into Bishopsgate-street on an errand, and called on Duncan - we went out together; I had never seen the prisoner but twice before; I saw him in Crown-street - he crossed, and took this article from Mr. Knight's; I supposed it to be a roll of calico or linen - I did not see the house he took it into, because I had Duncan's child, and I was rather behing her; he ran away with it - I did not tell the officer of it; I saw the prisoner in about ten minutes at a public-house -Mrs. Duncan said to him, "Sam, what have you done with that?" I cannot tell exactly what he said, but I think he said he had made it all right - she told him the Police would he after him, and he muttered something which I could not understand; I swear positively that he took something from the bottom rail of the door, and ran away directly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 28th of February, about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, I received information that the prisoner had committed a robbery in Crown-street; as his person was well known to me I looked out for him, and soon afterwards I met him - I asked him if he had any thing about him; he said No - I asked if he had any thing in his mouth, and I found he had 1s.; Duncan told me of the robbery about half-past eleven o'clock, but I had heard of it before.</p>

I was drinking with a friend, and got a little in liquor; I went home, and went to bed - I then got up again, and went with two or three more friends down to the Unicorn; Mrs. Duncan came there, and said something to me - she stopped drinking with me till the house was shut up; I then went home to her house, and went out for something more to drink before I was taken; when I came out with her and her sister she gave charge of me - I have her own sister outside, who will swear she took a half-sovereign from me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister-in-law. About three months ago I was going, through Shoreditch, and met the young woman he used to keep company with; she said, "If I could only find out a plan to get that thief out of the country" - I said, "Forget and forgive;" She said she never would, and once within seven years she would do for him - he had a good character, and I was astonished to hear her say so; she said she would not mind taking any one's life away so long as she could live - I never was here before; I could get my character where I have worked for nine years - I swear the prisoner has borne a good character; I heard that he fell into a misfortune about twelve months ago, but I cannot tell where he was tried - I did not speak to the family at that time; the person he lived with is worse than he is.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HURLEY. I have kept company with the prisoner six or eight months - his father, mother, and sister mustered up half a sovereign towards doing him good; I brought it to him, laid it under my pillow, and in the morning it was taken away by Duncan, my own sister, who is far worse than the prisoner is.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The officer knows when I was taken before I was innocent - I was only having a pint of beer in the house where a robbery was committed.</p>

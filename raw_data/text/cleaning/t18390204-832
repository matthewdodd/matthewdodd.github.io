                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. I produce some silk handkerchiefs which I received on Wednesday evening, the 23rd of January, from the serjeant-major of the rifle brigade—in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to Mr. Whistler's shop at Greenwich, and afterwards to the barracks, and took the prisoner—I told him the charge—he said he had received the handkerchiefs from a girl at Deptford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant-major in the rifle brigade, stationed at Woolwich. The prisoner was a private in the corps—on the morning of the 23rd of January, I sent for him, and asked him if three handkerchiefs given to me by Ford, belonged to him—he said they did, and they were given to him by a girl at Deptford—he had one round his neck of the same pattern—I desired him to take that off, and reported it to the commanding officer, who desired me to give them to the constable to make inquiry about them—there was room for a dozen handkerchiefs under his waistcoat.</p>

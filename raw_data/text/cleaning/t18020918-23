             sworn. - I am a schoolmaster, No. 1. Crescent, Kingsland-road; there is only a party-wall that divides my premises from the prosecutor's; on the 23d of July, I saw the prisoner lurking about the gate; I watched a few minutes, and saw him coming out of the yard, and the prosecutor's little girl following him, crying and saying, what shall I do, the house is robbed, and my mammy will beat me; I followed him; two young gentlemen, my parlour boarders, got before him, and he turned back; I stopped him, and asked him if he had taken any thing from the cottage, he was in a violent passion and said, you had better let me go, and kept feeling in his breast pockets with great violence; I took him back into the school-yard, and made him sit down upon a stool; I then saw a watch in his great-coat pocket; I asked him to let me look at it, and he put it in his job; I saw G. S. at the back of it; in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I saw a silk handkerchief in the crown of his hat; I sent for an officer, and he was taken into custody.(Peter Mason, an officer, produced the property, which was identified by Mrs. Goodson.)</p>

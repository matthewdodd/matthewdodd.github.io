On Friday the 6th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was looking at a boot-shop, in Middle-row, Holborn; Turner came up and entered into conversation with me; he represented himself as a cattle-dealer from the country. We walked together into Southampton-buildings, went into the <placeName id="t18210718-96-crimeloc558">Blue Posts, public-house</placeName>

In a few moments Hawkins came in, and sat himself down by my side, and called himself a tradesman from the country - he said he had been poorly, and came to London for advice, and was going back next morning. Soon after, in came a third, with a glass of liquor, and sat on the other side of the room. We three were at one table. Hawkins and the third man began laying bets, and in about a minute, the third man said we were all poor fellows - the prisoners appeared angry at that, and asked what he would bet that we could not shew 10 l. a-piece - he said he would bet us each 1 l. Hawkins then asked if I could produce 10 l. - I said I had no money about me, but I had 10 l. at home, and both the prisoners said they had not got it, but could go home and fetch it in the course of two hours. We all went out to fetch our notes, and were to meet directly. I went home and got a 10 l. Bank note, and put the number on a piece of paper. I returned to the Blue Posts, public-house, in about an hour and a quarter, and found them all three in the tap-room. They came into the same room to me. The prisoners shewed their 10 l. notes - I do not know whether they were notes, they only shewed them in their hands. I then produced mine in my hand, and put it in my pocket again. The man said he had lost his bet, but never offered to pay. Hawkins and him betted double or quit with all three of us - I did not understand what it was about; we lost it. A 10 l. note was to be put down to bind the bet. I put my 10 l. note into a hat with theirs, as they proposed it to bind the bet. They sent for a dictionary to decide the bet, and said I had lost it. I said I had only lost the double or quit - I never meant to bet the 10 l. note. I caught hold of the hat, to take my note out - I took a piece of newspaper out of it, which I thought was my note till I opened it. I then asked for my 10 l. note - they said if I gave up the hat I should have the 10 l. I did so - they then all said I should have 5 l., and all run away together. I stopped them all in the passage for a few minutes, to prevent them getting out, and called the landlord - nobody came; a man said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180046"></xptr>would fetch a constable, but none came; and seeing I could get no assistance, I ran over to the next public-house for assistance, and, in the meantime, all ran away. I went with a constable, and found the prisoners about two hundred yards off, in a court, and am sure they are the men; the third man was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have I not seen you here before - A. Never. I had been in the City, to enquire for a situation. I did not intend to gamble - if I had won, I should not have taken it. I did not give them the note to get change. I had received it from Mr. Graves of the Strand. I think I should know the third man if he was dressed as he was then. I asked nobody to get change. I am a Scotchman.</p>

               <p>"This is no thoroughfare."

               <p>TURNER'S Defence. I wish the people to be called from the Blue-posts and Three-tuns public-houses, as I understand the note was offered there for change; I saw Cooper looking at some forged notes which were stuck in a window, he said he was Scotch, I said. I came from Hertfordshire - I was the last that left the house, and did not run away, I fell on my knees, and begged the man to restore the note.</p>

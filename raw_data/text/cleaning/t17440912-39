            . On the 1st of July about ten o'clock at night, I met the Prisoner, and asked her the way to the water-side; she sent me down an alley and followed me, clapped her hand upon my shoulder, and asked me where I was going? I saw a watchman, and asked him if that was the way to the water-side? He said it was not, and drove the Prisoner out before him. I put my hand into my pocket and missed my handkerchief, and found it under her arm holes in the watch-house - I am a Gardener, I live at Rotherbith .</p>

            , I lodged at that time in the house, I looked round the shop, and found it had been robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment, they were all my property; when I went to bed I double locked the door, I am quite sure they were all safe when I went to bed; I went the same morning to Justice Blackborough's, and informed him, and he granted me a warrant; and Dinmore and me went and took a man that we suspected, who lodged in the same house, we found him in Gold-lane, and he was committed to prison; afterwards, when the prisoner was taken up, which was in his own room, I saw my shirt upon his back.</p>
               <p>Did he make any opposition to your looking at the shirt? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the shirt? - Yes, when it was taken off my wife swore to it; I saw it taken off him, and there was a woman whom he said was his wife, and we desired her to pull off her shirt, and we retired while she stripped, for decency, but she pulled it off, and opened the door, and gave the shift into my hand; when we got to the Justices, the prisoner before me owned the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him favour? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you threaten him? - No, he said, before the Justice, that he robbed me, and that it was through a woman that lodges in the house that he robbed me; he said, he had sold the rest of the things to a Jew, and the woman said you have not sold them all, for you have a pair of shoes on belonging to the man; and his shoes were then taken off, and I swore to them, having been at work on them the night before for a customer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you would make it up for two guineas? - I never spoke to him in my life, only the time he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make any offer to him? - Nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses that he offered to make it up.</p>

               <p>Thomas Maccullock. On the 4th of May, I let the Prisoner a ready-furnished Lodging; there being a Paper put into the Key-hole of his Door, gave me some Suspicion; however I looked through and saw that the Glass was gone, so I got a Warrant to search: He was in the Room, but would not let me in, nor give any Answer; he attempted to jump out of the Window, but at last he opened the Door, confessed the Things were taken away, but did not say by whom.</p>

            . I knew the Things were in the Room when he took it; he was going to jump out of the Window, his Body was out, only his two Hands had hold of the Cell of the Window. I was in the Court then; he owned he took a Sauce-pan.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said a young Man, who had lodged with him for a Fortnight, carried off the Glass: Several People gave him a good Character. <rs id="t17430629-65-verdict357" type="verdictDescription">

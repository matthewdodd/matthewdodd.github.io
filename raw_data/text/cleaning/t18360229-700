                  </hi>. I am a police-constable. On the 7th of February, between five and six o'clock, in the morning I saw the prisoner going up Arlington-street, Hampstead-road—he was with a person of the name of Jones—the prisoner was carrying a basket under his arm—I wantched them down towards Wellington-street, which is a quarter of a mile from there—that is where the prosecutor lives—I saw them coming back at half-part six o'clock—the prisoner was carrying a basket on his shoulder on the dark side of the road—I went and asked him what he had got—he said meat, and that he was employed to carry it—I said, "I saw you go up the road an hour ago, with the basket empty"—he said, "No, you did not, it was full then"—I took him into custody—I know the basket was empty when I first saw him—I then found the prosecutor, and shewed the articles to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, Camden-town. On the Sunday evening I saw the basket at the station-house—it contained my property—I saw it last at eleven o'clock on Saturday evening, in the safe in the area, which is between nine and ten feet from the street—there are no steps—there were 7lbs. of mutton, 1lb. of butter, 2 loaves, 1lb. of cheese, and 1lb, of dripping—I can swear it was mine, and I missed it on Sunday morning at half-past seven o'clock—the safe was not locked—I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

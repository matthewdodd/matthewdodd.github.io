               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>C. Chambers. I saw him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he before you or behind you?</p>
               <p>C. Chambers. He came behind me. He had spoke to me a little before. I met him about three weeks after with the breeches and waistcoat on, by the Alms Houses in St. Giles's. Said he, What do you want with me? I took him by the collar, and said, Let me have the things. Then he knocked me down, and said, You b - h! She is my wife, and said I was dead-drunk, and he wanted the key to go home; so he got away.</p>
               <p>Richard Row. I was the constable. I took up the prisoner on the ninth of April, for breaking open a house. I hearing he had robbed this woman, I asked him what he had done with the clothes; he said he had got the breeches on, and was willing to pay for the things.</p>

               <p>That night I met her in the street, she wanted me to bring her to the club and pay for her. I would not. She came and hallooed out and said, I had robbed her of all her clothes. After she swore the robbery on me, she never served me with a warrant, but wanted me to give her half a guinea.</p>

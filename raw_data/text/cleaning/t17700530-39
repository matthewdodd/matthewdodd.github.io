I took it up. There came an elderly man to me and said, Have you lost any thing? I said I had not, for I had got it. He said, Then let him go. I held him, and called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the prisoner belongs to?</p>
               <p>Wright. His father is a taylor. He has applied to me, and said if I would let him off he would send him to sea.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Fleet-street, having been drinking with my brother. I saw two other chaps by the gentleman. I walked on and got between him and the chaps: his handkerchief was about half way out. He turned round, and said I was going to pick his pocket, and called the watch.

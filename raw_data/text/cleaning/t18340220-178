I live next door to the prosecutor - on the 7th of February, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I saw Buckle pass my door with something in his hands, which induced me to go and ask Mr. Spencer if he had lost anything; and I told him which way Buckle went; I remained at the shop door, and in a few minutes I saw a boy at the window, who, I thought, was connected with him, and I taxed him with it; and from what he said, he and I went after Mr. Spencer; he took us to Crew's house, in York-buildings - he went and tapped at the shutter twice with two signal knocks - he then knocked at the door, and wished us to wait outside; but I pressed forwards, and we went in; and on a chair by the side of Crew were the caps, which Spencer identified as his, and asked him how they came there - Crew said they were brought there for sale.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell Buckle to take the caps to Crew's? A. Yes; and to tell Crew to allow them to remain there - I did not hear Crew say that he had refused to buy them, that he would have nothing to do with them.</p>

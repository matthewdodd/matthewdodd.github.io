We then went down stairs again, and found a man ill in bed; Way's husband was there: we found a key of my wine cellar in the bottom of a trunk. I had wine of various kinds -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190037"></xptr>there was Port, orange, and currant: I afterwards missed some wine from my cellar.

            . I live with Mr. Cook, in China-walk. On Saturday evening, the 10th of April, I remember Abigail Wood came there with Mr. Way - Wood said she wanted to speak to Mr. Keele's assistant, Mr. Williams; they went into the dispensary and were there about five minutes; I went down into the kitchen and Wood came down in about five minutes, and asked me to light her - she said she was come for some wine for Mr. Keele; she unlocked the cellar door and filled a basket with bottles of wine - she said some were port and some orange, and some currant; she then asked me to let her go through the area, which she did, and set the basket against the front gate; she came down into the kitchen again and went up into the dispensary, and said she should come again on Monday night: when they went away one of the prisoners took hold of one side of the basket and the other the other - Wood had put eight bottles of wine on the table, which she said were to be divided between Mr. Williams and me. I had never seen her but once, about three weeks before, when I took a note to Mr. Keele.</p>

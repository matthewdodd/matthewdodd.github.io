            . I am night constable of Kentish-town. I met the prisoner on the 27th of May, at twenty minutes before six o'clock, with this bundle; I took him to the watch-house - he said he had bought them at Mr. Gatton's school, at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The officer took a man to the watch-house, and he got away, and on the 12th of June he took me for the other man. Witness. There was no other man with him; when I took him I left him with a watchman named Colley, who walked out, and the prisoner escaped; I took him again afterwards, and am certain he is the man, by the scar on his face - I went to look for him at Crouch-end; he was found at Tottenham, and brought to us.</p>

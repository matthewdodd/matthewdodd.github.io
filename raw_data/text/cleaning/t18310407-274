            . I bought the rags of the prisoner as agent for Dinsdale - they came to 19l. 6s. 1d.; I had paid 1l. on account, and paid the prisoner 18l. 6s. 1d. on the 31st of March - here is a receipt which he signed for it in my presence (read); I paid him the whole amount, but finding 1l. had been paid, he returned that to me.</p>
               <p>MR. DINSDALE. He was to take the money to my employer if I was not in the way - I have not received any of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I received it on Good Friday, and on Saturday was going down to pay Mr. Dinsdale -I got intoxicated, and was robbed on Saturday evening; on Sunday morning I took the party who robbed me to the station-house in Wellclose-square; I was to appear against them at Lambeth-street on Monday, but Mr. Dinsdale came with an officer and took me out of bed.</p>
               <p>MR. DINSDALE. After he was apprehended, he took a German there who could not speak English, and said he had robbed him; the Magistrate was three hours investigating the case, and then said there was not the least charge against the man, and I must prosecute the prisoner - the prisoner said the man and him bad had a glass of rum together, and that ten or twelve people were in the house when he was robbed, but it was proved he was not robbed at all.</p>

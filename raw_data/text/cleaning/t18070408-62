               <p>Q. Did you keep any cocks and hens. - A. Yes, I kept four hens and one cock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep them in the yard. - A. They were taken from the roost, they roosted upon the coalshed door, they had just gone to roost. A little before six I went into a neighbour's house; about half an hour after that a woman called at the door of the house that I was in, Mr. Miller, make haste home, there are theives in the house robbing you. I instantly went home, I saw the house full of people and among them was the prisoner. He was charged with killing three fowls; when I saw him two hens and the cock were laying at his feet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the poultry to be yours. - A Yes.</p>

I was standing in my shop, I heard the fowls flutter, I went into my yard, I saw the cock laying on the ground by the coal-shed door dead; I saw the prisoner walk down to the bottom of the yard, trying to get out, with a hen in each hand, they were dead, I saw them alive just before I saw the prisoner. I secured the prisoner myself; as he was getting out of the yard he tumbled over a board of the fence that was down, and I held him down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the cock and the hens. - A. They are valued at seven shillings and sixpence.</p>

            . I am a watchman. This shop is on my beat. I saw the prisoners on the morning of the 5th of November, at two o'clock - they passed the corner of Wimpole-street; I went round, and met them again once or twice: I then went to look after them, and saw them coming up the mews with this property, about eighty paces from Anthony's shop; the serjeant of our watch took Davis, and I took Teagle; we found the tools upon them at the watch-house: we then went back, and found the shop was broken open. We gave notice to Mr. Anthony; he came and claimed the goods. The door appeared to have been broken open with a screw-driver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see either of us searched? A. Yes. I saw some of the tools found, and then I went to inform Anthony.</p>

As we got to the top of the mews we were taken.</p>

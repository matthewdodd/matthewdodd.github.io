On the 20th of this month (Which was on a Sunday) I lay out of town; and as I was coming home in the morning I met my warehouseman: I was surprised to see him, supposing something wrong had happened: he told me, when he came to work he found the street-door open, and the marks of feet in the garden, and he suppose my apprentice, the prisoner Cook, with somebody else, had done it. When I came home, I found my desk had been forced open. I judged, by a large pair of the scissars which lay by, the screws were forced out of the desk; the lock was still locked. I examined my desk and papers: I found every drawer of papers had been tumbled over, which was, I suppose, to look for bank notes: there were a great many notes of hand, which I found they would not take away. I left in a canvas bag, on the Saturday night, nine or ten guineas, which they took away: there were guineas and half guineas. I-missed forty half-crowns, two crown pieces, two silver dollars, a remarkable medal, a silver pint mug from the kitcken, and four tea-spoons. Cook was missing; he had been my apprentice about two years (he is about eighteen or nineteen years of age): then my two apprentices went in pursuit of him; they brought him home about nine or ten in the morning: there was found upon him eleven half-crowns, and two half-guineas, I believe.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Hamilton's when Cook was taken up: I asked him if he had robbed his master; he said he was concerned in robbing him; that he let a person into the house, about one o'clock in the morning: he said that person went by different names: he acknowledged to his taking part of the half-crowns, and the other person took the gold out of the desk, and gave him three half-guineas for his share. I took from him eleven half-crowns, two half-guineas, and a shilling.</p>

            . I am a Goldsmith, and live in Leaden-hall-street: I bought this ring (I believe) of the prisoner at the bar. Producing a gold ring.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This has been battered sadly since I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tripp. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Tripp. I had half a guinea for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she came by it?</p>
               <p>Tripp. She said she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it weigh ?</p>
               <p>Tripp. It weighs three penny weights and some grains.</p>
               <p>Q. Is half a guinea the full value of it?</p>
               <p>Tripp. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she found it?</p>
               <p>Tripp. She said she found it some where by White-Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Tripp. I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring a neighbour to give her a character?</p>
               <p>Tripp. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop her and the ring too?</p>
               <p>Tripp. It is very common for things to be found so.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have stopped and advertised it, that the right owner might have it again.</p>
               <p>Tripp. If every thing that was found was to be advertised, we should have nothing to do.</p>

            . The prosecutrix came and said, she had lost her ring; I went out to see for her, but she was taken by an acquaintance of mine, after she had made away with the ring.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He did not ask me any questions, but weigh'd it, and throw'd me down half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tripp. What, did not you ask her how she came by it?</p>
               <p>Tripp. No, I ask'd her no particular question.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered the ring to be weighed; the Marshal's man returned with it and said it weighed eleven shillings and eight-pence.</p>

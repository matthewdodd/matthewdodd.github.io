            . On Sunday the first of March, I had been to Deptford, and had got in liquor, not so much, but that I was able to walk home; but I parted with my friends at Deptford, at nine o'clock; I went into the <placeName id="t17720429-79-crimeloc380">Minories</placeName>

I did not know I had any other loss then; I got up, the watchman met me; whom I told, that I had lost my shoe and hat; the watchman said, there was a man just gone by with a shoe in his hand; the watchman and I went after the man that had the shoe; we stoped him; it was the prisoner; he immediately restored me the shoe. I took him to the watch house; the watchman bid me see if I had lost any thing else. The watchman by his lanthorn observed I had a cut in my breeches; I described what I had in my pocket, the same as in the indictment. The prisoner was searched in the watch house, and just that money was found on him. I am sure I had it in my pocket when I left Deptford.</p>

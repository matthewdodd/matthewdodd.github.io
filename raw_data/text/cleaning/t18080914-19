I did, in Harp court, Harp alley, No. 1. up two pair of stairs; there I found a great quantity of glass; all the articles enumerated in the indictment; I went to Mr. Collins' house, after I had been to the prisoner's lodgings; I began with him as though I was a dealer in glass; I first of all asked him where he lived; he said No. 1, Harp court, Harp alley; I informed him I was an officer, and was come to take him in custody on suspicion of robbing his master of a quantity of glass; he made some little hesitation at first, at last he said if he was taken in custody he must go; he seemed in great agitation; I told him there was another officer on his premises with a great quantity of glass; he then said he had taken it from his master, he was sorry for it; I took him away in a coach to Fleet market, left the gentleman in the coach with him, and went up to Hancock the officer to his lodgings; after that we took him to the public house near the office; there he said to his wife, my dear, I have only been married fourteen days, in fourteen days I shall be no more; I took particular notice of that; I searched him, I found two ounces of arsenick; I have had the property ever since in my care.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of 60, Leman-street, White chapel. On the morning of 25th May, between twelve and two o'clock, I was in Whitechapel, on my way home—I met the female prisoner, and went with her to a down-stairs back-room, at Keat-street, Spitalfields—I paid her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I took from my left waistcoat-pocket, and left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I put my clothes on the chair, and asked whether she was going to bed—I heard half-a-crown drop—there was then a knock at the door; she immediately; opened it, and the male prisoner came in, put his knuckles under my collar, and with an oath asked what I wanted there—I said, "I came to sleep"—he said, "If you do not go out I will knock your b----brains out"—I had seen to my waistcoat before he came in, and found nothing in it—I slipped my trowsers on, and ran into the yard after the woman, but lost her—I then returned to get my other clothes—the male prisoner was still there, and remained in the room while I was putting my clothes on, and threatened, if I made the least resistance, that he would knock my brains out—he kept hin<lb></lb>dering me, pushing me back in the chair, and keeping me as long as he could—I was about five or ten minutes altogether—it was just getting light, and I could see him distinctly—I left the house, met a policeman, and afterwards saw the woman; she ran away, I pursued, and gave her in charge—I gave a description of the man to the policeman, and he was afterwards taken—I swear the prisoners are the persons—when I went in, I had a concert bill in my pocket, I have since seen it in the hands of the police.</p>

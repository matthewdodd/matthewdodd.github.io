                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Coventry. We live in Old-street, St. Luke's, and are linen-drapers—on the 6th of June, we had twenty yards of silk, and forty-five pocket-handkerchiefs, about a quarter of a yard from the window, tied up in a bundle—they and the silk were worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were inside the shop—I received information, and missed them—the window had been cut that day fortnight by the pri<lb></lb>soner—he came to my house, and cut the pane of glass quite down—I saw him do it, and then he ran away—I sent a little girl after him—he had cut the glass straight down, but there was no hole made then—on the 6th of June, I examined it, and a piece of glass was taken away, and a hole made, big enough to take any thing out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Old-street. On the 6th of June, I saw the prisoner and two others opposite this lady's window—I saw them go over two or three times, and come back—I knew the prisoner, and was afraid he would notice me, as he had threatened me before—they then went to the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner break the glass with a knife or something—he took a piece of glass out, and pulled a wire out of his hat, and pulled something out of the window, which he gave to the other two who were with him—I saw they were black handkerchiefs—they put them inside their coats, and walked away—I could not see a policeman—they got to the first turning, and then ran—Most sight of them—I saw a policeman afterwards, and told him.</p>

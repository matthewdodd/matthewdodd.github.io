            . I am a waiter at the Coffee-house. On the 12th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the castors on the side-board. I found the prisoner in the parlour about half-past eleven o'clock, and asked what he wanted; he made some confused answer, which I could not understand. Mr. Osborne came over and secured him - he searched him in my presence; but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was he not going into the house, and not coming out - A. He was coming out of the parlour door. After he was searched, he said, he came to tell us the house was being robbed.</p>

            . I keep a public-house opposite Slaughter's Coffee-house. On the 12th of July, I followed Austin, who had informed me that a man had gone in at the prosecutor's window - I saw the prisoner looking out from the parlour door down the passage. I went in and secured him - I searched, but found nothing particular on him. I asked how he came there; he said he understood there was a robbery going on, and came to inform them - this was after I had secured him. I asked why he came in at the window if he came to give information; he made no reply.</p>

            . I live near the Coffee-house. I was informed somebody had entered the window - I went to the door, and saw a man's arm out at the window, with a pair of candlesticks. I saw two men outside; thinking them concerned, I looked about for assistance. I did not see the men take anything; but they ran off on my calling Osborne. I saw the prisoner secured inside.

             re-examined. I saw the castors on the side-board at eleven o'clock, and missed them immediately he was secured. He gave me no alarm of a robbery - there was no light in the room. Some candlesticks were moved from one table in the room, and placed on another table near the window. Nobody but the prisoner was in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Were the castors separate or on a stand - A. Separate - he could have put them in his pocket.</p>

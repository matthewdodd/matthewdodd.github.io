            . I am a lighterman, and live in Upper Thames-street. On the 8th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down Upper Thames-street, and saw the prisoner in company with two others. I saw him first trying a door, they passed on about four doors further, and found a door a-jar - one went in, and the other two waited outside, passing backwards and forwards; their companion came out in a short time without anything - they passed on, I followed, and saw them try another door; they went on till they came to Allhallows church. I met a friend, who joined in watching them - one of them got on a step, and looked into a coach, which was drawn up, and the driver had left. They passed on, we went into a public-house and saw them return to the coach, pass it, then return, and the prisoner left the coach and walked up Suffolk-lane with something; the other two must have been between the coach and the horses. I saw the prisoner had something, followed, and caught him with this swing-glass in his hand. I took him back, and found the coachman coming out of an eating-house, opposite to where the coach stood, he said it was taken out of his coach; the prisoner then resisted and tore my shirt - I kept him fast, and gave him to the officer.</p>

            . I know Mr. Williams. He desired me to watch the men; we went into the public-house, the prisoner was with two others; one of them, (the youngest,) went on the steps, and looked into the coach - the prisoner and another walked up and down, and the man on the steps went back and stood against a post, at the corner of Suffolk-lane. I sent Williams after him, the other two went off towards London-bridge - I saw Williams collar the prisoner with the glass, the coachman claimed it.</p>

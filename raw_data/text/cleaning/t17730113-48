My house was broke open on the latter end of November, and also on the night after Christmas-day; I went to bed at eleven o'clock on Christmas night; I got up the next morning between six and seven, and found my house broke open. The house is let out in separate tenements: I have the ground floor to myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the situation of your apartment.</p>
               <p>Croker. There is one common door for the several tenants to enter the house at and go up stairs: my bed-chamber is on the right hand of that passage; my shop is on the left, and my shop has besides this door an outer door to the street for my customers.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is not a breaking the dwelling house?</p>
               <p>Cocker. I found the glass of the casement in the shop broke near the hasp; I missed my till containing 10 s. worth of halfpence, and two little Christmas boxes containing two silver groats, and four silver three-pences. I saw the marks of dirty feet upon the table under the window. Burrell used my shop to buy little matters; he confessed before the Justice that he was the only person concerned in breaking my shop; he had at first said that Ferry was concerned with him; he said now that he only charged Ferry out of spite; he said he broke in between one and two in the morning; I observed the marks of feet upon the table seemed to be all of one size. Burrel told the Justice he had thrown my till in a field; it was found according to his directions. (The till produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

I went to Mr. Gray's, a weaver, who is Burrell's master; Burrell hearing me come up stairs, attempted to get out at the window; I laid hold of the slap of his coat and pulled him in again; he said I am guilty; I asked him of what; he said of robbing Mrs. Croker; he said he got into the house between one and two o'clock, and described the manner in which he did it.</p>

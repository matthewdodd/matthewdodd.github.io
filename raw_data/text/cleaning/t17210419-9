             (Steward of the Charity) deposed that he used to divide the Money among those swore on upon the Charity when there was a sufficient Sum, sometimes about a Fortnight after Christmas; that the Prisoner (just before) askt him when he intended to make a Dividend, and he (this Evidence) told him, the next Week; whereupon the Prisoner gave him a kick on the Arse. And being ask'd by the Court how long it was before that time that he had distributed any Charity Money amongst them, answered, about 7 Weeks.

On the 30th of April my house was broke open; I discovered it in the morning: I have a man lodges with me that is a watchman in the city; he came home about four o'clock, and informed me my house was broke open; I came down and found a pane was taken out of the casement, and it was undone; the pulley of the door that leads into the passage was cut; there were two bolts and a spring lock to the front door; it was unbolted and the shutters put to. I went to bed at eleven at night; I fastened the house myself. I lost the liquors and goods mentioned in the indictment ( spealing them). I had some suspicions from some information I had of the people at the house Meakham was at; I saw him with a basket with about 30 lb. of pewter in it, in Montague-street; we brought him back to his lodgings near the Cock and Hoop; we found at his lodgings a cask with rum in it, a cask with shrub, and a cask of Holland's gin, and there four lumps of pewter melted down in earthen dishes ( producing them) and a bag of linen, two casks of wine, one Malaga, the other tent; we found this pistol and a dark lanthorn (producing them). I believe the hat to be my property, but having no particular mark I will not swear to it; this cask I can swear to; it is marked I K; I had it of my brother at Gravesend. I asked the prisoner whether all the plates and dishes were melted down; he said I should never see them any more in the same form they had been in; I asked him if he had ever been in my house; he said he was two days before.</p>

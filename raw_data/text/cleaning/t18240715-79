               <p>"Let me see what it is" - I took the basket from his shoulder, and opened it: it was about twelve o'clock, he was about two miles from Mr. Simpson's house. I found a bundle of linen, and some bread and beef in the basket. I took him to the watch-house, and searched him and the bundle: I did not make him any promise or threat - he said that his wife had given him the things; that she lived at Little Chelsea, with Mr. Simpson, and that he said he was going to the Old Kent-road, which I suppose is two miles and a half from there. I went next morning to Mrs. Simpson, who identified the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he told you at once where he got them, and it turned out to be all true - A. Yes. When I opened the bundle of linen I said,</p>
               <p>"Did your wife give you this?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, the old cook put that into the basket" - that he was in the habit of going to the house at all hours, and never was stopped before.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON re-examined. Q. What time did you go to bed on the night of the robbery - A. Not till about two o'clock in the morning. I did not know of his calling, but I heard the door open, and enquired of some of the servants (not the prisoners) what it was.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the morning of the 3d of August, about half past five o'clock, I was on duty in the New-road, and saw the prisoners and another in Maida-hill, coming from towards Kilburn, at Paddington, it was the right way to come from this house to avoid us, it is a bye way; Smith and Lee were with me, we were coming off duty; the prisoners were in company, about twenty yards from the turnpike; they saw us, and Bennet threw a sack off his shoulder into the ditch, and sat by the side of the bank, they were both in company. I went up and asked Bennet what he had in the sack he had just thrown away? he said he did not know, as he had picked it up in West End-lane, which is three quarters of a mile from there, and quite in a different direction. Ditton said he was very sorry that we came so soon upon them. We seized them and the bag which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120059"></xptr>contained lead. We walked fifteen miles to find the owner. Taylor came to the watch-house and complained of losing lead. I saw it fitted to the place, every nail corresponded.</p>

               <p>Is your sister married? - No, Sir, she is not.</p>
               <p>Why did not she come here to speak for you? - I did not think it would have been of any service, nor she neither, and she has nobody to mind her shop; my father was a shoemaker when he was alive, he and my mother have been dead these four years, I shall be thirteen the 14th of October next, I went to school before they died and since for half a year, I used to make the wax for my sister, and go of errands.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clarke. Do you recollect exactly what time in the evening it was? - Between the hours of six and seven on Monday the 21st of October.</p>
               <p>Was day-light quite gone? - It was too dark to do any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. Was day-light quite gone? - I cannot swear to that with certainty.</p>

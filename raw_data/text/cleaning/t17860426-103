             came into our family, we had another boy of the same name, for which reason, he was called Jack, he has ever since gone by that name, though his name is William; he then upon being questioned further about the matter, said, that Valentine had put this paper in a secret place, with the gold in it, for him to carry away, that he had repeatedly done so, and that there was some of it concealed under the stairs in the kitchen, in Field's father-in-law's house; we desired then to go and search his father-in-law's lodgings; which we did, with another person; Field went with us; we found some of it under the stairs as he described it; he does not lodge there; we then went to the prisoner Field's lodgings, and there we found other pieces of paper full of the same kind of chips, which quantity is I suppose about the quantity or rather more than stated in the indictment; in the whole of the chips about five penny weights; he continued to tell the same story, that Valentine had secreted these papers for him to carry away; in consequence of which we took an officer and searched for Valentine, and we found him at his father's; we brought him home that night, it was then eleven or near upon it; we locked him up in a room in the house.</p>
               <p>Did he understand that he was in custody of the constable? - I cannot say; the next morning they were both examined at the office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him the morning before he went to Litchfield-street? - None at all; the next morning at the Justice's, Field told the same story he told us, and upon my asking Valentine, whether he had not at times put up the small pieces of gold in three pieces of paper, and put in a secret place for this man to carry away, he said, he had; he was then questioned as to the quantity that had been sold; he said, at one time he had received so much, and at another time so much; the magistrate desired they might be kept in custody, and that Mr. Cox might attend; the day following they were examined again, and repeated the same story, they said they were sold at Mr. Albion Cox's; we suspected he had no opportunity of getting rid of the gold out of the paper, and some of it was on the matt in particular at the counting house door, and that was the only part of the gold I saw.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That stair case was the only staircase for all the work folks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you told this boy that you would not proceed against him, or give him some hopes of mercy? - Yes, Sir, it amounted to that, he begged we would forgive him; I answered him, that the only hope he could have for any lenity, was that he would make an open and candid confession of all he knew.</p>
               <p>In consequence he went with you, and did as you have stated, under the impression of that promise of your's? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Did not you send a letter to Valentine's father when he was out on Easter Monday that you would not receive him again? - Yes; he did not absent himself that day from any consciousness of this subject; the father told me he had found him; there was no promise made him to induce him to confess.</p>

               <p>How old is Valentine? - Nineteen, he said he was; Field is twenty three.</p>
               <p>With respect to Valentine, did you make him any promises? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any thing said either by you or your brother to Field, in the presence of Valentine, which could induce him to expect the same? - No, nothing.</p>

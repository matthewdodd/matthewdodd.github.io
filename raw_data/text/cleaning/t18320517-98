             - the lower part of the house is offices, but I reside in the upper part, and the prisoner had the unlimited range of the house. In February last I lost a number of valuable articles, and among the rest some spoons - the prisoner was taken to the office on another charge; the officer found on him a number of duplicates, one of which is for a silver dessert-spoon, which is one of a set I had lost, and one for a silk umbrella.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PENNY. I live with Mr. Cottrel, a pawnbroker. On the 14th of February I took in this spoon of a man, who, I believe, was not the prisoner; I gave him this duplicate.</p>

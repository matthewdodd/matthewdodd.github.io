I have the principal care of all the things in the house, that are given daily for the use of the house, the linen and glasses. I had nine cloths in my care for the use of the coffee room; about eleven o'clock on the 15th of May, I left a waiter in the coffee room while I went to clean myself up stairs, I had not been above a quarter of an hour; just as I was coming down stairs I heard the bar bell ringing very violently, I ran down stairs as fast as ever I could, when I came down the prisoner was brought back into the coffee room with the table cloth on him, by a man where he had been to sell it with Mr. Lear's name upon it, the number of the house and the number of the box to which it belonged; this man I had frequently seen at our door begging and jabbering french. I could not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him that day? - I had not till he was brought back; the cloth is here, he said that a man gave it him in the street. The waiter had left the room in my absence, there were nine lay folded up in one of the seats exactly opposite the door, the opposite side of the room, they could see them in the street.</p>

               <p>I lost some leaf gold, upwards of two ounces, out of my shop, on the 2d of September.</p>
               <p>Is your shop a part of your dwelling house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see it there? - I saw it there within an hour.</p>
               <p>At what time did you miss it? - The next morning at six my people missed it; I saw it the night before at eight o'clock, and at nine I saw the prisoner come in, he came in to sell some skewins, which is a kind of gold that the gilders and coach painters rub off after they have used it, with cotton.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the shop? - It might be ten minutes I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140037"></xptr>Did you buy any of these skewins? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where was your leaf gold at that time? - It was lying on a board in the shop; after I missed it I sent out persons to different parts of the town to have it stopped; the first let him go, the second would not buy it, the third only stopped the gold, and not the man, the fourth stopped both gold and man; Mr. Stubbs has it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. Did this man ever tell you any of this article before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop; - I can say there was my son in the shop, and I called my boy to get change, and I believe my daughter went to the door of the shop.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a silversmith in Holborn, I produce this gold leaf which the prisoner brought to my came there the 3d of this month at about twelve, and asked me if I bought any gold, I told him I did; he told me it was gold leaf, he had not got it then, but he would go and fetch it; he went out immediately, and in the space of five minutes he brought this gold to me; I asked him if he had any more of it, he said, yes, he had, but he could not get at it at present; then I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it the corner of a street; I told him immediately I had had information that morning twice, that Mr. Durnford had his shop robbed of a quantity of gold, and that I was desired to stop both man and gold; and if he came by it honestly, he would not mind being examined; accordingly I put him in the parlour, and Mr. Durnford came down, and said, the prisoner was the man that was in his shop the night he lost his gold; I asked him where the remaining part of the gold was, he said he had given it to another man, and could not get at it at present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This part of the gold that was lost, I have a duplicate of it in my pocket; as to the melting, and manufactory, it is in such a state as I am sure of, it is my own work that I was upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Is it not usual, Sir, to manufacture gold in that way? - Certainly, but it is in the same state, the same melting, the same ingot and colour.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How much is there of that? - Here is a five penny weight, which is about the eighth of it.</p>
               <p>- FARLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a gold-beater, I produce this gold leaf, which I received from a person, but I cannot tell who it was, I conceive it to be the prisoner, I am not positive; the person said it was not his own property, it belonged to a person that found it; there was more of it, and he had given him this to sell.</p>
               <p>What quantity is there? - About sixteen shillings worth, he went away to fetch the person, and I sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>- BADGER sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is my master, he told me at Bow-street, that they had not got all the gold, there was some hid, he did not say where; I went in search of the gold, and I found the skins, some bits of gold were in a stable, the skins were found close by the shop, in a hole with some dirt over it.</p>
               <p>(The skins produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. CLOCKIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I found these skins in Mr. Durnford's shop, brought there by this man.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these skins by many marks, they have been through my hands, I suppose two thousand times.</p>
               <p>Did you lose these skins at the time you lost the gold? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was there gold between every skin? - May be not between every one, but between the major part.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Those are such skins as gold is usually beat on, manufactured in that way? - They are.</p>
               <p>I suppose there are many thousands of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140038"></xptr> same sort? - Without doubt, but I know the skins by many marks.</p>

            , come out of Mr. Eddison's house, with a canvas bag in her possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you stop her - A. I did. I asked her what she had there; her answer was, a few feathers. I asked her where she was going; and she told me to Pancrass. I informed her I was a constable, and she must come back with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Now, before she said any thing, did you make her any threat, or any promise, or did you say any thing to her, which might induce her to confess - A. I did not. I asked her what she was going to do at Pancrass; she said, she was going to take the feathers to Mrs. Smith; in Edmund-street, near Battle-bridge. I asked her whether she had ever taken any there before; she said, she had, and she had been in the habit of doing so. I asked her whether she used to take them in the manner she was taking these; she said, she had taken some in a tablecloth, which I should find in the one pair back room, at Mrs. Smith's, likewise two tippets in a chest of drawers in the back parlour. She begged very hard for me to let her take the bag which she had when I stopped her, back to her master's, for she should be hanged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you take her to Mrs. Smith's - A. I did not. I took her to the Compter, and got to Smith's at about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the woman at the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How did you get into the house - A. Over the wall, and in at the back window, the first thing I saw in the back parlour was, the chest of drawers that Clarke told me of, and upon opening it, I found the two tippets as described by her. Smith was not in the room at the time. As soon as I went out of the parlour, I opened the door, and let in Mr. Eddison, junior; we then went into the one pair of stairs back room, and found an immense quantity of feathers. I saw no person belonging to the house at that time. I saw a pair of scales, hung by the fire side, and there were several bags, which contained feathers, which were picked; in the corner of the room there was a great quantity of feathers loose and picked.</p>
               <p>COURT. This was the room of which Clarke told you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did any one come in whilst you were there - A. Yes; a boy, who was called by the name of

               <p>Q. Did Smith come in - A. Yes, in about half or three quarters of an hour. I told her then that I came in consequence of some information which I received from Clarke, that some of Mr. Eddison's property was there. I asked her where she got the feathers; she told me she got them from Clarke, to make a bed with, for Mr. Eddison. I asked her whether she got the tippets to make a bed also; she said, no, one was Clarke's, and Clarke had given her the other for her own wear. I asked her where she got the tablecloth; and she said, Clarke had brought feathers in it. When I took her to Guildhall, I asked her if she had ever disposed of any feathers; she said, no; these were the only feathers that were brought to her, and they were for the purpose of making a bed. At first, I thought that I had seen her in Gough-square; and I asked her whether she had been there; but she replied, she had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Have you got the feathers here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nobody can swear to feathers. You must prove their identity from the prisoner's own mouth.</p>
               <p>(The several articles produced by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Witness. These I found in the lodgings of the prisoner Smith, accordingly to the direction I received from Clarke, and they have never been out of my possession since.</p>

I have heard her say that she lived with Mr. Eddison, in the presence of Mrs. Smith. She used to bring the feathers in bags, and once she brought them in a tablecloth; I did not see the tablecloth come in; but I saw it after it was come. I used to be employed in picking feathers; and when they were picked, Mrs. Smith used to send me to sell them to a Mr. Neville, a broker, in Brewer-street, Sommers Town; the first time, I received six shillings for what I took, and another time five; I got eleven shillings altogether; I got two shillings a pound for some.</p>

The officer who took me just out of sight of the house, asked me where I was going, and some other questions. He then took me to his own home, and thence to Mr. Smith's in Gough Square; and Mr. Smith told me to make a friend of him, and tell him all about it. The officer then took me to Giltspur-street Compter, and I do not think the prisoner Smith knew that the feathers were stolen.</p>

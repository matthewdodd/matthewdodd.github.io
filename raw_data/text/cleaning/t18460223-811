                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Tyer's-street, Vauxhall. On the 6th of Jan. I had been at work at Camberwell New-road—when I came out about seven or eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another, whom I do not know, in the street—I had a basket on my head, and a frying-pan—the prisoner put his arms round me, and pushed me against the gate in the road—I went in and waited a little while till I thought they were gone—I then went on, and saw them again—they used very bad language, and as I got to Kennington-oval, they came up to me—the other one laid he would rip my b—y guts open—he put an open knife against my breast—he took it out, opened it, and put it against my breast—he said something about money, but I was frightened and do not know what he said—he then dropped the knife, and kicked me violently in the lower part of the belly—it gave me so much pain, I could not stand upright—he then held me, while the pri<lb></lb>soner gave me two or three blows in the side, and then kicked me—he</p>

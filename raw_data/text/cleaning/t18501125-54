                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Gower-street. I have known the prisoner many years—I do not know what he is now, he was a lawyer—I knew his family—he came to me on 10th Oct., represented himself to be in great distress, and asked me to write him a letter recommending him to a situation in the police-force—I wrote him a very guarded certificate—he then said he had had nothing to eat that day, and borrowed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., promising to repay it on the Saturday—he came again on Saturday, 12th Oct., and said he was unable to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he produced this check, and asked if I would be kind enough to cash it, or advance him something on it, as it was after banking hours—it was between five and six in the evening—I lent him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, which was all I had in my purse, and said I would cash it on Monday, and give him the difference—he said it had been paid to him by the drawer; that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it belonged to himself, and the rest to Mr. Unwin—I said, "I suppose it is a good check?"—he said, "Do you think I would give you one I did not believe to be good, and you such an old friend?"—I did not ask him who George South was—( <hi rend="italic">the check purported to be drawn by George South for 5l. 10s., on the London and Westminster Bank, payable to Hartley and Unwin, and was dated 14th Oct.,</hi> 1850)—it was on Saturday 12th he gave it to me—I afterwards wrote to him, stating that the check was dishonoured, but he did not answer my letter.</p>

Hartley and Unwin, and signed James Reynolds</hi>)—he asked me to let him have a few shillings on it; that it was a crossed check, and he could not get it changed—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said he would call for the rest in the morning—he called next day, but I did not see him.</p>

I said she should not have her Liberty without going before a Justice; she was examined before Justice Frasier on Sunday, and ordered back again till Monday; and then she said something, as if the Watch was at the Prosecutor's Lodging; there were some Women came to speak for her, and they said the same. I said I would go myself for it, and when I came there the Prosecutor's Landlord gave me the Watch, it was wrapped up in this Paper.</p>

I knew Mr Pidgeon expected a Parcel out of the Country, and thought they might have brought it; and this Watch was delivered into my Wife's Hand, wrapped up in a Paper, and my Wife delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor run away from the Watchmen. I never saw him in my Life before, but through the Key-hole of the Door, when he was drinking with those Women. He wanted to get away from the Constable, and I stopped him, in order to enquire into the Robbery.</p>

            . I am a dealer in fish, and live in Lower Thames-street. I was in Mincing lane, and saw the prisoner close behind Mr. Day and another person in his company; I saw the prisoner draw the handkerchief out of Mr. Day's pocket, and told Mr. Day immediately - the prisoner ran away; his companion came behind after the prisoner was taken, and was outside the watch-house door - he had run part of the way with the prisoner; I kept my attention on the prisoner - I never lost sight of him till he was stopped; he dropped the handkerchief in the middle of Billiter-lune; I did not see him drop it - it was found near him.</p>

I had been shewn him there two days before, and told he was a pick-pocket. I watch'd him, and followed him down Cornhill; there he took out a handkerchief and wiped his face with it, and put it in his breeches. Then he took another out of his pocket, and put that in his breeches; presently he took out mine, and put that in his breeches likewise. I saw two porters, and told them, that was a pickpocket, one of them said, I know he is, for I saw him pick a person's pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175407170003"></xptr> once in Cornhill. We took him, and had him before my Lord Mayor, and in searching him there were five taken from him, some from his pockets and some from his breeches, mine was one [ produc'd in court, and depos'd to ]</p>

            . Mr. Watson desir'd I'd assist in securing the prisoner, saying he had picked his pocket. Having seen him pick a pocket about half an hour before, I went to him, and said, you are a common pickpocket, and put my hand into his pocket, and took out three handkerchiefs. I secured him; after which I took out two more from his breeches. We took him before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed to Newgate. Mr. Watson owned one of the handkerchiefs. Taking him along he offer'd me 5 s. to let him go; after that he offered me a guinea.</p>

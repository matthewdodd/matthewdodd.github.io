                  </hi>. I keep a shop in Park-side, Knights bridge. On the 31st of May the prisoner came there at near three o'clock—he asked me if I had got a double-bottomed ladies' gold watch—I said "No"—he said, "show me what you have got"—I showed him the watch in</p>

               <p>question—he said that is not the one that will suit the lady—she wants a double-bottomed one; but if I would allow him to have it for ten days or a fortnight, merely to show the lady that he had not forgotten her, he would show it her, and return it to me, and give me an order for a double-bottomed one—he asked me the price of this watch—I told him eleven guineas, and thirteen guineas for a double-bottomed one—he en<lb></lb>gaged to show the watch to the lady—I gave it him in a bag, he took it away, and I never saw him afterwards—he never returned it—I gave him no authority to sell or dispose of it, only to show it to the lady—I had had transactions with him to a small amount before—when he did not return in the fortnight, I got uneasy, and waited a month—I went to his lodging, and he was gone—I went round to different pawnbrokers, and among the rest, to Mr. Kimber's, at Knightsbridge, and found it there—I took it out of pawn in November last—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I have a number on it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 31st of May, the prisoner came to my employ<lb></lb>er's shop, at Knightsbridge, towards four o'clock, and offered me the watch—I Lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I asked him if it was his own, seeing it was quite new—he said it was—three weeks after the prosecutor called—he afterwards paid the money, and took it out of pawn—I live about a dozen doors from him—I know it was about four or five o'clock that the prisoner brought it.</p>

Q.</hi> It is not unusual to ask people if property belongs to them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I took the number of the watch—I wrote it down before he came away—I recollect the number—the prisoner called about a month or six weeks ago for it—I was not there at the time he came, and cannot say to a month when he did call, but it was after Mr. Thitch<lb></lb>ener had it out of pawn.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner requested permission to address the Jury, instead of his Counsel, and in a long address stated, that he wanted the watch for the pur-pose he had represented, and the prosecutor told him if he did not call in a fort-night should conclude that he intended to keep it, and that he would call and pay for it—that on the same day he received a letter, stating that his mother was confined by illness, upon which, being short of money, he pledged the watch that evening, to procure money for the purpose of going to see her—and while in the country he was confined to his bed for four months—immediately on his return he called on the pawnbroker to redeem the watch, and found</hi>

            ; the prisoner was not present when this order was given, but I mentioned to him afterwards on the same day; he said nothing to me on that day. The next morning, as I was in the shop, making preparations to go out, he wished me not to go for a few days; I told him I should go, and Mr. Pepys was coming to attend business while I went, and I must go; he wished me to step up stairs, as he wanted to speak to me; I told him he might as well speak to me there; if it was any secret relative to the business I did not wish to know it. He then presented me with a paper; that is the paper (producing it); it is the hand writing of the prisoner; he requested that I would not call upon those people whose names were in that list. I told him he was placing me in an unpleasant situation; he said it was in my power to make him happy for ever. I went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you owe them any sum of money in June 1806. - A. We did, six pound thirteen, that receipt was given for the draft on our bankers, and the draft was returned cancelled by our bankers. (The draft and the receipt read in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. (to Williams). Look at that receipt and tell me whether that is the hand writing of the prisoner. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner account to you for this six pound thirteen. - A. He did not</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. W. H. Pepys). Did the prisoner at the bar account to you for this money. - A. No he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. E. Pepys). Did the prisoner account to you for the six pound thirteen shillings. - A. No, there was no money transaction at all passed with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 11th of June I had the misfortune to lose a watch and a sum of money. I recovered this money till such times I had a friend to come forward. I never intended to defraud my master.</p>

I found a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of buck skin breeches tied up in the prisoner's apron, and laid in his bed. Then I search'd about and miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment. This was on the 31st of May between the hours of 12 and two. There was a lock broke open, and I had no lodger but the prisoner. I mistrusted him, so took him up, and had him before justice Chamberlain, where he confessed he broke the lock, and took the things laid in the indictment. Some of the things were found in his pocket, and some in the sides of his coat. He delivered them all to the constable.</p>

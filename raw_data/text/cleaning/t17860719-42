               <p>I cannot speak to the prisoner, one person may be very much like another; I was robbed of one guinea in gold which I thought was weight, and two light guineas, and one gold ring, and two base metal shillings; I am very clear the prisoner took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Is that the woman that robbed you of your property? - Yes, it is, I know her now I come to look at her again.</p>
               <p>Then you do swear to her? - Yes; it was down in Mill yard, Rosemary lane; I had been at a society to the Seven Stars in Whitechapel, which I belong to, and was coming away about twelve, and in about twenty yards of the house I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190076"></xptr> from I happened to see the prisoner, and she appeared to be very much intosticated in liquor; I said I suppose you have been holiday making, she said yes, she said she lived in Rosemary-lane; I said I will go along with you; she took hold of my arm; we went down into Rosemary-lane; she asked a watchman for Mill-yard, and offered him twopence to shew her home; he went with her; I wanted to depart, she said, no, go and see me home; she gave the watchman three halfpence, and he went away; I wanted to come away then, but she said no, come in for a minute, so I went into the passage, and as soon as I got into the passage she took and flounced the door, but whether it locked or not I cannot say, she instantly caught me round the waist with one hand, and put the other hand into my pocket, I caught hold of her hand, and said I would not be robbed, the watchman hearing me say so, came in and asked me what that woman had robbed me of, I told him of one guinea which I thought was weight, and two light guineas, and two base metal shillings, and a gold ring, that was what she took from me.</p>

               <p>I went to the door of this woman's house, I heard a noise, I will call the watch, I went up and stood right opposite the door, which was wide open, I heard the prosecutor say, he would not be robbed, I went in, he told me he had hold of the prisoner's hand, with that I says to her, Madam if you please to let me see what you have got there? says she, I will not; says I, I insist upon it; I laid hold of her hand; when she found I was resolute, she said hold your hand, she threw the money into my right hand, it fell down, I immediately searched for it, and picked up three guineas, one guinea was

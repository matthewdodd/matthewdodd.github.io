            . On the 27th of April I was with Batten, and saw the prisoner a little after three o'clock at Waterloo-place, in company with three others, attempt a gentleman's pocket. He lifted his coat up with one hand and put the other into his pocket - he left without taking anything. I followed him towards Charing-cross, and as I was coming up St. Martin's-street with Dukes and Batten, I saw the prisoner and two others go into the Horse and Dolphin there, I followed, and went into the taproom, no person was there; I went into the yard, saw the prisoner, and took him. I was in the act of searching him when he took eight notes from his left-hand breeches-pocket, and rolled them in his hand, I took them out. A game certificate was picked up in the yard by the landlady. Two other persons were in the yard, and as I opened the yard door one bolted out, and got away. Duke secured the other, but found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's father's house, about half-past ten o'clock, on Tuesday morning, the 8th of January - the prisoner lived there; I knocked at the door - no one came - I then lifted up the latch, and went in; I called Mrs. Hermitage; she came about half way down stairs; I then went up, and found a sheep's head laying in a chair, in the first floor room; I then called the prosecutor's son, John, up, and we went into the attic together, and there found a quantity of mutton, cut in pieces; there was a whole carcase cut into pieces, and tied in a coarse cloth; we took it away; I went down, and told the mother and father I must secure them; I took the prisoner at the Little King's Arms public-house, Old Brentford; I said, "You are the man I want;" he said, "For what?" I said, "You will see;" I took him to the cage, and Mr. John Fletcher came up; I then said to the prisoner, "Mr. Fletcher lost two carcases of mutton last night, and I have found one carcase in your house;" the prisoner then said he found it, and I think he said near Drum-lane.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. Ten sheep had been killed the night before; part of them by Thomas Fletcher, but he dressed them all; they hung in the slaughter-house, which joins the back part of the dwelling-house, and is occupied by my father; it has no internal communication with the dwelling-house; we lost two sheep, worth about 4l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Must this have been done in the night? A. Yes; I believe between eleven and twelve o'clock; there are two side doors, which were locked by Thomas Fletcher - they were not opened, but a lattice window, which fastens with a bar, was broken.</p>

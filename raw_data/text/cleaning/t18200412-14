In a minute or two I felt something press against me, turned round, and saw the prisoner close by my side. I charged him with putting his hand into my pocket, but he denied it, and walked towards the door; I felt, missed my purse, and called to Mr. Brown, who is my brother-in-law, to run after him. I followed him, and he caught the prisoner just as he stepped off the pavement - I picked the purse off the pavement. It could not have dropped from me there.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutrix, and stood by her side; the prisoner came in between me and her. I I did not hear him ask for anything. In about a minute my sister accused him of feeling in her pocket, which he denied and stepped towards the door - my sister said she had lost her purse. I went after him, and secured him just as he was stepping off the pavement; I saw the purse fall from him about the middle of the pavement - my sister picked it up. He might have picked it up without my observing him.</p>

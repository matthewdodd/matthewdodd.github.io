               <p>WILLIAM EVANS. I live in Shepherdess-walk, Hoxton. On the 28th of August I missed an ash plank from Mr. Sturts' wharf, on the bank of the <placeName id="t18321129-197-crimeloc1112">Regent's-canal</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take money of the man for the plank? A. No, he did not look it out; he asked the price of it, and said he would come on the Monday and see if he could deal with me for it.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live in the Canal-road. On the 24th of August I went to Mr. Evans' wharf, and asked the price of the plank - he asked 17s.; on the 27th I went there again - I saw the prisoner and another man; the prisoner asked what I wanted - I said I had looked at the plank, and asked if the governor was in the way; he said No, but he could do as well - I said it was all right, and I would send for a truck - he said there was no occasion for it; he would bring it home for half a gallon of beer - he brought it, and I saw my wife pay him for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You asked if you had not given too much for the plank? A. No, you asked what I wanted, and I told you what the price was - I said it was 1s. a foot; I did not ask if there was a truck in the yard - I proposed to go for one, and then you said you and your mate would take it home; I suppose it was five or six o'clock- I did not see you at the Bricklayer's Arms; it was a very wet day - you received the money.</p>

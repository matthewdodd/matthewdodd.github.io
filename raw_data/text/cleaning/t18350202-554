I went with the con<lb></lb>stable to the prisoner's house—I asked where he purchased the head and pluck—he said he bought it—I said, "Where did you buy it?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Bransgrove, I will ask you once more, where did you come in possession of this sheep's head and pluck?"—he said, "It is no difference to you where I came in possession of it, I bought it"—I then gave him in charge—I took the head and pluck out of his house, and took him before Lord Montford—I took His clothes off at the workhouse, after we brought him from the magistrate, and his shoes also—I took them home to my house, and went to Bull's-bridge-field with the shoes and <hi rend="italic">corresponded</hi> them to the marks close to the fold, and found they did cor<lb></lb>respond exactly with the foot-marks—the weather was very dry, but it is ploughed land close to the fold—I observed a good deal of blood on the side of his waistcoat, and some blood on one of his shoes—I know Goring, a butcher—I was present when he <hi rend="italic">corresponded</hi> the head of the sheep to the carcass which Wyatt brought him—he fitted the head to the neck where it was cut off—Wyatt and I put the carcass on the table, and Goring fitted the head to it—it appeared to me to fit in every respect—the carcass had been skinned at that time—we did not fit it to the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the skin of the head in the other part of the skin of the sheep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the head was skinned—the patrol was, with me when I compared the foot-marks—they fitted in lengthy in width, and the nails—I fitted, to the best of my recollection, three impression of the right foot, and three of the left—there was a deficiency of nails in the shoes, and a corresponding deficiency in the marks—I produce the shoes I did not count the nail-marks—I did not make any impression on the ground first—we put the shoe down into the foot-marks made by the shoe before—there had been no rain, to the beat of my recollection—we made the comparison on Monday, the 11th of January—there was very little rain on the Sunday—there was no rain at all an Sunday in she daytime, but I believe there was a little on the Sunday night, and very little—I did not see it rain; but in the morning the ground appeared rather damp—I believe there was no rain on Saturday—the field was fol<lb></lb>lowed</p>

               <p>close to the fold—it had not been harrowed—I should think it had been ploughed three or four weeks—it was not in clumps, but very fine—it is a loam soil—all the six marks fitted—to the best of my recollection, they were all going from the fold; but I cannot be certain—I traced them on the headland, which is close to the fold—there were some marks in the furrow, close to the fold, and some in the headland, which is turnips, and not ploughed—there is no grass at all, and very few wheats—I could discover the impression of shoes on the headland distinctly—I cannot say whether there were any impressions going to the fold—he might go into the fold in another direction—I was quite satisfied with the marks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this the only field in plough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some part of the farm was wheat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any men working in the field the day before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not; of course the shepherd pitched out his fold—the shepherd wears nailed shoes, and so do I—there were several other marks along the headland, but not by the fold—it would not be the shep<lb></lb>herd's business to be on the fallow ground—he might have walked there if he liked—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the shepherd's shoe</hi>) this shoe is not so large—if I had seen a mark on the fallow, I could tell whether it was the mark of that shoe, without comparing it, because it is not so large—that is the only dif<lb></lb>ference.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not shoemakers make shoes for country people generally from the same last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt they do so—there are a great many nails gone out of these—when I first saw the blood on the waistcoat on the Sunday, it appeared to have been rubbed out—I did not observe it till then—it was all covered with white chalk—Sunday was the first time I went to his house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>the beer came from Mrs. Atto's—he said three or four pots were fetched in the course of the evening, and Dr. Fox, Leeming, and his wife, drank it, and he himself had part along with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Staples, an architect and surveyor, of Newman-street. On the 26th of Nov., in the morning, there was a ring at the bell—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner—I am quite certain of him and swear to him—he asked if Mr. Staples was at home—I said yes, he was, but not up—he said he was sorry, for he was to have called the night before, from No. 56, High Holborn, for some footing—I said he had better call again, as Mr. Staples was not up—he said he did not know what to do; he should get into disgrace if he went without it—I said he had better call again—he hesitated a few minutes, and I asked him to walk in and wait a little while—he said.; I will wait a little while"—he walked into the hall, and I gave him a seat—I went into the kitchen, came up again, and found him still there—I back into the kitchen again. And in about two minutes I heard the street door slam—I went up, and the prisoner was gone—I missed the cloaks out of the hall, which I had seen there the night before—it was their regular place.</p>

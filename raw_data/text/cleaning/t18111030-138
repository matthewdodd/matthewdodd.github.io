               <p>A. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, he called on me on the 13th of August for the money due to his master. I observed that his master was in a great hurry, he said his master had a bill to make up, the last bill was one pound five shillings. I said if you will take discount of I will pay you. I paid him four pound fourteen shillings, he gave me this receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. How long since that did Mr. Linscoten make application. - A. I believe about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>A. Turn to the entery of the 13th or 14th of August, do you find any entery made of any sum received of Moore or James. - A. I have examined the book before. I find no such entery about the 13th of 14th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were you much pressed to make up a bill. - A. Not the least in the world, he said that without my authority. I believe he applied to me to take off the discount of five per cent. of the one pound five.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring that money to accompt the four pound fourteen shillings. - A. He never did. I called upon Mr. James for the money on account of receiving the letter upon which he acknowledges receiving the money and not accompting to me for it.</p>

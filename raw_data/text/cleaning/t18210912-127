            . I am a newsman. I was in the Curtain-road, about 200 yards from this stand, about half-past ten o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went up, and saw a mob round the prisoner; he threw down this basket, and the plumbs fell out - they were dark plumbs. He said, he would be taken by no man, and used very bad expressions; he then went and laid himself down at a door in Holywell-lane, and with great difficulty I got him to the office. He said I could not hang him, but only send him back to where he came from, and he wished he had a knife to stick into our eyes.</p>

            . I am an officer. A little before half-past ten o'clock, I was in the Antelope, public-house, and saw the prisoner there with a basket half full of plumbs; he asked me to buy some - he was selling them at 3 d. a quart. I went to the City-road, returned in a quarter of an hour, and he was taken up - he seemed in liquor. The basket was exactly like that produced.</p>

            . About 4 or 5 o'Clock, August 5, I was carrying a Bundle of Mr. Stepple's Things to the East-Ham Coach; the Prisoner met me in <placeName id="t17370907-1-crimeloc3">Whitechapple</placeName>

I told him no; then he enquired if I was not going to the East-Ham Coach with my Bundle? I said, - Yes. You'll be too late, says he, the Coach is just going off, and so he snatched the Parcel from under my Arm, and away he ran with it, and turn'd up Gulston-street. I follow'd him, and cry'd Stop Thief; upon which several People pursued him, and he threw down the Bundle, in hopes of making his Escape, but he was taken in Gulston-Square. I am positive to the Prisoner, because he was not three Minutes out of my Sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carry'd before a Justice of the Peace?</p>
               <p>Castle. Yes; and I was present, and charged him with taking the Things, but he did not say any Thing to excuse himself, as I heard.</p>

               <p>Castle. At the White Hart and Three Tobacco Pipes, in Whitechapple.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got the Bundle from you, did he run towards the Inn?</p>
               <p>Castle Yes, he ran a little Way towards the Inn, and then he cross'd the Street from the Inn, and ran up Gulston street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I walked a little Way before him, - pray, ask him why he did not immediately cry out - Stop Thief?</p>
               <p>Castle. Because I thought he might belong to the Inn, 'till I saw him run out of the Way.</p>

            . I was going up Gulston-street, on the 5th of August, and heard the Boy (Castle) cry - Stop Thief. I turn'd to see what was the Matter, and the Prisoner was just then at my Elbow. As he ran, he threw down the Bundle, so I call'd out - Stop Thief, and though he run very fast, yet the People took him at the Corner of the Square. I am very positive the Prisoner is the Man that was taken, but he flew so swiftly by me, that I could not then take any particular Notice of his Face. I said to him, - you Rascal, how dar'd you take the Bundle from the Lad? why, says he, I did not design to run away with it; this was his Answer, as near as I can remember.</p>

            . I happen'd to be in Gulston-Square at this Time, and seeing the Prisoner runing along, without either Hat or Wig, and hearing People cry Stop Thief, I took hold of him, and held him 'till the Boy and the other Witness came up. He had nothing upon him, when I seized him, for (it seems) he had thrown the Bundle away before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Defence. I was walking along, and met the Boy very hard loaded; I asked him how far he was going? He told me he was going to the Ham Coach. I told him I would help him; so he gave me the Bundle to carry for him; but I had not gone far, before I saw some Bailiffs following me, and considering that I owed a Man 5 l. I flung down the Bundle and took to my Heels: upon which the Boy cry'd out, - Stop Thief, and these People took me. <rs id="t17370907-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

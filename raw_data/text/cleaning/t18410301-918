                  </hi>. I am bar-man at the Cock public-house, kept by Mr. Williams—the original name was Massy. On the 1st of February, Prior, George Arnold, and William Arnold came to the bar, and called for some ale—I served them—there were other persons there, but not connected with them—I then left the bar—Prior came to the bar in the course of time, and asked if I could change him a note—I said I could not—he went away and fetched a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and gave it to me—I put it into M'Grath's hand open—it was the same note—Prior seemed the worse for liquor—he said, "Give my old woman the note," and I did—I asked her if she could read—she pointed to the middle of the note where the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was engraved in large letters, and said, "This is the note"—she showed it to another person, and said, "This is the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I saw her fold it up, and put it into a small bag, she put it into her pocket, and went away—Galloway was present while I had the</p>

               <p>note in my possession, not Davis—I told Galloway that I had given M'Grath the note—she said, "It is nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it"—Prior went out first by the side door—Magrath went out at the front door—Galloway and the Arnolds went out in about two minutes—I be<lb></lb>lieve Prior had drank ale or beer—he was the worse for drink, but sensible enough to know what he was about.</p>

               <p>came in, and asked Peggy to look at the note—that she gave it him, and he walked a few paces, not coming near her—that she saw him hand Peggy the note again—he went out, and then Peggy said to her, 'Is this a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?' and she said to her, 'No, Peggy, it is a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note'"—I then took Galloway, and told Davis she must attend at the office—I went back, by the prosecutor's request, and took Davis—she had got her things on, ready to come—the Magistrate held her to bail—I round George Arnold in cus<lb></lb>tody at Spitalfields' station—he was dressed in a Macintosh, and was very drunk—I searched him, and during that time Prior came in—George Ar<lb></lb>nold extended his right hand to him, and said, "How are you, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>?—Priorsaid, "Where is my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took sixteen sovereigns and a half and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—the Macintosh appeared to be a second-hand one—he had a pair of clarence boots on, apparently new—he said he had won the money that day—here is the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I received from Prior—I said to Davis, "Mrs. Davis, it looks very black against you, being in the house at the time"—she said, "Yes, it does; I thought last night that I should be likely to get into trouble, being there"—I made inquiries as to her being in the house at the time she stated, and found it was a regular thing for her to go at that time with her servant's tea—she lives next door to Galloway, and keeps a house of accommodation—I believe Arnold's parents are very respectable.</p>

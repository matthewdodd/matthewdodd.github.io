            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I received information on the 31st of December, and found the watch at Harrison's - I went and took the prisoner, and said I wanted her for a watch, and that a man was in Newgate for it; I said I should search her for the duplicate - she said I need not search, as it was burnt; I found no duplicate, except one for a petticoat - a bill was filed against Elder, a soldier, and the prisoner was a witness.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Harrison, a pawnbroker. This watch was pawned by the prisoner, on the 26th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>MATILDA WELLS. I lived with the prisoner at No. 7, Old Pye-street; she came home on the evening of Christmas-day between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; she had this watch in her right-hand - she said the young man was fighting, and she went between them and drew him of his watch - she went out the next morning, and pawned it for 3s.; she bought the bonnet which she has here for 1s. 9d., and the other money she gave the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was given to me by one of the soldiers.</p>

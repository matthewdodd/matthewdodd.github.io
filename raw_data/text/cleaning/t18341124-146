                  </hi>. I sell goods in town on commission. On Friday night, 21st of November, between twelve and one, I met the prisoner in Aldgate—I had been out with some friends, and drank rather too freely—the pri<lb></lb>soner took me to Rupert-street—I had between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my waist<lb></lb>coat pocket when I went into the house, also a pencil-case, and some silver—I had one half-crown, several shillings, and a farthing—I was in a room with her about a quarter of an hour—I did not give her any sovereign—she asked for some gin, and I gave the servant 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the gin; and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for herself—the prisoner went away almost imme<lb></lb>diately—I do not think any person but her could have taken my money—I missed it—she was taken in a few minutes—I did not see her again till the next day at the office—I have no doubt she is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living there as servant. This gentleman and the prisoner came, to the house—I had seen the prisoner there before—the prisoner took a light, and showed the gentleman up into a room, and said she would settle with the landlady presently—she came down in about five minutes, and said she would not stop with him—the landlady said she should not go out of her house without him—she then said the would go up stairs again—I went up soon after, and asked the gentleman what he intended to do—he said, "To stop all night;" and asked what the room was—I said, "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the prisoner then asked him for some gin—he gave me a shilling, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for gin and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for myself—the prisoner was then by his side, and when I came back from fetching the gin, she was standing by his side—she came down stairs soon afterwards, and said she would go—I said she should not go without the gentleman—she stood a minute, and then slipped out and ran away—my mistress sent the servant of the next house after her, and the prosecutor called out that he had lost his money—she was brought back.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head, in St. James'-street. The prisoner has been about three years attending the coaches at the Gloucester coffee-house; he came to me with a 10l. note, and asked me to give him change; I am not certain whether it was on the 20th or the 21st of July; he said it was for Mr. Ryder is the Gloucester coffee-house - Mr. Ryder is the proprictor of the booking-office; I think I gave him a 5l. note and five sovereigns, but I am not certain; I put Mr. Ryder's name on the note, and paid it to Mr. Winch, of Crutched-friars - I know the note by my own hand-writing on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in a considerable way of business? A. No; I put the name of the person I took it of on the note - I might have twenty notes at that time.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the coach-office at the Gloucester coffee-house. The prisoner was employed by the proprietor of the Bath and Bristol mail; I remember the proprietor of the Bath and Bristol mail; I remember the parcel the prosecutrix has described, from its being on the books of the office, and from its being entered in the way-bill of the mail by myself; it should have gone by the Bath and Exeter mail - the parcels are taken out by the porters of the office, assisted by the porters coming with the mail; the prisoner would have access to this parcel, as he generally came into the office the last thing, to inquire if we had any more parcels belonging to such a mail; I have reason to believe this parcel never arrived at its place of destination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there many men about whose duty it was to take parcels out? A. Yes, there are necessarily; I have no recollection of whom I gave the parcel to - the coaches were all gone, and there was only the mail for it to go by; the lady said by the first coach - there are about seven mails come there, and about two porters to each.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, on the 20th or 21st of July, direct the prisoner to go and get change for a 10l. note for you? A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was stationed to attend the Bath and Bristol coaches; I seldom do any thing for the Bath, except unloading the mail - I sometimes put in a parcel, if the man is busy, and if this had been given to me I should have put it in; the note was given me by some one in the office to get changed, but who I could not tell - I am daily in the habit of getting change, and it is not always possible to ask the name; I can declare, upon my oath, that I did not put three parcels in a week into the coach, and the coachman was always present to count them.</p>

The two prisoners came and looked in at my window for some time, and I suspected they were about robbing the place; I went to the door, and one asked me if I wanted to buy a handkerchief; I said, "What do you want for it?" he said 1s. - I said it was too much. and then one of them said I should have it for 9d. - I said I did not want it; the wind blew Anderson's coat aside, and I saw a shawl under it - I asked what he wanted for that - he said 7s.; I said I had not the money with me, and asked him to come in; Arderson then asked me if I kept a fence - I said I did not know what he meant; he said, "To receive stolen goods;" I asked what they had got, and they said jewellery, and they could let me have some in an hour; I detained them, and sent for an officer who secured them; this is the shawl.</p>

I went to the place on the 20th and saw the two prisoners; the shawl and handkerchief were lying on the counter - I took them to Mr. Smith, and asked if they were the boys who bought the handkerchief; he said Yes, and owned the shawl - I searched them, and found 4 1/2d. and a bit of paper - they both said they picked up the shawl in the shop.</p>

I said 1s. - he said, "That is too much, we can get them for 6d. in the shops;" he said, "Will you sell that shawl?" I said No; he said, "You had better sell it;" I said, "What will you give?" he said 7s.; he kept us till he saw a gentleman coming across and sent for an officer.</p>

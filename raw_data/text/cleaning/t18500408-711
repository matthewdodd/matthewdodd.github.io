On the evening of 1st March, I saw the two prisoners together at Hackney-wick, about a mile from the Green Dragon—they stole a jar of snuff—I saw them together afterwards in a lane about half a mile from the Green Dragon, and Wilkins had this coat under his arm—I took it from him, and asked him to give me the snuff back—he said the coat was his father's—I said I did not think it was his father's—I went with him to his father's house, and his father was not at home—when I told Wilkins I should go to his father's, Fisher ran away—I saw the two prisoners together next morning.</p>

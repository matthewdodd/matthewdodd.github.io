The prisoner was three weeks in my service; I had my suspicions, and as I was going into the kitchen I found a pair of new stockings hanging out of his coat pocket, which was in the cupboard; while he was cleaning the front room window I called up Brown, my shopman, and left him there while I fetched Sapwell, the officer. I called Brown down - he was to send the prisoner out with a parcel; I cannot state what transpired afterwards, except that after he was detained I saw him throw some duplicates on the floor, which I took up, and gave to Sapwell.</p>

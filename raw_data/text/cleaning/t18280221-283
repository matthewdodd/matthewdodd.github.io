Between five and six o'clock on the 11th of January; I was going along Battle Bridge-road - it snowed; I met the prisoners there- they could not get on with the waggon; I and some others assisted them - Keating got into the waggon between two hogsheads, which were in it: they got as far as Weston-street, and there they staid some time; we found fault with Garrard for using his horses so badly, - I then walked round the waggon, and Keating jumped out - thinking something was wrong, I pursued and took him; he said, "Pray let me go," and asked for his hat.</p>

            . I live in Cottage-place, City-road. I saw the waggon - Booth was talking to Garrard about whipping his horses so much; I caught hold of the horses head, and then Booth went back, and was talking under a light to a man who I could not see; Garrard then came up to me, used very bad language, and said, "What, did you never see a waggon with two horses before:" I then thought I saw something move in the waggon under the matting - I touched it with my umbrella, and Keating jumped out; we caught him, and he was taken to the watch-house: Beal came up and said, "This is my sugar, and was coming to my house" - the hogsheads were then taken to his house, and it was found 26 lbs. had been taken out of one - a few nails were found on Keating; he said he lived in the Commercial-road - there was a bag of sugar - I saw it at Mr. Beal's; I think I saw a man bring it from the waggon, but I cannot swear that - it was opened, and contained sugar, which Beale compared with the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it dark? A. Not very - there were gas-lights; I do not think it snowed at that time; I think I did see the bag taken from the cart - I may have sworn so at the office.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Skinner-street, St. Pancras.

            . The nails found on Keating would nail the tin on - it is done with any kind of nails; there was a chasm in the sample-hole; I have no doubt the sugar in the bag was the same as that in the hogshead - part of it was running out when I took it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. If the plate had come off by accident, could they do better than put the bag to catch it? A. No; but that quantity could not have come out of itself; the proper way would be to turn the hole to the top.</p>
               <p>KEATING'S Defence. I met Garrard in Gray's Inn-lane- he could not get on: the sugar was running out - he told me to get up and get a little out, in a bag; I picked up the nails on Galley-quay.</p>
               <p>GARRARD'S Defence. I met him, and said I would give him a pint of beer to go with me; the tin had robbed off, by rubbing against the other hogshead - I had a bag, and told him to get in and catch it; the tin was nearly off when I had it.</p>

            . Mr. Lowe told me that the prisoner who was then crossing the square, had picked a gentleman's pocket; I pursued him; he ran through a passage into Serle-street, and threw the handkerchief into Mr. Green's passage - I pursued and took him in the next street; when I brought him back, a little girl had picked up this handkerchief and gave it me.</p>

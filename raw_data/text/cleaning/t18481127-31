                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 11, Gloucester-terrace, Kensington-gate. On the afternoon of 3rd Nov., at ten minutes before one o'clock, I was coming through Kensington-gardens, along the flower-walk, which is the most public walk in the gardens, between Mount-gate and Kensington, abutting on the park-railings—I had a reticule tied very tightly round my left wrist, containing a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, a half-crown, a sixpence, and a small bill of my poulterer's—there was a small alcove in the gardens, which I had passed some yards—I had not seen any one in it but a woman, whose appearance I did not like—I did not hear any footstep after passing the alcove, but I felt a tremendous blow on the right shoulder, which knocked me flat on the ground, and when I was down I saw a man, who I most solemnly declare before God, is the prisoner, stoop over me—I held the reticule very tight, but after a struggle the string broke, and he got it off my wrist—as it was turned <hi rend="italic">topsey turvey</hi> one of the checks dropped out—he dropped a black glove of his own, which the park-keeper picked up—I am now suffering so much from the effects of the violence, that it is with the greatest pain I give my evidence—my arm was bruised.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Myers, clothier, of Wigmore-street. On Friday, 3rd Nov., about two o'clock, the prisoner came there to purchase a suit of clothes—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—he produced a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check to pay for them—I asked him where he got it—he said his mistress had given it him in part payment for his wages, and he had to receive a certain portion, he intended to get the cheque changed, and to return the other—I was not satisfied, and called Mr. Myers, and gave him the cheque—he took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> down to St. James's, to learn something about the cheque—I kept the prisoner there during that time—he was then given into custody—I noticed that he had only one glove, that was a dark one—on the following evening I found this purse under our show-board.</p>

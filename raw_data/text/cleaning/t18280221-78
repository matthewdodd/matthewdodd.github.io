            . I am servant to Mr. Waters. About eight o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner at the hay-stack; he looked round the corner, saw me, and ran off - I ran and caught him - he dropped a bit of lead from under his arm; I picked it up, and laid it down again, and caught him - he was a stranger; Cullum picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing the field; a young man in a fustian jacket dropped a piece of lead - I was picking it up, and the witness took me.</p>
               <p>HENRY SNELLING. There was a young man near the place - he ran away; they were close together; but when they saw me, they parted and ran off - I ran and caught the prisoner who dropped the lead from under his arm.</p>

               <p>I am a cordwainer. Mr. Newton called on me, and asked me to go with him, when the prisoner was taken up by Old Tyburn; he confessed he pawned the things; and we found them at the pawnbroker's, Mr. Mangeter's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Newton deposes to the gown and piece of cotton. I know it by the old fashioned make; I had it made last year; and I had it made that old fashioned way, because I thought it suited me best; the piece of cotton is the same as the gown; it was in the drawer.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The petticoat was pledged pretty near four months before I left the lodging, by the consent of that gentlewoman; I asked her for some cash? she told me she had none; the next was the sheets, nigh three months before I left the lodging; and according to agreement, I was to have clean sheets every month; she told me she had no cash to lend me; she said I might take the sheets if I pleased; my wife was continually pledging her things, backwards and forwards; and that same gown once before; the last thing that was pledged, was near two months before I left the lodging; when I asked for my bill, I thought it was very large; we made it up to the 13th of March; we put in the interest; I said, look over the bill, and see if it is right? says she, I never kept any account; oh, says I, I will make affidavit I kept a just account; to the best of my knowledge, she looked on the bill, and said she was very well satisfied; and she signed it: the magistrates said they could not make it felony; they said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240196"></xptr>you have signed your husband's property away: every word as I shall answer before your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, before heaven; and they gave me that copy; Mr. Green kept the bill which he has; I thought that if a person was indebted to a creditor, that they should have the bill by them; but I am deprived of it; it is the first Court that ever I was before in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Newton. He says this petticoat was pledged by your consent, and the sheets and the cloak; is that true, or is it not? - It is not true.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give him leave to pledge any of these things which were pledged, which were missing? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is all that false which he says? - That, Sir, is very false.</p>
               <p>At the time he was a lodger to you, did you ever desire him to pawn any thing for you? - What I begged his wife to do, I always had the paper and the bill; but as to these articles, I never saw any; those things she carried for me, I have got again; I have taken them out myself.</p>
               <p>Then you are very sure that none of these things that are missing, were at your request pawned by him? - None of them: we were settling money that I lent him; he was to pay me sixteen shillings a week for his and his wife's board; I did put my hand to that, for the debt he owed me, and for nothing else but the debt; this has been added afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in that account about pledges? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have one favour to beg (she says she knows nothing of the things lent to pledge) which is, to ask her what the whole debt is.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Newton. Can you tell me what was the whole amount of the debt? - Upon my word I cannot; for I thought of receiving the money; he pretended he had a one hundred pounds draft in his pocket; and that he was put off from time to time receiving it.</p>
               <p>And was that the reason that you settled the account in this way? - Yes.</p>

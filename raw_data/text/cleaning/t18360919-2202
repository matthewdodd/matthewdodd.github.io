Cook, I left it all ready on the dresser"—(we frequently carried it up stairs to save him the trouble)—I went into the pantry with Eliza and him, and the plate was gone—he said, "Oh! what is to be done? the plate is gone!"—he said, "Oh! my master will have me takes up"—we searched to see if any body was in the house—he went with us into every room, and finding nobody, he went to inform master—that was about ten o'clock—he returned with my master, and was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody that night.</p>

I had occasion to pass from the kitchen up stairs—I went through the hall; the first time I went up the hall door was shut—it was merely on the latch—it ought to have been locked—this was about eight o'clock—there are panes of glass on each side of the hall door—one of the shutters was down, and the other up—the pantry opens into the hall, very close to the door—there was a light in there, which would enable any body outside, looking through the glass, to see if any body was in the hall—I saw the plate-basket on one end of the dresser at that time, and the candle on the other end—the plate was quite safe—I went up again in about twenty minutes or half an hour—I then found the back door open—I closed it but I cannot say whether the plate was there, as I did not suspect any<lb></lb>thing—I am quite certain it was there on the first occasion—I did not see a creature about the house.</p>

At this time I was staying at Walthamstow—it was my temporary dwelling-house—the prisoner came into my employ about the 1st of August—on the 2nd of September I was dining out, and about a quarter past ten o'clock, just as I was preparing to return home, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me—he knew as early as nine o'clock that morning that I was going to dine out, as I had sent him to the house to inquire at what time the dinner hour was—he came to me at ten o'clock, and said something very serious had occurred at home—I asked him what it was—he said the plate was all gone—I asked him how it happened—he said he did not know, he had left it all safe in the pantry, and had been out to the boot-maker, and then told the story about being frightened by somebody jumping out of a bridge—I</p>

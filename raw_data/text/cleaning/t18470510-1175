                  </hi>. I am assistant-inspector of letter-carries in the post-office. I know the prisoner—I was at the post-office on the morning of the 3rd of April, and saw the prisoner there—he should have been on duty at a quarter after five—I know his writing, and find his signature in the book as having arrived at five o'clock in the morning—in the interval between his arrival and the time he went out to carry letters, at twenty-five minutes after eight, he would have the opportunity of taking the letter in question—he was what is called a chance man, and in the absence of Persons, the regular carrier, he was put on as a substitute—there is a firm of Rogers, Olding, in Lombard-street, and Rogers, Nephew, in Friday-street district, and it happens in sorting that letters get sorted to the wrong walk, being directed only "London"—if this letter had been directed to Lombard-street this would not have occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Rogers, Nephew, might have got this letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible—it might be delivered to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it was sorted to Friday-street instead of Lombard-street, would the man who had the Friday-street delivery receive it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he ought not to have taken it out of the officer, well knowing it was not in his delivery—it should have been given to the sorter, to sort what we call blind letters—the dispatch was ten minutes after seven that morning—the prisoner may have had a morning duty in the Inland Office previous to that time—letters are brought to the carries by a person who signs for that duty, but the letters in Friday-street are divided to two persons—he might have had this letter by its being mis-sorted—the letter are brought up and laid on the carrier's seats—the prisoner's seat was not near the Lombard-street seat—he would have been noticed if he went to the Lombard-street walk, and took a letter—the only way I can account for his having it is the mi-sorting of the letter.</p>

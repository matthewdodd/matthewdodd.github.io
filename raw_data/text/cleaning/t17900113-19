               <p>I believed you charged another person with the fact? - The first time when I charged him with picking my pocket, says he, you may as well say that man is picking your pocket? I replied, yes, I believe that man is employed in picking pockets, as well as you; I took no other person to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Then you never took any other man out of the passage, or by your desire? - No.</p>
               <p>There were two examinations at Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you swear this at Bow-street, that you found the money in the prisoner's hand? - I swore at Bow-street the same as now.</p>
               <p>Did you swear the first time you was at Bow-street, that you found a part of the money in the prisoner's hand? - I did not find it; the prisoner was examined, and some money was found about him; I had a French half crown, and a French shilling.</p>

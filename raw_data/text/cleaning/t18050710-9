               <p>Prisoner. There was another woman that was with her that told me where to come to; I had been drinking with her all the evening; it is well known that nothing else than girls of the town live in the court.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner was brought down to the Office by the witness; I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100012"></xptr>him into custody, and on searching him I found this skeleton key; I have tried a number of locks with it, and it has opened twenty out of twenty-four; the staple was wrenched off the door, and I found the lock lying on the furniture of the bed when I went into the room. He said he was very sorry for what he had done; he wished me to let him go; I went and searched his box, and I found that letter which I have delivered to you.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What state was the padlock in when you saw it? - A. It had been knocked off the door, it was bruised at the side, as though it had been hit with a hammer; he got the padlock off by drawing the staple; the staple was put in again; I found the staple quite loose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not I very much in liquor? - A. You were at the time you were brought to me.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. Are you married? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She told that gentleman that her husband was working in Tottenham Court-road.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He works for Messrs. Haines and Roberts, in Piccadilly; he has been at Richmond for this month.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. What family has Mr. Solomon? - A. His wife, two children, and her sister.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. Whether you have any knowledge of that woman the prisoner speaks of? - A. She is a cousin of mine; her brother is a sheriff's officer, his name is Holmes; she had not been out two minutes when I saw this man standing with her; I sent that woman to a tailor with a pair of breeches, and when I came home she was behind me with the breeches in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your cousin appear against the prisoner on his examination? - A. She was at Guildhall, but she was not asked any questions.</p>
               <p>Court. The worthy Alderman is here; he does not remember any questions being asked of that person.</p>

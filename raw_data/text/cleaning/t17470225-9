               <p>Roades. Yes. Last Tuesday Se'nnight, as I was sitting in my Back-room, the Shop-door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked?</p>
               <p>Roades. I thought it was locked, but it was not: The Stockings that were taken away was the Property of Mr Dowsel, that I had to wash; they were to have been carried home that Afternoon, but they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was taken out of the Shop?</p>
               <p>Roades. All the soul Linen I had for five Weeks, these Silk Stockings I washed for that Gentleman, and several others; it is a particular Business I do for them, and no others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any Tea?</p>
               <p>Roades. Yes, they sold it for a Pound and half; as to the direct Weight I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the Prisoners come into your Shop?</p>
               <p>Roades. I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see your Goods?</p>
               <p>Roades. At Mr Hollingsworth's. There I saw six Pair of Stockings, and several of my Caps, Hoods and Sleeves, and Handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever come to the knowledge of all, or any Part of your Tea?</p>

               <p>Q. to Holloway. What had the other twelve People to do with you?</p>
               <p>Holloway. Please ye, my Lord, there were two Buyers there, and another that use to carry off the Goods when they were bought; they were cleared here on Wednesdays, on Account of the Buckles, the Stockings, as soon as we had looked them over, one of the Prisoners gave them to a Woman, and she put them somewhere, but I can't tell where.

               <p>On 28th April I was on duty at Paddington—the train from Exeter came in at eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner on the platform before the train came in; when the luggage was being delivered, I saw him take a portmanteau from within the bar, and take it to an omnibus—the conductor put it on the roof, and he got inside—Mr. Marsh and the guard came to me—we went to the omnibus, and Mr. Marsh owned the portmanteau—it was taken down, and the prisoner got out, walked a few paces, and began running—I pursued him one way and the conductor another—he caught him on the steps, just as I came up and brought him back.</p>

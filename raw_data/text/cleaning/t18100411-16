On the 15th of March, a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in my parlour at the back of my shop; some persons came into my shop, and gave me information that my shop window was cut. I went to the window; I perceived one of my panes of glass had been cut or starred. There was a hole sufficient to get them articles out, not sufficient to put any hand in; I perceived the tray where we put the things inside of the window had been pulled about; I missed a number of articles, but what at the moment I could not say. I was in the shop about half an hour before; then I saw the tray; it stood close to the glass; it contained gold seals and gold ear-rings, and gold things of different kinds; the articles all were safe in the tray at that time. In a very short time the prisoners were brought in by Mr. Swan, the constable, and a man of the name of Winter. The prisoners were searched, a silver watch was found upon Stoker; that was not any thing that I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of your property found upon either of the prisoners. - A. No; and not finding the property upon them, I supposed they must have dropped them somewhere; I directed Sheldrick to go under the gateway, where these boys were found standing; he brought me a gold seal, a gold finger ring, and a gold finger ring with a Cornelian drop; shortly after, another gold ring was brought in by Pickett, another seal, and a finger ring; they were all my property.</p>

             I am a labouring man. On the 15th of March, about ten minutes after four, I was at the sign of the King and Queen, Kensington, it is nearly opposite of Mr. Acres's shop, I saw the prisoners they were standing against Mr. Acres's shop window; I saw Brown run his hand down the window, I could not see whether he had any thing in his hand; I then saw him give Stoker something twice, which appeared to me to come out of the window; upon seeing this I ran over too Mr. Swann, he came out of his house; we went up the gateway at the corner of Mr. Swann's house; both the prisoners were under the gateway, they were both stooping; I collared them both and took them into Mr. Acres's shop, and a watch was found upon Stoker. I went under the gateway to where the prisoners had been stooping, by the step of the back door, there I picked up two bits of tickets, they were in a puddle near the step.</p>
               <p>MR. SWANN. Q. We understand you are a constable of Kensington - A. Yes. Winter came over to me, we went under the gateway adjoining my house, we saw the two boys, they were by a back door under the gateway; they were searched in Mr. Acres's shop, nothing of his property was found upon them. I have the gold articles that were afterwards found, they were delivered to me by Mr. Acres; I put them altogether.</p>
               <p>- SHELDRICK. I am a waterman at Kensington. I was standing at the Marquis of Granby, directly opposite of Mr. Acres's. After the prisoners were taken I went into the shop, some person said the boys had been under the gateway, I and Pickett went under the gateway, and just by Mr. Billet's door, Pickett saw a piece of wire lay, and with that wire he pulled up a finger ring, a seal, and an earring, he took them into Mr. Acres's shop; after he was gone I searched in the same spot, and found a finger ring, a seal, and an ear-ring; I laid them on Mr. Acres's counter.</p>
               <p>Stoker said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I am innocent of the crime.</p>
               <p>Thomas Pickett was called, and not appearing in court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>Stoker called no witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Brown called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

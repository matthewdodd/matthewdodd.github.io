            . I was coming from Little Chelsea, with my waggon - I drive for Mr. Beach. I saw the prisoner about half a mile from Kilsby's, he passed me about nine o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January; with a sack on his shoulder; he went into an empty house, and threw the bag down the area. I informed

            . Brown gave me information. I went, and found the prisoner in the house, and the sheets under the stairs; he said he knew nothing of them. I asked him what he had done with the sack, he said he knew nothing of it, that he had been lodging in the house, and taking a nap. I asked who else was in the house; he said nobody, and under the back kitchen stairs, I found a sack containing the sheets.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to Parson's-green, and passing the empty house, I saw a handkerchief in the area. I got down, and found the bag there. - I took them up, carried the bag some way, and on looking into it, I found some linen, thought it might bring me into trouble and carried them back, went up stairs to see if I could find any body, and the officer came.</p>

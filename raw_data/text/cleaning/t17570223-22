            . I live in Pepper-Alley, have known the prisoner several years, and have bought several things of him. He brought this tea kettle and plates to my house, and said his wife was dead, that he was going to sea, and he had rather bring them to me than any body else. He was a master baker in the Borough. I bought these things of him.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This tea-kettle and these plates are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My brother-in-law is the man that prosecutes me, and this certainly is done out of spight. I was going to work in the morning, and met a soldier with a bundle on his head. I had seen him at Windsor. He asked me to go in and drink. He said, he had got a few things to dispose of, and I could sell them better than he. As far as I can understand, he was at my brother's house all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did a soldier come to your house that day?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a man came in a soldier's dress. He came from Blackwall, with a message from a taylor. He said, he believed the sailor to be my brother-in-law. When he went away, he went out at one door, and I at the other. When my wife and I came home we found the key in the door, and we missed the things mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the key in the door at going out?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was left over the street-door for me. The soldier did not see the key laid there. Here is one that can prove the soldier did not take the things away.</p>

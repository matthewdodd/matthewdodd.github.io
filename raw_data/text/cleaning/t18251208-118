The prisoner was in my employ about twelve months; he was to carry out goods, and clean goods in the show-room. In consequence of suspicion, I got a warrant to search his premises in the beginning of November - the officer Clements, and the prisoner went with me. I had told him I had a warrant to search his premises, which I knew to be in John-street, Fitzroy-square. When we went out, he was about to turn to the left hand instead of the right, and then I found he had left those lodgings, but his box was still there - we went there, and found the box, which was locked - the officer broke it open, and some of the property was in it - we then went to his other lodgings, where we found the remainder of my property.</p>

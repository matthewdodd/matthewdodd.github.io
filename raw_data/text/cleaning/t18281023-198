               <p>WILLIAM WINGROVE. On the 15th of October I was working at an unoccupied house in <placeName id="t18281023-198-crimeloc1159">Liverpool-street, Battle-bridge</placeName>

I went out for about ten minutes, about half-past eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner going out of the house - I looked and missed my saw - I followed him; I took him coming from behind a cask; a witness went and took the saw - this is it.</p>

            . I was coming up the streeet, and saw the prisoner come out of the house; I said to the witness, "I don't like that man" - he went in, and missed his tenant's saw; I had not seen any thing in the prisoner's hand, but I ran after him, and saw him coming from behind a cask; I did not see any body else but him between the house and the cask - I charged him with taking it; he said nothing.</p>

            . I am street-keeper. I took the prisoner running from Wingrove's, and as he was turning into the street I saw the handle of a saw in his bosom - he turned into another street, and in a minutes or two he was brought to me; he begged very hard to be let go.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was not there at all - it is not uncommon for me to be employed in paper-hanging, and as this house was not finished I went to see for the master, and seeing no one, I came out; I was met by the witness, who said I had stolen the saw, which I had not- as to the saw sticking out of my bosom I solemnly declare it did not.</p>

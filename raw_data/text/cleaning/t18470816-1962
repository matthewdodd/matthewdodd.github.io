                  </hi> On the 25th of July, at half-past eleven o'clock, I was coming down the Commercial-road—Alice M' Lean and another female spoke to me, we went to a public-house and drank—we came out, they still stopped, and kept talking to me—the other woman then left—I felt for my watch, and it was gone—I said to Alice M' Lean, "You have been taking my watch"—she said, "No, it must be the old woman"—I said I would give her in charge—she begged and prayed, and went down on her knees, and said she would give me the watch—she took me down to Bluegate-fields, and said to an old woman there, "Will you go and see if Mr. <hi rend="italic">So-and-So</hi> is there"—she went, came back, and said he was not—Alice M' Lean then ran to a door-way—I ran, caught her by the shoulder, just in the door-way, pulled her into the street, and called "Police!"—William M' Lean then came out, struck me, and knocked me down—I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

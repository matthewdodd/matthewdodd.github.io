            . I was serving in Mr. James's shop on the 25th of April. I saw the two prisoners both come into the shop, they came in together a little after seven o'clock; I produced a box of lace Smith asked for the lace; the other was standing by the first box of lace that I shewed them; she said that was not the width. I removed that box, and shewed another, she then made choice of our card.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Atkinson ask the price of the lace - A. No, Smith chose two yards and a half of lace at six shillings a yard. During the time I was measuring the two yards and a half, she removed two cards of lace from the box, she then returned one of the cards and that card she put on the counter; I communicated my suspicions to Mrs. James, she sent for a constable, Mrs. James came home before the constable came, a constable came; Mr. James then asked me what I had to say respecting the prisoners, I said I suspected she had a card of lace; she said they was very welcome to search her; she was searched and one card of lace was found in her pocket; I saw it taken from her; that card I saw taken from the box; she dropped another of the cards from her pocket; the lace that was found in her pocket was twenty two yards, at two shillings a yard.</p>

            . I was sent for about ten minutes after seven by Mr. James, the servant came for me, I saw the two prisoners in the shop; during the time I was at the door, Mr. Jones came in; he desired me to stop, I stopped about ten minutes, Mr. James called me in, and gave me charge of both the prisoners. Mr. James picked up one card, he said, she had just dropped it, I searched Smith, and in her pocket, I found this card of lace, it has the shop mark on it. When I had secured the lace, she pretended to faint away, and threw herself on the ground, I shewed the lace to Mr. James, and he claimed it, I asked Atkinson whether she knew her; she said she did; she was sorry she came in with her, I have kept the lace ever since in the same state as I found it.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES. This lace is my property, it has my private mark upon it, both cards of lace are my property.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I called on Atkinson and asked her if she would go to Holborn with me to buy a bit of lace; we went to Mr. James's, and the person shewed me two boxes of lace, they were all very dear; a card of lace was found on my clothes, I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

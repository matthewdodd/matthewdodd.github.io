             (Police-constable N 34). About one o'clock on Saturday morning, the 10th of November, I apprehended the prisoner, from the prosecutor's description - I had seen her the same morning in the Vinegar-ground, with a brown purse - she emptied some money into her hand, and saw three sovereigns quite distinctly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Robin-hood, and asked the female to go home - she told me to go and shut the sutters; I went out, and was tying my pattens, when the prosecutor came and tapped me on the shoulder - he asked where I lived, and I told him; but he said it was too far to go, and bade me good night.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 2d of March, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18260406-204-crimeloc1100">King-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Then you did not see Costigani till you saw him in Broad-court? - A. Yes; they were together when the handkerchief was drawn; I did not know him before.</p>

            . I was in company with Bertraun the whole time, and saw all he has described; when we saw them looking at the handkerchief I went and took Costigani, who had then got the handkerchief round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How can you account for his having it round his neck? A. A handkerchief is tied round a neck in a minute; when I first saw it they were looking at it under the gas-light, but before we got to them he had got it on his neck; I suppose they did not see us looking at them - we got up to them in about a minute. Bertraun took it off. I am quite sure I saw Costigani in King-street, perhaps for five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT to ANGELIOUS BERTRAUN. Q. What time elapsed between your seeing the third boy take the handkerchief, and your seeing the three boys looking at it? - A. About a quarter of an hour; I did not lose sight of Costigani, except when he turned the corner. I took the handkerchief, which was tied round his neck; I did not see him tie it round.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>COSTIGANI'S Defence. My mother lets out a room in Wild-court; she sent me to see if the lodger had paid the rent, and when I got to Covent-garden I saw a lad named Smith, who said he was going to Bedfordbury; he went to buy some oranges, and I went on - when I was in King-street a lad came and said, "Is not that William?" I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060084"></xptr>Yes, and he said he would go with me to Wild-court, and a boy, they call Jack, the plasterer, came and asked him to buy a handkerchief - he said he had no money, but the boy pressed him to buy it; he said, "It is small - I do not think it will go twice round my neck;" I said it would go twice round mine. I then saw the two men coming up the court - when I saw the others run I ran.</p>
               <p>TALBOT'S Defence. I met this lad, and walked with him - a lad came and asked if I would buy a handkerchief - I was looking at it when the officer came and took me.</p>

            . I am the brother of the last witness; I saw my brother lock the drawer - I counted the money twice over, and there was 9l. - we had strong suspicion of the prisoner - the drawer was locked with a common key; when I counted the money afterwards there was only 8l. 17s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear that no person was in the place but the prisoner? A. Yes; I do not know that it was stated before the Magistrate that there were other persons there; I swear there were several half-crowns among the money; I do not recollect saying any thing to the prisoner - I do not know what my brother said to him - I was in and out of the toll-room; I never heard him make him any promise to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer, and apprehended the prisoner; he said he knew nothing about the charge, and denied it altogether; he then said if I would let him go to his prosecutor, he would let him know all about it; I took him to old Mr. Chasemore; the old gentleman did not say he should be forgiven if he told what had happened; he told him he was in the hands of an officer, and the law must take its course; the prisoner then said he opened the drawer with a key, which he threw into the water.</p>

               <p>RICHARD CUFF. I belong to Bow-street; I found the key where the prisoner said he had put it, near Putney-bridge - it opens the prosecutor's drawer.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHASEMORE re-examined. The boy has been with us four years, and down to lately we had a good opinion of him: my father never promised the prisoner any favour - he is very ill.</p>

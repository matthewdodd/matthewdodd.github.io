            , and told him the case, and desired a search-warrant; he said, there is no ear-mark to money, and advised me to mark some money, by which means it was most likely to find out the thief. I came home, and told my wife of it; she in my presence, marked fifteen or sixteen newish guineas with a scratch on all of them in one place, on the reverse to the head above the crown; I put them in my breeches-pocket, and went to bed, and laid my breeches as usual in a chair by the bed-side; in the morning I was surprized to miss fix of them; I said nothing at all, but went to Justice Spinnage, and got a search warrant; the Justice came to my house ; we intended to search all my servants; the prisoner was the first we searched; she was my wife's maid, she had lived with us about fifteen months; in her trunk we found about seventy or eighty guineas; among this money were fix particularly marked, in the manner my wife had marked those fifteen or sixteen; there were seven so marked; the seven guineas were all put in a paper, and sealed up by Mr. Spinnage, and delivered to the constable; they are now in court.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any doubt about the guineas?</p>
               <p>Mr. Viner. I had no doubt at all; I do not remember I made the least difficulty in the world about them, whether they were the same; I have some of the other guineas here which my wife marked; (six of them produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. How much were the prisoner's wages a year?</p>
               <p>Mr. Viner. Her wages was eight guineas a year; she had received no wages of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Viner. I believe she lived with me about fifteen months.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Viner. I marked fifteen or sixteen new guineas on Friday evening; I made a little scratch by the crown, and gave them to Mr. Viner, and he put them into his pocket; I was present when the prisoner's trunk was searched; we found six guineas in the trunk that were marked; there was another marked something like them, but I do not swear to that; I believe there were near seventy guineas in her trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the guineas, whether you was not very doubtful whether they were the guineas you had marked?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Viner. I did say I was afraid they were part of the money; but to speak the truth, I was not doubtful; it gave me a great deal of uneasiness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she had some money left her?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Viner. She says her father had left her 50 l. in the country, and I asked her mother, and she confirmed it.</p>

The prisoner was re-examined on the 12th, I was then gone upon duty at the house of commons; they sent for the key, and my wife sent the money sealed up to the Justice's, and whether they were opened there or not I cannot say; this looks to be the same paper, and the seal is firm; (the paper broken, and seven guineas taken out;) the Court and Jury compare and inspect them with the other six produced by Mr. Viner.</p>

Either Mr. Viner or his lady told me in what manner the guineas he had missed were marked, before the trunk was opened; I began to look out for guineas as they had been described to me; I found seven, I believe they were new guineas, they are these produced by the constable; they were all marked alike, as near as could be, and sealed up by Mr. Spinnage's seal, who came in at the time, and put into the hands of the constable; I went to Mr. Roger's house, desiring he would come and bring the money, at her second examination, to Mr. Spinnage; Mr. Rogers was not at home, but he came there a few hours after; Mrs. Rogers delivered the money in the paper out of a chest of drawers; it never was opened at the office.</p>

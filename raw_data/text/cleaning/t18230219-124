On the 6th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was down stairs, and heard a rustling in the shop - the servant called me up. I found the prisoner there; he was charged with stealing 5 or 6 lbs. of soap, which I found missing.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor's. On the evening of the 6th of February, I was at my parlour window, and saw the prisoner and another walking up and down the door. The prisoner went in and took up two or three bars of soap, and ran towards Baker-street - the other followed. I ran out, and saw them both returning without the soap; they passed the shop again two or three times, and the prisoner was going in again. I ran over and secured him. The soap was not found. I am sure of his person; there was a strong light in the shop - he said nothing.</p>

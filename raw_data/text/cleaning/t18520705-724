                  </hi>. I am a writer and grainer, and live in Granby-street, Hampstead-road. On Monday morning, 14th June, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going towards home—two females accosted me at the corner of Brook-street—I passed them by, and they muttered something—the pri<lb></lb>soners ran out—M'Carthy pinioned my arms while Coleman put his hands into my waistcoat pocket—I called "Police!" and received a violent blow from Coleman on the right side of my head with some blunt instrument—I cried "Murder!"—it knocked me down; my clothes were completely deluged in blood—I immediately got on my legs, seized M'Carthy, and called "Murder!" and "Police!" as fast as I could, and held him till a policeman came up—I lost a half crown and my hat—I had drank nothing but my supper beer, and knew perfectly well what I was about; I had been at a friend's house, not at a public house—next day I went to the police office to give my evidence, and saw Coleman there—he was disguised (he wore a dark jacket on the Sunday night)—he came up to me, and said, "About that affair of that young M'Car<lb></lb>thy: he is a young hardworking man, and I hope you will make it up"—I said, "Make it up?" and instantly recognized him and went for an officer—I have not the least doubt that Coleman is the man that struck me.</p>

               <p>momentarily after the women accosted me—no one came up before I got up and caught hold of M'Carthy—it was a very dull night, it had been raining—M'Carthy was behind me with his arm round my waist when I received the blow—I could not see his features then, not till I got hold of him—he did not say he had merely come up—I was not on the ground a minute.</p>

On the morning in question I was at the corner of Fitzroy-place, about 150 yards from this spot—I heard a cry of "Police!" and went to Brook-street—the prisoner Coleman passed me in Fitzroy-place, running, before I heard the cry—he came in a direction from that part of Brook-street where I afterwards saw blood on the pavement—I went up, and found Wills holding M'Carthy—he gave him into my charge—Wills was bleeding from the head, and his coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is covered with blood.</p>

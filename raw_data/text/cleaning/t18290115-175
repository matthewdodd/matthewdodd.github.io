            . I am a Bow-street officer. I took the prisoner on the 3d of December at an attorney's, in Lincoln's Inn - I told him what he was charged with: he said he could clear it up.</p>
               <p>MR. MELECH. I was clerk in the same office with the prisoner for nearly three years. I never knew Margaret Evans to inquire for him at the office, but I have seen her at his house; it was in the spring of 1826, I think - the milk business was carrying on there; a little girl was there when I called, and I asked her for Mr. Heath - she went in, and

             came out and said, "Mr. Heath, I suppose you mean Lloyd?" I said very likely it was Lloyd, and I left a note for him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was their milk business going on? A. I saw utensils about - I will not swear it was in 1826; it might be before or after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was introduced to the prosecutrix in September, 1824, at an assembly, in Ship-yard, Temple-bar; in consequence of unpleasant domestic occurrences, I occasionally spent my evening from home, and not wishing my friends to know I frequented so low a place, I took the name of Lloyd there; the prosecutrix did not know any thing relating to me till several months afterwards, though she resided in Devonshire-street, and I within half a mile of it - I mention this to shew the impossibility of my living there, and her not knowing how I was situated previous to Christmas, 1825; I told her my residence, name and every circumstance; I know it took place previous to Christmas, 1825, because her residence was then turned into a milk-shop, and told her while the front was being taken down; she knew this, though she comes to day and swears she knows nothing of it - it is for nothing but to extort money from me.</p>

               <p>DEAR LLOYD. - You may rest satisfied I will take no advantage of your having a first wife living, if we are married.</p>

               <p>Q. You remember this paper being shewn you? A. Yes, and I took a note of it in a memorandum-book - he desired me to note it particularly; he asked me to look at that letter, and remember that I had seen it - I did not make any mark on it; I have not my memorandum-book here; he did not dictate any memorandum - he desired I should remember it in case any thing should happen; I did not say the paper will speak for itself - here is the date on it; I read it, but did not ask why it was shewn me - I believe I told him it was felony to have a second wife; I do not know what he said.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were desired to notice the date of it? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you at Mr. Health's mother's in 1826? A. Yes, all the year - I saw Margaret Evans there in May that year - there was a child there very ill, and who is since dead; she asked if that was Mr. Heath's, and expressed great sorrow at its illness.</p>

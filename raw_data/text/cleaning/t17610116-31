               <p>Levi. I brought it of the prisoner at the bar the very same day.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for it?</p>
               <p>Levi. I gave her a crown for it, there is eight pounds of copper of it. I met her with it in the public street. I go about buying old cloaths. I said, Goodey, do you sell this old copper? What do you ask for it? She said, A crown. I gave her a crown for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Levi. I never saw her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find her out again?</p>
               <p>Levi. Because Mr. Harding's man went with me to where she had first offered it to a brazier. The brazier's man went with us to her lodgings. We went two or three times, and she was not at home; and the prosecutor said he would prosecute me, if I did not find her. Then I went and found her out, and brought her to Mr. Harding's house; there she owned she sold it to me for a crown; and the same she owned before the alderman, and there she said she had had it eleven years.</p>

            . I am a waiter, and live in Somerset-place, New-road. On the 19th of September I was in the Commercial-road, and saw two or three men following this cart - I walked down to the turnpike; the cart stopped to pay toll, and was going on - I saw the prisoner run up, spring out, and take a parcel (as it appeared) from the back of the cart; he walked away in a contrary direction with it; I followed and told a watchman, who took him with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever say to any one that you doubted whether he was the man? A. No; there were three examinations - I never said, that if I was paid my expenses by the prisoner's friends, it would be more pleasant to me. I have received no money from them or anybody - I do not know Sims or Fitzpatrick - I was not at home at the second examination, as I had slept at my aunt's, and did not receive the summons in time; I went in the evening, and gave bail for my appearance. I know the Black-horse in Lemon-street - I have been there, but not with any one; I spoke to no woman there; I saw Sims at the office, but not at the Black-horse; I never told Sims to pay my mother 7s. 6d. - she told me this morning that she hoped I would not hurt the prisoner.</p>

On the 16th of January, about six o'clock in the evening. I went up to the top warehouse, and found a candle placed in a very dangerous situation, and placed so that it would not he seen at the window - I could find nobody there. I looked about, and just as I took the candle up, I saw Palmer peeping in at the window; he came in; I asked what he did out there - he was agitated, and made no answer. I ran down stairs, and went to the end of my premises; Simmons followed me. I went to the end of the yard, suspecting somebody was there, and that Palmer had been throwing something down to him. Hatt was trying to get over the pails at the end of the warehouse - he had been in the warehouse, and was getting back over a hoard, from the bottom of the warehouse. A house had been pulled down there. He was under the window at which Palmer came in; he was getting over into the street. We stopped him, and found two bundles of whalebone hair, weighing 20 lbs., over the board. I am sure it is mine, by the string round it; it had come from Hull, and is a particular sort of string.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Hatt on your premises - A. He was off the premises. I did not see him on the premises, but he was under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a line falling from the window come upon him - A. No; he was about three yards from it, round the corner at the end of the warehouse; he could not see the window where he stood. It was not usual for me to go up stairs at that time. There was a small piece of glass broken in the window, but not sufficient for the hair to fall out.</p>

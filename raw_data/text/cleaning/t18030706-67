               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Better than half past twelve o'clock at night, as near as I can tell the time; I felt in my pocket, and found a penny-piece; he said, give me that; I said, no, I have no other money about me, and I cannot give you that; but I said, I am a watchman in Bishopsgate-street, opposite the London Tavern door, and whatever man was upon duty for me, I could get three-pence or four-pence for his civility in offering to see me home, and he walked with me; I met with the officer of the night, Mr. Bailey; he asked me why I was not on my duty, and I told him I was going to my stand; I did not come from the society time enough to go to my duty; when we came up to Mr. Pinder's door, opposite the London Tavern, the watchman, who was on duty for me, had called the hour of one o'clock; the prisoner then jumped towards me, and said, d-n you, sir, you have got money; he laid hold of my watch-chain, jirked it out, and set off directly with it; I immediately called out, stop thief, and pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q.Had the watch any seals? - A. Yes, a watch-key, and a little trinket; it was so violently pulled from me in a moment, that I could not make any resistance; I had not time, he pushed up against me.</p>

               <p>Q.What did he do to you? - A.Nothing further than laying hold of the watch with both of his hands, and I pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he lay hands upon you at all? - A.He pushed his body against me at the moment that he got the watch; he pushed me against the gate; the watch-box stands within side the gate; I pursued him into St. Mary Axe; he was brought back about seven or eight minutes afterwards, and taken to Leadenhall watch-house; I saw him in Lime-street, he was then in custody of the watchman; I know he is the man that robbed me; I know him by his having on a dark brownish great-coat, and he was a pock-fretten man; I am sure he is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you at the club that evening? - A.About half an hour.</p>

               <p>Q.What did you drink while you were in the club-house? - A. I did not drink any thing there; we returned from the club-house to the Coach and Horses, and spent six-penny worth; I was taken in the same way about six or eight weeks before, when I had had no liquor.</p>

               <p>Q.What had you been drinking? - A.Nothing but porter; there were eight of us, and we spent fifteen-pence among us, that was all; I saw my watch at the Lord-Mayor's the same day; I knew it to be mine; it is an old-fashioned watch, with two seals to it, a key, and a trinket; one seal had a head upon it; the key was a metal key; I shall know it when I see it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you able to swear to this person from his being pock-fretten? - A. I can swear to him by a thousand things.</p>

               <p>Q. It was club-night? - A. Yes; I got there about half an hour before ten.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it your duty to have been upon the watch that night? - A. I go every night, except I am engaged.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060046"></xptr>Q.Was it your duty to have been upon the watch that night? - A. I am not compelled any night, when I have other business that I can do.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you meet in your club? - A. No. 129, Whitecross-street; there were fourteen or fifteen hundred; it is the British Assurance Society.</p>

               <p>Q. How many might then meet? - A.There were a hundred there for any thing I know, but while I was there, there were only eight of us.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A.About ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that is a night-house? - A. I don't know; I never visit night-houses.</p>

               <p>Q.How much did you drink? - A. I did not measure it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you drink? - A. I suppose I drank my share.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be a warm night, and you might drink a little more? - A. No, I am no great drinker.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a dizziness upon you? - A. Yes; it comes exactly like the shock of an apoplectic fi.</p>

               <p>Q.While that is upon you, you don't at all know what you are about? - A. I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been a watchman? - A. Three or four years.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever been a witness here before? - A. No; I wish I had not come here now.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a forty pounds reward? - A. I never enquired about it.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever heard of it? - A.There are very few people but what have heard of it, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost a seal with a head on it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.What head is it? - A. I don't know; it is an engraved head.</p>

               <p>Q.Whether it is Buonaparte, or Cicero, you don't know? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The watch-key, you don't mean to swear was a key of mixed metal? - A. It is a watchkey, I cannot say exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinguish that from any other key? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q.And a trinket, with a lover's knot upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see such a thing before? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you always been a watchman in Bishopsgate? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you ever a watchman in Aldgate parish? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to leave Aldgate parish? - A. I committed an error, in asking for a Christmas box.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you not discharged from the Aldgate beat on account of drunkenness? - A. No, it was on the boxing-day.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you sober? - A. I cannot say I was.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WOOD sworn. - I am a watchman belonging to St. Mary Axe: About a quarter past one, on Tuesday morning last, I heard a cry of stop thief, and I jumped out of my box, and met the prisoner at the bar; I made a push at him to catch him; he ran on the other side of the way; I made an attempt to lay hold of him, and missed him; when he got about twenty yards, I struck at him with a stick, and missed him; I pursued him, and law our patrol coming out of the Saracen's Head yard, in Camomile-street; the prisoner ran across the street; a gentleman and the patrol ran up to him; I saw him fall down; he was taken to the watch-house, and searched, but the watch was not found upon him; it was found upon the grating of a cellar at the last house in Camomile-street, the left-hand side; the prisoner fell upon the grating; he had a watch in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you see the prosecutor? - A. I saw him in St. Mary Axe; after we had taken the prisoner, he said he had lost his watch, and went with us to the watch-house; he saw the man searched there; he said the prisoner was the man that robbed him of the watch; the prisoner did not make any answer, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The watch that was taken from the prisoner's person was not the prosecutor's? - A. No.</p>

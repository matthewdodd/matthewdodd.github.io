               <p>Oct.

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers at the London District-office. In consequence of what had occurred before, on 15th Oct. I placed myself in a situation to command a view of the water-closets, without being seen by the persons in them—it was about half-past two o'clock—some directions had previously been given to the plumber—between ten minutes and a quarter-past three I saw the prisoner enter the closet—I have known him upwards of eight years, the whole time he has been in the office—he seated himself on the seat, and took from his pocket a letter, which he broke opeo, and, in so doing, I observed that there were two postage labels upon it—he then tore the envelope twice cross ways, and threw it down the sink on bis left hand—he then unfolded the letter, took out a small portion of it, which appeared to me to be dirty paper, which he broke, and from which he took a silver coin, I could not say whether it was a shilling or a sixpence—he put it in his trowsers—pocket—he then unfolded the letter further, upon which 1 instantly saw a lady's neckerchief—he destroyed the whole of the letter by tearing it in pieces, apparently made use of it, and threw it in the basin—he then got off the seat, put the handkerchief in his left coat-pocket behind, adjusted his clothes, took the handkerchief from his pocket again, unfolded it, looked at it, then pot it into his pocket, and hurriedly left the closet—I immediately went and informed Mr. Smith, the Superintending President, of that I had seen; and, in consequence of his directions, I went to Blackburn, the plumber, and in a very few minutes I received from him these fragments of a letter, and this envelope—I had sent him to the first of the two water-closets where the prisoner had been—after the prisoner had been taken into the President's room, I accompanied Mr. Sculthorpe down stairs, and saw him take a great coat from a peg pointed out to him by a clerk—that coat was afterwards owned by the prisoner—he changed it in my presence for the one he then had on, and wore it—I saw Mr. Sculthorpe take from the pocket of that coat this handkerchief, which I believe to be the same that I saw the prisoner with in the water-closet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you swear positively that is the handkerchief you saw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I will not; but to the best of my belief it is—the water-closet only contains one seat—there is another closet adjoining it—I had been watching there before a little before one, and then saw the young man who was last tried—I did not return again till half-past two o'clock—I was watching near three quarters of an hour before the prisoner came in—it was at a time when a great many collections arrive from the suburbs—the persons would not quite have finished their duty—I saw no one but the prisoner during the three quarters of an hour—I have not given evidence in other cases of this descrip<lb></lb>tion, only the one this morning—I had watched the prisoner before that day—I had not watched others particularly, I had seen them—I had no instruc<lb></lb>tions to watch anybody, until I observed the prisoner on a former occasion—I have watched the closet before 15th Oct., and seen many persons enter, but did not see anything destroyed—I have been a very short time employed in watching, three weeks at various times—I have not given any evidence with reference to those three weeks, only to-day—the place in which I was would enable me to see both seats—there is a separate door to each closet—they are parted by a partition—I was above the partition, and looked down—I looked through an aperture, not through any glass—there was space enough for me</p>

               <p>to see with both eyes—I occasionally looked with both, and sometimes with one and sometimes the other—it was rather inconvenient for me to look with both—I watched both the seats from the same aperture—I could see both doors at the same time, but not both seats—I am an inspector of letter-carriers, and that is my duty—my duty is according to the instructions of my superior officers—I have many duties at the Post-office—it has been my duty to watch for the detection of frauds—I have been in the Post-office twenty-four years—that has not been my duty during the whole of that time—I have frequently had to do it—I believe that is pretty generally known in the Post-office—I did not go with Blackburn to the closet—I went with him within a short distance of it, and told him which it was—he returned in five or six minutes—I have no other calling besides Post-office duty, I am quite sure of that—I do not carry on any business besides—I had a son in the Post-office, he was eighteen years old—he is not there now—he was dis<lb></lb>charged—I live at 2, Melvin-place—I have not got a greengrocer's shop there—I have nothing to do with it, it is my son's—the same son you allude to—I have not the slightest interest in the business—he is now twenty-five or twenty-six years old—he has been discharged from the Post-office five or six years—his Christian name is the same as my own—the name of "Cole" is over the door—I receive a regular salary for my duty at the office; I receive something in addition—I have received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for attending here to-day, for refreshment, from the Solicitor of the Post-office—I receive other additions to my salary, very trifling—I am frequently sent eight or ten miles into the country, and I have my coach-hire, nothing more—I only receive the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my expenses here—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the last case—I shall receive 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for the days I have been away from the office on this business—I have only been one day before the Grand Jury, and one day here—I shall only receive 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nothing more, except the expense of coach-hire which I have been put to—I was sent last evening to Brixton, to order the persons to attend here—I went to Brixton in an omnibus—from there to Clapham, and from there in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Hayes-place, Lisson-grove; I charge 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for that—I came from Hayes-place to Pentonville in an omnibus—on one occasion, many years ago, I received 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a reward for detecting a man stealing a letter—ray salary is now 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am not paid my additional expenses every week, it may be in the course of a fortnight or a month—I present my bill whenever occasion requires me—I may not have occasion to present a bill for a much longer period—I have not received any other sum besides the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—yes I did, I think two years ago—it was a portion of a reward offered by Government, for the apprehension of a man who escaped from the Post-office—my portion was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never received anything else.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner has been in the employ<lb></lb>ment of the Post-office for eight or nine years—he was on duty on 15th Oct. last—the Clapham two o'clock dispatch arrived at half-past two—the prisoner opened the bag—it was his duty to check the number and amount of the paid letters, and to place the stamped letters on one side to be taken to another portion of the office to be sorted—if there were any stamped letters loose in the bag, he should place them with the bundle of stamped letters to be taken away to be sorted—I saw him that day employed in the performance ofthat duty—in consequence of something I heard, I sent for the prisoner about half-past three that afternoon—I took him into Mr. Smith, the President's private room, and said, "There is a letter missing containing a handkerchief and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you have been seen to destroy it"—he was very much confused—Mr. Smith said, "You hear what Mr. Sculthorpe says; what have you to say?"—he answered," I have not seen such a letter"—he was then searched by Peak—he had on his office or working coat—I asked if he had another coat down-stairs; he said he had—I went down into a room where the men hang their coats up—a coat was pointed out by a man named Everett; and in the left-hand pocket of it I found this handkerchief which has been produced—I then took the coat and handkerchief up-stairs, to the prisoner—I asked whether that was his coat; he said it was—I said, "I have found this handkerchief in the coat pocket"—he said it must have been put there by design or accident, as there were other coats hanging there—he took off the coat he had on, and put on the other, and was taken to the solicitor's office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is the witness Cole in your department? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is; I believe he does not receive anything from the Post-office besides his annual salary—occasionally the Postmaster General has been pleased perhaps to make him a present of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his services—I remember a case of that kind about three years ago—I do not remember any other—he may hare received more—I have only been connected with this painful duty five years—I feel it to be painful, and in consequence of the painful nature of it I have declined to have anything more to do with it—the bag that comes from Clapham would be emptied on the table in the presence of a good many persons, who would be waiting to carry the letters away to other departments—they would not be standing round the table, but sitting side by side—they are porters, the stamped letters are taken by a porter—I do not know what porter took the stamped letters on this occasion; I have not inquired—one porter would not do the whole duty. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has the prisoner at any time refused to perform any duty? on the Friday before this transaction was he asked to do Sunday duty at the Post-office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect on the Friday before he was seen to destroy another letter—that is the only thing I recollect about the Friday before—that was by Cole, not by me—I had the letter afterwards in my possession—I am not aware that he had been asked on the Friday previous to do Sunday duty—I did not ask him—I believe all in the establishment were asked—I believe he refused; I cannot say—he was in my department—I know the names of those in my department who refused, because evervbody has</p>

               <p>refused, and therefore I may say that the prisoner has—there were a great many coats hanging in the place where the prisoner's coat was; there were seven pegs all full—there might have been one or two coats hanging on the same peg—I did not notice—the prisoner's coat was the first I took hold of, it was pointed out to me—it is a common passage, through which a great many persons would go from time to time—the prisoner may at times have called my attention to loose money that had fallen from letters, it is frequently the case—I do not recollect his doing so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the London District Office. I pointed out the prisoner's coat to Mr. Sculthorpe—I knew it to be his; there were no others hanging on the same peg, there were close to it.</p>

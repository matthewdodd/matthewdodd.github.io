                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Sir William Charles Ellis, who lives at Southall, in Middlesex. He has sheep on his premises, which I have the care of—on the 30th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I took a walk round the premises, and in the park I saw a man under the hedge, stooping down—I supposed him to be tying up a bundle of wood, but he remained in the same position for four or five minutes—I looked round and counted the sheep, and found one short—I went back to the house, took two more men with me, and went up to the spot—I found the prisoner with a sheep, killed, and he had partly skinned it, all, except a little part on the neck and loins—I think he had not above a foot to do—he had cut the two legs and two shoulders off and the pluck, and tied it up in a handkerchief—he had taken the rough fat out and put it into another handkerchief, by the side—I collared him, and told him to deliver up the knife—he would not—we then threw him down, and forced the knife from him—we took him into the housekeeper's room, and gave him in charge—the sheep belonged to Sir William Charles Ellis—it had a large E on it, and a cross on the rump—I had marked it myself, about a fortnight or three weeks before—I had counted the sheep two hours before—at that time there were nineteen—I counted them afterwards, and there were but eighteen—this was one of the nineteen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sir William Charles Ellis. I went with Gage and saw the prisoner in the act of skinning the sheep under a hedge, in my master's park—I assisted in securing him—he made a great resistance, and had a knife in his hand—he cut me in the thumb of my right hand, and on the left hand—Gage at last got the knife from him—this happened close to my master's house.</p>

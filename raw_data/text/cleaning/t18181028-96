On the night of the 4th of September I was sitting up for a lodger, my house was shut up. There was a knock at the door, I asked who was there? a voice answered,"A friend!" I opened it, and the prisoner and another woman came in. I refused serving them it being late. They pressed so hard for a glass of gin, saying they were cold, that I served them, and then the other woman went out. The prisoner took hold of my coat, and made an indecent proposition to me, which I refused, and took her by the arm to turn her out, at which time, I suppose, she must have robbed me - She went out immediately. Just before they came in I was looking over my notes, and marking them. I had 170l. in my pocket-book, in the notes stated in the indictment. I was perfectly sober. I had counted my notes before my family went to bed, and put them altogether into my pocket-book, which I put into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did you not ask the prisoner to stop - A. I positively swear I did not. I never gave her the pocket-book.</p>

            , JUN. I am an officer of Hatton-garden. I received information, and searched the prisoner's lodgings in Fitzroy-row, Tottenham-court-road, and found 31 1l. notes in a glove in a drawer, which was locked - I had it picked - She was not at home, her husband was. I found a letter there, in consequence of which, information was sent to Liverpool.</p>

I asked her where she got them? she said she had earned them by washing. I was afterwards present when she saw White, she then said he gave them to her.</p>

             re-examined. I know one of the 1l. notes. I particularly marked it before I put it in my pocketbook. I also know the 5l. note-it has the name of Stevens on it, I took it of him. There is a black mark on the 20l. note, in the same place-it is mine; I have no doubt of its being mine-it has my wife's writing on it.</p>

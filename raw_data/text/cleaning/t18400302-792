                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a lodging-house in Friday-street, Cheapside. The prisoners lodged with me at different times for about two months—in the room where Cannon slept there was a box be<lb></lb>longing to Mr. Thomas William Gent, containing clothes and books—it was left in my care—on the 13th of February the prisoner Sams was in Cannon's room in the evening for two hours—the box was kept in the room Cannon slept in—I heard a noise of knocking, as if with a hammer, while they were in the room—Noble, a policeman, lodges in the same room with Cannon—he came home on the 14th—in consequence of what he told me I went up stairs into Cannon's room, and Noble lifted up the lid of the chest—a gimlet and hammer laid there, the hammer belonged to me, the gimlet to Sams—I keep the hammer generally in the skullery, at the back of the kitchen—I directed my daughter to mark some shirts, shawls, flan<lb></lb>nels, and a handkerchief, which were still in the box—shortly afterwards the prisoner Sams went up into that room—he stopped there about half-an-hour—when be came down I desired my daughter to go up stairs to see if anything was gone—these are part of the articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Sams.</hi> I took the hammer up to knock a pannel in the wainscoting of the room, which I was obliged to take out, to get Cannon from one bed into another, and the gimlet I had to put the nails into the piece of wood again.</p>

I am shopman to Daniel Reeve, a pawnbroker, in Red<lb></lb>cross-street On the 16th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner Cannon in the shop, in company with Sams, who stood behind him—Cannon pledged these three flannel shirts, in the name of John Gent, for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the counterpart of the duplicate I gave.</p>

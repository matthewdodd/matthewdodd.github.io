                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in High-street, Aldgate. On the 21st of December, at half-past ten o'clock, I met the female prisoner in High-street, Whitechapel, and went with her to No. 9, Essex-street—I went up stairs to the top room of the house, where the male prisoner was sitting by the fire—she told him to go out for a few minutes—at that time he had a jacket on—he went outside the door about two minutes, put on a smock, and came. in again, and immediately said, "What do you do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812310034"></xptr>
               <p>here?"—I was standing in the middle of the room, towards the fire-place, talking to the woman, and the woman was standing nearly close to me—I was doing nothing but talking—there was a bed in the room—I should think I was about a yard from the bed—it was a small room—we were not about to lie down on the bed, at the time—when he said "What do you do here?" I said, "You knew I was here when you were told to go out"—he ran up to me, knocked me down, and fell on the top of me—he then got up and kicked me—I said, "For God's sake, don't kick me any more, and I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "Give us hold of it then," and I gave him one—the woman was standing in the room—she never offered to touch me—just at that time, the people in the room below <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "What it the matter young man, do you want a light?"—I said, "Yes, I do if you please, for I have been ill-used, and robbed of three half-crowns"—I missed the half-crowns from my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, at the room<lb></lb>door, before I got down stain—I had seen them not ten minutes before, as I came out of Whitechapel—I had just changed half a sovereign at Couts's wine-vaults in Whitechapel—when I called out, somebody came up and brought a light—I went down and sat in a chair, in Walker's room, for five or six minutes—I told him the same story—he then lighted me down stairs, I went and fetched a policeman, and gave the man in charge—I went to the room for the purpose of going with the woman, but I had not laid down with her—she called the male prisoner by name, and asked him to go out for a few minutes—there was no other woman in the room—Walker's wife lighted me down stairs—I was kicked all round my body—he could not kick my head, as it was under the bedstead—I was quite sober—I had not been drinking, except a quartern of gin-and-peppermint, with two friends—I did not know the prisoners before—I missed my money just as I was coming out of the room-door, not before—it was then that I called out to she people below that I was robbed—the man had let go of me then, and I was coming away—I felt in my pocket, and missed my money.</p>

I have seen the prisoners once or twice going up and down stairs—they lodged in the house about two or three weeks, and pasted as man and wife. On the 21st of December, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was coming up stairs to my own room, and heard a noise—I stopped and heard somebody say, "Oh, dear, do not kick me any more, and I will give you a shilling, and behave like a man to you"—on hearing that I cried out "Holloa, mate, do you want a light?—he said, "Yes, if you please, and thank you too"—I pushed the door open, and told my wife to bring a light—she came on the landing and showed him a light down stairs—he came into my room and sat down, and said he was robbed of three half-crowns—I never saw him before.</p>

On the 21st of December, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, I was fetched by the prosecutor to No. 9, Essex-street—I found the two prisoners sitting by the side of the fire up stairs—he gave them in charge—I took the man to the station-house, which</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. What I stated was the fact. I saw two men pick the gentleman's pocket; I crossed the road, and took it up; the gentleman turned, and laid hold of me; I said, "It is your handkerchief, I am going to give it you;" he said, "I think you picked my pocket, and I will give you a night's lodging." I am a spring-maker, and work for Mr. Baxter, in Long-acre.</p>

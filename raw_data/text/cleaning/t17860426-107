            , the prisoner, and asked my way into Bishopsgate-street; she said she would shew me, if I would give her a shilling; I told her I would give her sixpence, and the other sixpence when she came to the place; she took me up to a house, under a pretence of getting a candle and lanthorn; I never was in London but twice before in my life.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - No; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of the house, so as to know it again? - Yes, particular notice of the door; when I got out, she took a bit of candle in her hand, under pretence to light it; and she asked me to stop; and she went just within the door, and then she told me I had better sleep with her; I told her I would do no such thing, and the sixpence was no object to me; so, if she did not chuse to go, and shew me the place, I should depart; she told me there was a door opposite to this door, and there was a bed there, and I might sleep with her; I told her I would not; then she took me by the collar, and I went to resist her; and at the door where the bed was, as she said, the prisoner Patrick came in at that door; he set his back against the street-door, to keep me from going out; she then demanded fifteen shillings of me to pay this man for coming into his house; I refused, and the prisoner Patrick said he would let me off for seven shillings and sixpence, and then he would let me out; and I refused to pay that; with that, she began to pull my hat off, and throw it down; then she turned my breeches pockets inside out; the man stood all this time close within the door, within six inches, or thereabouts; I might have six or seven shillings in my pocket, I cannot say, but I am sure there was four shillings and sixpence; I refused her taking it out, and she tore my breeches all to pieces, and my pocket out too; then, after the woman did that, she turned my waistcoat pockets out; then I had a great coat over this that I have on now, and they turned the pockets of the great coat out, and there were two handkerchiefs, one in each pocket; only one handkerchief was found; then the woman took a white cambrick handkerchief from my neck, and threw that down likewise where my hat lay; then the woman ordered me to stop, and I refused to stop; then, my Lord, she tied this cambrick handkerchief round my neck, in a noose, to throttle me, because I should not follow her out; then I began to halloo; then I heard the watch crying the hour; with that, the prisoner at the bar got from the door, and I caught my hat up, and got away.</p>
               <p>When you began to cry out, were they both standing by you? - Yes; this man just as he was at first.</p>
               <p>What did you cry? - I cried, murder? as loud as I could; then I heard the watch, and the prisoners got from the door, and let me get out; I made the best of my way, I came to the watch-house in this condition.</p>
               <p>While the woman was taking the things out of your pocket, did the man say any thing to you? - Only repeated that I should pay seven shillings and sixpence before I went out; he never laid a hand upon me.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been in that house before? - Never in that part before.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that man and woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you owe this man any money? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260155"></xptr> No; when I got out, I went to the watchman in that condition; he went with me, and shewed him the house; the watchman was coming along the street within a hundred yards of me; I was so frightened, I cannot say exactly; he asked me whether I knew the door; he saw I was sober; we went to the door and heard a woman and a man talking in the same house; and we went to the officer of the night, and tried to open the door, and the man from the inside said he would shoot through the door; the man and woman were not the people.</p>
               <p>When you came back to this house, was the back door open or shut? - Open, we heard them clatter out as soon as ever we went to break the door open.</p>
               <p>Where does that back door go to? - It went out into a brewers yard, where she wanted me to go and sleep; then we went back again, and I staid with the officer all night; then I was obliged to attend here on Le Gross's trial, and we went the next morning about nine, and we heard a talking again, and they were gone in an instant; the lad came and looked up, and before that we saw this prisoner peeping out of a house that was not furnished; we pursued and took him; that house where he was looking out of window looked into this yard; the street door of that house was bolted, and the window was pretty high, we were obliged to get in there; when we came to the top of the stairs to look for him, he was below and we took him; I am positive he was the man.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was this when you took him? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Did you find the woman? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Is that the woman? - Yes; I am positive that is the woman; it was pretty dark when I first met her.</p>
               <p>Where was the candle, when she was taking your things from you? - That I do not know; it was not light when they robbed me; I was robbed in the dark; there was a fire made of boards, and that flamed, you might see a pin; it was made of old paling, and bits of old tubs.</p>
               <p>Did she never light a candle? - Yes; and I am now sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Had there any familiarities passed between you and her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bunn. Did not you give me one of these handkerchiefs, and eighteen pence? - No; only sixpence to shew me the way.</p>

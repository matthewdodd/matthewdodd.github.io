            . I was coming up Holbourn from Smithfield, and a little on this side the watch-house I heard the cry of stop thief! and near a grocer's shop where was a light, the prisoner came running by me. I ran about 50 yards after him, when he stumbled and fell down. I was just behind him as he got up. I took hold of his arm, and the young man came up. Said I, what has he done to you? Said he, he has robbed me of my hat. The prisoner said he was almost starv'd. I saw a hat flung down, but I cannot swear to it. The hat was produced.</p>

            . As I was going up Holbourn on Christmas Eve, this young man cry'd out stop thief! stop thief! I saw the prisoner running as hard as he could. I ran after him; whether the hat came from his hand or under his arm I cannot say. I saw it drop from him. I ran by it about 20 yards. We took the prisoner. Then the young man came up, and said, this man has stole my hat. We took the prisoner to the high-constable, there he owned the taking it.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along Holbourn, I saw a man walking behind the young man, I was about 12 yards behind him. I saw that man take his hat off his head. I ran after him to take him, and ran a considerable time. I by chance fell down, and the man got away; and these gentlemen came and took hold of me and thought I was the man, so they swore against me. What they say of my owning it is false.</p>

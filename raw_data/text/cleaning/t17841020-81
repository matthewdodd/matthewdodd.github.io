             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Princes-street, Leicester-fields; I lost some goods, which I searched for and could not find, the goods were to the amount of six hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Can you yourself, Mr. Priestman give any account? - I went to one of the prisoner's lodgings in Oxford-street, about three days after I missed these things, and there I found a gold watch, chain, and seals, and a pearl locket, and various other things that are in this box; they were locked up in a large chest: a paragraph having appeared in the paper that I had been robbed, two people applied to me in the morning, and informed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ever acknowledge that lodging to be his? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>How did you acquire the knowledge of the lodging being his? - By the information of two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner in your shop? - Twice, I think.</p>
               <p>Who was he acquainted with there? - Nobody as I imagined; but I asked Hulett the apprentice, as I came into the shop one morning, three or four months before the robbery, and Stockdale was standing in the shop, and as soon as he saw me he moved off very quickly, I asked the boy who he was; one time I remember his coming in when I was in the shop, and on seing me he started and asked for something which I had not, and he turned round and went out of the shop, and I then asked the boy who he was: I sold the watch some years ago to a gentleman, and it was pledged with me about two years ago, I am sure it had been in my shop, and had not been parted with after it was pledged; I have not a doubt about the locket.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, he brought a ring to me about the middle of August, he said he came from his master; a young man called in the morning, who said he should send his servant in the afternoon; the prisoner did not say who his master was; his master called in the afternoon, he brought a diamond ring, and desired I would give the value for it; I gave thirty-five pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Look at it Sir? - It has been out of my hands, I cannot pretend to say this is the ring now, I did not make any mark upon it, I believe I gave it to Mr. Priestman.</p>
               <p>Court to Priestman. Has that ring been in your possession ever since? - No, it has not, I have delivered it to the owner, and received it back again.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any mark upon it? - No.</p>

               <p>Court to Shelley. Do you remember whether the prisoner brought you the ring, or called for payment of it afterwards? - He brought the ring, and said he brought it from his master; I did not pay him then, I paid him the next day when he called again.</p>
               <p>Barker. I have a memorandum of the name and number, the number is 107, and I remember this seal with the head of Voltaire upon it, I can swear to the seal.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the watch that Stockdale brought, was it delivered to Mr. Priestman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By who? - By me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Priestman. This is the watch that was delivered to me last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Court to Barker. What name did he pledge it in? - In the name of Simpson.</p>

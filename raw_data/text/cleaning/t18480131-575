                  </hi>. I am a commender in the Navy. On 11th Dec. I went from Blackwall to Gravesend by a steamer, at twelve o'clock in the day—I had two carper-bags, one contained a good deal of property, among other things a diamond ring—I missed one of the bags when I got to Gravesend—there being very few persons on board, and I naturally took a</p>

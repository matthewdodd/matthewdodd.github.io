In trying to open her hand, I saw a piece of paper like a duplicate, and some coin - she immediately put them into her mouth, and swallowed them. When she rose to come away, a small gold ring fell from her lap, which had been attached to my watch at the time I lost it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the evening of the 30th of April, I apprehended the prisoner at a cook-shop in Chandos-street; she would not come out of the box. A man who was with her escaped. I saw her put some paper into her mouth, and tried to get it out; but was obliged to let go, or she would have been choked. Something fell from her; she kept rubbing her feet on the floor, and found the ring under her feet. She spit a piece of paper out of her mouth, and said,</p>
               <p>"There, now you may do as you like."</p>

                  </hi>. I am not now in any habitation—I did live in White Horse-yard, Drury-lane—I am a porter in Covent Garden-market. In May last I went to lodge at the European Coffee-house, in Long Acre, which was kept by Beaumont—I left on Monday 21st Aug., as near as I can recollect—I had known Beaumont before, by using the House, and I had lodged there pre<lb></lb>viously—she spoke to me several times about firing the house—she said she would not mind giving 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one to do it—that was about a month or six weeks before I went away—she said, as she had known me so long, she would not mind giving me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to set fire to the house—I said I would con<lb></lb>sider of it, or something to that effect—I knew that the house and property were insured—Beaumont showed me the policy on three different occasions—isaw that the amount was for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I had told her that I would con<lb></lb>sider this proposition of hers, I saw things taken away from the house several time?, such as baskets of China and glass—I saw the bedding cut up and made into pillows—I saw Fitzgerald (who was servant in the house) take the pillows away; she told me it was by Beaumont's orders—I have seen her take them away when Beaumont was in the house—on the day that I left, Beaumont said the things were ready, and asked me what time it would be convenient to me to set fire to the house—she said the Thursday would be convenient for her, and would I go to tnke tea with her—this conversation took place in the little bar—I do not know that there was anybody there but Beaumont and I; Fitzgerald might have been in and out, following her occu<lb></lb>pation—I said the Thursday would suit me, or words to that effect—I led her to believe that I would do it—I went again on the Tuesday—I do not recollect that anything passed respecting this matter—she sent for me on the Thursday, and I went about five o'clock—Kitzgerald went in with me-Beau<lb></lb>mont was not there, but a young woman was, who was a stranger-Beaumont wme in, and 1 had tea with her—she said all was ready, and we might as well go through with it, as things bad gone so far—she said she had appointed to go to the theatre with Fry, at half-price, and that I was to set</p>

               <p>she put a light, or a lighted greasy paper, under the place where the old newspapers were kept, and it was all on fire in a moment—this was on the Saturday—on the Monday I was in Covent-garden market-Fitzgerald came to me there—she told me that Beaumont wished to speak to me, and would I go to No. 13, King-street, Long-acre, that is where her brother lived—I went there after Fitzgerald had left me—I saw Beaumont's brother—I waited a few minutes, and Beaumont came in—it is a little shop—her brother was in the private parlour-Beaumont said I need not be afraid, she would give me the remaining 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as though I had set fire to the house myself—I think she said I was not to mention it to anybody, I was to keep it a secret—I said, "Very well"—I then came away—on the Wednesday afterwards I saw Fitzgerald again in Covent-garden market, or somewhere adjoining; I think it was in James-street—I gave her a note to take to Beaumont—she came back after she had taken it, and told me that Miss Beaumont said I might do what I liked; if I said anything concerning the fire, that she would charge me with stealing some books that I had the care of—there were three books, a writing-desk, a bird-cage, and some other trifling things, that she had given me—I told Fitzgerald I would go and give information to the Fire-office—she said I might go as soon as I liked—I do not recollect that anything more passed on that occasion—I think I saw Fitzgerald again on the Friday—I told her I had communicated to the Insurance Company (which I had not; I did not make the communication till the next day, the Saturday)—she said I had done very wrong in stating that she had set fire to the house, it was a mistake—she said I had misunderstood her when she told me that Fry had proposed to bring 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of combustibles to put under the cup<lb></lb>board—that might have been on the Wednesday; it was after the fire—I informed the Insurance-office on the following day, and on Monday, the 4th, I attended at Mr. Storr, the agent's office—I found Miss Beaumont there, and her sister, Mrs. Matthews—I waited till Mr. Storr sent for me in-1 was in the same room with Miss Beaumont and her sister, the public auction-room-Miss Beaumont came to me, and asked if I had been sent for there—I said, "No," I was come there to meet a friend—she asked me to go out<lb></lb>side with her, which I refused to do-Mrs. Matthews came, and said there was something very mysterious between her sister and me, and she wanted to know the meaning of it-Miss Beaumont told her there were some trifling sums of money that she owed me; if I would make out my bill she would pay me—I told Matthews it was no use asking me such a question as that, that she knew all about it—Miss Beaumont said if I would go outside with her, or meet her at her brother's at three o'clock, she would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused that, and soon after, Mr. Storr called for me, and 1 went out of the room, and left them to themselves—I knew there was a ladder at the house that was burnt; I had seen it several times—it was kept down stairs in the passage, and sometimes I have seen it at the top of the house—Miss Beaumont desired me to take it from the passage up to the top of the house—there is a trap-door opening at the top of the house—I put the fodder on the top land<lb></lb>ing; that would enable a person to get out at that opening.</p>

               <p>Long Acre—I took down what she said on this paper—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"I heard Miss Beaumont say to Baxter that she would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he would set fire to the house; this was three months ago. She said she was highly in<lb></lb>debted, and she owed three quarters rent to her landlord, and he would not grant her a lease, and therefore she would injure his house. Accordingly she kept sending me out with her clothes to pledge; this was about last Saturday fortnight, but others were taken about three weeks before that. She told me it was to pay her landlord, and instead of that, when she received the money altogether, and the trinkets, she told me that she would take the money and trinkets to Mrs. Robinson, of Oxford-street, shoemaker. On last Thursday week a young man called upon Miss Beaumont, and took her out, as they said, to the Hay market theatre—on that day, before they went, she agreed with Baxter to set fire to the house, but he never said he would or he would not do it—she laid down 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the dresser, and said to him, (Baxter), 'I won't give it into your hands, in case that I should be put to my oath that I gave you any money'—Baxter took the money up—I was standing at the sink washing cups and saucers up—after that, Miss Beaumont and her young man went away, leaving myself and Baxter in the house—when Miss Beau<lb></lb>mont was gone, he turned round to me, and said if he could get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to do it, he would not do such a thing, and he would go off into the country before she could pull him up for the money—he then went away—in the course of the day I heard Miss Beaumont and the young man in conversation about setting fire to the house—the young man said to her, 'Get three shillings-worth of powder, and put it into some greasy paper, and place it near the fire, and it will blow the roof up'—Miss Beaumont returned half an hour after Baxter had gone—the young man came the next morning to breakfast—Beaumont told him how Baxter had served her out about the money—he was there all day talking to Miss Beaumont about the fire, settling how it should be done—she promised him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also that when she got her money, she would go to Australia with him, and if I would like to go with her she would take me as her servant, or if not, she would give me some money—I told her I did not want her money, and that 1 was never bribed to do such a thing-Miss Beaumont sent me out for a threepenny stamp, upon which they wrote something which they told me was by the God above, this secret was not to be revealed by either of us—she signed this paper after he had done so, and then made me put a cross to my name to it—after doing this I got frightened and ran away, and went to my cousin—Miss Beaumont came after me there, but she did not see me, as I had hid myself—this was in the afternoon, from one to four o'clock—I returned to Long Acre about half-past four—Miss Beaumont went out and bought me a pair of bouts, and brought them to me, and told me she was going to Cre<lb></lb>morne Gardens that night with the young man, she would not return before one o'clock—she said that I had better go to bed after the shop was shut, and when she came home she would ring double—when I was at tea, Mrs. Robinson came in—she (Miss Beaumont) and the young man went up-stairs, and remained there more than an hour and a half-before Mrs. Robinson went, she took three or four large books out of the bar, on the shelf on the right hand side as you go into the bar from the coffee-room, over a little box—Mrs. Robinson said they were nice books, and it was a pity that they should be destroyed, and I said, 'Do you know that my mistress is going to do such a thing? and she answered me and said she never was astonished so much as when she returned to her own home, after she had been out during the day, to find a large parcel or Miss Beaumon's containing duplicates and money and</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as clerk to the Magistrate, at Bow-street, when the examination of the witnesses in this case took place—after the examina<lb></lb>tion, Fitzgerald was asked if she desired to say anything—it was explained to her that if she did it would be given in evidence against her—I took down what she said from her lips—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"From the time I entered Miss Beaumont's service, Miss Beaumont kept me a prisoner. She told me that she was highly indebted, and that she was talking to Baxter about setting the house on fire. She would not let me speak to Mrs. Moore at all. I gave her warning to leave; she would not take my warning; she knew that I was very easily led, and she began to flatter and coax me to stay with her. She told me she was going to Australia with Baxter and her brother; that she would get a farm and land there with her insuring-money, and that if I wished it I should go with her. I refused to go. She used to go down and speak privately with Baxter; they talked very seriously together for about three weeks. Miss Beanmont has asked me to open the feather-beds, and two of them I opened for her, and filled bolsters and pillows with the feathers, and I pawned them two or three at a time by her direction. I pawned some of them at first in the name of Smith, and the others she told me to pawn in my own name, bat that I was to give a wrong address. I pawned a great many dresses, china, and other things, for Miss Beaumont. I took out a great many boxes and bundles for her. I showed Baxter the money and the duplicates for most of the things I pledged. She sent me up stairs to coax Baxter to set the house on fire, and to tell him that if he would go to Australia with her she would marry him when she got there. About two days before the fire I brought down two bedsteads by Miss Beaumont's direction, and I assisted her in chopping it up. She said she wanted to set fire to four places to destroy the whole house. On the Thursday before the fire happened, Miss Beaumont spoke seriously to him about it, and it was agreed that the house should be set on fire that night. He went away, and when he was gone Miss Beaumont sent me for a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp. She told me to go for Baxter, and she said she wished me to be a witness that she gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to set the house on fire that night. I went for Baxter, and I showed him. the stamp, and told him that he was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he was to sign his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230128"></xptr>
               <p>name to that. He said he would not du it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When I canie back, the prisoner Fry was in the coffee-room, and when Miss Beaumont came in she said she was going to the Haymarket Theatre with Fry, and that Baxter was going to set fire to the house then. When Baxter told me he would not have anything to do with it, I made myself perfectly agreeable to him. When Fry came into the bar she blew out the candle, and lowered the gas. She then went out to the Haumarket, with Fry, and then Baxter told me he would not do it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would go off into the country, and he did go. She returned home about half an hour after going away. Her brother was in the coffee-room. She told me that Fry had left her, and that she felt miserable; and that thinking the house was on tire she came out to see how the place was getting on. She staid looking out for Baxter till half-past twelve o'clock, and then told me he had acted very wise not to do it that night, because it was the Opera night. She then said she would do it herself if she could not get any one else to do it. The next morning she sent me to look for Baxter. I found Baxter's late master, Mr. Davis, and he came up, and saw Miss Beaumont, and told her that he (Baxter) had gone into the country with a young man "hopping." Miss Beaumont then told me that she would try and get the prisoner Fry to do it. He (Fry) came, and had break-fast that morning, and she told him how Baxter had served her, and then said she would give him (Fry) 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if we would do it, and we both refused. She then persuaded Fry to put his name to the stamp, and she put her own name to it, and she made rue put my mark to keep the secret. She read it over. The words in that paper are the same I gave Mr. Storr. She wished Fry to sleep in the house. He refused. I heard Fry say to Miss Beaumont, 'If you get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of gunpowder, and put it in a paper, that will blow the house up.' She said, 'Would not turpentine do better?' In the evening she told me she was going to Cremorne-gardens with Fry. In the evening Mrs. Robinson came, and she went up into the front room with Miss Beaumont and Fry; and after that Mrs. Robinson came down stairs, and took three books, and she said it was a pity they should be destroyed; and she said to me, 'Be sure to do it, and do it so that it will not be known that it was done with hands.' I told her not to be puzzling me. She said I was to be very careful how I did it. I did not answer her either way. She said she was frightened, Miss Beaumont had told it to too many, and that it would be found out. The night of the fire Miss Beaumont and Fry went to Cremorne-gardens. That night after they were gone, Baxter came to the private door, and he asked me what Miss Beaumont had said about his not setting fire to the house. I told him she said he had done very right, as it was the Opera night. He said he would not do it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said if he did not do it somebody else would, and that perhaps I would; and I told him it was to take place either that night, or the night after. He said be never intended to do it, and he went away. I fastened up the doors. I washed a coarse apron, and then hung it up before the fire in the bar, on the back of a chair, near enough to catch fire. There were files of bills hanging round by the fire. I went up stairs to bed, and was in bed about an hour, I suppose, when the ringing and the knocking came, and I was almost smothered with the smoke. I got up, and went up the steps that Baxter had taken up stairs, and I got out through the sky-light on to the roof, and then began to cry. I was taken down, and I was afterwards taken to Beaumont's, in King-street, and there Beaumont and Fry came to me, and asked me how it took place, and I said I did not know; and Fry asked me how it took place, I said I did not know. Miss Beaumont gave me three books and a writing-desk,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230129"></xptr>
               <p>and told me that if Baxter said anything I was to join her, and swear that he had stolen them. I went away from her, and saw nothing of her till the next day. She told me to say that the dresses I had pledged for her, and the china I had pledged for her, were burnt in the fire; and she also told me to say that the pictures she had given to me to take care of were burnt in the fire. She said as soon as she got the insuring-money she would go into the country, and take me wirh her. She told me to say at the Fire-office that there were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and some gold and silver in the little box that she gave me, which there were not; for there were no 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes; there was no money at all, except a few halfpence that I had put in. She told me to say that the satin dresses were also burnt. After I came from the Fire-office we went to 53, Long Acre, and Mrs. Matthews was with us; and Beaumont said that I should come over the water with her, and Mrs. Matthews said, 'Would it not be better to have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than to be raking about.' On the Monday following I went with Beaumont to the Fire-office, and from there to her brother's, and then she told me that if I saw Baxter I was to snap my fingers at him, and that if he said anything she would charge him with stealing bird-cages, books, a desk, and carpenters' tools, and that I was to do the same; and I did not see her again until I was in custody. I met Baxter, and he told me that he would give information, and that I had better come forward and speak the truth, whatever I might suffer; for he was sure to give information. I have nothing further to say; my mistress has led me astray.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MARY JANE FITZGERALD</hi>, + her mark.—Taken before me this 13th Sept., 1848.</p>

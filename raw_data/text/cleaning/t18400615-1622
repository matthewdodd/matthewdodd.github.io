                  </hi>I live with the prosecutor. On the 25th of May, I saw the prisoner, between four and five o'clock, in my master's wash-house, standing against the copper—he was a stranger—I thought he had come to some of the people who lived up stairs—he said, "Halloo, " to me, and I to him—then he went out—I did not see him again till a person came in the evening, and told us he had gone with the copper—I went out, and saw the prisoner going into a marine-store shop, in Bell-street—I went and told the policeman.</p>

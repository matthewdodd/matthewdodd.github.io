            . I am a watchman of St. Giles's. The prisoner came to me about eleven o'clock, and said, "Here is a tobacco box" - she laid it on my arm, and went away; I opened it, and saw the ticket - I called out. "Halloo! here is a ticket in it;" she said, "So there is." The prosecutor came up soon afterwards, and said he had lost his box; I stated what I had seen, and said I believed I could find the woman, but my brother watchman took her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and am in the service of Mr. Dallimore, of Great Titchfield-street, Oxford-street. On Monday, the 16th of February, I was passing the prosecutrix's shop, and saw the prisoner with two other boys—the prisoner was looking round the corner of the shop—I saw him crawl in on his hands and knees, and then he came out with a bundle of clothes on his shoulder—he was crawling till he came to the door—he then took them off his shoulder, and put them into his apron—I followed them till I met a policeman, whom I told he had stolen some clothes—the prisoner and his companions ran away, but the policeman caught him—I saw him throw away one jacket and one pair of trowsers, which I took to Mrs. Smith's.</p>

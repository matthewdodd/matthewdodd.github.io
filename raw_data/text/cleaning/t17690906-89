            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. On the 14th of July, I saw the prisoner coming out of the parlour into the kitchen with the spoon in his hand. I ran round, and saw him come to the gate. I asked him what he was doing there: then he took to his heels and ran; and I ran after him, and never lost sight of him till I took him. I asked him where the spoon was, he said he had nothing. I brought him back. He dropped the milk-pot and spoon in Rosemary-branch-alley, and they were brought in by two gentlemen.</p>

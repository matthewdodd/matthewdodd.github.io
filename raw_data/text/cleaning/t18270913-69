On the 4th of August, I left my shop about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, and within a minute I heard a scuffle; I returned instantly, and saw the officer with the prisoner, behind my counter. I had looked into the till just before I went out; there were three sixpences in the front part of it, and two shillings in the back; I said I had lost four sixpences, I believed, but I was in an error; I had had five sixpences in the till, but had sent my servant out with two, and therefore there were but three.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner about ten o'clock on the 4th of August, in Peter's-lane, watching a butcher's shop window; there was another lad with him; they went up St. John's-lane, and the other stood outside while the prisoner went into this shop, and round the counter - he took out the till, and put something into his pocket, but I could not see what; I ran in, and took three sixpences out of his waistcoat pocket, into which I had seen him put something. Mr. Clarke had gone out of the shop just as the prisoner went in.</p>

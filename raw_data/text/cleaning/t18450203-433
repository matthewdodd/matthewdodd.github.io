                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Titchbourn-court, Holborn. I know the prisoner—he called on me in Dec, 1842, thrice for work—I told him, the third time he came, that if he would call on the following Monday I would give him work—he came on the Monday afternoon, the 5th of Dec, between two and three o'clock—he had no tools with him—I told him I could not give him any work unless he brought his tools—he went away, to go to his lodging, in Old-street—he returned in about an hour and a half or two hours, and said his landlady was out, but be would go home to his father, at Poplar, and borrow some tools—he came back, and said his father told him to ask me to give him a night's lodging, at his landlady was out—I did so—he slept in the third floor front room by him<lb></lb>self—about half-past six o'clock next morning my apprentice came up to me—I directly went with him to my workshop at the bottom of the house—I found the tools all confused, and the greatest part of the tools on the bench were gone—I missed two trying-planes, three saws, chisels, and screw-drivers; also, my apprentice's new flannel jacket, two baskets, and a news moo thing-plane—we also missed two pillows off the bed in which the prisoner slept—he was also gone—we have never found any of the things—I never saw the prisoner again till I saw him at the Thames Police-office in December last—I was taken there, and identified him—I am sure he is the man I let into my room—my house is in the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields.</p>

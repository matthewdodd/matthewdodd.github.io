            . I am patrol of St. Giles's. About a quarter before three o'clock in the morning, on the 27th of February-it was not daylight - I met the prisoners going down Tottenham-court-road, with four pigs; I followed them to George-street, St. Giles's, into the Maidenhead, public-house yard. They put the pigs into the stable. I asked them if they were their own - They said they had brought them from Barnet for a man who was intoxicated, and that he told them to drive them into their stable. I thought they could not have come so far, as they appeared fresh. I secured the prisoners, and took the pigs to the Green-yard - I found they were the prosecutor's.</p>

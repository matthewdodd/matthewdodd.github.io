                  </hi>. I am the son of Edward Garner, of No. 29, Harts-lane, Bethnal-green; he is a weaver, and I work for him. On the night of the 26th of Nov. I retired to rest about eleven o'clock—I left the wdrkshop all secure—there are five looms there; three of them had been at work du<lb></lb>ring the day—about half-past five next morning I was awoke by the wind blowing in at the window, which was open—I got a light, and found the work</p>

               <p>cut out of two of the looms—I also missed a suit of clothes, a pocket-hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and three trevats, which are tools we use in weaving—about thirteen yards of silk velvet was cut from each loom—I went to the station, and gave information—the window which was open looks into the back yard—there were footmarks in the yard—the work from one loom was cut by a person who understood the business, but the other was not—I know the prisoner by his living opposite—he is a weaver.</p>

About half-past five o'clock on Thursday morning, the 27th of Nov., he called me up—I missed two pieces of black velvet, a waist-coat, handkerchief, and three trevats from the workshop—the prisoner was brought to my house that morning by Mr. Macklin, a neighbour—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Tom</hi>, what did you do this for?"—he then said, "Here is 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they will take it away from me when I get to the station"—I live in the house—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green.</p>

On the night before the robbery, about a quarter to nine o'clock, he came to my house with another man—the other one asked me about some rolls which I had—the prisoner did not say anything in particular—when I heard of the robbery I went in search of the prisoner—I found him in a house in Vine-court, Spitalfields—I asked him whether he had been in Hart's-lane last night after he left our house—he said he had not—I asked who he had with him last night—he said, "No one; what is that to do with you?"—I said, "Was you at Mr. Gar<lb></lb>ner's last night?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you in bed last night?"—he said, "I was"—I said, "You must come with me; I see you will not tell me anything"—directly I lifted up his cloth waistcoat I saw he had a waistcoat on under it which I had seen Garner wear—I took him to Mr. Garner's, and when we got there I said, "Let me see if you have got Gar<lb></lb>ner's handkerchief in your hat"—I took off his hat, and the handkerchief was in it—Mr. Garner came in then—the waistcoat and handkerchief were given to the police at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Hitchcock, of St. Paul's-churchyard. On 7th June the prisoner came there, and bought trifling things, to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was something in her manner which led me to suspect her—I saw her walking from some silks as I was returning</p>

               <p>from another part of the shop—I informed the shop-walker—T walked behind her as she was leaving the shop, and saw her drop two pieces of silk from under her cloak—the shop-walker stopped her, and said she had dropped some silks—she said she had not dropped them, hut a friend of hers had—she picked them up and threw them on a lady's lap, who was sitting about a yard beyond her, nearer the door, and said that lady had them on her lap—that lady is not here—I am sure the prisoner dropped them.</p>

                  </hi>. White gave me information, and I watched the prisoner—after she received her change she was going towards the door—I was near the door—she walked seven or eight yards—I saw her hands move, and a sudden lift of the elbows—something moved under her cloak, and the silk fell from her cloak—I charged her-with it—she said, "The silks did not fall from my cloak; another woman let them fall"—I said, "You must not proceed further"—she picked up the silk, and threw it on a lady's lap, who was sitting about a yard nearer the door—there was no one between the lady and the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. She denied all along that she had anything to do with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was asked if she had anything else on her person, she raised her dress, but nothing was observed—she was not searched.</p>

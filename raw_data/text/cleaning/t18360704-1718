The prisoner was my servant-boy for two months—he was never allowed to serve in the shop but when there was a second person there—I was informed he had taken a shilling—I came and asked whether he had not got a shilling of mine from the till—he said nothing—I told him I was determined to prosecute—he made a sort of cry—I gave him to a police<lb></lb>man—he was taken to the station-house, and in one of his stockings were found twenty-three shillings in a piece of paper—I may have lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lately—he said he picked the money up—when the night-constable asked him whether he took the shilling from my till—he said he had, and it was mine—he had not a shilling when he came to me.</p>

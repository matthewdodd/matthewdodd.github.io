                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my father who is a stone<lb></lb>mason at Uxbridge. About nine o'clock on the evening of Sunday, the 15th of July, I was coming from West Drayton, where I had spent the af<lb></lb>ternoon at my sister's—this happened between Useley and Drayton—I was coming along the foot-path—the prisoner, who was quite a strange; came out of a hedge, caught hold of me by the shawl, and asked me for my money—I told him I had not any—I was alarmed—he began swear<lb></lb>ing at me, and said he would have my money, and if I did not give him a shilling, be would <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> me out—I then gave him a shilling, and imme<lb></lb>diately after that he hit me twice in his face with the fist, and made my nose and mouth bleed—he said he knew where I came from, and he would he with me again in a short time—he then ran away across the fields—he had a blue smock-frock, and a cap on his head—I kept on, and went to the first public-house I came to—I told them, and they took me back to my sister's, to West Drayton-in about half an hour after I went back I understood he was taken—I saw him the next morning—he had the same dress on then, and I knew him—I am quite sure he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Useley. About nine o'clock I had just come from the station-house at the rail-road—I went to Useley to a pub<lb></lb>lic-house kept by my mother—the prosecutrix was telling my sister she had been robbed, and described the man as having a very loose ragged smock-frock, knee-breeches, white stockings, and an old pair of shoes—(I</p>

               <p>took her to her sister's)—I had seen the prisoner on the Saturday night be<lb></lb>fore, dressed as she described-in half an hour after the girl had gone, he came to the public-house—I was talking about the circumstance, and said if I could have caught the man, I would have broken his neck—the prisoner immediately said, "Has there been a young woman robbed here to-day?"—I said, "Yes, there has within the last hour"—he drank his beer and walked off—I immediately followed him with a young man—I saw him go to Bagley's farm where he was to sleep for the night—I went to Drayton, found the girl in fits, and all over blood—we carried her to the bottom of Money-lane, stopped with her two hours, and returned to Bagley's farm and took the prisoner—he wanted to pull off his smock<lb></lb>frock, but we would not let him—we took him to Uxbridge—the next morning the prosecutrix saw him, and said, "He is the man"-when I first saw him that evening his legs, and shoes, and stockings were wet, as if he had been through the wheat—it was a very wet evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What stockings had he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They ought to have been white, if clean—they were dark because they were dirty—I and my sitter were talking about this when the prisoner was there—I am sure he said, "Has any young woman been robbed, and stopped here to-day?"—I have never said he used any other words—I was examined before the Magistrate—he said, "stopped," "interrupted," or something—it was a quarter to nine o'clock when I first saw him—she was robbed about two hundred yards from our beer-shop—I afterwards found him sleeping in Bag<lb></lb>ley's farm.</p>

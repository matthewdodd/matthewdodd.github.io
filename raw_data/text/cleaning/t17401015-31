               <p>Lewis Hayes . On the 6th of September, about 10 o'clock at Night, I was coming along <placeName id="t17401015-31-crimeloc157">Cornhill</placeName>

He ran away, and called John! John! all the Way he went; I pursued him, and Mr Crouch hearing him calling John , likewise followed him; but the Prisoner falling, Mr Pantrey came out, and took him. I never lost fight of him all the Time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether there was a Lamp at the corner where he took hold of me?</p>
               <p>Mr Hayes . There was a Lamp by which I could see him.</p>

             . On Saturday Night, about 10 o'clock, I was coming by the East-End of the Mansion-House, and heard a Fellow come after me, calling John as he ran; the Way is there so narrow, that I must either stand up, or he push me down: I did not like the Looks of the Fellow, so I clapp'd my cane against the Boards, he fell down, and Mr Pantrey seized him. The Gentleman came up, and said he had lost his Handkerchief; we searched him, and found several upon him, but not Mr Hayes's .</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He says he catched hold of me, seeing the Handkerchief thrown away; it is a very strange Thing if it had been on the Ground that the Lamp should not shew it. <rs id="t17401015-31-verdict158" type="verdictDescription">

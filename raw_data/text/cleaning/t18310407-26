On the 26th of February, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was going down to Botolph wharf, with thirty baskets of Malaga raisins, in fifteen packages, in my waggon - I stood in <placeName id="t18310407-26-crimeloc163">Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. It is false. Witness. I am certain I saw him take them from the waggon, and put them on his back.</p>
               <p>JOHN WRIGHT. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. I delivered to the waggoner, in Garlick-hill, a little after seven o'clock, thirty baskets of Malaga raisins, made into fifteen packages - I afterwards saw the package before the Magistrate, and know it to be part of the contents of the waggon, as I had marked them T. M., Colchester.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DANDO. I am a constable. I received the prisoner in custody - he said nothing to the charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Saturday five weeks a young man came to my mother's, and said a young man was wanted at the Elephant and Castle - I went there: they were engaged, and as I returned, in Thames-street, by the waggon, I saw two baskets on the ground, and the prosecutor standing over the way, watching them - I thought he was going to steal them; I tried to lift them, but they were so very heavy, and he instantly came and took me.</p>

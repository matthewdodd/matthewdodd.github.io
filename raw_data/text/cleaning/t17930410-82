               <p>I let ready furnished rooms; the prisoner came to me on Monday the 31st of December last; the man asked me for a ready furnished room; I told him I had got one; he asked if he might see it? I told him I was very particular who I took in; I asked him what he was and where he came from? he said, I might have his character and he should not want the room till the day following, he agreed with me for the room at half a crown per week; he came on Monday night instead of the Tuesday and asked me for the key of the room for he had brought his wife out of the country and he had no lodging for his wife; I let him have the key; after I had let him have the key he brought in several articles, as wood, &amp;c. when his wife came I objected taking her in; if that is your wife, say I to him, I believe her to be a bad woman; says he, she is my wife, I was married three months ago at Cripplegate Church; I did not like to take her in, says he, I have taken the room and possession is nine points of the law, you may enquire my character to-morrow; he paid me exceedingly well till the 27th of February; on the 27th of February I suspected the prisoner having taken something out of the room; I went into the room and found a sheet, blanket and bolster missing, that was in his care; I examined the bed, and found a great quantity of feathers out of it; the bolster that was left had been a very full bolster and almost all the feathers were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the feathers? - They were entirely taken away; the prisoner I had got into custody, at the same time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100099"></xptr>I found his wife had left him; I asked him for the things; he said, I should have all the things presently; he gave me a duplicate of the sheet, and gave me a direction to his wife where she was; I went and fetched her to my wife; then afterwards we took her to the pawnbroker's where the things were, I found feathers, and have got them here.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he brought in some articles, what were they? A little table I believe and some wood.</p>

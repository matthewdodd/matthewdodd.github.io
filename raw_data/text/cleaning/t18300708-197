               <p>ANGELIOUS BETRAUN. On the 14th of June, I was on duty in <placeName id="t18300708-197-crimeloc1117">Oxford-street</placeName>

               <p>Griggs. Q.Can you swear you saw me? A. Yes, you were there for twenty minutes - you were five or six yards off when I took you.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNERLY. I met Betraum - he told me Jones had something in his apron; he was turning into Wardour-street - I went and asked him what he had in his apron; he refused to tell me - I was taking these stockings from him when Betraun came and took him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLANT. The shop is mine, and these stockings are mine; here is my ticket on them - here are twelve pairs of them; I missed them when my attention was drawn to them.</p>
               <p>Jones. Q.Was it not possible for any one to knock them down? A. No, they were tied.</p>
               <p>Griggs' Defence. I met this young man, whom I knew, we walked two hundred yards, and then had a pint of beer - we shook hands, and I had not left him three minutes.</p>
               <p>Jone's Defence. I walked a few yards with him; it rained fast - I stood under a door-way two or three minutes; I then saw these lay, and took them up.</p>
               <p>Jones received a good character.</p>

On Sunday, the 1st of July, about twelve o'clock in the day. I saw the prisoner in Anderson's yard, with a bundle - I kept looking at him, not knowing whether he had stolen it; but a man came out. crying Stop thief! I immediately ran out towards the fence of the Grand Junction premises and the prisoner came running round the corner and dropped this bundle - I am sure he is the man; I secured him - the bundle was claimed by Gingell.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Gingell - we live in Anderson's house. I am his servant. On Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I dressed myself and went to a place of worship. I left every thing safe - I came home after twelve o'clock, and found the prisoner in custody with the bundle, containing this property, which I had left in different drawers in two rooms, on the ground floor; the window was about three inches open when I went out - a person in the yard could open it; I had left the servant girl at home - the property is worth 7l.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . Gingell left me at home. I was in the kitchen - I heard no alarm at all; I went to the bed-room door and could not open it. I then went to the engine house, to ask Mr. Gingell if he had locked it - he came down with me; we then found the door open and the property gone - the drawers were open. I went out and saw a man in the yard, he ran away; and the prisoner was brought back - he was tying up the bundle on the pipes in the yard when I saw him - I will not swear to his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking in the fields and was suddenly taken ill - I went into an empty house by this place, for a necessary purpose, and in about five minutes this man came in, and said "Here he is, come out," and charged me with the robbery.</p>

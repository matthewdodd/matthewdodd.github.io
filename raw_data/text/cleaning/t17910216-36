               <p>Had you frequent opportunities of observing him during the short week he lived with you, so as to know him again? - Every day he came into my own apartment; I have no doubt of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was there any key belonging to your house, that you know of, that would open that door in which the black man lodged? - Not to my knowledge; I did not know before my son told me that there was any key in the house; the prisoner said she was a <rs id="t17910216-36-deflabel226" type="occupation">lady's maid</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. She said if I would give her a guinea, she would not prosecute me? - Never, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Smith. At the time I was taken they were offered some money not to touch me till I was flogged, so the Duke of York gave them some money that I might be punished first, and then they were to take me; I was first punished, and then turned over to them; they got five guineas as far as I understand, for not taking me.</p>

               <p>Court. Then I understand you, your question was a general one, and not particularly applied to Mrs. Bibb? - Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Please to ask him if he did not clap his hand upon my shoulder, while I stood in the Orderly-room, and would not take me prisoner? - Yes, because there was a serjeant, a corporal, and two more men about him, and it was the Duke's desire.</p>

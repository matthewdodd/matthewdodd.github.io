I went up and there stood the prisoner; I had not missed him from below before; I asked him what he was doing there? he said, nothing at all; I called to my man, he came up, and we search'd the prisoner; we found the shifts in his bosom with the sleeves, and the spoons in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Fitzhenry. He said nothing, but beg'd for mercy and said the devil tempted him to do it. I took him to the round-house, and the next day to Justice Fielding, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>Fitzhenry. He made no defence, but own'd he took the things.</p>

I went and found it was; I told my master, and he bid me stand by the prisoner to see that he did not drop any thing; while we were searching him, the shifts and sleeves fell from him, and I found the spoons in his left coat pocket; he made no defence, but lay down with his hands and knees to the boards and said nothing.</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor and know nothing how I came up stairs, or how the things came to be about me; I had been ill a long time, and a little eating and drinking overcame me.</p>

On Monday evening, the 5th of March, I went out about half-past eight o'clock, to get a pint of beer from the public-house at the corner of Plumbtree-street - I asked the young man for the newspaper, and while he was looking for it I saw the prisoner by my side, looking stedfastly at me - I was surprised at it; I came out of the public-house, and when I got half way home she came up to me, and tore my frill off my neck, which had a gold brooch in it- I called the watchman - he had just got out of his box, and stopped her - I had not lost sight of her; the brooch was found in the passage of the watch-house.</p>

            . I am the wife of the watch-housekeeper - the prisoner was brought there; and about half-past nine o'clock another person was brought in, very tipsy; another person came in with a pane of glass in his hand; the beadle turned him out, and the glass was broken - I asked him to lend me the lantern to pick up the glass, and I found this brooch in the passage.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not in the public-house. I was going up the street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! the watchman was opening his box, and asked me what was the matter; I said I did not know, and then this woman came up, and said I had robbed her; she made a noise at me, and I said, "Don't make a noise - give charge of me;" there was another girl there, and she said it was either her or me, and then she said she would prosecute me.</p>
               <p>M. A. HEBERT. There was another girl who went into the watch-house with her; I did not say it was either her or the prisoner; I can swear positively to the prisoner; I had not lost sight of her. When we were at the watch-house I said, as my brooch was a family one, "If you will give it me you may go about your business." I said there had been other women in the public-house, but it was the prisoner who looked so hard at me.</p>

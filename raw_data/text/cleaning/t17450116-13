            . The night twelfth night was kept on, as I was going along about seven o'clock, I felt something rustle in my pocket, I put my hand into my pocket to feel for my handkerchief, and it was gone. I collared the Prisoner, and said, where is my handkerchief? he said, there it is, and threw it out of his hand. There were several people came up, and threatened to take him away from me, but some butchers coming they ran away. I took him to a publick house, searched him, and found seven handkerchiefs in his pocket; he had a very good one about his neck that night, the next morning it was gone. I asked him what he had done with his handkerchief? he said, he had sold it for bread in the prison. I asked, whether he had any money; he said, no; I gave him a shilling, he gave me a sort of a gruff for it, he did not thank me. The handkerchief cost me 4 s. 6 d. but I laid it at 10 d. on account of his youth. <rs id="t17450116-13-verdict67" type="verdictDescription">

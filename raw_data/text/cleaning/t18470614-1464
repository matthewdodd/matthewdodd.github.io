                  </hi>. I live in Shovel-alley, Princess-square. On the morning of the 28th of May, I was in a coffee-shop, in Ratcliff-highway—I said I had been in that coffee-shop two years before, when I was badly off, and was very kindly treated, and if there was any poor fellow there who was as badly off as I was, I would treat him—the prisoner was there—I gave him two half-pints of coffee—I laid out to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one and another—I had three sovereigns and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a bag in my fob—I was going to stand treat, and took out my bag—instead of getting hold of the mouth of it, I got hold of the bottom—the money fell on the ground—I said, "I am only a poor man, don't rob me, I have used you well"—there were four or five persons down scrambling—the prisoner was one—I distinctly saw him take up a sovereign—he put his hand within six inches of mine, with the sovereign in it, and while I was getting the rest, he went—he did not give me the sovereign—he put it near me, and then drew it back—the other gave me the money they picked up</p>

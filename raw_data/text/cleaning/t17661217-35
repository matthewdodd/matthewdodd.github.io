On the 25th of March, in the evening, we suppose we lost the things mentioned in the indictment, by a pane of glass being broke; we did not know of it till the 26th in the morning; one of the shutters was open; I was called up immediately, to look to see whether I had missed any thing. I had brushed the shirt-buckles and things in a drawer that stood just by the broken pane, but the morning before: I missed out of that drawer, to the best of my knowledge, either fourteen or fifteen shirt-buckles; I am clear to six gold ones, and about nine silver ones, and two silver stock-buckles; we found a piece of the broken glass close by the drawer; that drawer was always uncovered; Mr. Dealtry made a hook of wire, and I saw him try through the broken glass, and he easily could come at the things in the drawer. I went and spoke of this to two or three shops; on the Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170028"></xptr> evening following, the two prisoners were taken, for breaking Mr. Barnes's shew-glass in Duck-lane: on the Saturday morning Mr. Barnes came to my house; I found the prisoners were to be examined before my Lord-Mayor, at the Mansion-house; that day I went there; the prisoners were there, and there were eight stone shirt-buckles produced, of different sorts, and four gold ones, one in silver gilt, and two silver stock-buckles; (produced in court) they are all our property; there is one gold buckle larger than any that are in the trade; two of them have green and white paste mixed:

               <p>Mr. Barnes. I live in Duck-lane, I am a watchmaker, and keep a silversmith's shop; on Friday the 28th of November I was at work at my window; I saw the two prisoners come up to it between two and three in the afternoon; soon after that I observed two more; the prisoners came up towards that part where I was at work; the other two kept their heads close to the shew-glasses; I had some suspicion of them; I sent my daughter out to see if the glasses were safe; she came and said one was broke, and some things taken out; Miller stared me full in the face; I went over the counter; Doyle went off; I took Miller at the end of the lane; he was walking fast, but did not run; as soon as I got him to the door, Doyle came again, and said, Lord! what is the matter; I knowing him, said, you are the other; and I took hold of him, and pushed him into the shop, and sent for a constable; when he came, Miller took out his handkerchief, and laid it on the ground, and said, that is my handkerchief and gloves, there can be nothing in that; now search me, and welcome. The constable searched one of his pockets, and found nothing in it. Miller took his handkerchief from the ground, and put it into his left-hand coat-pocket; there was a woman in the shop; she said, she heard something rattle in his handkerchief, search the handkerchief; upon that, he took his handkerchief by one corner, and strove to take it out of his pocket; the constable took hold of it; I saw this shagreen case here produced; I said, how came you by this case; said he, I bought it; I said, what trade are you; he said, a blacksmith; I said, blacksmiths do not buy such things as these by the dozen; I gave them into the care of the constable. Upon searching Doyle, there were two pair of buckles found upon him, one silver, the other iron plated; by enquiring among the shops, I was informed, Mr. Dealtry had lost some buckles; I went to him; he said, his wife could describe them, she having the care of that part of his business; he sent her; she described the buckles before she saw them, that we had in the shagreen case, and said, she had lost more; before the Lord-Mayor Miller said, he found the case and buckles behind a gutter in Cornhill, when he went to make water.</p>

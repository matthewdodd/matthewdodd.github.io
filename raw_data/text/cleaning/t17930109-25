               <p>Q. In what capacity was he at your house? - He waited on us, he did every thing that was to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to give him your clothes? - I gave him one coat, I never gave him any of these things; finding these things in his box, we carried them to the office in Marlborough-street, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>- WALLIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I executed the warrant on the prisoner, I found him in bed, and I got this key of the box out of his breeches pocket; I opened the box, and found all the things in the indictment, but the watch, these three waistcoats, a pair of breeches and two coats; when he was fully committed, Mr. Conant told me to go along with the prisoner, to see if I could find the watch, the watch was buried under ground in little Welbeck-street, the corner house of Wimpole-street; I went with the prisoner, he said it was under ground, but it was not, it was up a water trunk, I let the prisoner put his hands up, and he pulled it out, he produced it to me. (The things produced deposed to.) There was three guineas and a half found in his pocket; the notes were found in these black breeches pockets, they are two ten pounds bank notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In regard that he says the notes were found in the black breeches pocket, they were not, they were found in a pair of kerseymere breeches pocket; - They were found in the right hand pocket of these black breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The second thing he said that he took the key of my box from my breeches pocket, I took it out of my coat pocket; as to my defence, I am left without counsel or witness, I am left entirely at the mercy of the jury; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090040"></xptr>witnesses to give me a character, but not knowing so suddenly of coming up to this court, I had not time to get them.</p>

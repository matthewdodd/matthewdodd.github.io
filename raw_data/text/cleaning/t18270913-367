            . I am a constable. I was at the fair by accident, not on duty. I saw a gang of well-known pickpockets, and the prisoner among them. I saw this lady and her husband - she had a reticule on her left arm. I saw the prisoner make a snatch - he got it, put it behind him, and some one took it, but I do not know who; I laid hold of him, and did not let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What are you? A. A constable of St. George, Bloomsbury: I had been to see my brother, and then went to the fair; I had got my staff. I am a special constable, paid by the committee of Torrington-square. I was opposite Richardson's show; I had seen the prisoner about an hour before- I was by the side of this lady, felt a push, and saw him snatch the reticule; some one said, "That was well done;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130148"></xptr>I saw it on her left arm before he took it; I saw him take it - he was standing up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember the woman saying he was not the man, when you took him? A. No, I do not; the instant he snatched it her husband took hold of him, and was crying out for an officer, and in two or three minutes the officer came.</p>

            . I was at the fair on the night in question. I was passing, and saw this young man collared; I heard the woman repeatedly say that was not the man, four or five times.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that all you heard? A. Yes. I live at No. 4, Mapes-street, Hare-street-fields. I do not know where the prisoner lives; I have seen him before, but have never been in his company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A weaver; I was pretty near the prisoner; I do not know how many people were there; I did not hear the complaint of the robbery; I believe she had been robbed - I did not hear that she had lost her reticule, nor that she had been robbed; I had seen the prisoner before - I saw him taken up; I do not know what became of his companions; I heard the woman say he was not the man; I was subpoenaed here - I do not know who by; I had no conversation with him after he was taken up - I cannot tell who subpoenaed me - the subpoena was brought to my house; I suppose the solicitor subpoenaed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you heard that woman say, in Bartholomew fair, that that young man was not the man? A. Yes, Sir, I can.</p>
               <p>MARY DONALD re-examined. Q. Did you ever say that was not the man? A. No. I could not; I saw the prisoner by the side of me; but I could not say he was the man who did it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNS re-examined. I was present all the time, and heard all that was said; if she had said he was not the man, I must have heard it; I never saw this witness there to my knowledge; if this declaration had been made I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You say you were standing by him? A. Yes; I followed the lady and the prisoner down to the Compter; I had hold of the prisoner, and the lady was next to my left arm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see from the first to the last of it? A. Yes; I went with the lady till she got to a place of safety, and if this passed I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAKER re-examined. Q. Do you swear that the lady said the prisoner was not the man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at the time? A. Yes; I do not know how I came to be subpoenaed - I received my subpoena on Sunday - I have got it with me; I was not sent for to attend the examination before the Magistrate; I have never spoken to the prisoner, not to my knowledge; I have seen him at different times; I never knew him in jeopardy before - I have never been in trouble myself; how I came to be subpoenaed was, I happened to tell a young woman who happened to be in company with him, and by that means they told the solicitor; I had seen that young woman in company with him before, five or six different times- I have spoken to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep company with him? A. I do not know, I am sure, Sir; not to my knowledge, I do not know that she keeps company with him - I have seen them together five or six different times, seven or eight weeks ago.</p>

            . I am in the Blues, and belong to the band. On the 5th of April, about ten minutes before ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner near Sloane-street; she asked me about a cousin of hers in the regiment, and came with me close to the <placeName id="t18290409-35-crimeloc214">barracks at Knightsbridge</placeName>

            . I am a constable. I was applied to at twelve o'clock last Sunday evening by the witness, who said he had been robbed; I went with him to a house in Exeter-buildings - he pointed to a door, and said he had followed the female there, and she shut the door in his face - I knocked a long time before I could gain admission; I heard a great whispering in the house- I called a watchman, and told him to fetch a crow-bar; they then called to know who was there; I said I was an officer, and a <rs id="t18290409-35-viclabel215" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; he had a comrade with him, and a young woman asked his comrade to give her something to drink; we went into three public-houses, and had some gin; the young man then went into the barracks, and the young woman and myself staid with the prosecutor: he wished to go home with me: I said he had better go to the barracks, but he followed us - I was intoxicated, and asked the young woman to see me up to bed, and what passed afterwards I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Arnold. It is impossible to miss such a small quantity out of 4 or 5 tons, which sometimes we deliver at a time.</p>

            . I am 15 years of age next March. I work with the prisoner for Mr. Arnold. I saw the prisoner make up two parcels of tobacco, and put one in a bag, and laid it on my shoulder, and the other he put in another boy's lap.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Higham. This was in the warehouse. He bid us go and wait at the corner of Gray-friers, till he came; and he came in less than two minutes, and took them, and away he went with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there of it?</p>
               <p>Higham. About 6 pounds, as near as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose tobacco was it?</p>
               <p>Higham. I am sure it was Mr. Arnold's tobacco; for there was none of any body's else.</p>

            . I heard the prisoner own before Mr. Alderman Scot, that he put a parcel of tobacco in a bag, and put it on this lad's shoulder; and deliver'd another parcel to another boy; and he also begg'd of Mr. Arnold to be merciful to him.</p>

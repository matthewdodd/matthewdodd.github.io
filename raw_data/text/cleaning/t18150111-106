I then discovered that Mr. Nott had another lodging; there I found some ale that belonged to a brewer. I found at another lodging of the prisoner, there I found some cards of Nott's addressed to ladies, concerning fortune telling; I searched three lodgings of the prisoner's, and found Mrs. Bishop's property in them.

               <p>LOUISA SMITH. I was engaged as a servant to Mr. Nott, the day before he took the house in Han's Place. I had the care of the house to do everything there was to do. He sent for a few things out of the house while he was in Newgate. I do not think he did it with any dishonest motive.</p>

               <p>Q. How came the feathers out of the house - A. The feathers were never in the house; there were no feathers taken out of the house as I know of the beds in the garret had a great many holes in them, and were pinned up on one side. I left the house on Monday the 5th of December; Mr. Nott sent a bed back from Newgate, because he would not dirt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110058"></xptr>it, I lived with Mr. Nott in Park Place as his mistress; but I parted with him, and became his servant in Han's Place.</p>
               <p>Gillmore. I have brought a sample of feathers from Mrs. Bishop's bed they correspond with the feathers I found in the prisoner's lodging.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have compared the feathers; they correspond; they were taken out of two of the best beds; they are goose feathers; the beds in the garret had no holes in them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These feathers were never in Mrs. Bishop's place at all.</p>

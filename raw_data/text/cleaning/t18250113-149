On the 9th of December, about three o'clock, I left my master's house, and about a quarter to nine I fell in with the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street. She came up and pleaded distress to me, saying she was in want of refreshment. I said it was not in my power to relieve her, but she was welcome to a drop of poster. She took me into a house in London-wall, where we had a pint of beer. I came out, she followed me - I had a bundle containing the articles stated in the indictment, which belonged to John Dixon, my husband. We walked a few yards from the house - she then made a snatch at my bundle, but did not succeed - I got my gown torn in the struggle. I thought she was gone - but when I was not prepared for her she came and made a sudden snatch, and got it, without using violence; she ran off with it. I gave an alarm, and the officer took her on the spot, before she got out of my sight. I am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it to me to hold, and then tell me to run after a man who was your fellow-servant? A. No; it is false.</p>

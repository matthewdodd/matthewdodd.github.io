                  </hi>. I am a grocer and tea-dealer, and lire at No. 53, Aldersgate-street. I had known the prisoner by coming to my shop for goods for his master, Mr. Cook—on the 16th of February he came—he said he came from his master for 61bs. of black tea, 61bs. of green, and 7lbs., of coffee, the same as the last—he said he had not brought an order, but he supposed it would not signify—I said it would not—he asked for an in<lb></lb>voice—I said I could not send the invoice then, as there had been a varrias<lb></lb>tion in the prices, and I would see Mr. Cook—I let him hare the articles under the impression that he came from Mr. Cook—I discovered the next morning that it was wrong.</p>

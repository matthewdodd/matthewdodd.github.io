I sat in the back parlour about half-past six o'clock on the 1st of February. I heard the lock of the door slip back, the door opened, and I saw the prisoner enter, lean over the chair, and take them. He ran out - I called Stop thief! - ran after him, and about twenty yards from the door, when I was close behind him, I saw him drop them - he was taken directly, but not in my sight. A man picked them up, and gave them to me - one belongs to Thomas Sambrook, one to George Robinson, and the other to Charles Vivash. There were three lamps in the shop, I saw him plainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Miss Sambrook lives in the house? A. Yes; I believe she pays part of the rent. I did not notice his dress - it is possible that I may be mistaken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he run round any corner? A. No. I only stooped for them, and immediately followed him - there might be twenty persons round - I kept my eye on him when I stooped.</p>

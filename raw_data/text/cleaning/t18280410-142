On the 12th of February, about the middle of the day, my wife came to me - I missed two watches, and in consequence of what she said I went to a pawnbroker at Isleworth, and my wife went to Brentford; the prisoner lived next door to me, and had a slight character, and the next morning he went away for nine days; when he returned I had him taken up; he was taken before a Magistrate and acquitted; he was taken again in a fortnight afterwards; I have since seen this one watch, which was found at a pawnbroker's at Shadwell; it is one of two which I had left at my house.</p>

I told him I had picked up a duplicate, but I knew nothing about it - he said if I would produce the duplicate I should go about my business - I did so, and then he kept me. Witness. He said, on the Sunday morning, that if I went with him to a place where he had lodged for two night she would give me the duplicate, which he took from between two posts.</p>

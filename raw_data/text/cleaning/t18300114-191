               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had been to two public-houses? A. Yes; I only went a little aside with her, that the people might pass; I did not take her out of the way; I do not know that my coat was buttoned; I did not unbutton it there - she was not searched there; she called to two of her companions to come to her assistance - they came and got round her, and then she said, "You may search me;" I did not finish my pint of beer at the Black Boy - there was only a thimble found on her; I did not claim that - I was searched, and a sovereign was found on me; I am sure I had two when I left the Black Boy; I had given my wife what other money I had.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BREYER. I was called by the prosecutor on the night in question: I saw a mob at the London Apprentice - I went to remove it; he gave the prisoner in charge, and said she had robbed him of a sovereign; she said she was willing to go, she had no sovereign - there were two or three women about, who were strangers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was searched? A. Yes; and no sovereign found on her.</p>

               <p>JAMES PINKERTON. The prisoner was brought to me by the witness, and it was said, she had taken a sovereign from the prosecutor; I took her into the lock-up place, but found nothing on her but a thimble - the prosecutor said she had robbed him; I searched, and found one sovereign on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He came up to me in a very rude indecent manner; he wanted me to go up a turning, and I would not - he pulled me about; several persons came up, and said he ought to give charge of me; he is a very bad old man indeed, or he would not have behaved in such a manner to any woman.</p>

               <p>JAMES PINKERTON. When she came to sit by the fire in the middle of the night, she said he had taken liberties with her, and bugged her round the neck.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not she say at first, that he first accosted her? A. Yes, and I did not take charge, because I did not know whether he had lost a sovereign or not.</p>

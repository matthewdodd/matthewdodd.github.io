               <p>Mr. Notley. On the 10th of August, the prisoner brought this silver stand to me to pledge: I asked her who she came from? she said, from Mrs. Dewberry, and that she was an acquaintance of hers. I asked where she lived? she said, at Charing Cross. I said I would go along with her, and if so, I would let her have the money. I went with her, and there was no such person; then the prisoner said she was to meet her there; we waited there some time; no body came; then she took me to St. Martin's Lane: there she said she would send for her. She sent, and there came an old mean looking person, that called herself Dewberry. I thought she could not have such a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176409120019"></xptr> thing; then the prisoner said some body had lent a silk gown, and taken this in pledge: I said, she had better tell the truth; then she said she took it from Mrs. Dewberry, her mistress, in Westminster; then I took her to Mr. Welch's office; he was not at home; we went to Colonel Dean, who sent for her mistress, and committed the prisoner to the Gatehouse.</p>

               <p>I found the stand at the door, and did not know what it was, and the man frighted me when he took me up; I did not know how to behave, or what to do; I never was guilty of such a thing in my life before.</p>

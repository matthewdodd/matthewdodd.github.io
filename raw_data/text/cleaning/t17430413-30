            . On the 13th of this Month, the Prisoner broke open a Closet in my House, belonging to Mrs Harding, who rents the first Floor of me; I met the Prisoner upon the Stairs, coming down with the Goods, and took them from her: I asked her what she had got there, and desired to see it: she would not let me, but I did insist upon it, and pull'd and hawl'd so much that I tore her Apron to Pieces; the Constable took the Prisoner and left the Things with me, where they have been ever since; I shewed them to Mrs Harding, and she said, they were her's. - It was about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>

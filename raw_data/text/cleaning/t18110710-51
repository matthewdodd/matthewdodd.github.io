               <p>Prosecutor. This is the handkerchief I found in the prisoner's hand, it cost me eight shillings, it is worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not intend to rob him. I was going down to Tower Hill, being out of work. I saw this gentleman's handkerchiefs part out of his pocket, I said, you will lose your handkerchief, and when he saw the handkerchief, part in my hand, and the other part in his pocket, he said, you rascal, you intended to take it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had the handkerchief completely in his hand when I turned round to him.</p>

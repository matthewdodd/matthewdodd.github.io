            . I am a brush-maker, and live in Broad-street, Manchester-square. On the 24th of August, I was in St. James's-square, I saw two suspicious characters leaving the square, and at the bottom of Whitaker-street, the prisoner joined them, and shewed them something. I followed them, met three constables, and pointed them out. The prisoner saw me, immediately ran off, and I followed him into St. Martin's-lane, pushed him into a coffee-shop, and asked what he had in his pocket, as he put his hand in. He said</p>
               <p>"Come none of your tricks. I have been robbed of 5 s. 6 d." He had got a watch half out of his pocket, I took it quite out, he said it was his own. I took him to the watch-house. The prosecutor claimed it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watch was thrown down, a man scrambled with me for it. I intended to give it up.</p>

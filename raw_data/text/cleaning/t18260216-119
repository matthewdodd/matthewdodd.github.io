The prisoner came to me on the 2d of February, and asked me to go and buy eight chairs; I said I was very ill - he went away but returned about two o'clock, and said he had seven more to sell - I went with him - he left me in the street and took a porter with him, whom he met, and said he would go and get the chairs - I stood in the street about an hour, but he did not return to me - on going home I missed a bedstead.</p>

            . I have known Mr. Smith four or five years; I was with him when this happened - we were walking arm in arm; at the corner of Carey-street I saw Goadly draw the watch from his pocket, and pass it behind him, where were two persons - they ran off down Chancery-lane - Mr. Smith ran four or five yards to see if he could overtake them - I took hold of Goadly; he seized me by the throat, and the other prisoner came and took me away from him, and tore my shawl - Reboul ran off when the police was called, and the officer took him; I am sure of them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Goadly before? A. No, Sir; I should not know the other two persons; I am a shoe binder; I have known Smith four or five years, only as a friend - I met him about nine that evening - I had not seen him for six or seven months before; it was not so long as ten months - my sister was with me - I live at No. 8, Market-street, Haymarket, but I then lived at No. 7, Clement's-lane - we went to the Craven's Head, in Drury-lane, and we had before that called on a friend in a public-house, I don't know the sign, but Spring keeps it - I took a glass of ale there, and stopped some time on account of the rain - Drury-lane is not in the way to Clement's-lane, but I had to call on a person - Chancery-lane is out of the way to Clement's-lane, but I walked a little way back with Smith - it was about two o'clock when we got to Carey-street; I had not drank any thing at Drury-lane - Smith knew where I lived, for I told him; I went to Drury-lane to call on a friend at No. 23, but they were in bed; it was then half past one - Goadly positively denied that he had any part in the transaction.</p>

             (Police-sergeant, F. 12). I was on duty in Carey-street, and heard the cry of Police! between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April - I went to the corner of Star-yard and met Reboul running towards me, as though he was running from the spot; I took the prisoner back, and found Goadley being held by the prosecutor and another constable - I took another person afterwards who was not identified.</p>
               <p>Goadley's Defence. I had been to Drury-lane theatre, and then to a cook-shop and had my supper; I then came down Carey-street on the right hand side, and when I got near the bottom I heard a noise; I walked on, and when I got to the corner I saw the prosecutor, the witness, and two more women all in a bother, calling police; I stepped up and asked the prosecutor what was the matter - he said, you are one of the men who have stolen my watch - I was going home to Blackfriars-bridge, when he collared me - I said I would go with him; I made no resistance nor did I attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>Reboul's Defence. I was at work in Drury-lane, and left at half-past one; I walked down the Strand, and turned up Bell-yard, and the policeman took me back, and this woman swore I was one who had attacked the man.</p>

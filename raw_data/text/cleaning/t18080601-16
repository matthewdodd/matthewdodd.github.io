               <p>Q. Had you seen it shut before that - A. About a quarter of an hour before that I locked it myself; I left in the room a quantity of things, among which was some tablecloths in a basket; finding the door partly open, I went up to the door, I said who is there, I pushed the door open, I perceived the prisoner just behind the door, apparently putting things into a sack, down by the side of him, which was the tablecloths out of the basket he was putting in the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your street door open - A. Yes; it is a French eating house; when I pushed the door open, I said what do you want here; he made answer, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010016"></xptr>he is a coming; I said who is coming; he took me by the shoulders with one hand and apparently wishing to put me in the room that he might get out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the sack - A. He dropped it down by the side of him, the sack did not belong to my mistress. I did not go in the room, I kept on the landing place where I was. I collared him with both my hands tight; I said you are a rogue and a thief; instantly he gave me two hard blows on my head, he gave me another blow on my head and another in my face, all with his fist, he gave me a black eye when he gave me the last blow in my face; I let go of him because it hurt me very much; I called out for assistance as loud as I could; when I let go of him he ran down stairs as fast as he could run, and I after him; he got half way out of the passage, my master came out of the kitchen and caught him, and with the assistance of the gentleman in the parlour he was secured; after the officer came I went up with them and looked at the sack; there were seven tablecloths put in the sack. The officer took the sack and the tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the tablecloths were in the basket when you locked the door - A Yes, ten tablecloths; the next day my mistress picked up three pick lock keys on the stairs.</p>

            . I was sent for, I went into the parlour where the prisoner was setting; I handcuffed him, and then I took him up stairs with me; I examined the bag, the mouth of it was open; this is the bag, there were seven tablecloths in it. I took the bag and the tablecloths, I have had them in my custody ever since. Here is a key that was found on the stairs, it opened the door.</p>

               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went up the street to enquire for a brother in law of mine; the street door was open, I went up one pair of stairs; I knocked at the door, I saw the door of a jarr, nobody answered. I went in and came out again; this young woman asked me what I wanted, I told her I had made a mistake. I was wrong in the house. I might shove by her, the young woman seemed to be falling of one side; I was going down stairs when I found I was in the wrong house.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar lodged with me about 10 or 11 months; on Thursday the 17th of January my wife was sitting on the stairs , and the prisoner came for a candle to go to bed as usual. About ten or eleven she heard a person up one pair of stairs, she cried who is there, who is there? the person went up stairs and put the candle out; my wife went up stairs and could find nobody but the lodger in the house; after that my brother came and found his box broke open, but the prisoner would not own that he had been in that room .</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your box when broke open?</p>
               <p>Shirley. It stood in my brother's bed-chamber. The prisoner confest at the Gate-house he had broke open the box and robbed me, he returned me a three pound twelve shillings piece and five guineas, and after that he confest the same before Justice Trent.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his confession taken in writing?</p>

            . I heard him confess the fact, and saw him take the money out of the lining of his coat, and return it to Thomas Shirley.</p>
               <p>Joseph Dunce I went with these witnesses to the Gatehouse to the prisoner and heard him confess it; Mr. Shirley, who keeps the house, asked him if it was at the time of their suspicion? He said it was; and I saw him return the three pound twelve shillings piece and five guineas; it was all he had except two shillings, or half a crown. He was asked what he had done with the rest of the money? He said he got into company in Covent-garden, and had lost it at cribbage.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. These gentlemen came down to the Gatehouse to me and called for liquor, and I drank heartily; and they said if I would give them what money I could, I should go out at four o'clock in the afternoon; they said they would swear such and such things against me if I did not; and if I was, or was not guilty, they would swear against me. Colefax said, give us what money you can raise, and you shall go about your business. I told them I would give them what money I could raise, but I never confest the thing; I gave them five guineas and a three pound twelve shillings piece.</p>

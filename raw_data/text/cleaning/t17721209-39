About half after 11 o'clock, on Sunday night, the 1st. of November; I saw that woman at the corner; I saw one come out and run away; there were two women, one on one side, the other on the other; the gentleman cried out that he was robbed, I laid hold of the women; I saw the tallest woman have her hands upon his coat: they were secured and carried away; they swore they had never seen the man in their life time. Cunningham had her stays off; there was no other searched; one ran in the highway and behaved indecent; the watchman insisted upon my going with them to the watch house.</p>

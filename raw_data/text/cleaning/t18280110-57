            . I am a servant at No. 16, Sloane-street. On the 4th of December I was out of place, having a bad shoulder. I was out all day, in search of a situation; I was returning about half-past ten o'clock at night, to my lodging near the old church Chelsea - I had a bundle, with all the articles stated in it. I met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18280110-57-crimeloc288">Pimlico</placeName>

When we had had the rum and water, he went home with me, and gave me the bundle at my house, and I missed these articles, which I am certain were in the bundle when I gave it him; there was a large pillow in it, so that it appeared as large as when I gave it him. When he was apprehended, as we were going before the Magistrate, he offered to pay me for every thing that was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not rather tipsy? A. No; I was putting my pattens on, and stooping to tie them - a watchman, named Davis, came up to me, but he did not assist me home; I was quite sober: it was a very wet night. I drank nothing whatever myself. I did not tell the prisoner I had been robbed the night before.</p>

I told him what she had stated, and asked if he had been at the Shakespear's Head with her; he said he had never seen her before - she said,"You know you are the man - if you will give me the the things, I will forgive you;" he said, "I cannot give you what I never had - I never saw you before;" she said, "You did, and if the landlord was here he would know you;" I sent for him; I showed the prisoner to him  - he said he was the man. The prisoner then said he took the shoes, but nothing else, and that he had pawned them at Jones', Tothill-street - I asked what he had done with the duplicate; he said, "Made away with it." I went to his house, and saw a woman, who gave me the duplicate of the shoes, and a small quantity of tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. He has been a watchman about two months, and before that was in the guards.</p>

            . I am a shopkeeper, and live in Draper's-place, Burton-crescent. About three months ago, I bought a book of the prisoner as waste paper; I gave him 10 s. 6 d. for it. I sold it to a young woman named Pearsall; about a month after I bought several others of him at 6 d. per pound; he said he had them to sell for another person. The officer took them from my house about five weeks ago.</p>

On the 3d of June I found the prisoner in custody, then went to the stable, and missed the harness and papers; the prisoner was employed in the stable, and had the key all day.

            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, and live in Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. On the 28th of May, I bought some harness of the prisoner. He then said he had some coach-harness, which he had shown to a gentleman, and if he did not buy it I should look at it. On the 3d of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, he called, and sent me to the Cock, public-house, in Tottenham-court-road, where the harness was; he came in as I was looking at it, asked ten guineas for it, and said that

I went and gave information to the constable. While I was at dinner the prisoner came to know if I was coming for it. Cousins the constable, and myself followed him down to the Cock, public-house; he asked me if I knew Gibson, in Goswell-street. We accompanied him there, and told Mr. Gibson the circumstances; he said he never heard the harness was for sale. The prisoner said it was given to him at the stable. I asked him to go round to Mr. White's, which he refused; we went, and he followed. In consequence of what Miss White said, he was taken into custody. The harness was in a chest.</p>

On the 23rd of December I apprehended Hook at his house; I told him it was on suspicion of a robbery at Mr. Newman's, at Deptford-creek - I did not threaten or promise him any thing, but the next day he told me that two men in a ship's boat, came and brought a quantity of line and twine to him - that he had hired a cart of Fitch's, and Fitch was not at home; he said he did not know the man who brought it to him, but he was to dispose of it, if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140108"></xptr>could; that he could not dispose of it, and took it to Limehouse-cut, and hove it overboard; I asked if he knew the two men; he said he would tell me no more, as he had told me enough; I went to Wakeley's on the 22nd (I believe) with Judge and White - I found a quantity of lines, twines, and a bundle of box cord; some of them were in a water-butt; the officer who executed the warrant asked him about them, and he said Goddard brought them to his house - Wakeley is a dealer in marine-stores, and keeps a melting place: he had a crucible on the fire, and ran down 2 cwt. of metal while we were there: he is in an extensive line.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been an officer? A.Thirteen years; I never saw any silver melted at Wakeley's, but I have copper - it might be in his way of trade; he was in his back premises - the place is open in the day time; there was some new copper concealed under some sacks - White took that, but we have found no charge against him for that, but he could not give a satisfactory account of it before the Magistrate; he has been employed at that for years; I saw the twine found in the butt - I was at the cut on the 24th or 25th, I believe - I did not see Turner there; it was in the afternoon - I found some rope, which was rather dirty; that was not the reason which Wakeley assigned for putting it into the water-butt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.You did not persuade Hook to say any thing? A. No; I did not upon my oath - he boys some sort of twine for use in his business; I asked if he knew the two men, and he said he did not - I did not caution him against telling any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time did you go to the cut? A.About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I went with this witness and White to Wakeley's premises, and in a stable, at the back of the premises; I saw a water-butt - I found something in it, got the tongs, and found a bundle of twelve skeins of box cord - Goddard and Wakeley were both present; I went the next day to the cut, with White, Gray, and Hughes, and found twenty-two skeins of what is called ground twine and thirty-eight skeins of twine and line - this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.What did either Wakeley or Goddard say? A.Goddard said, "We washed it all there;" we went to the cut, because Goddard said, if any body would go with him to the place, he would show where he took it up; he said, there was some more, no doubt - on the first day I had only a boat-hook and a rake to get it out, and on the second day, I got a pair of drags.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-officer; I went to Wakeley's. and found him in the melting place, and Goddard with him; I said I came to look for some rope and twine, Wakeley said, "Very well, look round" - I looked round and found it - Wakeley said Goddard brought it in about an hour before: Goddard said he had been to drown a cat in the cut, and had found it swimming there; I am sure he said that - Judge found twelve skeins of cord, but I was not there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Then what Wakeley said, turned out to be true? A. Yes.</p>

            . This is the ticket which was on the ground twine at Mr. Newman's; I have looked at all the property, and believe it is all, that which was stolen from his premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Can you swear to this ticket as your hand-writing? A. Yes; it is never sent out with the goods - it is my place to take it off, and enter the goods in the book; I have sent out the goods ever since I have been there.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON to MR. NEWMAN. Q. Is the cord in the state, in which it is sold? A. It is a little altered with the wet - it has all little pieces of string to which tickets have been attached, and they have been torn off, which they are not when it is sold; the persons who came to me on the 11th of December, came to sell rope - we frequently buy old rope.</p>

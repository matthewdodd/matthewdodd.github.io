Yes - I cannot swear which took it, but I caught a glimpse of it going under the prisoner's jacket - the other boy fell down, but seeing the handkerchief in the prisoner's possession, I did not care for him, but followed the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner turning from the prosecutor - I was in Long-lane and pursued him - he dropped the handkerchief about fifty yards up Barbican, and kicked his two slippers off - he was stopped at last, and we took him in charge - I saw a little boy fall down - I never lost sight of the prisoner - I saw him tucking the handkerchief under his jacket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 16th of September I was in New Brentford—Mr. Upjohn called me into his shop, and Perkins was there with the forks—he gave her into my custody with the forks, which I produce—I brought her to the station-house, and afterwards went with her to her mother's house, and the prisoner was there—I told her Mr. Upjohn had stopped the forks she had sent by Perkins, the girl—she said, They are my forks, but I did not send her to sell them; I only sent them to be mended;" and she turned to Perkins, and said, You little hussey, how could you be so silly as to say I sent you to sell them?"—the girl said, No, aunt, you sent me to sell them, and to get what I could on them" when the prisoner was taken to the station-house, she was examined by the inspector on duty, who asked how she came by the forks—she said she had purchased them in Chancery-lane, about two years ago, at a sale room.</p>

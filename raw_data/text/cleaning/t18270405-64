            . I am the mother of Henry Searle, and live in Bell-square, Moorfields. On the 23d of March, at nine o'clock in the morning, I sent him to his father at Billingsgate, to ask for some silver - he returned at a quarter past eleven o'clock, with an officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 23d of March, I was in London-wall, and saw the prisoner with two reputed thieves. I followed them into <placeName id="t18270405-64-crimeloc362">Wormwood-street</placeName>

The little boy called out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050037"></xptr>"My money!" I took the money and cotton from the prisoner's hand, but saw no bird; he said he only wanted to take care of it for the boy for fear he should lose it; I took him to the Mansion-house, and then went to the boy's parents; I have had the money ever since; here is L T. stamped on the sixpence.</p>
               <p>W. F. SEARLE. This is the sixpence I gave my son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young gentleman came, and asked if I would buy a bird and cage; I said No, I had no money - this little boy stood by, and I asked if he wanted to buy it; he said he should like it, but had no money; he dropped his sixpence; I picked it up, and gave it him- he was throwing it about, and I wrapped it in the cotton that he should not lose it; the constable then came, and took me.</p>
               <p>T. HAYLOCK. If any thing of the kind had passed, I must have observed it.</p>

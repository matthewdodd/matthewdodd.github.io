                  </hi>. I am residing in Great Winchester-street, City. On the 15th of December I engaged the prisoner to drive me in a cab from Pool's Hotel near London-bridge, to Smithfield-market—he did so—when</p>

               <p>I paid him, and left my cloak in the cab—there was no name on the cloak—I have not seen it since.</p>

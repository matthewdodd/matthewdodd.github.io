               <p>MR. BRODRICK conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL. I live at Bexley-place, Greenwich. In February last, in consequence of an advertisement in the newspaper, I wrote a letter (see No. 1) directed to S. S., Albany, and on the 18th of March I received this answer,(see No. 2); my servant brought it to me, and next day I went to No. 20, Dover-street, Piccadilly, I saw the prisoner, who stated that his name was Jelf, and having other business at Greenwich he had called at my house the day before, respecting the letter I had written in answer to an advertisement - that he should have noticed it before, but he had been into the country to fetch his wife: he said he had some trust-money to advance, which would not be required for eight months for the purposes of the trust, and asked what sum I required. I said, "We will say for the present about 1000l." and I proposed to deposit deeds of freeholds as a security. He said there was another gentleman to be consulted, and said "If you have a bill, Mr. Hall, it will be more satisfactory, as there will then be two persons as security." I happened to have in my pocket a bill drawn by myself on Mr. Richard Delves, of Tunbridge-wells, for 1000l., and accepted by him payable at Sir James Esdaile's - it was dated 5th of December, 1827, at twelve months date. I handed it over to him, he said "This will do; will you leave it with me that I may make enquiries respecting the responsibility of yourself and Mr. Delves." I had endorsed the bill when it first came into my possession, but that did not occur to me at the time; it was payable to my order; I handed it to him and left it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it left with him for any purpose whatever than what you have stated? A. It was left for inquiry only - no advance whatever was made on it - this was on Wednesday; he appointed for me to call on the Friday, to hear the report as to the inquiry. I called on Friday; he then stated that he had not had time to make the inquiries, and appointed for me to call again; he gave me at that time this memorandum. (read.) "5th December, 1827, at twelve months after date 1000l., signed J. Hall. To Mr. R. Delves, Tunbridge Wells. Sir, received the above bill, to do the needful or return, 21st March, 1828." On my arriving at home that day I found this note, which I should have received on the Thursday, (see No. 3.) On the Monday before I had received this note from him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290099"></xptr>(see No. 4.) - On the Monday or Tuesday following I called at his house, as from some information I had become desirous of having the bill - I saw him, and he stated that he had given it to a friend, who would call on me to ascertain if it was my signature, and to make inquiries - that he would call at nine o'clock in the morning or five o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, and requested me to be at home - he did not say who his friend was - I remained at home, nobody called - I called at his house on Wednesday but did not see him - I called on Thursday night, Mrs. Jelf said he was not at home - I said I would wait till he returned - I waited and saw him - he came into the room, but I observed his hat was on the table all the time, which induced me to wait for the purpose of getting the bill back - I stated that Mr. Delves was in town, and would give other bills for it - he said the bill was not in his possession, but he would meet me at Mr. Isaacs, his attorney, next day, and return it. I went to Mr. Isaacs but he did not come - I did not see him again - I received this letter from him,(see No. 5) - I have never received a shilling from him - I do not know what he means by the "small balance" - I published bills describing his person, and offering 50l. reward for him - I have not recovered the bill, or any proceeds for it - I enquired at the Albany and found there was a Mr. Simms there, a ship-broker, but nobody of the prisoner's description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You found the porter of the Albany received letters from the prisoner? A. Yes. Mr. Delves is not here - I did not take the bill in my pocket to get him to discount it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not on the Friday take the bill out of his pocket, and offer to return it to you? A. No, he did not; I demanded it on two occasions - he said, at the second interview, that it would he more convenient if the bill was exchanged for small ones, as they would be more easily negotiated - I wrote a note about bills of 200l. and 300l. in order to get the hill back, as I had seen Mr. Roe, of Marlborough-street, on the subject, and after what I heard I should have had no dealings with him; if he had offered me 1000l. I do not believe I should have taken it and left the bill - I never breakfasted with him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you inquired at the Albany and found letters had been left there, had you ascertained whether the person was known there? A. The porter said he knew nothing about him, but he had asked him to take in letters for him - I never intended to part with my bill - he never produced it to me after I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your purpose was to obtain a certain sum of money? A. Yes; he was to have had the deeds and the bill; the offer I made to get other bills was in order to get it back; Mr. Delves is a good respectable man.</p>

I belong to a society for the suppression of swindlers, and am a tailor; I was once indicted for perjury, but the prosecutor was so condescending as to withdraw the indictment without any application.</p>

S., will you have the goodness to take charge of it;" I did not know him - he did not live in the Albany; I received a few letters, and afterwards told him it was against my order to take in letters, except for gentlemen connected with the building; he said, "Very well, I will direct them to my solicitor, in the Temple." I had four or five letters; several persons called to make inquiries - I told them I knew nothing about him.</p>
               <p>The following are the Letters referred to.</p>
               <p>No. 1. 4th of March, 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Having just been informed by a friend of an advertisement relative to a sum of money to be advanced, I beg leave to mention, that I have occasion for an advance of 2000l. or 3000l.; shall be obliged by a line, appointing an interview, addressed to my residence, Bexley-place, Greenwich.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALL.</p>
               <p>No. 2. 18th of March.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I waited on you in consequence of a letter addressed to my clerk, Mr. Simms, at the Albany; having some business in Greenwich to-day: if you will call on me from eleven to two o'clock to-morrow, I will make a point of being in the way, and conferring with you on the subject of your letter.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. JELF.</p>
               <p>No. 20, Dover-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>No. 3.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jelf's compliments to Mr. Hall, and will thank him to call on Saturday instead of Friday.</p>
               <p>No. 4.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - My friend is making some inquiries at Tunbridge, and on Thursday I shall be able to speak to you definitively; I shall be at Greenwich on Thursday afternoon, and will be at your house about five o'clock. J. JELF.</p>
               <p>No. 5. Dover, 2d of April. 1828.</p>
               <p>SIR, - Business of great importance obliges me to leave for France, for a short time, and I am this moment getting into the steam-packet for Calais; on my return I will call upon you, and give you the small balance which may be due to you upon the bill. J. JELF.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Law left the bill with me to get discounted; he has partaken of my bounty repeatedly - I was obliged to leave home, respecting some persons who had given me bills, and who have since fled; as to the balance I allude to. he was to have had 200l. or 300l. in cash, which was all he seemed to require; this arrange<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290100"></xptr>ment would have been settled, but when I found that in my absence my character had been aspersed, and improper language used to my wife, I certainly refused to relinquish the bill till satisfaction had been made for injuries so serious, and conduct so detestable; if proper satisfaction had been made he would not have found me backward in fulfilling my intentions.</p>

I was at home at the time this happened; it was about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening; the day light was entirely gone. I was sitting in the back parlour in company with my wife, (the outer door always stands open) I heard a great noise in the passage; I took the candle to ascertain what was the matter. When I came into the passage I saw the prisoner in the passage; he was taken in custody by an opposite neighbour; Mr. Watkins had hold of him. Mr. Watkins said he had information that a man had entered my house, and he suspected he was robbing me. The prisoner was struggling with Mr. Watkins to get away from him. We sent for a constable; the prisoner was secured and searched; nothing was found on him, but in the part of the passage where I found the prisoner struggling with Mr. Watkins there were a quantity of wearing apparel laying close to the prisoner, together with a quart pot. That apparel had been kept in a trunk in the kitchen. The man's apparel was mine, the gowns my wife's.</p>

On the 2nd of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner Lewis go into Mr. Stow's house; I went and caught him in the passage.

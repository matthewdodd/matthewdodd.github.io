                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Robert Weather<lb></lb>don, of Palace New-road, Lambeth—he is a tailor. I knew the prisoner Tap<lb></lb>son at Launceston, in Cornwall—I had a very slight knowledge of him—I had seen him when I was there with some friends—about a week before the 31st of March he came to my father's house—he said he had seen me at my friends, and came to let me know how they were—he asked if we could re<lb></lb>commend him a lodging—we said he might have a bed at our house, and he stopped—on Tuesday, the 31st of March, he said he was going out, and would take my little brother, and bring him home in the evening; that he was going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> meet my cousins, who live at Launceston, and were coming by the railway, and he should bring them to our house—I was not aware they were coming up—their name is May—he went out with my little brother, Edwin, a little after ten o'clock—I did not see him again till a quarter past ten o'clock at night—I went out in the afternoon, and returned at a quarter past ten—Tapson was then up stairs at my father's house, and the prisoner Beard was down in the kitchen—my brother Edwin was at home—Tapson came down stairs in about a quarter of an hour—he said he could not get the key to fit his box, and he should be obliged to cut it—he had got a knife before I came home—he said this in Beard's presence, and Beard asked if he had got any cream—he said no, they had not sent anything of the kind—he had cut the box open then—when Tapson was up stairs Beard said he wished he would make haste and come down, for he wanted to get home—he remained about a quarter of an hour after that in the kitchen—a few words passed, and then he left—he said as he left that he should try and get Tapson in to hear the trials at this Court next morning—Beard was quite a stranger <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me before—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Foyle, a pawnbroker, in the Westminster-road. On Wednesday, the 1st of April, a few minutes after seven o'clock, the prisoner Tapson came to the shop, and brought a satin dress, a black satin pelisse, with a cape to it—I valued them at from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—that created my suspicion—I asked him whose they were—he said they were his own, that a young woman gave them to him a fortnight ago—I asked him where he lived—he said at Gravesend—I asked him the reason of his coming all the way from Gravesend with them—he said he slept with a friend in Red Lion-street the night before—I asked him the reason he came all the way from Red Lion-street, Holborn—he said he came with his friend to Charing-cross, and just came over the bridge to pledge them—I said I should be justified in detaining them till I inquired further into it—he said something about law to me, and I sent the boy after a policeman—he went away before the policeman arrived, leaving the things—when the policeman came he went after the prisoner, but could not find him, and about half-past nine, or a quarter to ten, the prisoner returned—I asked why he left the things behind him—he said he had been to acquaint a friend of the circumstances he was placed in, as he did not wish to be locked up—the boy was gone after a policeman then the second time—Tapson was talking to Mr. Foyle, and said a young woman gave them to him the day before to pledge for her—she had come out of the country, and spent more money than she ought to have done, having been seeing the gaieties of London, and he being a friend, she gave them to him to pledge for her—Radford, the officer, came in and took him.</p>

On Wednesday, the 1st of April, I went to Foyle's shop, in the Westminster-bridge-road, and saw a satin dress, a polka, and a cape there—I went a second time, and saw the prisoner Tapson there—I asked him where he got the dresses from—he said he got them from a Miss Cater—I asked where Miss Cater lived—he said at St. John's Wood—I said, "St. John's Wood is a large place, can you tell me the name of the street, or the number?"—he said he could not—I took him to the station—he stated there that he slept with Miss Cater's bro-ther the previous night—I asked him where Mr. Cater resided—he said in a court leading from St. Paul's down the hill, he could not tell exactly where—he gave me the name of the court—I found out No. 4, Stationer's-court—I</p>

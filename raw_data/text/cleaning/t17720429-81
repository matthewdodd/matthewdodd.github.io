            . I was out with Lucas one Sunday, about a fortnight before Easter, when he told me he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I knew any house for them to break open. West was not with him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out then picking of pockets?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; he was not out picking pockets then, he only said he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I would go a housebreaking with him, and if I knew of ever a place; I said I knew of Mr. Faulconer's; we all agreed to go and break it open on Saturday; we met West after, when he agreed to it; that was some time in the next week; we agreed to break it open on the Saturday, but they went and broke it open on Tuesday, unknown to me, as they informed me on Thursday following; when I saw them they said they had done it, and told me they had got this quantity of plate by them. They desired me to melt down the silver the first opportunity, I agreed to it. Last Friday week I thought I had an opportunity to melt it down, I went and told them, and they brought it to me; I was told there was 164 oz. of it, by my master, who weighed it. I was about melting it down when I was detected.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoners lodged?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, at Mr. West's; one is his son, the other his apprentice, he is a fan-stick maker; the master's name is West. The silver was all but 44 oz. when it came to me, melted down, they melted it down at a jeweller's, an acquaintance of their's; they wanted me to melt this 44 oz. along with 120 oz. to pour it into an ingot for them, to have it all in one lump. I went with Mr. Heley and Mr. Clarke to shew them where the prisoners lived.</p>
               <p>West's Defence.</p>
               <p>The things that I had were brought to me by Jones, to keep for him.</p>
               <p>Lucas's Defence.</p>
               <p>It was at the same time Jones brought what I had to keep for him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. I think you was not up the first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The maid was up first, but she could not get into the part of the house that was broke open, because I had a key of a door between, which was locked. I forgot to mention, that I found a candle put out, that stood in one of my candlesticks near the door, that was taken off the hinges; the candle was not mine, I had no such in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where the candlestick was over night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively say; I am sure it was my candlestick.</p>
               <p>For West.</p>

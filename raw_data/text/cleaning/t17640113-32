I went into the house, to get a pint of beer, and when I came out again, my coat was gone from off the box, where I had laid it; I saw the prisoner going cross the way with it on his shoulder: I call'd stop thief; he looked back, and saw me, and threw the coat down, and ran away; I pursued, and took him: he said, another man took it from off the box, and gave it him to carry cross the way, and he was to have a pot of beer for his trouble. I got a constable, and took him before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed.</p>

            . On the 19th of December, I was at my own door, in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner was by the coach, opposite my house. I saw him get upon the fore wheel, and take hold of the coat, and pull it off; just as he had got it off, the prosecutor came out at the door: he ran directly round the coach; I heard him say to the man, where is my great coat? the prisoner was going back again, to put it on the coach; he seeing the prosecutor look at him, threw it down, and ran away. He was soon taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body with the prisoner when he took the coat?</p>
               <p>Tinsdale. I did: there was a man standing about 8 or ten yards from the coach, seemingly to belong to the prisoner: he seemed to give motions to him.</p>

               <p>I was going to look for work, and a young fellow was standing by the coach; he desired me to take the coat cross the way for him, and he would give me a pot of beer.</p>

            . I live in Southampton-row; I keep a hotel two doors from Lady Briscoe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What morning was it that you observed the prisoner and any other person - A. The morning of last Sunday week.</p>
               <p>Q. What first drew your attention to them - A. Some conversation I heard in the street; I was induced to look out for my own safety; I saw several persons walking; I saw the prisoner there; another person was with him; they were talking under my window; they were watching about, walking backwards and forwards; I thought they were no good. I saw the person that was with the prisoner, he went and unlocked the gate, came under my window again, and the prisoner went very diligently and opened the area-gate; he went down the area-steps; I watched him close for about five minutes; I then put on my clothes, and down I went; I opened my door, and out I went to the person in company with the prisoner; I said what are you; he said he was calling the servant up. I said, I will soon see what you are about; he ran away; he was off in an instant; I went down Lady Briscoe's steps, and went into the kitchen. I hollooed out holloo, what are you, who are you; in about a minute I heard the prisoner running along the passage, over my head; I saw him coming out of the front door; I called out to the people coming along opposite, to stop him; I saw him running as fast as he could; he then crossed the way; I kept as close to him as possibly I could; I pursued him; he went into Southampton-court, that court leads into Queen-square; a man stopped him between the posts.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. The time he stopped him was about twenty minutes after six. It was broad day light.</p>
               <p>COURT. The sun arose before four, you had an opportunity of seeing him before he went into Lady Briscoe's house so as to see his person minutely - A. I had a particular view of him just as I might be looking at you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he ran away until he was stopped - A. Yes, I lost sight of him about half a minute; there was no person intervening but the person that stopped him. I lost sight of him when he turned the conter. When I saw him I was sure he was the same person; I had been watching him a quarter an hour. I saw him searched; when I went down in the kitchen I saw some keys taken out of his pocket, thirty skeleton keys, and a small crow.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down in the kitchen tell us what you saw, and where - A. The kitchen was dark except at the door where he entered; I saw a knife and three silver tea-spoons laying on the dresser in the front kitchen close to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you gone out that morning before this breaking in was effected - A. Yes, out of the kitchen door, and up the area steps, and out of the area gate. When I went out I locked both the doors after me. I went out just after the clock struck six.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the things, the spoons and the knife, whose property are they - A. Lady Briscoe's.

I know the knife; that is lady Briscoe's.</p>

            ; I live just by the Maypole side, in Barking, Essex. I come to London to sell poultry occasionally. On the 29th of July I was selling poultry in Whitechapel at the corner of Winfield-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner near you part of the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing to do with a gentleman of the name of Sims - A. Yes; I sold him sixteen chickens, and took two one-pound notes of him. I at that time had a one-pound note in my purse; that two pound made three. After I had dealt with Mr. Sims I put it into my bosom, and when I came to Petticoat-lane I had my purse in my bosom until I came to Winfield-street. Mr. Sims bought the Poultry at his house near Sun-tavern fields, and when I got to Winfield-street I sold two geese to a man; I took a one pound note of him; then I had four pounds. I took the purse out of my bosom, put the note in my purse, and put the purse into my pocket. After I had done so I saw the prisoner near me; I sold one chicken to a woman that keeps a green-stall. I put my hand into my pocket to take my purse out to put the shillings in; I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near you when you missed your purse - A. No; he was gone when I missed it. I judged the man that bought the two geese. I judged that he must know where my purse was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner taken after you missed your purse - A. About half an hour; he was brought into Winfield-street, where I was; he was searched; there was found upon him five one-pound notes; I had but four; they were altogether in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sworn to the notes - A. No. Mr. Sims was sent for at the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the note that you had of Mr. Sims was in your purse when your purse was taken away - A. Yes, and I put my purse safe into my pocket.</p>

            . I am an headborough of Whitechapel parish. I took the prisoner in Winfield-street, adjoining Petticoat-lane. I took him to a neighbour's house, and searched him along with the prosecutrix. I found five one-pound notes upon him. These are the notes; they are all one parcel, folded up just the same as they are now. Another man took the prisoner in hold for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Q. to Prosecutrix. Had you charged any body else with taking the notes - A. I told the man that bought the geese it was likely he must see the purse, or know of the taking it. When I accused that man he went into a place where the men were gambling, and picked the boy out, and held him until the constable went and took him.</p>

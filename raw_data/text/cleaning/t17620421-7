               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same watch that was picked out of my pocket that night.</p>
               <p>Galendine. I had information against the prisoner. I saw him going up into the gallery. I said to Mr. Abbot, have an eye to that man, I mistrust him: he said he would. A little time after he and another man came down. Mr. Abbot called to me, and said there goes the two men. I ran after them. I saw Noaks give the prisoner a watch at the top of the passage almost in Hart-street. I stopt Noaks; the prisoner came and rescued him. I said, if he gets off, I'll stop you. The prisoner said, d - n you, you rascal, do not stop me, I'll knock you down: then Mr. Abbot came up; the watch was put down, and Mr. Abbot took it up.</p>
               <p>Hen. Abbot. I always open the door at half an hour past four o'clock. Just as I opened the door leading to the crown gallery on the 10th of March, Mr. Galendine said, I wish you would give an eye to those men, meaning the prisoner and one Noaks. About a quarter of an hour after, I saw them both come down; they passed me. I called Mr. Galendine; and said, there goes the two men; he ran after them and secured one of them. I saw South run up towards him, and there was a scuffle. He called out for me. Before I could get up to him, the other was got off; then the people called to me, and said there lies the watch; it was upon a bench in the passage. I did not see it put there. I took it up and went to South. He said, Mr. Abbott you know me. I said, I do. Said he, you never knew any harm of me? I said, you never did me any. We secured him, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>I had been with an order about some holland's gin A relation of mine had a mind to see the oratorio. We went; they asked a crown to go in. I was coming promiscuously by; I thought there was a quarrel. A man pushed his hand out, and gave me a watch in my hand Mr. Galendine said what have you got there? I said, a watch, and laid it down directly. I asked him, what he wanted with me? and went contentedly with him. I once kept a public house in covent-garden a great many years.</p>

               <p>Q. You was not at dinner when this happened? A. No; a pot of porter was sent for while the order was made out, for Morgan to send to King, the agent of the Melville, to ascertain if money was due to Morgan, and on receiving the answer I gave him credit; I have the note here - no more porter was drank, to my knowledge; I sent for no more: I do not know Pesman and Quicksey- I have heard of them, and went to school with them; I know where one of them lives, but was never at either of their houses; William Smith's debt was between 5l. and 6l. - Lewis signed the order on the first floor, in the room where he received the clothing; it was in an open room, not in a corner - Smith stood over him, and saw him do it; Solomons wrote the name of Morgan, and Lewis put his mark to it; William Smith and the prisoner Smith were both in the room during the transaction, but whether

             calling to either of the defendants after going down? A. Not going down, but in the room; he told Lewis not to take any clothing, as he did not want any - he did not call him by any name; he did not call them when he was down stairs - he did not call out, "Smith, are you coming," to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not the answer "Yes, directly I can get Lewis?" A. Never; the name Lewis was not mentioned, or I should not have transacted the business: nor did Smith afterwards say, "Lewis, are you ready;" no such words passed - I have made loans to perhaps twenty or twenty-five of the Melville crew; I cannot say exactly - I am sure there were not fifty; I had no dinner that day - I never mind dinner if I can get money - they all three went up stairs together, to be supplied with clothes; Lewis was sober, he put his clothing on when I gave it him - he had the same jacket, shirt, and trousers on when before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Lewis did not appear as he does now, almost naked? A. He had a frock on; Solomons saw him sign the paper as Morgan - the advances made to you came to 5l. exactly.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Was I ever in your house before this occurrence? A. Not to my knowledge, but I have so many seamen; I never sent an agent on board the Melville, who advanced you 10s.; I did not authorise King to advance 10s. to him on my account.</p>

No, I never did; I never saw any Thomas Morgan at Jones' but yourself - Price was at the house on the 19th, but I cannot say whether it was at the same time as you, if any thing, it was a few minutes before - I was there when you first came in; I do not remember Jones being at dinner - I think he was at home when they first came, but I cannot speak with certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In what part of the house were you when you were called down to the prisoners - were you in the same room with them when they came? A. Yes; I do not recollect whether Jones was there; I was not at all intoxicated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Smith? A. Six or seven years; I know nothing against him; I knew him in the Princess Charlotte and another vessel - I know Emanuel; I cannot tell whether he was agent to Jones - neither he nor Jones received any part of Lewis' wages.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Was not Emanuel on board the vessel before it came up to Gravesend, with Jones' direction on pieces of paper? A.

               <p>Q. Was I put to bed drunk in your house? A. No; you were perfectly sober, and the moment you had the money you left, and said you were going to take the Bristol coach to go to Ireland - I met him a few days after; he said he had lost his wages, and I gave him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was put to bed drunk at his house, and can prove it; I was robbed of every farthing of my wages in the house - King and Jones are partners - Jones' notes mention his name and address; he said his practice was, that part of what he advanced should be spent in his house. Witness. I keep a public-house at No.55, St. Mary-axe; he never complained of losing money there; he left directly he was paid - when I met him afterwards, he did not say he was robbed in my house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Which of Jones' young men brought you the order to obtain the money belonging to Morgan? A.

               <p>HENRY SOLOMONS. I wrote this inquiry note about the wages - I did not take it to King (read)</p>
               <p>Sir, - Please to deliver to bearer my note for balance of wages due to me for services on board the Honourable Company's ship Lady Melville.

            MORGAN X his mark.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. Morgan can write - his receipt for wages is in Court; he received his wages at the India-house on the 22nd - I was not aware till that time that he could write, and it frequently happens that seamen are disposed to write, and at other times to make a mark - I have no doubt Jones' cards were on board the Melville; I do not know whether Emanuel distributed them - there are cards of a great many slopsellers distributed as soon as a ship arrives.</p>

            . I am witnessing clerk in the pay-office, at the East India-house. on the 22nd of July 18l. 9s. was paid in my presence to Thomas Morgan, of the Melville - he signed the receipt in my presence - he was quarter-master: there was no other Thomas Morgan on board - Lewis is not that man.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Who received my wages? A. John Wright, by power of attorney - Lewis had had them before.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The company pay on a particular day? A. Yes; the agents may advance it before.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I paid Lewis 16l. 1s. on the 10th of July, by virtue of the power of attorney - the persons advancing it would receive it on the 22nd, at the India-house.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner Smith.</p>
               <p>Lewis' Defence. Before I came ashore King and Jones' agents were on board, and each man thought proper to accept of 10s. on condition that they were to leave their things in their custody till pay-day; I was one of the unfortunate number - I gave my clothes, hammock, and bag, to Jone's man, and never saw a stitch of them again - I went up to Jones' the very day I went about this, and spoke about it - there were eight Jews in the house; they knocked me down, tore my things off, and locked me in the room - I went out for an officer, and then they ran out; I spoke about my clothes, and they gave me in charge; when pay-day came I never received a farthing, except 3l. which I received from King - I got drunk in his house that morning, and had but 5s.; I have not received a farthing more, though I have been away nineteen months, not even the clothes I brought ashore.</p>

            . I was on board the Lady Melville; the prisoners were in the same vessel - I did not see a man come on board at Gravesend; I went, on the 19th, with the defendants to Jones'; Lewis was drunk - Jones was at home up in his room when we got there; Smith told Jones he had brought him two men that wanted money and clothes - a crimp is a man who comes on board on purpose to take poor sailors in; Jones said he was very much obliged to him - some porter was sent for; it was about three pots - I am sure there was more than one; we all partook of it, Jones and all - Jones said he could not wait on us just then, for he was going down to take his dinner; he took us down with him into his room, and then he sent for the porter - I did not see Emanuel there; I saw Daniel Price and Solomons; we were all in the room with Jones while he dined, and then I and Jones went up; we did not all go up together - I had a jacket, trousers, waistcoat, hat, and a sovereign, which came to between 5l. and 6l.; I paid him when my wages became due; and as I came down stairs I met Smith, Lewis, and Price going up into the room; I had left Jones and Solomons in the room - I went up in about half an hour and called out,"Jack Smith are you ready;" he told me he was coming as soon as Lewis was ready - that was loud enough for Jones and Solomons to hear; I went down, then went up again, called Smith, and he said he was coming as soon as Lewis was ready - it was loud enough for any body to hear; I heard Lewis tell Smith he owed him a pair of shoes, to take a pair, and he would pay for them - I was on the top of the stairs; Emanuel is now outside the Court- I did not see him in the house; I went before the Magistrate one day - Price was there.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are Smith, the poulterer? A. Yes - I know Thomas Morgan; he was gunner's mate, not quarter-master - he is an old man: there was only one Thomas Morgan on board - Lewis was quite drunk when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160136"></xptr>he went to Jones; Jones told him several times to hold his tongue, for he did not know what he was talking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so drunk that an honest man would not like to make a bargain with him? A. No, I should not - he staggered about the street when we first came out; Jones investigated who I was before he gave me money - he did not inquire if any money was due to me; Lewis recollected about owing Smith the shoes, drunk as he was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him he was too drunk to make a bargain? A. No, nor did Smith say so - he was sober.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not, on the pay-day at the India-house, say to Jones, "I hope you don't think I had a hand in the business?" A. I did not; Jones said,"Smith, I don't want you, I think you are an honest man."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Smith, in your hearing, call"Lewis Morgan,"? A. I did not hear him; I was present when he introduced him - he did not use any name.</p>
               <p>Lewis. Q. Did not both you and Smith call me by my own name while Jones was at dinner? A. Both of us did.</p>

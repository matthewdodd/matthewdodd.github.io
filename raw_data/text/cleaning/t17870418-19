She says to the child, shall I get any tea, my dear? the child replies, yes mammy; she said, get it out; I am sure this is the little child; I saw her taken out from the woman.</p>
               <p>What time did she bring her in? - As well as I can recollect, between one and two; I did notice the child for the trifle of time she sat in the corner.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has she lodged in this house with you? - I never saw her before in my life to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner and the two children in Fetter Lane; she had hold of them by the hand; she crossed over to me, and asked me if my name was Cimmerick; I said yes; she asked me if I knew Mr. Spencer; I said I did; she said Mrs. Spencer was her godmother, and she had borrowed a guinea of her, and had not seen her these four years, and was going to take the children home; she kissed the children, and seemed to be very fond of them.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Spencer. What is the value of the things? - The frock is worth 2 s. and the ear-rings 18 d.</p>

               <p>I was very much in liquor when I met these children; we had a pint of purl; it was very cold; I asked the children if they would have a drop of purl; I knew them, and my parents lived close by them.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Spencer. Is this woman your god-daughter? - I never saw her in my life.</p>

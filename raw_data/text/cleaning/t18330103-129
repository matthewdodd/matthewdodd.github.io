            . I am an inspector of the Police. About two o'clock in the morning, in consequence of a coachman being robbed of his hat, and hearing a noise in the shed, my officer went there, and found the two witnesses and another man, who was accused of robbing the coachman - the witnesses said they had been robbed; I went and found the prisoner, and found on him the handkerchief belonging to Perry, and the gloves and box belonging to Jennings - I have not found Jennings' handkerchief; both their handkerchiefs were taken off their necks.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

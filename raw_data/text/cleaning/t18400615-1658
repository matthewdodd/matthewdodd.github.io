                  </hi>I am a draper. On the evening of the 17th of May I was in Bishopsgate-street Without, at a quarter or ten minutes past nine o'clock—I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the act of collect<lb></lb>ing himself—I told him he had something about him that did not belong to him—I then charged him with the theft—he said, "Oh, I saw a boy take your handkerchief, and there lies your handkerchief in the road, " pointing to it—I was going to it, and a man was going towards it—I said, "Don't touch my property, " and he said, "I have been watching the man that took your handkerchief; there it is, and the man you spoke to robbed you."</p>

Yes—I felt a tug at my pocket—I saw the prisoner turning down a street, and charged him with it—he did not come back towards the place where he pointed out the handkerchief—he was standing where I over<lb></lb>took him, about six paces from where it occurred—I saw something dark in the road, and ran immediately towards it—I turned immediately I felt the tug—when I turned to go to the handkerchief, the witness got to it about</p>

                  </hi>I was passing, on Sunday, the 17th of May, through Aldgate, and saw the prisoner and another man taller than him feeling various people's pockets—I watched him down Houndsditch to Bishopsgate—I went on the other side, and saw him take the handker<lb></lb>chief out of the prosecutor's pocket—the prosecutor turned, and he threw the handkerchief down—I went towards it, and said to the prosecutor, "That is your handkerchief, and that is the man that took it"—directly the prisoner heard that he set off as hard as he could—I gave the hand<lb></lb>kerchief to the prosecutor—we ran after the prisoner—he was turning a corner, a boy took hold of his legs and threw him down.</p>

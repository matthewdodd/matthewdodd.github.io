               <p>Q. Who does the cellar belong to? - A.It is No. 3, in Well-street; the cellar is open, only a board over it, it is a place that people sift dust in; I made application to my master, that people were up and down in the cellar, and I expected there were some things there they would come for; I watched, and about six in the evening, Bellman and Evans came and went down, and Price stood at the end of the street; I had sent for an officer to be in readiness, to take them; seeing them go down, I gave information to the officer, and he came and took them immediately.</p>

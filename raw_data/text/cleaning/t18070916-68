               <p>Q. On the evening of the 31st of July were you employed in cleaning the chapel. - A. I was. I left Mr. Huntington's chapel a quarter before seven; it is called Providence chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any rooms in that chapel. - A. Yes, two; they are even with the first gallery over the door; one is the vestry and the other the study.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Huntington occasionally sleep there. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you went did you observe whether there was a candlestick on the mantle shelf. - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180709160052"></xptr>Yes, in the vestry; the vestry adjoins the study, and there was a brass bowl in the sink; I returned on Saturday morning at about half past five; I found somebody there; I went in, I found the drawers had been broken open on the side of the vestry; the top of the drawers were split off. I saw the tongs lying by the side of the drawers very much bent; the shutters of the lower window of the chapel were open, the bolt was very much bent, it appeared that the shutter had been forced. I had fastened them shutters when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any way to get to that study but by getting in the chapel. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing in the morning when you came. - A. Yes, a candlestick and a bowl; nothing else was in my care.</p>
               <p>DENNIS CRONE. - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a watchman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of August the 1st were you calling the hour of two behind this chapel. - A. Yes; it was break of day, I observed the shutter of the chapel to be open; I tried the door, that was not fastened. I acquainted the woman that is in care of the chapel, the pew opener; then I got a light and went into the vestry, and found the drawers forced open, and the top quite broken off, and the fender was bent.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. We understand sir, you are the minister of this chapel. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep occasionally in that study. - A. I live there on the sabbath day, my residence is five miles from the chapel; I have a bed in the study, in this chapel that I may sleep there on Saturday or Sunday evening, in case of bad weather. There is two galleries to the chapel; the vestry and the study are on a level with the first gallery; I built it for the convenience of going into the vestry, without going into the body of the congregation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any bank notes there. - A. There was about three guineas and a half there in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you seen this money there. - A. There was always a little money left in the drawer in the vestry, to defray the expences of coals, or any thing that might be wanted; I cannot speak to the money; it was very much under the management of one of the gentlemen of the chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose candlestick is that. - A. It is mine; there were three tea spoons and a sugar spoon, one of them belongs to me, the others are his mothers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday the 3d of August, I apprehended the prisoner; I sent a man into public house where he was, to identify him; when the man came out, he immediately followed, and tried to get away. From the description I had of him, I told him that I suspected he had robbed Mr. Huntington's chapel; he said he had not; I took him to the office. In his fob pocket I found the duplicate of the candlestick; I went to the pawnbrokers, and there I found the candlestick; when I came back, I told him I had seen the candlestic, that a person who was in the habit of going to the chapel bad identified it, therefore he must be the person who took them. I asked who was with him, he said it was the lame fidler that was in the public house with him; I asked him what he had done with the bowl, he said he had sold it to a person that kept an ironshop, a few doors from the pawnbroker's; I asked him what he had done with the spoons, he said he knew nothing more than of two spoons and if there were more taken the fidler that was with him had not made him acquainted with it. One of the spoons he said he had given to a girl, who went to pawn it; she immediately came back and said the pawnbroker would not take it in, and a man who was sitting in the same box with him and several others, took the spoon from the girl it was given from one to another he never saw it afterwards, and the other spoon he gave to another woman. He said it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when he went with the fidler, and he broke the drawers open with the poker.</p>

            . The house belongs to me; I was finishing it. I employed the prisoner, Dovey, as a painter there; he brought Mascall over to me that day, as a very honest man-to succeed some men who had robbed me before; he was to come to work the next day, as a plumber. Neither of them had any business in the house. Buckley was my glazier-the prisoner had no authority to take away any glass.</p>

            . I am a glazier. I was employed by Mr. Sutton, and had the glass in my charge; I had glazed several of the houses. On the 2nd of February, I left at one o'clock. I left forty-eight squares of glass in the house, and went to work several doors off. I was informed they were stolen about five o'clock; I went there and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180026"></xptr>counted them-there were only fifteen left. I and the foreman, went and found Dovey, quite drunk, at a public-house at six o'clock. I did not take him that night, thinking he would come to work next morning-but he did not. I and Morrison, went with Sutton to the public-house, and found him in charge. I had not hired either of them to take it away-nobody had any business in the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILKINS. I am a Bow-street officer. Sutton sent for me to take Dovey into custody; I took him to Bow-street. On the 4th of February, I took Mascall, and asked him, what he had done with the glass, he took from Mr. Sutton's premises with Dovey, he said, it was at his own shop, and that he gave 10s. for it. I took him to Bow-street, went to his house in Crawford-street, Marylebone, and found the frail, and thirteen panes of glass.</p>

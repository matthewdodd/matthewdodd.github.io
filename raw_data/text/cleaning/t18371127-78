I am a single woman, and get my living by hard work, I live in families as a servant—I was out of place for about three weeks—the prisoners were quite strangers to me—on the 30th of September, I had been out to spend the evening with a few of my friends, and as I was re<lb></lb>turning home I was a little the worse for liquor—it was ten minutes past twelve o'clock—I had been' at the Eagle-tavern in the City-road—I had never seen the prisoners before—as I was going along the City-road they spoke to me—I think it was Jemima Neily spoke first—she said, "Halloo"—I spoke to her—she said to me," What are you going to stand?"—I said they could have what they liked—so one sister took hold of one of my arms, and the other the other arm, and Adamson walked behind me—they went into a public-house and called for half a pint of gin—I paid for half a pint of gin, and a bottle of ginger beer—I did not mix the gin and the beer to<lb></lb>gether, they drank it between them—I did not take a drop—I paid 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after we came out, the two Neily's took my arms again, and took me down the City-road; first down one street, and then down another, and then they took all my things from me—the two Neily's had hold of my arm—Adamson took my bag and my necklace, and the two Neily's took my veil and other things—I had a necklace in my bag with an harmonicon and snuff-box—they got away, and were taken about five weeks after—I am certain they are the same persons—I had lived with Dr. Smith, of White<lb></lb>cross-street, before this happened—I have not been able to go to a place on account of this business—my brother has kept me—he is a painter, in Horse Shoe-alley, Wilson-street—he is a married man—some of my pro<lb></lb>perty has been found on Neily's premises.</p>

On the 15th of March, about four o'clock, the two prisoners came to the shop - there were a great many other persons there - we attended to the prisoners in about five minutes; they asked for some half-mourning prints - I think Sadler asked for them - they bought three yards at 1 s. 2 d. I saw Sadler shuffling something under her, and Gannon put herself in front of her, as much as she could; they paid for what they bought, and left the shop - they had not been there altogether about ten minutes - when they were gone I missed a piece of cotton print off the counter - I had been shewing it to them - I told Scruton - he followed and brought them back with the print; I was then at the end of the shop, and did not hear any thing said.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. J. Graham. In consequence of what Bristow said I went after the prisoners, and overtook them in Hand-court; I asked them to give me the article they had stolen from the shop - Gannon said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, if you have got any thing give it to him;" I said</p>
               <p>"Give it me, and you may go about your business." Sadler then took the print from under her clothes - Gannon fought to get away, and Sadler did get away - I pursued and took her again, and then came back and took Gannon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GANNON. He took the things from Sadler, and then he knocked her down three times. Witness - upon my oath I did not - Gannon attempted to fight - a gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070036"></xptr>came up, and said he would give me assistance to take them - Sadler did fall down.</p>

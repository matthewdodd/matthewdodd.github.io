               <p>Who played on them? - The thieves did, then they came out of that house, and went into the Cock ale-house, they did not sell any in Fleet-lane that I know of, and they were taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, there is no difference in point of law between breaking a pane of glass and breaking open a house; but to be sure in point of enormity of offence there is a very substantial difference; therefore, you would not incline to press a fact of this sort beyond what it does necessarily import; the boy says he heard the cracking of the glass while he was listening to the singing; he did not see it done; somebody else might have broke the window, and if after this pane of glass had been broke, one of these boys had taken the things out, he would have been Guilty of stealing them, but not of breaking and entering the house; therefore, perhaps you will think it sufficient if you find them Guilty of stealing, but not of breaking and entering the dwelling house.</p>

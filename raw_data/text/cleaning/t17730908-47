               <p>Q. She did not take away that silk cloak she had bought?</p>

               <p>Hunt. No; as soon as I found the cloak she fell a crying, and went down on her knees, and begged pardon for God's sake. I sent her to the Compter and the next morning she was had before a magistrate; this is the cloak (producing it); it is marked with my own hand writing,</p>

               <p>I used to wind silk for Mr. Satchwell, and when work failed, my mother, who is a market woman, lent me half a guinea to go to market with; I bought a bushel of apples for 9 s. I went with the 1 s. 6 d. to get a cloak; I gave him 6 d. of it, and took the cloak to look at at the door, and he came and laid hold of me and said I wanted to rob him of it.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Hunt: I was in the shop when the prisoner came in to buy a cloak; she fixed on a flowered one, and was to give 26. for it; she gave 6 d. in part to Mr. Hunt; I put the cloak in a paper and laid it on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080057"></xptr> the Compter till she was gone out of the shop; when she was brought back, she said, Good God, what have I got, a cloak! and seemed affected with the charge; she did not deny it, but made a great noise; she went down on her knee's two or three times and asked Mr. Hunt forgiveness.</p>

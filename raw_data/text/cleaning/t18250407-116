The prisoner came to lodge in my house on the 23d of February, about eight o'clock in the evening; he only took lodgings for the night; he was to pay 1 s., and have the room on the first floor to himself; he paid for the room before he went to bed - I saw him go away in the morning, and did not then suspect him of having taken any thing - but as soon as he was gone I sent my servant to see if any thing was taken; in consequence of what I heard, I followed, and took him about one hundred yards from the house - I said you have got my property; he acknowledged it, begged for mercy, and I went back to my house - I saw the pair of sheets, which I knew to be mine; they had been on the bed where he slept.</p>

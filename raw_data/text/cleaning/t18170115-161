I came to London on the 11th of December. I was going to Guildford. I spent my evening in Fleet-market, and parted with my friend a little after nine o'clock, I met the prisoner in Holbron, my watch was safe when I met her, it was near ten o'clock; I went home with her to <placeName id="t18170115-161-crimeloc874">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

I had a three shilling piece in my pocket when I met her, and two guineas, and a half-guinea, and a seven shilling piece in my purse. I gave her the three shilling piece, and she went out to fetch some refreshment. I fell asleep while she was gone, and when she came back I awoke, I fell asleep again almost immediately. I had put my watch under my pillow. I awoke in the middle of the night, and found myself alone, and my watch gone, and my pocket-book right; I felt my purse and found something in it, which I thought was my gold. When day-light came, I searched again for my watch, but could not find it. I went next door to the master of the house, who said, she had not lodged there before that night. She had left one shilling in the room, which he took for the rent - I went away; and when I got to the top of the court, I found two or three Roman coins in my purse instead of my guiueas. I described the prisoner to the constable and he took her. I found the watch in pawn in the name of Corn; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

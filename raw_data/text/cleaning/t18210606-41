            . I live in Queen-street, Covent-garden. On Sunday, the 29th of April, I was crossing the top of <placeName id="t18210606-41-crimeloc229">Orchard-street, Westminster</placeName>

He snatched it from me - I cried Stop thief! and another man stopped me, turned me round, and struck me on the back - my sister pursued him, and he was brought back in about seven minutes; his dress corresponded with the man who took my scarf - I have no doubt of his being the man. When we were at the office, before the examination, he said if I would not prosecute him, he would return it, if he could find it, and make any recompence - when I was before the Magistrate, I said I could not swear to his person, but his dress answered, I do not now speak to his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. It was quite dusk? - A. Yes. I only saw his back - he said he knew nothing about it, not that it was thrown at him.</p>

            . I am a dyer; I heard a female cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner, with other boys, running with the scarf in his hand; I stopped him, the gang came round, and in the scuffle I could not see what became of the scarf, I collared him two or three hundred yards from the spot, where he ran from; I attended at the office and heard the prosecutrix say to him,</p>
               <p>"You took my scarf," he said, I shall not deny it, but will return it, and make you a present to say nothing about it; she said she would not do it.</p>

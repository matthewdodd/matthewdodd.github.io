            . Last Monday Sev'n-night, between Four and Five in the Morning, the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel, and we went together into Bow Church Vault, and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville's Son's Coffin. I knew it to be his Coffin, because there was an Inscription upon it. I help'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street, in Old-Street-Square , who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it.

             . I keep an Old-Iron Shop in Chissel-street . Mr. Moore came to me for some Iron to make Coffin Handles, and said he had some Lead to sell. I bought upwards of 300 Weight of him at 11 s. a Hundred, which I sold to Mr. Newton at 13 s. a Hundred. I asked Moore, who he bought it of? He said of some Grave-Diggers who had it for Perquisites.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Warner told me that he had Orders from Mr. Prior, the Church-Warden of Bow Church, to clear the Vault. And when I went down with him, he said, This is a good Place, my other Perquisites are but small, and when these Things [Iron, Lead and Nails] are gone, my Business will be worth nothing.</p>
               <p>Warner . A little while ago the Sexton gave me leave to go down and level the Floor of the Vault. The Prisoner went with me, and taking one of the Candles he look'd all round the Vault. Lord! says he, What a Sight of Brass Nails and Handles here is? What a pity it is they should lie and spoil here, when I can have 2 d. a Pound for the worst Handle among them?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There's Mr. Hall, the Common-Council Man, knows me, and can give me a Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hall. I know he has been Under-Grave-Digger in Aldgate Parish for four or five Years. We have had some suspicion of him, - and Yesterday we searched the South-Vault of the Church, and found it all robb'd, - and Nobody had the Key but him and his Master, and his Master hears a very honest Character.</p>

             . I saw the Deceased put into the Coffin, and afterwards Interr'd in the Vault; and hearing last Saturday that the Vault had been robb'd, I enquir'd after Mr. Garland's Coffin. Warner told me, the Coffin was taken quite away, and the Corps thrown on the Ground, and shew'd me the place where it lay. I knew the Body by two Things; the Deceas'd had been Lame, and one of his Legs was shorter than the other; and after his Death his Body was open'd for the Satisfaction of his Friends to know what Distemper he dy'd of.</p>
               <p>Warner . Last Saturday Morning between 4 and 5 the Prisoner went into the Vault with this Mallet and Chissel . He broke the Wooden Coffin, and then cut the Sides of the Leaden one, and tumbled the Corps out upon the Ground, and cover'd it with the Saw-Dust that came out of the Coffin. Says I, this Corps will soon be discover'd by the smell if ye leave it here, and then I shall come into a scrape, and my Master may lose his place: No, says he, it has been Buried so long that there's no fear of smelling. Then he cut the Lead to Pieces, and we carried it to Mr. Moore. There was about one Hundred and a half of it. When Mr. Paine came to me, I ript up the Shrond , and shew'd him the Body. The Shroud look'd as fresh and as white as the Shirt on your Lordship's Back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you take the Mallet out of our Vestry? - 'Tis the very Thing that Alderman Parsons knocks with. And did not you borrow the Chissel of your Brother-in-Law?</p>
               <p>Warner. No, you brought them both to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And will you swear too that you did not carry the Lead to Moore?</p>
               <p>Warner. I helped to carry it. And when we came to Moore he seemed unwilling to buy it at first for fear of Trouble. What a Plague in Hell are ye afraid of? says the Prisoner, Don't ye know that I rummage the Church at Aldgate, and that these are my Perquisites? - Well, but (says Moore ) you promis'd to bring me some Coffin Handles. And so I will to Morrow, says the Prisoner, as I hope to be saved, - upon my Life and Soul, - the Devil fetch me if I don't. - And so Moore paid us for the Lead, but stopp'd a Shilling till the Prisoner brought the Handles.</p>
               <p>Moore. I would have stopp'd the Lead, but they said it was their Perquisites, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173201140004"></xptr> came honestly by it, and so I gave them 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it, which is the Price that all Old-Iron Shops give.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Warner brought me into the Secret, and said this and that, and t'other, and that I was safe enough , and he could get the Key of Mary, the Sexton's Maid, and would I go one time and another time? But I refus'd to go several times, till at last he persuaded me there was no Danger in it. The Jury found the Prisoner <rs id="t17320114-1-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

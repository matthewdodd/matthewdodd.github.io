                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> These boots—(<hi rend="italic">looking at those found on William Henry Fernley</hi>)—are my son's boots—his name is John David Oliver—they were lost on the night in question—this great coat is my husband's—I had mended it just before—the two table-cloths pro<lb></lb>duced by Ruberry are ours, and have our name on them—the rest of the property belongs to us—the knives, forks, and shawls, and towels—I have not recovered all the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Haslams Defence.</hi> It was intimated in the last case, that I and Eliza<lb></lb>beth Fernley lived together as man and wife, it is false; I had been ac<lb></lb>quainted with her for some months, and the property brought into the cottage, I brought there; she placed the greatest confidence in. me, and thought I came by it honestly; we were short of money at times, and I told her to pawn the things; I took the cottage myself, with the idea of our being married, but the rooms being small, and not liking it, we said we would wait some time, and take another; the coat was among some pro<lb></lb>perty brought to the cottage; I said it was no use, and told her to sell it; she took it to her father, and thinking she came by it honestly, he said he would purchase it; the boots Williams had on, I gave him, as he was in want of a place, and friendless; I took him to the cottage, and said I would always be a friend to him, if he was a good boy; he did not know how the property came there.</p>

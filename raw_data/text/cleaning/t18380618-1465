                  </hi>. I live in Brewer-street, Golden-square. Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 17th of May, I met the prisoner in Long-acre, and went with her to No. 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Phoenix-alley, Long-acre—I gave her half-a-crown, and the woman of the house a shilling—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket at that time—I am sure of that—I put it in<lb></lb>to my left-hand trowsers pocket, with my handkerchief—I undressed, and went to bed—the prisoner did not—I slept about half-an-hour, when the servant came and knocked at the door, and asked me if I was aware the prisoner was gone—I found her gone, and instantly missed my money from my trowsers—I had never seen her before, but I am sure she is the person.</p>

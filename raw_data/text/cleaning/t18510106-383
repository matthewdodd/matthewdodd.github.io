                  </hi>. I reside with my sister, Mrs. Getliffe, at the British Queen, George-street, Hammersmith, On Christmas-eve we went to bed about half-past twelve, and before doing so we bolted and locked the doors and windows—on Christmas morning I was down about half-past seven—before getting up, at about a quarter to seven, I had heard footsteps in the prisoner Standen's room—there are four rooms on the floor—I sleep with my sister and the three children in the front room, and Standen slept in the back—I can hear a tread in his room, and the joists spring when they get out of bed in that room—there is a brick wall between the rooms—Standen was a lodger in the house, and carries crockeryware for sale—his usual hour for getting up was about eight—when I got down-stairs I took hold of the strap of the front door that straps it back, and the door opened—there is no lock; it fastens by a bolt in the middle, and another at the top; they were drawn—I found the bar-door forced open, and one leading to the bar-parlour, the top part of which was locked on the pre<lb></lb>vious evening, and the key taken up-stairs—the bottom was bolted, and the other door also—I found the bottom part broken open, and the top still locked—I found the bar-parlour in confusion, the cupboard forced</p>

               <p>information that there had been a robbery—I examined the premises—I found the front door had not been forced, but the bar doors had—one sash of the kitchen window was slided back, and an iron grating outside very slightly removed—the inside of it next the house was fixed between bricks, and remained in its former position—that might have been moved from the inside—it is a little window area—it had not been moved half far enough for a man to get in—there were some ashes and cinders, and a piece of wood projecting over the grating, and they must have been moved to admit any one—I apprehended Cooke in George-street, about a quarter-past nine, took him to his house, and searched it, but found nothing relating to the robbery—I searched it again on the 27th, and in the yard, under some ashes and rubbish, I found two silver table-spoons, four silver spirit-labels, two brooches, three shirt-studs, three rings, one shawl-pin, and five skeleton-keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I apprehended Lee on Christmas-day, at his house, 2, Plantation-place, and in his room found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which corresponds with marks I had found on the bar doors at Mrs. Getliffe's, and the chisel is bent—Mrs. Getliffe's house is in Hammersmith parish.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADDISON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go into Cooke's yard on Christmas-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I did not search it—the yard is directly at the back of the house, and there are many houses round about; it is in a row—there are no houses at the back—there are two females also live in the house—I should think it is 200 or 300 yards from the British Queen—I do not think I went to the house on the Thursday—there is a partition between the yards—you can get from one to the other by getting over the walls.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many houses are there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twelve—the walls are four or five feet high—I have been upwards of seven years in the police, and two years a sergeant—I laid the chisel into the impression in the wood—that mark was in the door in front of the bar—it did not correspond with those in the bar-door—the first thing I did was to put it into the mark, and it exactly fitted—I laid it in; the mark was not very deep—I am quite sure I did not make it fit the mark; I mean the breadth fitted—I believe the only persons in Lee's house are his father, mother, and himself—none of the keys I found opened the bar-doors—there is no key to the front door.</p>

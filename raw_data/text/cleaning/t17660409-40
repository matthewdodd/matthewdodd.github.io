On the 21st of March I was obliged to go out; the shop was left open, my spouse was in the shop. I had not been gone five minutes before I had word brought me that my shop was robbed; I went home directly, and found my wife had two boys in the shop, Jones, the evidence, and Merchant. My wife sent for a constable: I looked and missed a silver watch, a stock-buckle and knee-buckle from the inside of the window; there were found two shoes in Merchant's pockets. I took them both to the round-house: my window was broke all to pieces. The next morning another boy was apprehended in Covent-garden; they were all three taken before Sir

The constable found the shoemaker in Round-court that owned the shoes; he prosecuted Merchant last week at New Guildhall, Westminster, for them; the other two remained in the gatehouse till the Saturday following; then Justice Fielding sent me word to come; I went,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090018"></xptr> and told him I had found nothing: then the other two were discharged, On the Monday after the evidence was taken up on another robbery, then he was admitted King's evidence, and confessed to their robbing me; then I was sent for again; Jones told me he had given the watch to a woman in the Gatehouse, and she gave it to a man in order to bring 16 s. for it to Jones. I went with the officer by Jones's direction where the stock-buckle was pawned, (produced, with another of the same pattern to compare) this I verily believe to be my property. The prisoners were all taken up upon the evidence's information. I heard Hull say he had not the watch then, but he had sold it to a Jew.</p>

               <p>Hull. There was a bit of paper, a note in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hackett. What time did you carry it to Hull?</p>
               <p>E. Hackett. I carried it to him about 10 o'clock on the Sunday morning, and he gave me the money about 11 on the Monday, in Church-lane, at his own house; he was sick in bed, and was not able to carry the money himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did he send by you?</p>
               <p>E. Hackett. He delivered half a guinea in gold, and 5 s. 6 d. in silver, which I carried to Jones.</p>

            ; I was very bad with the ague and fever, I got that woman to go for me; she brought up something in a rag and bid me sell it for a guinea, there was a note in it. The spring of the watch was broke, and I could get no more than 16 s. for it. I kept no part of the money, but sent it all to him. I was afraid to go to pawn it, for fear I should be stopped: I sold it in the street, but do not know the man again.</p>

We lost a book, called "Humphrey Clinker," between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 6th of March - I was in the parlour, and a witness came and brought the prisoner in we searched him but could not find it- we took a light and looked in the yard just by our door and found the book.</p>

            . On the 6th of March I was passing, this shop and saw the prisoner and another young man - the prisoner took a book off a small shelf and put it into his trousers' pocket; I collared him and pushed him into the shop - we afterwards took a candle and I found the book about two yards from the place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said there were three or four persons. A. No; you resisted, and turned to go up the gateway.</p>

Yes, it was; the prosecutor had not missed it; there was a gas-light in the window, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060100"></xptr>he took it him from under the board; I took hold of him immediately, but he turned his back and gave himself a twist round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were not you standing in the gateway? A. No; I was not; I did not state so at Bow-street; I went up there, but did not see him throw the book.</p>

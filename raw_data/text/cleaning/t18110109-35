               <p>COURT. Were you sober enough to recollect what passed at that public-house - A. I was not. I am sure I was there. I am certain I sat in company with the three prisoners, I drank some beer, it was paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your pocket book while you were in the public-house - A. Yes. I cannot tell whether I took it out myself, I was tipsey; I went to sleep, and when I awoke I found the pocket book empty on the table, and the prisoners had all left the house; I told the landlord I had lost every farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pocket book, or know that you had the pocket book before you went to that public-house - A. I put the notes in my pocket book at Rumford. I put it in my pocket, and I had never taken it out of my pocket, until I found it on the table.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she return with the change - A. No, she had been out half an hour, and returned before the Irishman brought the change to the Welchman.

             told me she gave the note to Moore to change; asked her how she came by that twenty pound note which Chapman had got; she told me that the Welchman had given her it as a one pound note, to go out and get some bread and cheese and onions with it.</p>
               <p>Bailey's Defence. I was in the tap-room when the Welchman came in; he asked me after a young woman of the name of Nelly. I told him she was gone on board a ship; he and I drank rum together. He gave me a one pound note; I thought it was. I gave it to Moore to look at it; he said it was a twenty pound note; I asked him to go and get it changed; he went to Mr. Chapman's to get it changed.</p>
               <p>Moore's Defence. I know no further about the robbery than a child unborn. The girl gave me the note to get it changed; where she got it I do not know.</p>
               <p>Green's Defence. I was not in the house; I never saw the prosecutor before I saw him at Hatton Garden office.</p>

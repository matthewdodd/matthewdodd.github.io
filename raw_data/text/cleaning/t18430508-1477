                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 15.) About four o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 3rd of May, I met the prisoners in Rose-lane, Spitalfields—Fuller was drunk, and Riley was leading him—I went up to them in George-yard, and asked Riley if he knew Fuller—he said he did, he was his brother—he was then lying on the ground—I saw this stiletto projecting out of Fuller's trowsers—I told Riley I should take Fuller to the station, for being drunk—he said I should not—I then went to remove the instrument from his pocket, and found there a pearl knife, tobacco-box, silver tooth-pick, a silver scissors-sheath, one coral ear-ring, a pearl stiletto, thirty-nine farthings, and nine half-pence—I told another constable to secure Riley, which he did—I found in his pocket a brass candlestick, a pair of boots, one in each pocket, a shawl in his breast, and a ladies' cloak between his shirt, waistcoat, and trowsers—I took them both to the station—I found in Riley's hat, 3lbs. weight of tobacco—he had a bottle under his arm, which I believe contained rum—I proceeded to the place where he gave his address, Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane, I made inquiry and found the side-door of the George the Fourth, Rosemary-lane, was found open about four o'clock in the morning—that is about half a mile from where I found the prisoners—I found the landlord standing inside—he accompanied me to the station, and identified the property I found on both prisoners—Riley said the boots were his own, the cloak was his wife's, and the tobacco his brother's, meaning Fuller, who he said was a tobacconist and cigar manufacturer—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel.</p>

I keep the George the Fourth, in Rosemary-lanr—I was the last person up—I secured the house about half-past eleven o'clock, and went to bed about half-past twelve—at a quarter to five in the morning I was alarmed by the policeman—I found the side-door, which leads from my bar into a court, open, and the policeman in the house—there were no marks on the door—there were no lodgers in the house—the prisoners might have secreted themselves in the tap-room chimney—I had fastened the door before I went to bed with two bolts and a lock—I missed some tobacco, copper money, and spirits from the bar and parlour—the articles produced are all mine—I have seen Riley in the house, but I do not recollect seeing him there that night.</p>

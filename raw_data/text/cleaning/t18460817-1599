                  </hi>. I live in Old Montague-street. On Sunday evening, the 26th of July, about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, I was in the White<lb></lb>chapel-road, opposite the church—I turned down Black Lion-yard, and the prisoner turned down after me—I did not see him till I turned down—he caught me by the collar with one hand, and seized my watch, which I wore in my fob, with the other—it had a chain, seal, and key to it—he snatched the chain, and broke it from the watch—I never saw him before to my know<lb></lb>ledge—I could see him quite plain, and have not the least doubt of him—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, he was brought to me by a policeman—at the time of the robbery there was a companion of his came down with him, behind me—I saw very little of him, but my hat, and gloves, and two handkerchiefs were taken—I had no opportunity of seeing his com<lb></lb>panion's face—I do not know who took my hat and handkerchief, but they both ran away—my hat was taken off behind—the hat and handkerchiefs were worth 15". or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 26th of July, from eleven to a quarter past, I saw the prosecutor in the Whitechapel-road—I did not hear him call out—in consequence of what he said, I took the prisoner in the Whitechapel-road, about 300 yards from Black Lion-yard—he had another person with him—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Luke's. On the 10th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two boys at the window, I had seen them in Chiswell-street, the same evening, I observed both of them go towards the prosecutor's door, and stoop down by the window, they did something by a pane of glass and then ran off; I could not distinctly see what they did, they run towards Featherstone-street, I went up to the windows and saw a great hole large enough for a man's hand to enter, and a pane of glass broken. I then went after them, but lost sight of them, I met Vann and turned towards Mosley's shop again, and saw the same two boys by the window; I believe there was another boy with them; I tried to take the biggest who was Humphrey's, but he run into the horse-road, and tried to throw his hat off, but I prevented him and secured him; I took him into the shop, and found a small pocket-book in his hat, and a box with cards in it, and four pencils.</p>

            . On the 10th of December, I was right opposite Mosley's shop, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I had not been there five minutes before I saw Matthews put his hand into the window, and take something out and give it to Humphrey's. I knew them before, I ran across the road to take them, but they both run away, I lost sight of them at the corner of Featherstone-street. I returned and saw Bridges, we went to the shop window and saw them there again; Bridges took Humphrey's.</p>

             - I became acquainted with the prisoner, slightly, about a fortnight after I came to this country; I was courting his sister, and do so now. On a Monday morning, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner in the neighbourhood, and went with him up the street to Whitechapel; we went into a public-house, and there had two quarterns of gin together- we then went back to the prisoner's lodging: before we got there he asked me if I had my notes about me, and asked why I did not change them, as I could get English money for them; I said that at present I was not in need of money, and thought of saving them a little longer - I had them in my pocket at the time; they were two Amsterdam notes, for three hundred and two hundred guilders- he asked me to come home, and I went to his lodgings in <placeName id="t18311020-149-crimeloc799">Gulston-street, Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the prisoner against your marrying his sister? A. I do not know - I have three names in Holland, but since I have been in England I have only been called Michael Hart, and here is my hawker's licence in that name; I was so stunned with fright I could not follow the prisoner down stairs - I am sure I did not give him the notes to change - he took them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did he say when you asked him about the notes? A. I asked him for my money - he said nothing, but that he had been badly handled.</p>

I was in the prisoner's room when he and the prosecutor came in, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning - they spoke in Hebrew, which I understood, but did not notice what they were talking about; I saw Hart open his pocket-book, and take out some papers - the prisoner snatched them out of his hand, gave him a push, and ran down stairs; I could not see what the papers were, but Hart called out in Hebrew,"I have lost five hundred guilders;" I had seen him in possession of a three hundred and two hundred guilders Amsterdam notes; I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was in the room? A. My wife, the prisoner's wife, his sister, and children: he being an intended brother-in-law, I did not like to interfere - I did not call Stop thief! my wife was alarmed - the prosecutor was standing up; he could have followed him down stairs if he chose - I had merely called there because the children were ill with the measles; I saw two men carrying the prisoner home, drunk, about two o'clock; the prosecutor went to Brighton, and my son went with him as an interpreter, and I wrote to him, directing my letters "Lewis Cohen," which was my son's name - the prisoner was to inquire at the post-office for a letter in that name; my wife is too ill to be here.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I am acting as a Bow-street officer. On the 19th of last month, I was in company with Johnson, and Woodroffe, in the Strand; I saw the two prisoners at the opposite side of the way. knowing their characters, I took notice of them. I saw something underneath Butt's coat; we watched their motions for about an hundred yards; seeing them speak to each other; this was a little after six. I caught hold of Butts, and Johnson caught hold of Cassimere. I asked Butts what he had got, and he said nothing. I unbuttoned his coat, and took that bundle of silk, (producing it.) I asked him where he got it, and where he meant to take it to. He hesitated some time, and could not satisfy us, only that he had picked it up in Scotland yard. When I took it from him, this handkerchief was over it;he said he picked it up; I told him that could not be, for it was a very dirty night, and the bundle was quite clean. We then took them to Bow-street. By the letters C. H. we guessed it belonged either to somebody at Charing Cross, Cheapside, or Chelsea; at last we found it belonged to the prosecutrix.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arbour-terrace, Commercial-road. On Saturday night, about a quarter past eight o'clock, I stopped to look at some plaster of Paris medallions in Whitechapel-road—while looking, I felt a slight touch at my coat pocket—I turned round, put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief, which had been safe between three and five minutes before—I saw the prisoner standing close behind me—I saw him take his hand from behind me, and put my handkerchief into the bib of an apron he had on—I collared him—he said he had not got it—it was picked up, and given to me—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him, and caught him—he jerked me off, and ran away again, and ran into a po<lb></lb>liceman's arm—this is my handkerchief.</p>

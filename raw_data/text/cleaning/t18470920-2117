I also act in the evening as check-taker at the Pavilion theatre—I know Hayward, and I know Alexander by sight—I remember seeing Hayward on the 21st of June last, at the Mulberry Tree, Stepney-green—there was a publican's ball there, and therefore I know it was on that day—I was there after being at the Pavilion Theatre—I saw Hayward in the ball-room—I was there as one of the company, and he also—we left the ball about half-past twelve o'clock—he wished me to sleep with him that night, and I slept at the coffee-shop—he said he had got a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns, and some silver about him, and he had a gold watch and chain—he said he had given eighteen guineas for the watch—I had known him before, by coming backwards and forwards to the Pavilion—I did not see the note, I saw the purse—he had the note inside the purse—there was one note, I could not tell whether it was a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or not—I saw no appearance o a note, but he told me had it—the next morning I went home and got my breakfast, came back, and went with him to Rotherhithe—I dined with him there—he paid for the dinner—he put his purse on the table, and said he had got a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there and some sovereigns—some time after that, I think on a Saturday morning, about the middle of July. about the 17th, I saw him again, at the corner of the New-road, White chapel—he wished me to go with him to the other end of</p>

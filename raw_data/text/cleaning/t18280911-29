            . I am an apothecary, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. The boy was brought to me on the 15th of August by the prisoner; he had a violent blow on the right side of the head; it was a lacerated wound - had fractured the bone, and the brains protruded; I merely applied a handkerchief as a bandage to keep it steady - it bled, and I advised his being sent to St. Bartholomew's hospital; the boy was about ten or eleven years old; a pewter pot might have inflicted the wound - anything with a circular edge might have done it; the boy remained in my shop about ten minutes while the prisoner fetched him a jacket - he then took him away on his back to the hospital.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital. On Friday, the 15th of August, this boy was brought in - I do not know who by; he was about ten years old; I found a large lacerated wound on the right side of the head - his skull was extensively fractured and driven in on the bone; the wound was about three inches long and about three quarters deep; the skull was fractured just above the right ear - part of the brain was exposed, and came through the wound - every thing proper was done to him; I saw him several times every day - he got worse, and died on Friday, the 21st, at the hospital: his head was opened, and the right hemisphere of the brain was in a state of suppuration; he died of inflammation on the brain, arising from the blow he had received; it might have been inflicted by the sharp edge of anything; a pewter pot might have occasioned it.</p>

               <p>JURY to ROSETTA FLINT. Q. Did you see the boy hold the pot to his father? A. Yes - he was about two yards off; and when the boy was down the pot lay on the right side, I think.</p>

I found my handkerchief in the left breast of his jacket. I dragged him into a shop. I saw a little boy dressed like Bond near him, but a few yards from him - two officers followed me into the shop, and they brought in Bond.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor in the street, about two hundred yards within the City. I had been watching the two prisoners for an hour. I saw Bond try Mr. Watson's pocket several times, without success, and just as he passed a tailor's shop by Brook-street, Bond took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and ran off directly - I pursued and took him, and found another handkerchief on him, which I had seen Clarke take from a gentleman half an hour before - they were together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed in the Post-office at Stepney. It is my duty to inspect the letter-carriers—I received instructions early in February to make inquiry about a letter which Mrs. Hill, of Poplar ought to have received—I made inquiries of Mr. Howlett and Mrs. Bristow—on the 19th of February the prisoner came to my office and inquired if I had a letter there in the name of Hill—I told him no—I understood him to say Hill not Hills—I asked him how he came to have his letters addressed there as it was not usual to have letter addressed to out office at Stepney—it was a thing we never have done—if it was directed to be left till called for it, would not come to our office, which is a branch station—I said it was not usual to have letter addressed there and asked him why he had them addressed there—he never had any addressed there before—he said he thought he could have letters address where he pleased—I asked him if he had had any letters directed to the Post-of<lb></lb>fice at Poplar—he said no—I again asked if he was in the habit of having his letters addressed any where else—he said yes—I asked him where—he said to the General-post-office—I asked him which General-post-office—he said the General-post-office, St. Martin's-le-grand—he than said "You seem to question me very closely, if you doubt my word I will soon fetch you something to show you I am a respectable man, and a worn broker"—I again asked him if he had ever received any general-post letters directed to the post-office, High-street, Poplar—he said yes—I asked him how long since—he said five or six months—I asked when he received the last letter from the post office at Poplar—he said on Saturday the 19th of December—I wished him if he could to produce the cover of that letter—he said he could and would go and fetch it—I asked him where the letter came from—said from Alesham—I did not ask him about the contents of the letter—he did not say what it con<lb></lb>tained—I asked him for his address, which he gave me in writing, No. 4, love-lane Shadwell—here is the direction—I sent William Edbury, a letter—carrier with him to that place and they afterwards returned—the prisoner wrote this direction in my presence.</p>

                  </hi> I went with the prisoner on the 19th of February—when we got near Love-lane, he said, "I do not live there." I then said, "When do you live? he said, "Not far, follow me," he then took me to no.13. Lower Gun-alley, Wapping he went into the house and I followed him, he went up-stairs, pulled a key from his pocket unlocked a door on the first floor, and went in I followed him—the outer door was open—when he got in he said, "I have not got the cover of the letter"—he had not looked for it when he said of—he went and got some paper and tied them up in apiece of flannel he brought them down stairs, and was about to give them to a woman I said, "You had better bring them to the in<lb></lb>spector and clear yourself"—he said, "You shall not take them they are my property and I shall not go with you," I said, "Then I must give you into custody," which I did—It was a small house—it appeared to have one room up-stairs and another down, that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to Mr. Cross, and live at No. 80, High-street, Poplar. I expected to receive a letter from him in December last—I did not receive it—I did not receive any letter from him—I have often received cash letters, directed to High-street, Popular—I never received this—the prisoner is no relation or connection of mine.</p>

I am by trade a porter, and have a wife and two children to support—I worked for Mr. Ellis, a surveyor, in the Minories, five years—I can have an excellent character from him, and other gentlemen in the City—I fought for my king and country many years—I am entirely innocent of the charge—I have been in the habit of re<lb></lb>ceiving letters addressed to the post-office in question—I did not receive the letter in question, nor is it my name which is signed to the receipt—it has been compared with my writing, and it does not agree.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, and live in New-street, Covent-garden. On the 29th of March, I left my shop, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—on my return, I missed these boots, which are the property of myself and my father—I had seen them safe when I went out.</p>

One evening I met a man I knew in Drury-lane—he said, "I have bought a pair of Wellington boots, and I don't like them; I wish you would go and pledge them for me," which I did—he said, "You can ask the pawnbroker if he will buy them," which I did, and the man said, if I would look in, in the course of a few days, he would give me an answer—I went, but he would not—I then bought the ticket myself, and gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I sold it to Mr. Bailey—he said he would meet me at the corner of Brownlow-street, the next morning, and he went with me to get them out, not having the least idea that they were stolen.</p>

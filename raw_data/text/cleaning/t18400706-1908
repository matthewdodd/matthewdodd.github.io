                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Lovell, and live in Flagon<lb></lb>row, Deptford. On the afternoon of the 18th of June, the prisoner came to our shop, and offered a clarionet for sale at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was not aware of the value of it, and took it to Mr. Greenly's, the pawnbroker, to ask him the value—I told him what it was offered to me for, and in consequence of what passed I left it with him, and returned with his young man and a policeman—I found the prisoner in my shop, and he was taken into custody—I had only known him a few weeks—I had bought several articles of him—he said the clarionet was his own—the other articles he had said were his aunt's.</p>

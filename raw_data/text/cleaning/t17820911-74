The prisoner was brought back to me by the porter and a watchman; I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You remained by this coach all the while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had very little opportunity of seeing any thing of him? - No, only by his dress, he was in black.</p>
               <p>You did not see his face? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nothing more that struck you than the dress of the man, which was black, you say now it was in June, when every body was in mourning? - Yes I believed it to be him when he was brought back again.</p>
               <p>That was sometime after he made his first escape? - It might be about ten minutes, and all that time I never was from my coach.</p>
               <p>Do you remain in the same service now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been robbed before? - No. Sir.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NEGUS sworn.</p>
               <p>I pursued the prisoner from the coach to Cheapside, I am the porter, I did not see him drop the box, the coachman shewed him me, and bid me follow him; he was taken in Gutter-lane, I only lost sight of him as he turned into Gutter-lane; the prisoner is the man to the best of my knowledge, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. How came you not to attend some of the examinations about this man? - I was not called upon.</p>
               <p>You know he was examined twice before my Lord Mayor, and this evidence was not heard of? - I was not called upon.</p>

               <p>Court.

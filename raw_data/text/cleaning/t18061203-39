            ; examined by Mr. Alley. You are a police officer. - A. I am. On the 6th of November, at half past ten at night, I was in a boat along with Warwick. I asked the prisoner what he had got in his boat, he said a log of wood, he got up and shewed it me; I looked into the boat, I saw a rudder chain, I searched the boat fore and aft; I found it under the benches concealed; he said he had it from a ship at Woolwich, he said he was going to carry it to a coppersmith's. I asked him if he had got a note from the captain, or the owner of the ship, he said no; I then took him into my boat, I asked him where he got it, and to tell me the truth; he said he picked it up under the wall of Woolwich. I took him and the chain up to the office; I searched him, he said he had got nothing but money in his pockets; in his pocket I found that knife, and these two forelocks, one is copper and the other is composition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030040"></xptr> metal, they are to fasten into bolts, to fasten on the chain.

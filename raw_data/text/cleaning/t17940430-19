On this I went to the police office in Marlborough street, for a constable, I did not choose to proceed farther of myself, a constable, of the name of Hamilton, was sent with me, and he examined and found all the articles contained in the indictment, which are my property. I have undervalued them considerably in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any articles before this time? - Never, not during this woman living with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this woman lived with you? - She had lived with me two periods, and I took her back the second time because I thought her an excellent character, she had lived with me formerly as a nurse maid, she attended on me in my illness; the last time she came to attend about the house, occasionally to attend my wife, the first time she lived with me fifteen months, the last time about two months; I took her in again merely because I thought her an excellent character, and as such I should have given her to any other place had I not found this out.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found these things in the box, had you missed any of them? - None, I had not a suspicion of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to open the box? - Yes, I had reason, but not expecting or suspecting any thing of this.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the trunk besides your things? - Yes, there were some articles of her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any articles there which she claimed to be her own? - Yes, she had some.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to Mary-le-bone; I saw the box opened; it was the prisoner's, she was standing by and acknowledged it to be her's, there were some little things of her own in it, and the greatest part of the articles, which I produce here, were found in that box, some I found in another box up stairs, which had never been removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the box above stairs was the prisoner's? - Because she brought it down herself into the entry where the other was. It was a small paper box.</p>
               <p>Court to Prescott. You say that the articles which were delivered to the constable are belonging to you; and all the articles are put in the indictment? - They are, I believe them all to be mine; I can swear them all to be mine. The fine shifts are marked I. B. with a cross, they have never been marked since they were washed in India; I can at all times tell things that have been washed in India. I do not conceive, from the circumstances I have collected in my family, that the prisoner could have taken all these things at one time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 560.) I have been in the force about seven years—about half-past six o'clock, on the 24th of June, I was on London-bridge, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, put it into his breast, and run across the road—I followed, and took him into custody—(I had previous to that seem him attempt to pick several gentlemen's pockets)—I took the handkerchief out his breast—this is it—it is the same colour as the handkerchief I saw him take—the gentleman went down the steps, or into some house, I gave the prisoner into custody to another officer, and ran after him, but could not find him—I have not been able to find who he is.</p>

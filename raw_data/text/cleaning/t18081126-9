On the 19th of September, between eight and nine in the evening, just before I came to Temple bar, I felt a man close behind me; I therefore was upon my guard, I suspected what he might be after; immediately I got on the other side of Temple bar I found my handkerchief gone; I immediately turned round and saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he - A. Immediately under the bar; I saw the handkerchief in his hand, which he immediately threw behind him: I saw this from the light coming from the shop which is immediately by the bar; I saw him very plain. I immediately seized him and took him to St. Dunstan's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he followed you before you saw this - A. A very short distance; I did not feel him but just before I got to the bar. I picked up my handkerchief.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward of Farringdon Without. On the 19th of September I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I immediately came to the prisoner; the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I stand at the bar completely innocent of the charge alledged against me. On the evening it is said the robbery was committed, I was going to spend the evening with my sister, who is a servant to a respectable tradesman at Charing Cross. The prosecutor said I had robbed him; at the same instant I was walking along a gentleman kicked his foot against the handkerchief; the gentleman seeing a mob walked on; the prosecutor claimed the handkerchief; and although I know myself innocent, I was dragged to the watch-house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260009"></xptr>I am indicted in London, which I am told is wrong, the robbery was done in Middlesex. Gentleman I am a poor young man, a hatter by trade, now a private in the London Militia; and for some time I have been the only support of an aged father; but I now am at a loss for money and friends to assist me; I therefore hope and flatter myself that this real statement of my case will have every possible weight upon your minds to prove my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You say your pocket was picked before you got through the bar - A. Yes, it was done under the bar; I had got through the bear when I discovered that I had lost the handkerchief; I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand.</p>

On the 26th of September, in conse<lb></lb>quence of suspicions, I was at Mr. Gurney's, in plain clothes—I went at twenty minutes <hi rend="italic">to</hi> eight o'clock—Mr. Gurney and his housekeeper were then in the bar—he left in about ten minutes—Lock was in the bar near the beer-engine—as soon as Mr. Gurney left, I saw a man come in and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> behind the beer-engine, which is quite at the further end of the bar—the engine was between him and Lock—I did not know that man—he asked for a pint of half-and-half, which Lock served—he did not pay him then—Lock served two other customers—the housekeeper then left the bar—the man drank part of the beer, and when the housekeeper left, he tendered a small piece of money, a fourpenny or sixpenny-piece (the half-and-half would be 2<hi rend="italic"> 1/2 d.</hi>) Lock took it, and said to him, "You should come in the morning, not come now, you see we are busy, they have only just left; come of a morning"—he then went to the first till near him, took out about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence with his right band, and placed them in his left—he then dipped further back into the till, and took out two <hi rend="italic">or</hi> three shillings—I saw shillings distinctly—he placed them on the top of the halfpence in his left hand, then took out more halfpence, and placed them over the shillings without counting them—he went and handed them over the engine to the man, turned round, and said, "All right"—the man then finished his half-and-half, and walked out, keeping the money in his hand—I went after him—he turned towards Whitechapel, and in pass<lb></lb>ing along, seemed to be counting what was in his hand—he crossed over to Essex-street—I saw him again, and Webber there—they passed down Essex-street, within a few paces of each other—when I first saw Webber, he was walking in Essex-street, rather from Mr. Gurney's, on the opposite side—they met in Essex-street, and passed down—I was not near enough to hear them speak—I saw Walton at the corner of Essex-street—it was so dark there I could scarcely see where they went to—Walton followed them, and seized Webber, and took him to Gurney's—the other man escaped—I went back to Essex-street with a light in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and on looking about, picked up a halfpenny and a shilling—Webber had not been in the house while I was there—I assisted in taking Webber to the sta<lb></lb>tion—he said three or four time she had not been at Mr. Gurney's that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lock's Defence,</hi> On the 26th of September last, as I was serving at the bar, a man named Emery, a law writer and cousin of Webber's, was employed by him to come to me to ask me for some money; this was the third time of my seeing this man that Webber represented to be his cousin; he tendered to me a sixpence, and I gave him in exchange 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and six pennyworth of halfpence; Webber was in the habit of coming about twice a-week, as he used to go to some other place, where I do not know, for the last four months. The first time I ever saw Webber it was at my brother's house; I believe that it was only twice I saw him there; one evening as my brother was there, he, Webber, came in; be waited some time after my brother was gone; what my brother had he always paid for. He (Webber) stated to me if I did not give him some money he would inform Mr. Gurney that I was robbing him; he called in several times before I gave him any thing, at last he said, I will do it for you to-morrow,' meaning he would inform Mr. Gurney; I said to him,' You are a lying false man to say what you have;' he said, 'It is all very well for you to say so;'—at last I con<lb></lb>sented to his wishes, foolishly, not knowing the character of the man as I do now, or I should have informed Mr. Gurney of it. The first time I gave money it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and at other times not so much; he would ever scarcely go away before I gave him some money; he has had on the average about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or</p>

Webber has said to me many times if some persons were in my situation they would have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per day, and he said I was a fool that I did not, as I should be considered quite as much of by the Gurneys as if I did not take a farthing. I can make a declaration before the Almighty, that I have never taken one farthing from Mr. Gamey the whole time I was with him, for my own pocket, neither for any one else but Webber; by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> own confession to me, he has not done any work for the last four years.",</p>

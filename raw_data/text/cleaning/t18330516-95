            . I keep a green-grocer's shop in Grays-inn-lane. About the 15th of March, a man came to my shop about some harness which he had for sale; I had before seen some hand-bills, and I desired him to bring it for me to look at; he came a second time, and said he could not get it without 15s., which he had left it for - I let him have the 15s., and then the prisoner brought the harness; I fetched Mr. Angle's foreman, who claimed it.</p>

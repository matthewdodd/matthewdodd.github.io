            . I am a constable. I had seen the prosecutor with the prisoner about half-past three o'clock- he afterwards informed me he had been robbed; I went to her lodging, at No. 1. Duck-lane, and asked what she had done with the watch - there were two men in her bed, and I found the watch tucked into the bed; she was hiding herself behind the door.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got behind the door to let them in - he came, and asked me for the duplicate; I said he had given it to me, and he fetched a Policeman.</p>

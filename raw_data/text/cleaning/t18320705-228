            . I live in the same house; my husband is a groom. On the 2nd of July I was in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner go up the area-steps - I followed and overtook her, about two hundred yards off, with a bundle - I asked her to return with me, to No. 105, Piccadilly - she said she was going a little further, and would return bye-and-bye- I said I wished her to return immediately; she said she could not think what the housekeeper wanted with her -I said she would tell her when she got there; when we got to the corner of Dover-street, she said, "Take the bundle, let me go," but did not offer to give it to me - she went and towards Hyde-park - I pulled her back, and got a Policeman, who took her with the bundle - she said she had come and there for a person named Bennet, who she washed for, who owed her some money - nobody of that name lives there - the bundle contained these articles.</p>

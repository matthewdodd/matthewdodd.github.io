                  </hi>. I live in White Lion-street, Chelsea. The prisoner was my housekeeper—on Sunday, the 4th of June, I came home, and went to bed—she assisted to undress me, and took the money out of my trowsers poc<lb></lb>ket—there were two shillings, three sixpences, and five 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I attempted to put my trowsers under my pillow, but she took the money out before I missed it—I sent her out for a candle, but she stopped out all night—next morning I went in search of her—I heard her voice in another house be<lb></lb>tween five and six o'clock—I brought the police down, and there she was—I counted my money before I went to bed—I was in the bed about two hours before I missed it—I am sure no one could have taken it but her—she has not been with me above six weeks, and never missed sleeping at home before.</p>

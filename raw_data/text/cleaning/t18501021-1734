I and Brett were on duty on London-bridge, on 24th Sept., at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at night—I saw the prisoners together, coming from Southwark towards the City—I saw the prosecutor going in the same direction—Lee went and laid bold of his arm—she walked a short distance with him, and sat down with him in a recess, where they remained about five minutes, Hawkins passing and repassing three times while they were there—Lee and the prosecutor then went down the steps into Thames-street, followed at a short distance by Haw<lb></lb>kins—they turned up Pudding-lane, Hawkins remaining at the corner, peep<lb></lb>ing round—in about five minutes she joined Lee and the prosecutor—they all three walked up the lane—I placed myself in a situation to hear their voices, but I could not see them—in about five minutes I saw the two prisoners walk<lb></lb>ing rather quickly up Pudding-lane towards Eastcheap—the prosecutor was walking in the same direction—I spoke to him, and in consequence of what he said I followed the prisoners, who had gone from Pudding-lane to East-cheap—I saw a woman's dress getting in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> opposite the White Bear, near Cannon-street; it turned out to be the dress of one of the prisoners—I went towards it—the prosecutor followed to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I opened the door and saw the two prisoners inside—I got in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and told them I was an officer, and I would trouble them for the watch they had robbed that gentleman of just now—they both denied any knowledge of the watch, repeatedly saying that they had not seen his watch, had not got his watch, and knew nothing of it—I took them to the station, and on the road I observed Hawkins moving back<lb></lb>wards and forwards, twisting herself about, and placing her hands at the lower part of the front of her person—she seemed very uneasy—I held her hands, and took her to the station—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man said there in presence of the prison-ers that they both jumped into his <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and desired him to drive on without telling him where to drive to—in consequence of suspicion I had from Haw<lb></lb>kins's manner in the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> I requested the inspector to have a person to watch</p>

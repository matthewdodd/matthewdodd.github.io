                  </hi>. I live in Pall-mall. On the night of Friday, the 19th of August, I went to the theatre, and afterwards went with some friends to supper at Hemming's, in the Piazza, Covent-garden—I had three sovereigns, two £10 bank-notes, and one country note for £10—I stayed there two or three hours, till two or three o'clock—by that time I had taken a little too much, and instead of going home I took an opposite direction, and went to the east end of the town—I had not much recollec<lb></lb>tion of any thing till I was locked up in Lambeth-street; but when I was properly in my senses, I found myself before the Magistrate, and this money was all gone, and there was one £5 note left to full suspicion—when I recovered, I found I had a £5 note that was new to me—the three £10 notes were gone, and the two or three sovereigns—I had received these £10 notes from Drummond's, at Charing-cross—I can swear to the numbers of the notes which which have been traced—they correspond with the numbers which one of the clerks gave me at the banking-house—there is no clerk here.</p>

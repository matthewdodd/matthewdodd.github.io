            . I am assistant at Hatton-garden. About six o'clock in the evening of the 30th of December, I was in company with Thompson, and saw the prisoners with a smaller <rs id="t18200112-134-deflabel775" type="occupation">boy</rs>

They followed a gentleman and lady into Fleet-street, then turned up <placeName id="t18200112-134-crimeloc776">Chancery-lane</placeName>

I saw the smaller one attempt to pick the gentleman's pocket - the prisoners closed up to hide him. I saw him take a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket by <placeName id="t18200112-134-crimeloc777">Sergeant's Inn</placeName>

I could not inform the gentleman without losing them; I caught Jones in Bell-yard, Carey-street, about a hundred yards off, in Middlesex - Thompson secured Clark. They picked the gentleman's pocket within four yards of the Inn gate, which is in the County. Jones said he picked it up.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Read, and watched the prisoners in company with another - we saw them attempt one or two gentlemen's pockets. They followed a gentleman up Chancery-lane, and after they had got about two hundred yards up, I saw them close upon him - they fell back directly, and ran away. I followed, and as Clark got into Bell-yard, I saw him hold it up to the others, and laugh - Read seized the others, but Clark got away. I followed him to Temple-bar, and there saw him drop the handkerchief. I secured him - he said he had just picked it up.</p>

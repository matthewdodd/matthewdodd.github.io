                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, James-street, Manchester-square, and am a harness-maker—I have known the prisoner about five years—she called on me last Sunday fortnight, about seven o'clock in the evening, and asked me if I would get her a bill of exchange discounted, bearing the acceptance of Lady Wood, of No. 4, Bedford-square—I said I could, if the acceptance would bear investigation—I asked her if she had got the acceptance—she said not, but she had just left Lady Wood, and was to return to her about nine o'clock—she told me previous to that, that her ladyship had promised her her acceptance for 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked her how her ladyship came to promise her acceptance for so large an amount—she stated</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812170027"></xptr>
               <p>that the had laid before her ladyship all her papers and documents relative to her business in the country, that her ladyship pitied her case very much, and said she was sorry she had not got so much cash by her, but if her accept<lb></lb>ance was of any use she should have it for two months—I asked her if she had a stamp—she said she had not, but that Lady Wood had given her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to purchase it—that would be the correct stamp—she asked me what my friend would charge for discounting the bill—I told her, 5 per cent, or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, making 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then went away—she came next morning about nine o'clock and brought this bill—I went to a banking-house, and on the same Monday I went to Lady Wood myself—I had not cashed the bill—in consequence of what passed between Lady Wood and myself I directly returned to my own house, accompanied by Mr. Overton—it was about one o'clock when I got back—the prisoner was there, and I asked her where she got the bill—she stated from Lady Wood—I said, "Well, that must be wrong, for Mr. Overton has been down to Hoare's bank, and they have detained the bill"—she said she certainly obtained the bill from Lady Wood, and that it was a genuine bill—I told her Hoare's had declared they did not believe the acceptance to be Lady Wood's hand-writing—she said it was the hand-writing of Lady Wood—I said it was useless to utter falsehoods, for I had been to Lady Wood myself, and she had declared that she never accepted a bill in her life, and that she had not seen the prisoner for three or four months—she said, "Well, if Lady Wood will deny her hand-writing I suppose I must bear the <hi rend="italic">brunt</hi> of it"—(I had not told her it would be better for her to confess, or worse if she did not, nor had Mr. Overton)—Mr. Overton went away a short time—the prisoner went into an adjoining room, which is a bed-room, and I afterwards found she had swallowed laudanum—I sent for a doctor, and she recovered—I told her she had done a very wrong deed, and observed to her at the same time that she had put me and Mr. Overton in a very awkward predicament—she said she could not help it—that it was all brought on by a man named Pankridge—she wanted me to write to him in the country, but I did not.</p>

I returned to the shop, alarmed Payne, who pursued and brought him back in two or three minutes; the watch was missing - I had seen it safe two minutes before - it has not been found.

            . I am in Mrs. Oliver's employ. A person came in to buy a pair of boots; I knocked for mistress to come into the shop; she alarmed me; I saw the prisoner come out of the room door myself; I immediately followed him up Bishopsgate-street, down Old Bedlam, and into a stable-yard; he there dodged me between the coaches, struck me in the breast, and tore my coat; I at last caught him by his coat tail; he sat down, wanted me to return back, and, as he passed a dung-hill, he threw his hand out, but I did not see what he threw away; I took him to mistress; she said, "That is the man who stole the watch;" I returned to the stable-yard to look on the dung-hill, but two men there said if I dare enter the yard they would knock me down. I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stable-yard was private property? A. It belongs to the Two-penny Post-office; the men were strangers there - I should know them again; they stood near the dong-hill; I have no doubt but he threw the watch there; I lost sight of him twice in turning the corner for a moment.</p>

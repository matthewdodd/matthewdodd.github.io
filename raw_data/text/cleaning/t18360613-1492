On the 29th of May I went to Johnson-street, Back-road, St. George's, East, and found the prisoner at the house of a person named Penn—Mr. Penn said in her presence that he knew her from a child, and she had some property about her that he was going to allow her to remain there till her grandmother came home, and he wished me to take notice what property she had—I saw she had a gold watch, suspended by a ribbon round her neck—this led me to make inquiry—she said the watch had been given to her by her young mistress, named Dixon, No. 2, Oxford-street—I made inquiries and returned to Penn's house, and told the prisoner, instead of her mistress' name being Dixon it was Harding—she said it was—I told her there was some money she had stolen, besides the watch—she said she had spent all the money at Graves<lb></lb>end except two sovereigns, which she had lost out of a hole in the purse—I had taken the watch from her in the first instance.</p>

            . I drive the Northampton coach. The prisoner came to me at Barnet on the 29th of November, and asked me if I could bring him to London an outside passenger. He said he had beer at the next door; he asked me if I would drink; he put a bundle into the boot, and came with me to this side of Sadler's-wells; then he got down, and went himself to take his bundle out. I saw him take out the portmanteau; I said, that is not your bundle. He made no answer, but took it out, and ran away with it. It was about seven in the evening, and was very dark. I took him up between five and six o'clock; it was dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you know the man?</p>
               <p>Knight. I saw his face when I drank with him in the house, and am positive the prisoner is the man. When he had taken out the portmanteau, he ran down the path-way into the fields. The portmanteau belonged to the Rev. Mr. De Sallis.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was there two portmanteaus, or one?</p>
               <p>Knight. One portmanteau with a case.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. What clothes had I on when you took me up?</p>
               <p>Knight. I think a light-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No. I had the same coat on as I have now. He has laid it the 29th of December; it was the 11th of December I found the portmanteau to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of the portmanteau being found?</p>
               <p>Knight. The day he was taken.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MAGILL. These things were drawed throught the area rails out of a window down stairs.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOPKINS. At about a quarter past twelve at night of the 9th of August, I saw two men in Windmill-street; I watched them up John-street, and along Colville-street, and I lost them. When I came back, I saw a third person at the area; when he saw me coming along on the other side of the way, he walked off from there and went into Tottenham Court Road. When I came back again to the corner of John-street; the prisoner and another one came by again along <placeName id="t18160918-231-crimeloc1176">Windmill-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18160918-231-crimeloc1176" type="placeName" value="Windmill-street"></interp>

Soon after the prisoner came to the prosecutor's area, and put his hand through the grating, pushed the upper sash of the window down; and in a few minutes with this stick he began to pull some of the things out. In five of six minutes, I saw that I could catch him, and I was within five or six feet of him but my foot slipped, and he turned round and looked at the full in-the fae, and then ran; but I pursued him, and caught him. The rattle sprund, and I secured him in Suffolk Mews. I can swear to the man, for I have known him these two years.</p>

               <p>I believe this drinking of your's brought you acquainted? - It did not, our acquaintance proceeded from our going to the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>The reason you did not dine with this man was because you gave him an invitation to dine with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the prisoner was so intoxicated, he knew nothing about it? - No, I do not remember anything of the circumstance, I begged he would excuse my laying down.</p>
               <p>Was he denied to you at all? - Yes, he was denied insomuch the woman of the house said, that I could not see him, that he was in bed.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning I was coming from the vestry clerks, near Charing-cross, on my return I met this gentleman, he asked me his way to Lime-street; I said, I would shew him, I walked with him to the end of Lime-street, then he asked me if I knew where he could get something to drink, I said, there was a public house at the corner, he wished some brandy and water, I condescended to go along with him, I told him I should rather not drink, he pressed me several times to drink; I said, if I did drink any thing, it must be white wine and bitters, he called for a gill of wine for me, and he drank the brandy and water, he went to his agent's, and I had a second gill of wine, then he produced a letter, where there was a woman's address, that lived at a hair-dresser's, in Glanville-street, going along it rained, he went into a public house, and called for pen, ink and paper, wrote a letter or two, then he drank some white wine and water, then he went to No. 13. in George-street, where there were two or three women, I waited sometime in the passage, I sent him several messages, at last a woman opened the door to me, and the Captain was laid on the bed with his clothes on, and a woman by the side of him, I waited ten minutes longer, he then seemed to be at a loss, where to go, I told him that I had some roast veal at home that day, and he was extremely welcome to dine with me; he called for a coach, and drove to that gentleman's house, in Goudge-street, then he introduced me up stairs, and introduced a decanter of brandy, I was quite intoxicated, prior to this I gave him my address, and there he found me; the woman of the house I presume is here, who can support every thing I say respecting of this; I came home, and as soon as I came home, I was immediately put to bed: I found when they left me in the room at the prosecutor's house, there was a female child left in the room with me, how I came by this property, I do not know, the Captain went and deserted me, and laid on his own bed, and how I got home I cannot tell; here are several respectable characters who have known me twenty years, and never knew me guilty of the smallest thing, till this unfortunate affair; when they came to charge me with this matter, these gentlemen had both been in the room a considerble<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190063"></xptr> time before I came to my senses, they drew out all my clothes, in consequence of that I searched my pockets, I immediately resigned them to that gentleman; from nine in the morning, or thereabouts, I had been drinking brandy and wine and bitters, till he was so drunk, he was obliged to go to bed in his boots, and it was not extraordinary that I should be drunk.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you desire Mr. Stoughton should be asked in what manner the spoons were produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have related it already; immediately as the Captain had told him about the spoons, he began to laugh, the Captain said he would not be laughed at, he said I have none, he immediately jumped out of bed, opened a chest of drawers, put in his hand, whether in a pocket or not I do not know, and produced the spoons; then he downed on his knees, and begged pardon, and hoped I would not prosecute him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me, he was strongly recommended to me by a person that had known him a many years; he came home at night intoxicated in liquor, which I never saw him before, between ten and eleven the prosecutor and another gentleman came and knocked at the door, and asked if Ford did not live there, I said, yes, I said, I believed they were both in bed; they desired me to go up with Captain somebody's compliments, but I cannot tell his name, I went up first and knocked at the door, and the prisoner's wife is very hard of hearing, and I could not make either of them answer, I came down again and said they were both of them fast asleep; the Captain then desired me to go up with a light which I did, the prosecutor said I will wake them, after sometime his wife came to the door, and asked what the gentlemen wanted, the Captain said, Captain such an one wanted to speak with him, she said it must be a mistake; the prisoner lay on his left shoulder, the Captain to the best of my knowledge, went and shook him in this manner, and said Mr. Ford awake! he opened his eyes, and could not for sometime make out what it was, Mrs. Ford desired me to withdraw, which I did; they came down stairs soon after, when the Captain came down stairs, I said to him, Sir, I am affraid here is some eruption, what may it be; the Captain asked me how Ford behaved, I told him he was exceedingly well recommended, he came to me on the 17th day of September, that was the 9th day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bose, who keeps the King of Prussia public-house, in George-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was employed by us as a jobbing carpenter—we went into the house about three weeks before we were robbed—the prisoner came on Monday, the 21st of October, to fix a bedstead—while he was in the house, I went to my bed-room, and found a box in which I kept money with the lock forced, and the screws almost out—this was three or four days before the robbery—I went down to the prisoner, who was at work in the club-room, and said it was very strange, the screws were forced, and I was in the habit of keeping my money there, and I should remove it—he said, "If I was you, I would"—I said I would put it into my drawer, which I did—after that, I went to a drawer in my bed-room, to get change for a sovereign, while the prisoner was at work in the room—he saw me go to the drawer—I locked the drawer, as usual—on Tuesday, the day before I missed my money, I found all my money safe at ten o'clock in the morning—the pri<lb></lb>soner had finished his work in the house on the Monday, the 28th, and left his tools behind him—he had no business there on Tuesday, but he came between eleven and twelve o'clock, and asked the servant for his tools—I saw him in the house—I saw him come down stairs, while we were dining in the parlour—he had no business up-stairs at all—I had some drawers in an upper room, which had not been put into the chest, and there were locks on all of them—having just moved, we did not put the drawers in their places, they were lying about, and after the robbery I missed a lock off one of those drawers—the same key opened all the drawers—when I went to my drawer, on Wednesday, the lock had not been forced—it must have been opened by a key—I lost a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I have two small children, and one servant—it was a very serious loss, for we had saved it to pay our brewer.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, the 25th of October, I saw the prisoner at Lambeth-walk, working there, assisting the pewlerers—I first saw him between eleven and twelve o'clock—I was at work there—I live in Frances-street—I know it was the 25th, because on Saturday night they opened—I saw the prisoner all the day, till eleven o'clock at night—Mr. Hall sent me a note to come here.</p>

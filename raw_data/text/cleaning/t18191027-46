            . I am a wholesale clothes salesman, and live in the Minories. I was crossing America-square on the 23d of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, and observed the prisoner with the piece of cloth by a private door, about thirty yards from the prosecutor's. I suspected him, went back, and asked him what he was going to do there? He said he was going to leave the cloth at that house. I asked him if he had knocked at the door? He said he had knocked twice; I then knocked for him. The servant said he had not knocked before. An officer was sent for, who took him into custody.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KINNERSLEY. I took the prisoner and cloth in charge, and found it belonged to the prosecutor. The prisoner said a person gave it to him to carry.</p>

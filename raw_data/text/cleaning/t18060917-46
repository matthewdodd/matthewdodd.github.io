               <p>Q. When did he leave your master's service. - A. On the 12th of July, after he was gone, I missed the property immediately, with the keys of the area door, and the key of the butler's pantry; on the 19th of this month I saw them again, they were produced by Mr. Pocock and his wife; when I saw them I knew them to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>- ATKINS sworn. I am an officer belonging to Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Jervis with a warrant to a person of the name of Pocock. - A. Yes, on the 19th of July to his house Eagle street, Red Lion square; in Pocock's front parlour there was a trunk which belonged to the prisoner, it was locked, I broke it open; in that trunk I found a hammer and a pair of snuffers; in a bureau that was open, I found two clothes brushes, a cup and saucer, one pint decanter, one tumbler, two wine glasses, four earthen plates, two knives and two forks, and one japan lamp; in a box in the one pair of stairs back room, which I broke open, I found a red and white muslin handkerchief, five plates, two teacups and two saucers, and a drinking glass, that is all I found; I produce them. The prisoner was apprehended a week before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the boxes and the trunks that he took away. - A. Yes, they were the prisoners; they were brought to my house on the 30th of July, about seven o'clock in the morning, by a man of the name of Matthews. Mrs. Pocock put the crockery ware in the bureau for fear they should be broke.</p>
               <p>MRS. POCOCK sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you at home at the search. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the crockery ware described by your husband, that you placed in the bureau. - A. Yes, in the course of that evening he was taken to prison, (I cannot say the precise day) they were put in there, because they were in our way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that these things, that you put in the bureau, belonged to the prisoner. - A. I thought so, the person that brought in the boxes, brought the plates and glasses in a basket; the keys I gave to Mr. Jervis myself; I had tied them both together, and I hung them on a nail in the yard.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a fruiterer and green-grocer, New Willmot-street, Foundling Hospital. I have known the prisoner some time, I was employed by him on the 13th of July last. He came to me, and said, he was going to leave Jervis's service, and asked me if I would move his boxes into Theobald's-road, which I did; I removed them from there and the prisoner helped me (I cannot say as to the day of the month), there were two deal boxes and two trunks. When I removed them from Theobald's-road to Mr. Pocock's, there were some plates and glasses in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever he employed you to move to Theobald's-road, you moved them, and you also removed them to Mr. Pocock's. - A. Yes, I received them of the prisoner, he said they belonged to him. I delivered them at Mr. Pocock's.</p>

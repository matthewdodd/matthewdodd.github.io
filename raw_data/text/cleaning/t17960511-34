               <p>Q. When Jeffery came up, what did you say to him? - A. He asked me if I saw a man take a basket, and I said, yes; he had pitched it at the corner of that street; I told him he was a shortish man, rather pitted with the small-pox, with a lightish coloured coat and waistcoat, with two or three patches in it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 5th of April, this young man, Jeffery, came into my shop, and said, he had lost eight quartern loaves, and on the Sunday following, I, and Jeffery, and Jobson went to the public-house together, the Merlin's-cave, in Margaret-street, where the prisoner lodged; when we went in, we sat down, and called for a pint of beer; we cautioned the young lad to be very particular in the person, and make himself certain; he had shewed him to Jeffery before; there were then six or eight of them in company, and he pointed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body suggest to the boy which of them it was, or was it totally of his own accord? - A. Totally of himself, he pointed out the prisoner, we sat down and were drinking our beer, and then the prisoner got up, and walked out, and I walked out after him, and I took hold of him at the door and said, young man, you must go a little way with me down this street; and he said, where; I said, a little way down here, and he said, for what; I said, for something you have done to that young man; why, says he, then, I have seen the young man two or three times before, why did not he speak to me before, if I have done any thing; well, says I, we will have no disturbance, as it is Sunday evening, go with me, and if you have done nothing to him, he can do nothing to you; I told him, he must go to the watch-house, he swore he would not go, and directly a scuffle ensued, and the landlord and landlady, and five or six more came out and rescued him, and the landlord swore I should not take him, that I had no right to take him without a warrant, and to touch him if I dared.</p>

               <p>Q. What public-house was this? - A. The Merlin's-cave, Margaret-street; I then went down to Marlborough-street to see for an officer; I got one of the beadles, and when I came back, he had got away from the young man, and was gone; and they abused me then, and said, they believed we were the biggest rogues, and that no person should dare to go into their house without a warrant; the next day I saw him, and took him in the market, the landlady said, he was not out of the house at first, that he was ill in bed all the day, and then it was contradicted, that it was the day before that he was ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Q.Who contradicted that? - A. The landlady herself, and several others, and the prisoner said, he was out upon a job; I told him then, he had better send for his master; the landlord of the house then came in, and said, no, you know you were not there only a bit of a night; well, says I, if you were there at all send for your master, he will be of the greatest service; but no master was sent for, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110101"></xptr>then the Justice put him back till night, as he said he had got more witnesses; and then, at night, neither the landlord nor landlady came forward; and then, they brought another man, that I had never seen before; and then, Mr. Conant ordered him to go to prison, and said, that if the landlady would come up next day, he would then send for him up again; but we never heard any more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination. Q. You went on the Sunday, and did not succeed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And on the Monday you went to the public-house to take him with a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not run away? - A. He was not there; they told me he was gone to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was at work at Mr. Atkins's, in Berkley-square; I came to my lodging in the morning, and ate my breakfast, and was never out of the house all the day long; my landlady has been here two days, she will be upon her oath I was not out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. I will just give you notice; take care how you cell any body that states to the Jury any thing that they will not believe; if you call a witness to swear that which the Jury don't believe to be true, probably, the worst punishment the Court can inflict will be inflicted upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckstan). What is the name of the publican? - A.

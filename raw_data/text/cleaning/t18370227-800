                  </hi>. In the early part of last year I took the prisoner into my service, and he accompanied me to Spain—I returned in July wounded, and the prisoner was still in my service—I went out again on the 16th of August—I entrusted the prisoner with trunks containing the articles stated—I was going through France, and directed him to go from Portsmouth—I went to Spain—he did not come to me as I expected—I returned to England, and got here on the 27th of January—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to me and gave me the duplicates, and said that I was very fortunate to get them—he said he had pawned the things, and that he wanted money, and he did not expect to see me again, as he heard I had been so wounded, he did not expect I should survive—I had hired him as groom, at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and half-a-crown a day board wages—when I went away I left him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a free passage—I advanced him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, which was more than a year's wages.</p>

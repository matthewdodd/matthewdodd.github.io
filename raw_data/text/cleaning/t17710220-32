I was out on the thirteenth of this month; I came home, before seven o'clock: I went into my back room, where my people were at work. About half an hour after that, I came into the shop; I found the door open, and suspected somebody had been in the shop. I examined the hats in the window, and missed three: I had seen them before I went out. I went to Sir

On Friday night the pawnbroker came to me, and informed me one hat was brought to pledge. I went to see it, and knew it to be my hat. I went to Sir

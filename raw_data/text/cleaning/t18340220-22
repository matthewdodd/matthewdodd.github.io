               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I come to you that morning for? A. I do not know - I do not know why I went into the back place - you had a dog in a string - I did not buy it of you - I got to town about half-past five or six - I did not offer to compromise this for 2l.; but you said if I had a mind to go to a friend of yours, I should be made welcome, and you would give me 2l., and 4l. after you had been out a fortnight - I called on you the other day, because you sent for me to come to you by a letter, which you told the person to tear as soon as he had read it to me.</p>

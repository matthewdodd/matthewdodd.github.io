Clark said he wished me to be perfectly satisfied, and referred me to Mr. Robins, who was the solicitor in their cause. He produced several papers, and referred to a letter written by Robins to Blunt and Co., containing an account of the stock. He gave me Robins's address, No. 36, Leicester-fields, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060048"></xptr>asked me if I knew him? I said No. He said he was a respectable attorney, a man of great business, and that his country house was at Wandsworth. I sent my man to Mr. Robins, and afterwards went myself - I saw Clark there, sitting on a bench in the hall; he said Robins was engaged. After waiting about twenty minutes I was asked to walk into Mr. Booth's office, the managing clerk. I told Booth I was come to enquire relative to

             being the right heir - he said none whatever remained in his mind - no doubt existed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state why, no doubt remained - A. He said from documents and affidavits in their possession, and I think he said received that day. He said, he had been down in the country himself a week on their business, and Mr. Robins had expended a considerable sum of money on their cause already, at this time Mr. Robins came into the office, and looked over some papers, turned round, and asked Booth if I had business with him. He said,</p>
               <p>"He is waiting to see you." I said I was referred to him by Mr. Farrington, relative to the cause I understood he had in hand for them. He appeared very indignant at being referred to, and said, he allowed no person to refer to him - he would not permit even the Bank of England to refer to him, he however said, as far as human foresight could see, the party (Farrington) were intitled to the property, and any order for payment of goods they might give on him, he would discharge, on the property coming into his hands. I returned home, and in about half an hour the prisoners came in. Clark said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Robins and I have been talking about your application, and he recommends Mr. Farrington to give an order on him for payment of what goods he might want," and on the 21st he gave me this order - (looking at it) - it is signed Farrington.

               <p>Q. Did you give him credit entirely from what passed - A. Certainly, I delivered them on the 21st; goods stated in the bill (producing it) the amount is 111 l. 15 s. 6 d. On that day they said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Nock you will be paid a great deal sooner than we expected, for the executors are much alarmed at our proceedings, and wish to compromise." Farrington, then said, to me,</p>
               <p>"I will not lose 1 d. by them." I advised him to close the business, even if he lost 500 l.; it was better than litigation. Clark joined in my advice, and said it was better to settle it soon, for the lawyer's bill would be 1,500 l. They then referred to the hasty and indecent manner in which the will had been proved. and gave me a list of the legacies. Clark said there was a good deal of money in her hands at the time she died, and at the time of her funeral, there was not enough found to bury her. They took the goods away themselves in a coach. They called afterwards and dealt largely with me. They said they bought the goods to go and have some shooting in the country somewhere in Suffolk. They had borrowed two guns on the 19th, till I could get two finished. When they came on the 21st, they said,</p>
               <p>"We have tried your two guns yesterday, and the double one we have given to our keeper;" and said, they were determined to have a week's shooting before they turned to any more business; and at the end of the week I was to be paid. I afterwards received orders from them by post, and about the 2d of October I made further enquiry as they did not fulfill their engagements. I went again to Robins, and had still further assurances, and sent my man to discover the executors *.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner, Clark, put several questions to the witnesses, but their answers were precisely to the same effect as on their examination in chief.</p>

Mr. Nock asked for the address of some respectable person, and Clark said, that Mr. Robins, of 36, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, was their solicitor in this matter. I went to Robins, but did not see him. I saw Booth, his clerk. I found the prisoners in the office with him. Booth said, Robins was not at home. I informed him my business, in their presence, and said they had applied to Mr. Nock to purchase guns, and referred to him as their professional man. Clark corroborated my statement, by informing Booth that they had been to purchase guns. Booth immediately turned to me, and pointing to Dawson, said,</p>
               <p>"That is Mr. Farrington;" and Dawson said Yes - my name is Farrington. Booth said, Robins did not like to have his office made a place of reference. but from the papers and documents in their possession, he had no doubt, that the property was coming to them. I asked when Robins would be in the way, he said, in about three quarters of an hour; and as I left the office Clark desired me to have every thing ready, as he wished to leave town by the coach that evening, and we need not be uneasy about the money, for there was plenty. I went home and told my master, he went to Robins, and about ten minutes after his return they both called.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they had goods or not then I do not enquire, but when did they call again - A. On the 21st. They talked about the property as before, and bought goods to the amount of 111 l. Mr. Nock had lent them a double and a single-barrelled gun on the 19th, till he could finish them two, and on this day Clark said, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060049"></xptr>should keep the double one for their game-keeper, and return the single one. On the 2d of October, I went to Robins's again, and made further enquiry about them. I saw Booth, he tried to satisfy me, but did not. They were at last apprehended.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker, who lives in Aldgate. On the 22d of September, Clark pledged a gun with me for thirteen guineas, in a case, quite new; he said he gave somewhere about 80 l. for it, but previous to that he had pawned another for 30 s., and redeemed it when he pawned this; it is a double barrelled one, and has Mr. Nock's name on it.</p>
               <p>MR. NOCK re-examined. The guns are mine, and those I sold them on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CLARK. Q. Have they ever been fired - A. Both have had the priming snapped, and the barrels may have had a little powder flashed in them just to spoil them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did we not say we were going a pigeon shooting that morning - A. I do not remember it. I believe it was half-past five o'clock when they left.</p>
               <p>EDMUND SIMKINS. I am employed in the Excise Office, and live at No. 24, Greenfield-street, Commercial-road. Clark took a lodging of me in July last. The other prisoner came backwards and forwards to visit him. Clark first introduced him to me by the name of 
               <persName id="t18201206-140-person1347">

            , and produced papers to me, purporting that he had business in hand as an agent. When he took the lodging; he referred me to Mr. Embden, No. 46, Old Bailey, and wrote a note to him, which he sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not material, he introduced Dawson by the name of Fisher - A. Yes, he said he had a deal of writing to do, and asked if I objected to his coming backwards and forwards to do it for him? I said No; I always called him Fisher, and knew him by no other name till some time in September there was a talk about recovering the estate of Miss Farrington, for a person named Farrington; I knew Miss Farrington, she had lived nearly opposite to me. The prisoner did not live there - the house was empty, and under repair, if they had lived there within the last nine or ten years, I must have known it. In September, Clark called Fisher by the name of Farrington; he told me not to be surprised if I saw Mr. Farrington walk into the house some day; he then called Fisher, Farrington; I said "Dear me, I always thought that this gentleman's name was Fisher?" Clark said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, nonsence! it is all right, we did that to blind the children and neighbours, we don't wish the other party to know Mr. Farrington is in London." Fisher had told me he lived in East-street, Commercial-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When this confusion of names took place, did Clark owe you any money - A. Yes, about 20 l. I had been very pressing with him; he paid me 10 s. a week for two rooms. On the 21st of September he paid me a 1 l. note, and promised me more the beginning of the week, or before if he could get it, he expected money for he had got bills to get discounted. He gave me a 10 l. note next day, and asked me to lend him 1 l., as he was going into Essex; he said I need not write him a receipt; I said then I would pay the small bills. He then shewed a duplicate, and said he had pledged two guns, one for himself, and the other for Farrington, on purpose that he should not disappoint me. I know both their hand-writings, the papers produced are some in the hand of Clark, and some in the hand of Dawson.</p>

               <p>DAWSON'S Defence. I admit living with Mr. Benjamin by the name of Dawson, but my real name was Farrington, and I think myself entitled to the property.</p>
               <p>CLARK's Defence. Mr. Farrington came to me, saying he wanted to trace his pedigree. I went with him to the church Miss Farrington was buried at, and found his statement correct about the property being left. He said he was born in Essex, I found his register there, believed him to be the heir at law, and took the necessary steps. I took him to a solicitor and advised with him - he said he thought him entitled to it. They issued distringuses on the stock, and took legal means to obtain the property, and try his right in a court of law. At this time we went to Mr. Nock's and obtained credit, but used no false pretences, as I really thought the property belonged to him. I told Nock to go himself to Robins, and get satisfied, and not let us have anything till he was satisfied.</p>

On Saturday night, the 3rd of April, I and my family went to bed a little after ten o'clock—my wife locked up the house before we went to bed—on the following morning I called up the servants between five and six—my niece, Maria Cumbers, came up to me, and made a communication to me, in consequence of which I got up, went down stairs, and found the pantry had been broken open, which was secured by iron bars inside, and wire outside the window—the wire was bent right up, and one of the ban was cut away with a chisel, and tied to the next—that would enable a per<lb></lb>son to get in—I had some pickled pork in the pantry—we missed a great deal, I cannot tell how much, but I am certain as much as fifteen stone—the ham was in the kitchen, and they had to force back two locks before they got at it—the ham had my initials, "H. G." on it—we also missed a leg of mutton, a coffee-biggin, a silver tea-spoon, a metal spoon, a metal mustard-pot, a pair of high shoes, a pair of ladies' boots, and two bladders of lard—I gave information to the police at Dagenham.</p>

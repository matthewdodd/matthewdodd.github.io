                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 30th of May, about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Garden-court, Hoxton-market, and as I was passing by a wall leading to the rear of the prosecutor's premises, I heard a sort of rumbling noise as if somebody was climbing the wall on the other side—I was about three yards from the wall, and there is a short corner in the court, where I lose sight of the wall—I re<lb></lb>turned to where the sound came from, and met Hasler—I did not know</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160051"></xptr>
               <p>him before—I said, "Halloo, where did you spring from?"—he said. "Why, down there," pointing down the court—I said, "Down where?"—he said, "From home"—I said, "Well, come and show me where you I live"—I took him about four yards down the court to where the corner is, and then saw Mack way jump over the wall from the other side into the court—there is no thoroughfare to the court—I called him, and said, I "Where did you come from?"—he said, "Oh, out of the privy"—I said, "What privy?"—he said, pointing to Hasler, "There, he knows"—Mackway then showed me a privy in the court, and said, "Out of I there"—that was on the court side of the wall, but he had come I over the wall—I said, "What did you do over that wall?"—he said, I "Oh, I don't know," in rather a careless manner—I then brought them up into Queen-street, at the end of the court, and got the assistance of two more constables to hold them while I went down to see what I was done—I then heard another person down the court—I went down, and met Twaites in the court, covered with soot—(Mackway had soot on his jacket and boots)—I said, "Well, and where did you come from?"—he said, "Down there, out of the privy"—there are two privies in the court—I asked him to show me the privy—he said, "That one," pointing to the same that Mackway did—I said, "Why it is impossible for you to have come out of there, I have only just looked into it"—he said, "Oh, but I got down the hole"—I looked at his clothes, and could not see any soil about him—there was soil in the privy—I then gave him over to the other two constables, and got on the wall, and saw two window sashes of the shed broken, and the frames—it was the sashes of two windows—there is no glass, but it is covered by canvas—the canvas over two windows was broken down, and the frame-work broken of both sashes—I saw a number of footmarks in the garden—it had been very wet that morning—the shed is detached from the dwelling-house—no one sleeps there—I traced them over the wall—I took them to the station, and found lucifer matohes on each of them, a box on one, and two parcels in the pockets of the other two—I took off their boots, and with Cripps, another constable, compared them with the marks in the garden—there were three different sizes—it was daylight—we found all the footmarks to fit—we called the people of the house up, then went into the yard, and found the kitchen window in the area wide open—it is a sash window—I found these three bobbins, one lying in the area, and two outside on the pavement, also this poker—this large nail, or <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, was on the back parlour window cill, but the poker had been dropped on the pavement—I compared it with that window which had been prised up—it was not broken open—it was forced about half an inch up on one side, where the mark of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was—they had endeavoured to raise it up—we went into the kitchen, and found a number of things strewed about, and the place all in confusion—I compared Mackway's boots with some marks. on the wood inside the, kitchen window cill—one of them was smothered with soot, and being wet, the impression was left—it exactly corresponded with where the naila were, and everything exactly—in the dust-bin I observed several marks which agreed with Twaites and Mackway's shoes—the marks were very plain indeed—I went into the shed, and there was some dirt there, apparently where one had eased himself, and footmarks as well of two persons—the shoes of Mackway and Twaites corresponded with those marks—there was a box which had been disturbed in the kitchen, and several bobbins strewed about the ground besides the three I have mentioned—I saw the</p>

               <p>marks of a sooty hand on the side of the area window, and in the shed there were marks of soot—the soot had come from the kitchen—then was a quantity of soot there, as if somebody had been up the chimney—Twaites was very sooty—there was soot on the hob of the kitchen, it if it was knocked down by a person getting up—there was a mark on the hob about the size of Mack way's boot, but we could not be certain of that—we traced them over the shed into the dust-bin, where they dropped from a wall, they would then be in Torrey's yard—they could get up to the shed by the assistance of the water-butt—after getting over the wall they raised the kitchen window, and got in there—nothing was broken about it—it had been lifted up, as if left unfastened.</p>

               <p>I was the last up—I fastened the house up all quite safe—next morning I found the kitchen window in the area open—I am certain it was shut down at night—I did not look up the kitchen chimney before I went to I bed, nor go to the fire-place—the fire had been out some time before I went to bed, about eight o'clock—it was daylight when I came down on being alarmed—I found the things disturbed in the kitchen, the bobbins and things, and some dirty linen—nothing was disturbed in the parlours—this poker was there—it belongs to my mother—this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> does not belong to us—I saw the bobbins in the area—they had been left in the kitchen when I went to bed—the rest were in the kitchen—they had I nearly all been taken out of the box, but no more than three were moved I out of the house—the box was not shut.</p>

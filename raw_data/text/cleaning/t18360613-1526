                  </hi>. I am a journeyman millwright, and live at Mr. Wheeler's, at Stanwell Moor Mill. On the 12th of May, about ten Minutes to one o'clock, I laid down in Stanwell-Moor-lane to rest myself, after I had had my dinner—I did not go to sleep—when I had been there a few minutes, the prisoner Wickington came up and drew my watch out of my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I am sure of it—I looked round, and saw him put it into his left-hand trowsers pocket—there was no one else present—I directly jumped up, and charged him with stealing my watch—he said he had not—he called out, and Osborn with two other young men, and four young women, came round us—I saw Wickington take the watch out of his left-hand trowsers pocket, and give it to Osborn—they directly all went off together—I followed them a little way, till one of the girls threatened me, and then I turned back to the mill—I did not know any of them before—I immediately gave information to the constable—we went to see for them, but could not find them—I went to the mill to work that night, and on the Friday night I had a description of the two prisoners—I went to one constable, but he was not at home—I got another constable, and we went to the Three Tuns, and from there to the little Anchor—I saw the two prisoners there together—I collared Wickington, and said, "You are the man I want."</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Thomas Wheeler, the miller. I was in that lane, and saw the prisoners go by me a little before the time that the prosecutor lost his watch, as I was gong to dinner—Wickington had a bundle under his arm, and had four girls with him—there was no other person with them, but Osborn came up with another man in a green jacket, who was smoking a short pipe—I know the prose<lb></lb>cutor had a silver watch.</p>

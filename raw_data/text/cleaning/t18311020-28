            . I am an officer. I was passing Bishopsgate-street, and saw a young man, a comapanion of the prisoner's, peeping round the corner, and saw the prosecutor struggling with the prisoner; I could see part of the chain hanging down in her hand - as soon as the young man round the corner saw me he ran away; I ran up, secured the prisoner, and saw her put the watch into Lloyd's waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor was quite in liquor; my sister came to the watch-house, and saw him - he could hardly stand. Witness. He was perfectly sober.</p>

I met him in Bishopsgate-street quite in liquor - I spoke to him, and we turned up Skinner-street; he asked where I lived, and said he would go home with me, but all in a moment he said, "Stop, I have lost my watch;" I said he had not lost it in my company - he said he had, and struck me, and it was I that called the watchman, who came up; I said he had charged me with robbery - he felt, and said his watch was in his pocket.</p>

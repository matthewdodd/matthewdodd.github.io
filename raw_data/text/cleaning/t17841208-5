               <p>Was it reduced to writing? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to induce him to confess? - Nothing at all, he confessed freely and honestly, and carried me to every place where he had sold the things, the shoes were found upon him and the cane; I recovered the boots, he carried me to the Jews where he had sold the plate, and we laid a very close siege to him, but never could catch him.</p>

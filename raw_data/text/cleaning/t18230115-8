On Friday, the 11th of October, I went out about seven o'clock in the morning, leaving only my son at home - I returned about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, but missed nothing till Sunday morning - I then missed two coats; one my son's, who is about seventeen years old - the other was mine. I gave 36 s. for my son's coat and trowsers, which were also gone. The articles stated in the indictment were all gone, which were safe on Thursday in the drawers in the back parlour. About a fortnight after I saw Moore, whom I knew by the name of Wells. A day or two after I saw Hurlock; he told me part of the property was pawned at Lowther's, in Tottenham Court-road; that he was present when they were sent to be pawned, and saw the ticket brought back - he did not say who pawned them.</p>

Moore went by the name of Wells; he opened his bundle, it contained a coat, two waistcoats, a pair of breeches, and a pair of yellow gloves. He desired me to pledge them at Lowther's, and to ask 2 l. on them - I pledged them for 14 s., in the name of Gibbons, as he desired me, and gave him the money. Hurlock gave his bundle to

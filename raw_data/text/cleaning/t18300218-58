On the morning of the 25th of January they were all right - I did not miss them till the officer came, and asked me if I had lost any; I have a great many fowls and turkies - I have ten turkies which were going about loose; I can speak to two of the turkies, from having their feathers cut - I cannot speak to the fowls.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had a great many fowls? A. Yes, fifty or sixty; they had no particular mark on them.</p>
               <p>JAMES JONES. I am a brass-founder, and live at Islington. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the 26th of January, I looked out of my window, and saw the two prisoners near a brick-kiln - I watched them, and when they were gone I went to see what they had put there; I found two fowls - I called the watchman, and told him of it; he and I watched, and in the afternoon we saw the prisoners coming across the fields - Adams had a bag over his shoulder; Crew went up to the brick-kiln, and took the fowls - the watchman took him with them; I followed Adams - he was taken to the watch-house, and the turkies were found in the bag; I do not know who they belong to.</p>

            . On the 26th of January the witness informed me he had taken two fowls from the brickkiln, one was half dead and the other quite dead - I said I would take them back again, and did so; we patroled the road till four o'clock in the afternoon, when these two lads came across from Highbury - Crew went down to a clump of bricks, and Adams went on; I saw Crew take the live fowl, kill it, and put it into his apron with the other dead one - he jumped over the ditch, I jumped over it too, and took him with the two fowls; I gave him to the witness, and I took Adams with the two turkies, which were both alive - I found this barley in the prisoners' pockets to entice the fowls; these are the turkies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are sure it was "to entice" - do you expect to belong to the new Police? A. No, I would not belong to it; I do not know the prosecutor - Adams told me he stole them from there; if I had had the fowls under my care I should have known them - one of them was blind with one eye.</p>
               <p>Adams. I told him I had to carry the turkies for a gentleman to Islington. Witness. He told me, when coming across the fields, that some gentleman in a white rough great coat had given him 9d., and part of a pot of beer to take them to Islington, but afterwards he said he brought them from Hornsey-wood house.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKENHEAD. I can swear to these turkies, but I did not know these fowls.</p>

               <p>Crew. This young gentleman said at the office that he could swear to one of the fowls. Witness. No I did not.</p>

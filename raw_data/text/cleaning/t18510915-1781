                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 10, Hambleton-street, Wands<lb></lb>worth-road; I work at Fulham. On Friday, 16th Aug., between 12 and 1 o'clock at night, I was in a street in Westminster, which I do not know the name of; I was going to my daughter's in Coburg-row, Westminster—I saw three women and two men; one of the women accosted me; I told her to go about her business—I had scarcely spoken a word before I was knocked senseless by the prisoner—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">the witness appeared to point to a gentleman standing near the dock, but afterwards went up and pointed to the prisoner</hi>)—I am certain he is the man; my eyes are very weak, through work<lb></lb>ing before a fire—as I fell, the woman made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch-guard; the guard was not broken, but the ring was torn off the watch—I received a blow in the face, and was completely saturated with blood; my face was shock<lb></lb>ingly</p>

               <p>disfigured—I saw the prisoner with the woman before he struck me, coming up to me; I had a good view of them—I came to myself and found a policeman with me—I missed two sovereigns and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, from my right-hand breeches pocket, and my watch; the chain and ring, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were left—I went towards the station with the constable, and saw the prisoner about a couple of hundred yards from the station, near the church in Rochester-row—I recognised him as the man, and told the constable—it was a beautiful moonlight night, and the prisoner looked me hard in the face before he struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman B</hi> 180). On the morning of 16th Aug. the prosecutor came to me; I went with him towards the station—on the way we met the prisoner with a constable, the prosecutor recognised him as the person immediately, and gave him in charge—the prisoner said he was not the man—we had walked about 200 yards before we met the prisoner—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose there were not many persons about at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we had not seen anybody till we met the prisoner—he was in custody of the other constable on suspicion of stealing a gold watch of a Frenchman; but they recognised him as not being the man, and he was then on his way back from the station—the other constable is not here—his name is Tucker, and his No. is 315—it was about half-past 1 o'clock when I found the prosecutor—I went with him directly towards the station—the constable told the inspector, in the prisoner's presence, that he had taken him into custody in Union-court, Orchard-street, and had come to the station with him directly—it would take about fifteen minutes to come from Union-court to the station; it may be three-quarters of a mile—I found the prosecutor in Tufton-street, that is about 300 yards further from the station than Orchard-street—we met the prisoner and the constable about 200 yards from the station—we had then come, I dare say, half a mile from where I found the prosecutor—Union-court is about 300 yards from Tufton-street.</p>

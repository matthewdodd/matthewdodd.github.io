               <p>Q. On your telling him, he must stop till your son returned, what passed - A. He said he did not see that I had any right to detain him if he had a forged note in his possession; I said that may be, but I shall do it now, until my son returns; if there is such a person lives there, it may be all right; he then said if I would go with him, (and mentioned some name, which I do not recollect) he would show me where he took the note; I said I should go no where with him yet; we remained about half a minute in silence; he then said, you shall not detain me, for I will go; I said he should not; he attempted to pass by me to go out, I collared him, but having so much glass about the shop, I did not like to have a scuffle, and he forced himself on the pavement in the street, I having hold of him all the while; he then began striking me as hard as he could in my face, with both hands, and I was obliged to let go to defend myself; I knocked him down in the kennel, and as he endeavoured to get up, I made a grasp to lay hold of him again; he got from under my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020056"></xptr>arm, and ran down Holborn; I pursued, calling out</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" as close as I could; he ran two or three hundred yards, before anybody offered to stop him. A watchman named Banning, who was near Chancery-lane, put his hand out to stop him, and threw him down; I came up, collared, and took him back to my house, and sent for a constable; just as I returned, my son came back, and said in his presence, that no such person lived in Eagle-street; I told him I knew that very well, for I had had a good proof of it - I gave him in charge. (looks at the note) This is it - it has my writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the scuffle hard - A. Yes, it drew blood from my chin, and tore my shirt and handkerchief.</p>

            . I am the master of the last witness. On the 5th of November, my nephew John brought this note to me (looks at it.) I came into the shop with it, and asked the prisoner to write his name and address on it. He wrote Mr. Boycer, No. 22, George-street, Adelphi. I asked him if that was his address? He said it was his master's, and that he came from his master for the cravat. I asked his name? He said it was

            . I am nephew to the last witness. I gave my uncle the note which Evans gave me, he desired me to go with the prisoner, to see if the address was correct. I had heard him give it as No. 22, George-street, Adelphi. I went a little way towards George-street with him. He desired me to go back, and said he would send Mr. Boycer, his master, to-morrow morning for the note. I went a little farther with him, and he said he would knock me down, if I did not go back, he then ran off. I pursued calling Stop thief! He got away.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, at the Bank of England, and have been so above twenty years (examining the note uttered to Mr. Hankes.) it is forged, the paper is not that used by the bank. The water-mark is put on after the paper is made, the Bank water-mark is made with the paper. It is not the Bank plate, the line with the date appears to be engraved, in a genuine note it stereotype. It purports to be signed C. Tabor. I have known him ever since I have been in the Bank, and believe it not to be his writing. I have no doubt of its being forged. (looks at that uttered to Eddels), it is forged in every respect like the other, and is not R. Clough's hand-writing, he did not sign small notes at this period. The notes are both off the same plate.</p>
               <p>Examined by a JUROR. Q. Are there any other means of knowing a forged note, besides those you have expressed - A. There is another particular in this note, the letters No, before the number, is engraved in the plate, which is not the case in a genuine note; there are no other means which I have of proving it to be forged to the jury, except from my general knowledge. It is forged from what I have stated, and from having seen a great many of these notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for other people besides the Bank, to use stereotype - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020057"></xptr>Q. You say in a genuine note the water-mark is made in the paper, have you ever seen it made - A. I have seen the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen a bank note made from the first process - A. I have seen the paper before and after it was impressed, and before it was filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not inspectors, and other clerks of the Bank, received forged notes, and paid them, being deceived by them - A. Yes; that has happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not also rejected genuine notes as forged - A. There was one instance of the kind in my recollection, and I am not positive as to another; it was a very old note, in a very mutilated state, with a quantity of paper pasted on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the Bank ever alter their plates - A. They have altered them several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When the paper is delivered out to the work people to be printed, is it counted out to them - A. I cannot tell, nor do I know whether the work people are searched after it is printed.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Are the two notes on Bank paper - A. No.</p>

            . I am a signing clerk at the Bank, and was so on the 12th of September, there is no other signing clerk of my name. I have been so five years (looks at the note,) this was never signed by me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is your signature so regular and uniform, that you can always know your own writing - A. Yes, I sometimes sign a thousand notes a day.</p>

                  </hi> I am pot-boy at the Prince's Head public-house, a Richmond. I had a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and a gold pin, on the 20th of Aug.—on Saturday night, at six o'clock, the window of my room was safe, and everything all close—on Sunday, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to get my clean things in my room up stairs, and saw the window was open, and one pane of glass was broken—I went into the room, and found my box was broken open—I looked into it, and found a sovereign and a half had been taken out, and a gold pin and two brooches—when I had done my business I went to look for a policeman, and told him what I had lost—I told him had suspicion of the prisoner—when I came back the prisoner was in the tap<lb></lb>room—the officer questioned him where he was the night before—he said he was at the Waterman's Arms till a quarter to eleven o'clock, and then he went to the Queen's Head, and was there from a quarter to eleven till a quarter is twelve on Saturday night, and while he was there he saw the pin offered for sale.</p>

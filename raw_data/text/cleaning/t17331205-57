            . Coming from beyond Temple-Bar, at Night, I enquir'd my Way to White-Friars-Stairs, a Man who had two Women with him, told me, I was past the Stairs, and must turn down such an Alley. I went as he directed, and he and the Women follow'd, and ask'd me to drink a Dram. I told them, I had no dram Money. He said I was welcome whether I had or no, for it should cost me nothing. He went into a House, he call'd for two Quaterns, paid a Shilling, and left us. The Prisoner then came up to me, and said, What do you call for? I told her I had no Money to spend. Sure, says she, you won't trouble the House for nothing? With much Importunity I gave her 6 d. she laid her Hand on my Thigh, and pull'd my Watch out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you charge the other Woman for this?</p>
               <p>Gallimore. The other Woman held me while the Prisoner got off, and therefore I charged the other Woman. I was beat and abus'd there, 'till my Face run down with Blood, and at the same time I lost my other Goods, which were in a Bundle. The Constable came, and I and the other Woman (Ann Castle) were sent to Woodstreet-Compter. The Prisoner came to me there in another Dress, and desir'd me to be easy ; I told her, perhaps I might, if I had my Goods again ; and in a little time they were all sent to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me, in Woodstreet-Compter, he did not know the Woman that robb'd him.</p>

            , Porter. A Man call'd to me, as I came out of my Master's House, in Milk Street, and, says he, Go over to Mr. Gallimore, at the Bull-Head, and give him this Parcel. And who must pay me? says I. Why, says he, the Gentleman will. I found Mr. Gallimore and the Constable there, and the Constable said, I'll be hang'd if here are not the Things; they open'd the Bundle, and there was a Watch and some Linen in it. I went from thence and saw the Man who sent me, going into the Compter - It seems, he's one of the Runners there - I ask'd him for my Money, but he deny'd that he sent me, and he is run away since.</p>

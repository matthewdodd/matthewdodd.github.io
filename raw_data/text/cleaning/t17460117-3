            . Four Pewter Plates, &amp;c. My Maid asked me if I knew any thing of the Company the Evening before. I answer'd I did, and that they belong'd to the Six Clerks-Office: So I went to one or two of them I knew: I asked, if they knew any thing of such and such Things I had lost; I told them we had had no other Company in the House that Evening but themselves; and they guessing at the Prisoner, one said, he knew the Place where he used to pledge Things; and at that Place we asked for such and such Plates, which the People produced directly, with mine and my Wife's Name upon them.</p>

               <p>Ward. At Mr. Singleton's, the Corner of Feather-stone Buildings, Holborn.</p>

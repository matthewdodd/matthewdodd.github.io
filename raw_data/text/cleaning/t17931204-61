               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him before he was taken? - I believe I might for a moment, but it was so instantaneously that I am sure of the man; he only ran across the road, but it does not take two steps to cross; a gentleman came from the Globe Tavern, and stopped him; the knife was taken from him by some one, not by me.</p>

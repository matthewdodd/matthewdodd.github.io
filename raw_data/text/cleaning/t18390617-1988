On the 19th of April my mother went out and left me at home—I went out between seven and eight o'clock in the morning—I locked the street door, and put the key in my pocket—the window was shut—my mother's box was just as it used to be—I returned at four o'clock in the afternoon—I found the window wide open, the flower-pots down on the ground, and the table away from the window where it had been—I got in at the window, and went up stairs, and saw the box open, and all the things about the room—the bed was pulled to pieces, my mother's bonnet-box down, and my father's hat-box—the prisoner was a stranger.</p>

I was on duty between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of April—I fell in with the prisoner in company with another sweep on the canal bridge—the prisoner had got the sack and the machine in his hand—they were standing near the bridge, I was going towards the Green Man public-house—I returned, and saw them on the other side of the way—I suspected there was something in the tack that was not soot, as they laid so light—they saw me, and went down Peckham-lane, walking at the rate of better than four miles an hour—I walked as fast as I could till they came to the canal bridge public-house—there I lost sight of them—I ran, and got sight of them again—they turned another street, and I lost sight of them—I again saw them—the prisoner was about to run, and I stopped him, and found this property in the sack which he dropped—I asked what he had got in it—he said, "Nothing"—I took him to the station-house—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.</p>

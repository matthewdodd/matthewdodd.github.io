                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 38). On the afternoon of 12th April I was on duty in plain clothes about Greenwich fair, and saw the two prisoners at the bottom of Church-street, where there was a crowd of people; a per<lb></lb>formance was going on—I saw Dridge place himself in front of a female, on the right side, and Martin, who had a coat on his left arm, went to her side—I then saw Martin's hand come from the female's dress with this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in it—I did not see the hand go in—Dridge then left a little way, and I saw Martin go to him, and give him the purse, and he put it into his right coat-pocket; they then separated—Dridge came across the road, and I pushed him into a public-house, and told him I wanted that purse in his pocket—I put my hand into his pocket, and took it out—I am quite sure this is the same purse—I told him he was charged with stealing it—he said he did not steal it; he picked it up—I told him he did not, but that he received it from another man—I asked him how much was in it—he said he did not know; he had that moment picked it up—I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I left him in custody, and went after the female and the other prisoner—I could not find the female; I found the other prisoner—I am quite sure he is the person who was in company with Dridge—he had then put the coat on—I told him he was charged with stealing a purse from a lady—he said he had not done so—I told him his companion was in custody—he said he had no com<lb></lb>panion—I asked him how much he had in his pocket—he said 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him that was a good deal more than 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said he had just changed a sovereign—I also found on him a silver watch and guard.</p>

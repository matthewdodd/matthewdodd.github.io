My sister was up-stairs; she came down in about ten minutes, and went to the work-table drawer, where the watch had been - he had sat so near the work-table, that he could put his hand into the drawer - directly she came down, she went to see what was o'clock, and the watch was gone - I had seen it in the drawer a quarter of an hour before; it was a gold watch, with a gold chain, a gold watch-hook, and gold key; they were all gone, and were worth about 30l. together - no other stranger had been in the house that day but him - I was speaking to the prisoner for about ten minutes; I am quite certain he is the man; I have seen him twice before - I should know the watch again - he was near enough to the table to hear the watch tick; because I have sat in the same seat, and could always hear it tick in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you called on me, to recognise me at the prison you looked round; there was not more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170055"></xptr>three or four men in the yard, and you could not discover the person. Witness. I immediately pointed the prisoner out to the gaol keeper, and to the sergeant of the police.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A gentleman came with her, and said,"That is the man." Witness. I had no gentleman with me at all; nobody pointed him out; I said, "That was him" - the sergeant was there; he did not point him out - there was a servant with me, but she had never seen him.</p>

            . I was servant to Mrs. Ebrington and Miss Crook, in May - I remember the person coming to look at the house; he came with a card - I showed him the parlours and the kitchens, and then took him into the drawing-room; he looked round, and the lady sent down word, that he must wait a few minutes before he could come up to see the bed-rooms; I asked him to sit down a few minutes in the drawing-room - I believe the prisoner to be the man, to the best of my knowledge; I have seen him twice before - I let him out afterwards; he was in a hurry to go out - there was no other stranger there until after the watch was missed; it has not been found - he was apprehended about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you were examined at first, was not I pointed out by a policeman? Witness. No; I said, if ever a person there was the man, that was him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Parnett Boll, a woollen-warehouseman, in St. Martin's-lane. The prisoner has been in the habit of making purchases for ready money as a tailor—I did not know his address—we do not take the addresses of persons who buy for ready money—on the afternoon of the 8th of May he came to our shop with this bank post bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wished to know if we could take it of him—I looked at it, and found it was drawn to the order of William Pennell, Esq., and specially indorsed by him in favour of John Croker Pennell—I said, "This bill, in its present state, is useless to anybody; it will be necessary for John Croker Pennell to put his name on the back of it before it can be taken"—he said, "Very well, I will get Mr. Pennell to do so"—he went away—he came at four o'clock next afternoon, and brought the same bill with him—he spoke to Dickens, the foreman—shortly after, this bill was sent to me by the cashier-it then bore the indorsement of John Croker Pennell, as it appears now—at that time I had no knowledge of this instrument having been lost—I did not receive any intimation till the Saturday after it was due—I then saw an ad<lb></lb>vertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, stating that this bill had been lost—it was paid by us into Smith and Payne's, and returned to us the same day—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what I found on the note, "Coles, 21, Great Smith-street," I went to that address on the Saturday afternoon—I could not find the prisoner there—I saw the person who I believe keeps the house—she said he had never lived there—I have not seen the woman here—in consequence of further in<lb></lb>formation, on Wednesday, the 17th of May, I accompanied the police-sergeant Weston to the Warwick Arms, at the corner of Gillingham-street, Pimlico—I went with the constable into the parlour—I saw several people there, and, among others, a person I believed at first sight to be Coles; but at the time I went into the room he was sitting with his back to me—he put his hand over his face, and remained so for a quarter of an hour—I could not catch sight of his face, and was not positive of him—alter that he put both his hands over his face, and remained so equally long—from a conversation going on in the room he was caused to laugh, and in doing so he raised his face from his hands, and immediately he did that I recognized him—I told the officer that was him—Weston left the room and went into the passage of the house—im<lb></lb>mediately he left the room the prisoner got up from the table, and appeared to be doing the same—I immediately rose up, opened the door, and got out before him—when in the passage I said, "Mr. Coles"—he made no answer—I said, "Your name is Mr. Coles"—he said, "No, it is not," and he pushed by into the street—it was raining very fast at the time—he appeared as though he wished to make off—I told the officer he was the man—he said, "Are you positive it is him?"—I said, "I am"—he said to him, "We want you respecting a bill you passed to Messrs. Bull and Wilson for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with a forged indorsement"—he said, "I know nothing about the bill"—I said, "It is no use saying you know nothing about it, because I am the person to whom you spoke at the time"—he immediately said with a great deal of surprise, "Oh, are you the person?"—I said, "Oh, then, you do know something about the bil"—the policeman said, "Well, then, it has a forged indorsement of John Croker Pennell attached to it"—he said, "I know nothing about it; I saw Mr. Pennell put his name on the back of it."</p>

"No"—I said, "Do you know where he lives?"—she said, "No"—I said, "I am sur<lb></lb>prised at that, because this is the address Mr. Coles has given as being his; did he ever live here?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Do you know him?"—she said, "Yes, I know him, and he has occasionally slept here with my bro<lb></lb>ther"—I said, "I wish to see him on particular business; can you tell me where I can find him, any house he is working at, or any person in whose employ he is?" and she could not tell me.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of Nov., about six o'clock in the evening, I had two old 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and three other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which I had received from Mr. Frazer, the cashier at Messrs. Childs', on the 29th of Oct., a few sovereigns and some id. pieces—I put them in the drawer of my writing-desk, which was in my study—it was all safe at six o'clock in the evening—I locked it up with a Bramah key—I missed it on Monday—Jessop had been a servant in my house—I turned him off in Aug.—I had put the Bramah key into my shaving case, where it used to be kept—Jessop knew it was kept there—on Sunday, the 2nd of Nov., I was going to church at a quarter before eleven o'clock, and saw Jessop coming up a corner as if he were going to my house—he had not on his working dress—to the best of my belief I do not think anybody else in my house knew where the key was beside Jessop—I never took any money out in presence of any of my servants—on the 4th of Nov. I met Jessop coming from the train, and taxed him with having been in my house—he said he had spoken to the kitchen-maid outside the door.</p>

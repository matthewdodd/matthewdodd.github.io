               <p>9 o'clock, or a quarter to 10; I saw the two prisoners carrying the prosecutor, or rather dragging him along—one was on each side of him—one had hold of each arm, and directly they got opposite my door, they threw him down on his head—the prisoner Atkinson snatched his watch from his pocket, and they both instantly ran off; I ran after them—they both ran in the same direction—I followed Atkinson for about 150 yards, the constable took him—I pointed him out to the constable, and told the constable that he had knocked a man down and robbed him of his watch—I said that in Atkinson's presence—I saw no more of Goddard that night—I went back to the man whom I had seen knocked down—I had not known the prosecutor before—he was rather the worse for liquor—he was not on the ground when I went back, he was when I left him; but when I went back, some one had picked him up—I observed his watch guard was hanging about him.</p>

               <p>WATERS PONEY, junr. sworn. - I am the son of Waters Poney: We lost some lead from a house in <placeName id="t18030420-11-crimeloc55">Gloucester-place, Marybone</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was this house covered in? - A. Yes, it has been covered in about six weeks; the doors and windows were fast at one o'clock that day; when I had secured the prisoner, I went up stairs and found the lead cut from the gutter, and rolled up, it was removed about eighteen inches, it weighed about twenty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner employed about the building? - A. No, I don't recollect ever to have seen him before; I shall know it again when it is produced.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOPER sworn. - I am a carpenter; I saw the prisoner cutting the lead, and rolling it up; my master was coming by, and ordered him to come down; I went up, and found the knife stuck in the cut of the lead, (produces it;) we found some nails in his pocket, which correspond with the lead. (Produces the nails and the lead.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man employed me the day before to come there to a job, and I went accordingly, and not finding the man, I went to the top of the house to look for him, and while I was there, this gentleman came by.</p>

On the 10th of July the prisoner came between five and six o'clock in the evening, and looked at seven volumes of Law Reports, which were in my window; he said he had a brother in the law, who he was pretty certain would be glad to buy them, if I would send them to an office he had in Leadenhall-street - I thought he was on no good, and wanted to get rid of him; he said if they were sent that evening, and I would call the next morning, he would settle for them - I then went out, and did not return till eight o'clock; my shop was then shut up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the boy to dust them? A. No; you remarked that they were dirty, and I said the boys could easily clean them - they might be put on one side for the purpose of being dusted - these are the books, and here is another book which I know nothing of.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wilks. The prisoner came after Mr. Wilks was gone out, and said he was waiting for me to take the books down to his chambers in Leadenhall-street - I was not present at his interview with Mr. Wilks; I then went with him, and left the books at No. 25, in the East India chambers - he opened the chamber with a key, and opened a desk which he said he meant to put the books into; I did not return to my employer till the next morning, when he desired me to go anddemand the books: back - I went, and waited till the prisoner came; I said I came for the books to save me from any further noise - he said it was a fair bargain betwen Mr. Wilks and him, and his brother could not come to town that day; I went across the way, and saw the prisoner come out and go to Mr. Higham's - when he came out, I went there, and asked if he had come to sell or to buy books, and the books were on the counter; I told them to detain him if he came again.</p>

            . My father is a bookseller, and lives at No. 54, Chiswell-street. On the 11th of July the prisoner came there, about nine o'clock in the morning, with a porter, and brought these books, which are Dowling's Reports; he wanted 4l. for them - my father said he would not give that, as one of them was spoilt with ink; he then said he would take 50s. - my father said he would not have them till they were looked over, and he was desired to call at two o'clock; he said he could not call till four - he requested to have a few shillings, and we let him have 3s.; the witness then came in, and gave us information - the prisoner came at twelve o'clock, and we told him they were so much damaged he had better take them away, and return the few shillings; he said he had more to sell, and he would bring them - Mr. Wood came in, and he was detained.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Henry Locock, of Myddleton-square. Mr. Brown was our chimney-sweeper—on the 10th of June, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—they had then finished sweeping the chimney as far as they could—they said they were too large to get up—they wanted to no away and get a little boy, but we missed a purse, and some money, which had been in the dresser-drawer, in the kitchen?—I had seen it secure the even<lb></lb>ing before—it was then clean, and no one been in the house but me and the servants—we had been absent from the kitchen, and when we returned the purse was gone—the prisoners then wanted to go away—they went into the hall to go—I said, I was sure they had robbed me of the money—I locked the door, and sent the housemaid up to tell my master—I stood in the hall—Thomas then went down and said he would go and sweep the soot up—he was down for some time—I saw the purse after it was found—they said, they came from Mr. Brown—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi>, I am in the service of Mr. Locock. At a quarter-past five o'clock the prisoners came to the area gate, and rang the bell—they walked down into the front kitchen—I went into the back kitchen and left them thee—I went into the kitchen again, and came out again, and then Sarah Nicholls told me to go and look for the, money—it was not there, nor the purse—I said they must have got the money—they denied know<lb></lb>ing any thing about it—I asked if they came from Mr. Brown—they said, yes they did—they said, they were too big, they would go and fetch a little boy—I said they should not go—I went and told my master—he came down soon after—the purse was at last found by the nurse under the plate<lb></lb>basket, under the dresser, all over soot.</p>

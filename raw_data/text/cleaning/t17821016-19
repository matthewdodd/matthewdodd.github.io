               <p>I live in St. James's-street; on the 14th of September, a little before seven, as I was going down Little St. James's-street, near the end, three men rushed by me, one of them asked me what it was o'clock; I crossed the way, and as I crossed, I heard a carriage pass me, and I looked round to see if I was clear of it, and I knew it to be the Colonel's, by the horses, they are particular horses; and I saw the prisoner with three fellows, behind the chaise; the footman was on horseback; they rushed by me, and run up the street: I suspected their intention was to cut what was behind the chaise; I was determined to see the event. I wondered the servant had not trod on them, they got between the servant and the phaeton. By this time, the chaise was facing my own house; I run very fast, and came up with the hindermost of the three. The chaise turned into Dover-street, and I run so fast that I came up with the chaise, then the prisoner and the other men fetched a pull, and down came the trunk; when the trunk was down, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160035"></xptr> prisoner took up one end, and the other men took up the other, it was very dark, they got it up; it was down in a moment: they carried the trunk along Stafford-street, in the middle of the street I perceived a light, and I jumped in between them, says I, put this trunk down, they all three said blast your eyes; the prisoner struck the trunk against my legs; I was so hesitated I jumped back, and called, Thieves! then they all three dropped this trunk, and run away; the prisoner was hindermost; he was taken. I am sure he is the man.</p>

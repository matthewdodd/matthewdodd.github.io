                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. John Hutley, a wholesale cheese<lb></lb>monger, in Broad-street, St. Giles's. I put out a cask of pork from half-past six to seven o'clock on the 16th of Jan.—I saw it safe about seven, and a little after eight it was missing—the pork was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the cask 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—this is the cask—here is my master's mark on the head of it</p>

I was on duty in High-street on the 16th of Jan., just before eight o'clock, nearly opposite the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's shop—I saw the prisoner Collins and another man go to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop, roll away a cask, and take it to the comer of George-street—they then went and spoke to Williams, who was walking up and down in sight of the prosecutor's shop—I am sure he was in sight of it when Collins and the other man were rolling the cask away—he did not touch it, but they left it and went and spoke to Williams—he walked to the shop, looked in, and then came to them again—then they commenced rolling it away—when they got to George-street, I saw a truck—Collins had hold of the bottom of the cask in the truck, and the other man had hold of the handle to pull it down—they then saw me—the other man ran away, and I caught hold of Collins, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said he did not know—I expect Williams was at that time against the shop.</p>

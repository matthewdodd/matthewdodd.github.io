            . (Produced the guts of a watch.) On the 13th of July last, this woman at the bar and another, came to my shop and produced this guts of a watch; the prisoner offered it and asked a crown for it. She said she found it in the Strand I saw it had been very ill used; I sent for a constable and carried them before the sitting alderman; they were sent back four different times, and at the fourth time the prisoner made a confession that she had offered the silver part of it to Mr. Douson on Holborn-hill; we went there and found the cases, they answered to the movement; then she acknowledged she stole the watch out of the prosecutor's house, and beg'd for mercy; after she was committed I advertised it, and by that means the prosecutor found me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this movement yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my property.</p>

            . ( Produces a pair of cases.) Here is all the silver that belongs to the watch, except the rim that holds the glass, and the dial-plate; this woman came to our shop on the 13th of July, and asked me if I would buy them, she said she found them at the end of Leather-lane, Holborn; she asked the value of them, I saw they were bruised. I suspected she did not come honestly by them, so I stoped them. She said she would call again, and did, but I was not at home; so I never saw her after till she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these silver cases ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the cases belonging to my watch that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you see a person waiting for me at the end of Shoe-lane?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did see a person there, but I did not suspect any body when she offered it me, but afterwards I recollected I saw a person there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had it of a young woman, and did not know that it was stole.</p>

               <p>Clark's Defence. I went with Rawlins to the prosecutor's shop to purchase two yards of cotton at a shilling a yard, and six yards of print at two shillings and two pence per yard, for which we left two shillings for a deposit; we were going away, and we asked the shop boy if it was all right; he said stop, I must go up stairs and make the necessary memorandum; the boy returned; we went away, and got half a mile, when the boy came up to us and desired us to come back; the prosecutor stood at the door; the prosecutor charged me with taking a green print from under my apron, he said it was there before I went away; he said upon my return I put it down upon the counter; I deny it positively, I might as I passed touch such a print, but not to my knowledge. I get my living by shoe binding.</p>
               <p>Rawlins' Defence. I am young and pregnant; I am a married woman; I was never accused of a criminality before.</p>

I lost a piece of pork from my window last Saturday, at half-past seven o'clock in the morning; the tray in which it stood was full two feet from the window - a girl who was lighting the fire said some person had taken a dish of pork; I ran out and saw the prisoner carrying it up Seward-street; I followed him - he saw me, threw it down; and ran off; I called Stop thief! several persons came up, and met him - he turned back, and I took him; my little boy was close after me, and he took the pork up- when I brought the prisoner back, he offered to pay for the dish.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BURFORT. I saw the prisoner come into Seward-street, with the pork, and a ticket on it; I saw him throw it down, and the prosecutor took him.</p>

            . My husband's name is Peter. About the 8th or 9th of March last the prisoner came to my shop, and desired I would send some hats to her mistress. I ask'd her who her mistress was; she did not tell me her name, but said I might send a servant with them, which I did.</p>

We went into that neighbourhood and inquired if there was such a person, describing her, and some people took her some time after and sent for us. We went and took her before justice St. Lawrance, where we charg'd her with taking the hats; she own'd she did take and pawn them at three different pawnbrokers, and by her direction we went and found them, here they be (producing them.)</p>

When we came to the door the prisoner ask'd me for the hats, and said she'd go and shew them to her mistress. I let her have them. She went up stairs and came down again, and desired I'd walk up one pair of stairs, and she would go and get a light. I went up.</p>

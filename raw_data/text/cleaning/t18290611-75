            . I am a footman, and was at that time out of place - I spent the evening with Nowland, at a friend of his; Connor was one of the girls we met, but I cannot swear to Griffen - we went home with them; I was not drunk - I went to bed first, and Nowland came after me; there was only one bed in the room; we went home with the girls because we were both locked out - I awoke in the morning and got up; I found the doorajar - Connor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110035"></xptr>and the other girl were in the room when we went to bed; it was a front room on the ground floor - we did not particularly ask them to go to bed; I saw no other persons in the house - I lost my waistcoat and trousers; my coat and my boots were left - I know nothing of the other prisoners,</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COLE. I am a constable. I heard of this on the Sunday evening, from the prosecutors; they gave a description of Connor and Griffen as being the girls who had robbed them - I met Connor, Griffen, and Cooke together on the Monday morning, about half-past ten o'clock; I looked at them and passed them once or twice - I went to get assistance of one of our two constables, but they were not at home; I then called a young man to assist me - I saw one handkerchief on Griffen's neck, and one on Connor's; I did not say what I wanted them for, but said I wanted to speak to them, and took them to the watch-house; I sent for the prosecutors - while they were in the watch-house I saw something go down the steps; I picked it up, and it was this black handkerchief with this gold pin wrapped up in a bit of paper - I do not know from whose hand it came, but to the best of my belief it was from Cooke's; as I came back I found some pieces of black handkerchief on Cooke, all torn to pieces - they appeared the same as this; I found 18s. 8d. in Cooke's pocket - I then had the females searched by Mrs. Furzeman; this handkerchief was taken from Griffen; the one which I had seen on Connor had disappeared; I asked Connor where she lived; she said at No. 12, King-street, Drury-lane - I went there with Nicholas, but they denied all knowledge of her - I then asked Conroy, (whom I found there with a person, who I believe was her husband,) if they had any objection to my searching the place; they said No - I found a pair of gloves in a hat-box, in Conroy's room, and a latch key on the top of a cupboard, close to the ceiling; Conroy said that she had found that key in the coals that morning, and the gloves she said were her own, then she said they were her husband's, but he denied it; we said, if they were not right we would bring them back again - we went to the office and shewed them to Nowland, who identified them; we then went back and brought Conroy and the key - Nowland said he could not identify the key, but it was like one he lost; Conner told me at the office that the coat and other things were taken from Conroy's lodging that morning - I found this bag and black thread on Cooke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Conroy told you she had a husband? A. Yes; she told me it was her husband.</p>
               <p>MORRIS NICHOLAS. I am beadle of St. Giles'. I went with Cole; we found this pair of gloves - Nowland identified them; I searched Connor, and found this handkerchief tied round her thigh.</p>
               <p>JOHN NOWLAND. These handkerchiefs are both mine, and are what I lost; this gold pin is mine, I have had it these four years - these gloves are mine, and this key to the best of my opinion; I know nothing of the black handkerchief - I lost some black thread.</p>
               <p>CONNOR's Defence. I met the prosecutors in James-street, Covent-garden; they took me to have something to drink; and then they asked me to go home with them - I asked

             to let me go to her room; she did, and we went there - Nowland said he had but a half-crown and that spotted handkerchief, which he gave me - before I went to bed he asked me to go and get an ounce of snuff; I went out and met Griffen; she said she had had nothing to eat all day, and I spent the half-crown with her.</p>
               <p>COOKE's Defence. I met Griffen and Connor in Hatton-garden, and they asked me to give them something to drink - I was going to do it, and the officer took me -Griffen gave me the black handkerchief.</p>
               <p>GRIFFEN's Defence. I met Connor, and she lent me the red handkerchief, the pin was stuck at the corner of it - she said it belonged to the person she was sleeping with; I was tucking it down my bosom.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Wigmore-street, Marylebone. I knew the prisoner, as being porter to Mr. Freeman, the wax-chandler—on Saturday, the 17th of September, he came to my shop produced a cheque to me for £8 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said Mr. Freeman would be obliged by my cashing the cheque—I remarked that is was not Mr. Freeman's hand-writing—he replied without hesitation that it was his son's—I was not acquainted with the son's writing—I knew Mr. Freeman had a son—I cashed it—I gave the prisoner eight sovereigns and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—this is the cheque—I paid it away—the same evening to the trade, of the name of Randall.</p>

This cheque is not my writing, nor my son's nor was it written by any body by my authority—the prisoner had lived in my service for three years as errand-boy—he left me ten months before this occurrence—he never wrote cheques for me—he had been in the habit of seeing my cheques so as to know my writing—I have given him cheques to pay bills—this cheque is drawn, "Pay to house"—that was the way I used to draw for house expenses—it is drawn on Herries and Farquhar, who are my bankers.</p>

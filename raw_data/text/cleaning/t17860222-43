I remember delivering some goods in our way of trade, the things mentioned in the indictment; they were to go to Broad-street, beyond the Royal Exchange, part of them there, and part of them to another place. My man came home, and gave me an account that he had lost them. On the next evening, I went out with Lucy and the porters in order to apprehend the man.</p>
               <p>- HERITAGE sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of January, I was to carry some goods, and I pitched my load in Bull's-head-court, Newgate-street; the prisoner at the bar was standing there: I asked him to give me a turn round; he helped me with it on my head, and he followed me into Cheapside; he said I was very heavy loaded, and he had just been giving his partner a lift, who was troubled with a shortness of breath. He asked me where I was going to, I said I was going to Broad-street; he had a knot on his shoulder, and had the appearance of a porter; I said, I have only a penny, and that I will give you for a glass of gin, to give me a lift; he said, No, I do not mind your penny, I do not mind giving a brother porter a lift; then he asked me if I could give it a shove on his head, and a lusty man lifted it off my head on his head; and going between Foster-lane and Gutter-lane, on that side <placeName id="t17860222-43-crimeloc238">Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Who was hallooing out? - I suppose eight or ten gentlemen on the off side of the way; he came up soon afterwards, and said, what, are not you got any further? No, says I, and he asked me where I brought it from? I told him out of Leadenhall-street, and was going into Saint John's-street, and I took it down Giltspur-street, and this same gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220087"></xptr> met us, and slipped down again, and he offered me threepence-halfpenny, and wiped his hands again; I told him I must not stop to take the money, and I followed the prisoner; he turned short into the hospital; the gentleman told me he was gone on straight forwards; I turned short, and when I came to turn to speak to him, says I, you are going, my cock, the wrong way; yes, says he, I forgot myself, I should have gone straight across Smithfield; then he brought it, and pitched it by Hosier-lane, and said; you take it a little way; I took it up, and he was off in a minute. I am sure the prisoner is the person. I went out again on the 26th with Mr. Lucy and young Mr. Cowland, and I saw the prisoner passing by St. Sepulchre's church, and I told the constable to meet me at Fleet-market, and we took him in Fleet-market; and before the magistrate he said his name was

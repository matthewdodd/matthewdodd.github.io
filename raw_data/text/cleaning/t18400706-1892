                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer. On the 2nd of June I was at the Marquis of Anglesea public-house, at the corner of William-street, Marylebone. I went in between four and five o'clock to take a pint of porter—I entered into conversation, and soon after J put my hand into my pocket, and missed two handkerchiefs—I made it known that I had been robbed, but by whom I did not know—my handkerchiefs are lost altogether.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant out of place. I was at the Marquis of Anglesea public-house talking with the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner come in at the side-door, and take a handkerchief out of the prose<lb></lb>cutor's pocket—I only saw him take one handkerchief—he winked at me, and smiled at the same time—the conviction on my mind was, that it was a joke, because the room was full of people—no one noticed him, but myself—he went out again immediately.</p>

I keep a cheesemonger's shop, opposite the public-house—I do not remember the day, but about a month back I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner come out of the public-house with two handkerchiefs in his hand, and he was trying to put them into his pocket—he ran down the street, and as he ran they both fell out down the lining of his pocket—I called to him—he came back, picked them up, and ran away again—I am sure he is the person—I went over and spoke of it, and the prosecutor said he had lost his handkerchiefs.</p>

On the 21st of June, I was superin<lb></lb>tendant of the Marine Society's ship, the <hi rend="italic">lphigena</hi>—it was <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> in the river Thames, off Greenwich—the prisoner was admitted on board the vessel on the 31st of March, by the Committee in London—after he had been on board the vessel about a month, I selected him as my servant—he was sent on shore every morning in the breakfast boat, at half-past seven o'clock, to get spring water—he went on shore on the 21st of June for that purpose, and did not return to the ship—I returned to the ship at half-past eleven o'clock—I had been absent during the night—on my return, I was informed of the prisoner's absence—I went into my bed cabin to put on my uniform coat, and I observed a screw driver on a chair near a chest of drawers—when I left they contained a cash-box—I unlocked the drawer, and found my cash-box broken open—the drawer was locked—I missed about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that box—about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, a few shillings in silver, and a new fourpenny piece—there was a £10 note in the cash-box, which was not taken, and there was some railway shares left in it—a lady's dressing-case was on the table—my wife opened that in my presence, and missed about nine sovereigns from it, seven or eight half-crowns, a gold-chain, a silver pencil-case, a brooch, and several articles—four silk handkerchiefs were taken from the chest of drawers—I heard of the prisoner the same night, but it was a month after<lb></lb>wards before he was apprehended—on the 24th of July he was brought in custody by a constable—I have since seen the gold chain, a shirt-pin, the garnet drop, and two silk handkerchiefs, which have been pledged—I did not recover any money—the prisoner was brought on board the ship on the 24th of confined on board the vessel one night, taken before the Magistrate next day, and ordered to brought up next day—the witness Ward was taken up, and after some circumstances disclosed by her before the magistrate, he admitted her as a witness.</p>

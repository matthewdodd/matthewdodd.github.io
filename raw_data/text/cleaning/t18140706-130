               <p>GEORGE WAKEMAN. I am a carrier. On Wednesday morning. I was alarmed by my watchman, stating, that a man was taken to Marybone watch-house with a chest of tea. I went to the watch-house, and saw the chest there. That is the identical chest. The waggoner delivered the way-bill to me; he is here.</p>

            . I am the waggoner. I received the way-bill of Isaac Boden, the bookkeeper of the Castle and Falcon inn, Aldersgate-street. When I receive the way-bill. I receive the waggon, and all the goods in the waggon. I carry them to my master's wharf, and there I put them.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you carry this to the wharf - A. Tuesday night. I found out the deficiency on Wednesday morning. I discovered, about half after six, a gap in the waggon.</p>
               <p>ISAAC BODEN. I made out the way-bill myself I saw the goods loaded in the waggon. I am able to say that every article in the way-bill was put into the waggon, and was delivered to Plomer. I knew this box was tea. I am sure this article was put in the waggon.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOND. I am a hackney coachman. On the 5th of July, the prisoner came up to me about half after nine at night, and said he wanted a coach to go to St. Luke's. I told him to get on the box to shew me the place. In going along, I said, what part of St. Luke's; he said, the City-road; I said, the fare is five shillings and sixpence; he said he had but half-a-crown in his pocket. He jumped off the box, went into a place where they had laid a foundation for some new houses, and brought up a chest that laid in this place. I then said to him, I do not think it is any good; I shall not like to carry it. I turned the coach about. It gave me suspicion that he had not come honestly by it. A dog was barking at the prisoner. He put the chest down; he was sitting upon it. I said to a boy, go and get a watchman. One of the boys got a watchman. Before the watchman came, the prisoner took the chest on his back, and ran across Montague-square. I ran after him, and cried stop thief. A gentleman knocked him down. I am positive the prisoner is the man who first hired me for the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wakeman. Does that chest correspond in all respects with the chest that came in the waggon - A. Yes.</p>

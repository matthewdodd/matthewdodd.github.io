I then ran out into the street, found the prisoner Levingston; I broke the cord in a moment, I found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Nichols, I never knew the prisoner before, he was then struggling very hard to get away; I found the hose very near the prisoner, eleven pair of stockings; I picked up the stockings and ran to the constable Hatch, and he came and took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I had never seen the prisoner before that evening; passing very near the prisoner I heard a noise of breaking the glass, I directed my attention towards where the noise came, I saw the prisoner running with a parcel, I called out stop thief, least with the speed he was running, he might escape me, on which he dropped the bundle; and before any assistance came, I secured him, and held him till Mr. Fellows came. He was never out of my sight, nor ten yards from me, I took him instantaneously, and held him, and never let him go till he was in the care of the constable; the stockings are in court.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you eleven pair of stockings all in one bundle? - Just as they are now, they were intended to shew, all tied up together.</p>

I had been with a letter to the top of Charles-street, Tottenham Court Road, coming home I saw several people run pass me, stop thief was called out, and this gentleman took me up in his arms, and said to me stop, or I'll dash your brains out; I had no stockings, no bundle at all; I was going back again after I had been with the letter.</p>
               <p>Court to Fellows. Had you seen these stockings in the window that day? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150067"></xptr>had, they were in the form of a bundle when I took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pane of glass of sufficient magnitude to have these bundles taken out of your shop? - Yes, it was a large square of glass.</p>

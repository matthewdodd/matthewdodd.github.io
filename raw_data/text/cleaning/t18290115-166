            . On Friday, the 9th of January, I met the prisoner, with a saddle and mud-boots on his head, about five o'clock in the afternoon, in Duck-lane, Westminster; I asked him where he got them; he said from a gentleman's horse in Regent-street - he wanted to leave it at Mrs. Palmer's, but she would not let him, and he took it away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you ever been in trouble? A. Never; I was never here, or under any charge - I am a cutler; the prisoner asked me to give him a night's lodgings, which I did.</p>

            . I am the patient the prosecutor came to visit. I saw this boy in the afternoon, between three and four o'clock, and took particular notice of him; I saw him about four o'clock, as near as I can recollect, and I am quite sure he is the boy who took the prosecutor's horse - he crossed the road, and took it; I am certain of him - it was not dark.</p>

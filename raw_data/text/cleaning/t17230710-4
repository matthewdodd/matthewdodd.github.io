               <p>It appeared by the Evidence, That the Prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172307100002"></xptr> having lost Pots, and Search being made for Run-goods, a Hamper of Pewter Pots was found in a Cellar where the Prisoner had desired Mrs. Spicer, who was her Friend, to set them, under Pretence it was Pewter that she was willing to preserve, her Husband being an ill Husband. There were several Pots of the Prosecutor's found in the Hamper. There were also many other Pots found, some in a Dung-hill, some in the House of Office, some in a Hole in the Chimney, and in other Places, to the Number of about 50 in all. The Prisoner pleaded that she knew nothing of the Pots of the Prosecutor, or any others, but some that were her own, which was in the Hamper; she having before kept a Cook's-shop. That as to the Pots found in the Vault, it was a publick Vault that any Body might go to. The Jury found her <rs id="t17230710-4-verdict20" type="verdictDescription">

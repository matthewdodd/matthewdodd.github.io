                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Pearce, and live in Dunstan-street, Stepney. I made the bed on the 18th of April, and left the front room about eight o'clock—these articles now produced were then safe—I went into the kitchen about a quarter-past eight, and then went outside to close the shutters—the window was partly up, and the bed things were taken off the bed—when I left they were all on the bed, and the window closed—these things are all my husband's—it is our dwelling-house; we live and sleep there.</p>

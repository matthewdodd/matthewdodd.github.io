From his great dexterity he must have been, I think, an old practitioner. He took to his heels and ran away - I immediately followed him and cried Stop thief - I kept sight of him for some time - at that moment a witness, who was standing opposite to Mr. Shepherd's glass-house, pursued him, and another witness, who was a little forward, joined in the pursuit, and he was taken in about two minutes. A constable, who happened to be in the street, stopped him, and he was taken to St. Martin's watch-house, but the watch has not been found. From the general appearance of the prisoner and from one or other of us not losing sight of him, I think he is the man. I had lost sight of him for a few moments while he was turning the corners. It was a metal watch with a gold seal, and had cost me about 9 l.</p>

            . I am an engraver, and live in Oxenden-street. I was in Pall-mall and heard the cry of Stop thief - I saw the prisoner turn the corner pursued by some persons. I also pursued, but lost sight of him for a few moments while he turned round Pall-mall East. I am sure he is the same person - he had got into St. Martin's-street before he was stopped; I did not see his face but from his general appearance I have no doubt of him.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Compton-street, Soho. I was in Whitcomb-street, and heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner was then running, pursued by other persons - there was no one before him; I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130010"></xptr>lose sight of him till I caught him in St. Martin's-street - he asked what I was going to do with him - I said he had stolen something, but I did not know what. The officer then came up and took him. Mr. Cox came up and charged him with stealing his watch - he said he was innocent; but run because he saw other persons run.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming home from Westminster - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and a man came and took hold of me - he said there was something stolen, but he could not stop with me as he had left some fruit - then the witness came and took hold of me.</p>

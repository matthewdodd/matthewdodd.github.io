The prisoner came in with another person, on the 17th of November; they asked for a small piece of flannel - I did not serve them, but saw them served; when they were going out I said I was sure that person had something; they had been there about ten minutes, and bought a small piece of flannel and a piece of calico, which came to about 3s. - I pursued, and overtook them about five doors off; I told the prisoner she had something - I brought her back, with the assistance of Mr. Champman, and took this property out of her apron; it was seventy-four yards of calico, three pieces, of different patterns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How do you know it? A. The mark of our foreman is on it - it had been laying on the counter; there were other goods marked in the same way - I had seen these not a minute before they were taken; we had no other goods of this pattern; they were in the prisoner's apron - the person who was with her had a child: I do not know who took them out; I suspected the prisoner, because she appeared so much more bulky when she went out than when she came in - she was rather intoxicated; I have seen her at the shop before.</p>

I was at a crockery-stall bargaining for a teapot—I had 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, in a purse, which was tied up in a white handkerchief—directly I left the stall I missed them—I saw Green standing next to me at the stall; and I think there were two more boys, and I saw the prisoner (to the best of my belief he is the same man), about two yards behind me—I was not quite sure of him when I first saw him afterwards, on account of his having whiskers (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner had none</hi>)—the prisoner resembles the man very much in height and size.</p>

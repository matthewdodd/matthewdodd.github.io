                  </hi>, R.N. I live at No. 46, Devonshire-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone; Bracey had been in my service, as footman, for three months before this occurred; he had the care of my plate, and had access to my wearing-apparel and property. I was aroused on Thursday morning, the 17th of April, about seven o'clock—I went dowa stairs to the lower part of the house, found the plate-chest open, the trays lying about, and the plate gone—I missed the plate stated in the indict<lb></lb>ment, and from my dressing-room a dress-coat, a large blue cloak, and a variety of articles of apparel—Bracey was also gone—the value of the whole property was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed from a writing-table two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-notes and five sovereigns, which were. Quite safe, and the house ap<lb></lb>parently fast, the night before—Bracey slept in the pantry below—there was a strange coat and hat found in the house, which the police took pos<lb></lb>session of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 74, George-street, Chelsea, and am a labourer, but am not in employ now—I have lived there about five months—I was acquainted with the prisoner Tomlin—in April last he was out of employ—he has been a shop-boy—he lived with Mr. Gadson, a grocer. On the 21st of April I was in his company, in King's-road, Chelsea—he left me to join a man who came up—T did not see his face—Tomlin ap<lb></lb>pointed for me to come to No. 22, Doyley-street, Chelsea, where he lodged that night—I went, but did not stay at all, he came down and told me his cousin was there, and he could not come out—I saw him next morning in bed—he got up, and came out with me—he said he had been out the night before, and had had a glass or two with Fisher, and got drunk—he asked me to sell a pencil-case for him—I did not agree at first, but at last I did—he was in the street then—I went to his lodging—he produced the</p>

               <p>pencil-case and a ring—he broke them up—we came on together, and went to Knightsbridge—he said he would not sell them there, he was known; and we went to Soho—I went into Mr. Fry's, a working jeweller's there, and sold the things for half-a-crown, which I gave to Tomlin—I did not ask any price for them—we went back to Chelsea—a man passed us in George-street, and Tomlin ran away from me—he came back, and said he did not want that man to see him with me, because he was watched, and the man was a Bow-street officer—I said, "Why don't you insult him? I would if he was watching me"—he said, "Hold your tongue, you are not ac<lb></lb>quainted with the circumstances; there has been a robbery, and I have got part of the things; that pencil-case you sold is part of the property"—I went to his house—he showed me sme more things, and said they were also part of the property, that they belonged to Captain Carnac, and Fisher, who I had seen him with on Sunday, was the party who carried them away, with the gentleman's servant—he showed me a gold pin, two gold slides of a purse, and a silk handkerchief, and said they also were part of the stolen property—I afterwards found a piece of the gold pencil-case left in my pocket—as soon as he told me this, I went to the station, and spoke to Superintendent Hughes about it, and gave up the piece of gold—after I had given information, on the Friday or Friday week, Tomlin showed me a hat—he said Fisher had it, and it belonged to the gentleman where the robbery was committed, and he was going to have it re<lb></lb>lined, and the rim altered, for Fisher—it had no lining then—he was to take it to Fisher next day—I walked with him as far as Mr. Chetham's, a hatter—he went in and left the hat, then came out and joined me again.</p>

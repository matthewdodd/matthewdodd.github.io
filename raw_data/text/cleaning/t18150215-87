               <p>COURT. Q. to Mr. Hoard. What time of the night was it - A. About half past eight.</p>
               <p>Barnes. About half past eight, I was walking up and down before my door; two little boys came up, and said, Jack, there is somebody gone into Mr. Hoard's shop; that drew my attention; I looked into the shop; the prisoner was then creeping along the side of the counter. The coat was on a chair at the end of the counter. He took it up, put it under his arm, and came towards the door; I met him, and asked him what he wanted; he dropped the coat on the sell of the door, half in the shop and half in the street; I took him into Mr. Hoard's shop. I did not see him go into the shop; I only saw him in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you usually shut your shop - A. About half past nine. I work in the inner room; I was doing nothing then. I left the shop door shut to with a hasp.</p>

            . I am a plaisterer. I was with Mr. Hoard on this night, in the room behind the shop, I was sitting there with him; I was the last person that went into the shop before this boy came in; I might be five minutes in before him, not more; there was no one in the shop after me until the prisoner came in. I heard a noise shutting the door, the moment I heard the noise, I went out directly; when I came out, the coat was at the door, part in and part out. I was the last that went in, I shut the door after me, it is a common lock to the door, a glass sash door, with a spring latch to it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter, but do not live at this house. On Saturday, the 22nd of January, about ten o'clock, or a little after, I asked my father for a waistcoat-piece from the drawer, and it was missing - when I went to the room that evening, I found my brother at home; I missed nothing else myself - I do not know whether the prisoner was at home; I found some property pawned at Attenborough's, on Monday morning, and when the prisoner was at Worship-street after I had found the property, I asked her what she had done with the duplicates; she said if I went home to the back kitchen, in the dust-hole I should see an old garden-pot, and under the pot should find the duplicates - I went and found ten duplicates, with a key which fitted the room door; I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>JAMES BEAL. I live with my father. I was at home all day on the 22nd of January - I went out the day before, about half-past three o'clock, leaving the prisoner at home, and when I came in at half-past five I found the staple of the padlock drawn; I went into the room, but missed nothing - I told my father when he came home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170067"></xptr>but he did not take much notice; this was on Friday -I met the prisoner in the court as I came home.</p>

             MOULTON. I am shopman to Mr. Attenborough, of Crown-street, Finsbury. I produce two curtains, one sheet, three shirts, and two pairs of stockings; I received the stockings in pawn myself from the prisoner - the other things were pawned in the same name; I did not take them in - the duplicates correspond with those on the articles, and are the counterparts.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAL. These are my property, and were in my drawers; I missed them on Saturday, but some were taken before the others, for what I know - I never allowed her to pawn my property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had been in the habit of borrowing articles of the prosecutor to pledge, and intended to redeem them - that the prosecutor's son was an abandoned character, and must have taken the padlock off himself to screen his own delinquencies.</p>

            Tell me how you missed the property going over the Bridge? - There were four young fellows came several times about the cart, and two of them desired me to get off the pavement, and shoved me, this present young man, that is the prisoner, he made two or three attempts at the cask, I see him put his hand twice on a tub, and he took it away, when he took it away I pursued after him immediately, I saw him take it out of the cart; he took one cask, I immediately pursued after him, and took him by the collar, with the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he hold the cask? - Between his arms and his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the tub? - I left the tub, and took him across to the watch-house, I found it immediately, a man took care of it, and rolled it down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver the cask to? - To the constable of the night, the constable that I called for assistance brings it here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was pork that the tub contained? has it been opened? - The proprietor is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man never touched me till such times as he knocked me down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150100"></xptr>he knocked me down once, or twice, with the butt end of his whip? - I did not strike him till he struck me; because I would not let him have his liberty, he struck me and I was ill used by the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. What were the other men? did they try to assist him to get away? - They did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he ever saw me touch the tub or was nigh them? - I saw him take the tub, and took the tub from him.</p>

               <p>Court to Talbot. Did you miss two at that present time? - While I was taking care of the prisoner, the rest drove the cart away, and I lost one then entirely.</p>
               <p>Court to Field. What were in these tubs? - Salted pork, they had all salted pork in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any marks on the tubs? - Yes, S. T. I am positive that is one of the tubs that were in the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was recommended to do a job in Westminster, I am a chair and cabinet maker, one of my shopmates told me he could tell me of a job in the Borough, I met some of my old shop-mates and we went and had three or four pots of beer, when I came over the middle of London Bridge, I heard the carman crying out thieves! thieves! thieves! I saw nobody, he runs and catches hold of me by the shoulders and beats me on the head with the whip, I asked him what he did with me? he never said any thing till such times as the watchman came up, then he sent me to the watch-house, I never saw the cart nor tub till it was brought into the watch-house; by my running across the way he catched hold of me by the coat; there is a good many in court that knows me, that I am a very hard working man.</p>
               <p>Merryman. I have had the care of the tub ever since; this is the tub that I took from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is impossible for me to lift this out of a cart, I am not such a strong man as to lift that tub up. I have not got a friend in court nor nearer than Birmingham. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, I beg for a little mercy, I am innocent of the offence.</p>

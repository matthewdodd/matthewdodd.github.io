                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live with Mr. Polfer, in Old Gravel-lane. On the afternoon of the 12th of April, about four o'clock, I fell in with Moore, in a grog-shop—she took me to her house—as we went up stairs, I took my purse out and counted my money—she could see me—I had seven sovereigns in my purse—I did not give her any thing—I had nothing to do with her—I went to bed, and went to sleep—when I awoke, my money was gone—my purse was in my trowsers when I went to bed—I was not sober when I went to bed—I was when I awoke—I laid awake, and when Moore came in I accused her of robbing me—she said she had not, and went down on her knees—I went out with her about ten o'clock at night, and saw M'Carthy as I was going out—he asked where I was going—I said to give her in charge—he said I should not—I said I would give both in charge; with that he struck me above the brow, and on the side of the nose, and in my eye—he got down between my legs, and tried to throw me over—Moore got away.</p>

I was on duty this night, in High-street, Shadwell—I saw the two prisoners about five minutes to eleven o'clock at night—I heard M'Carthy say to Moore, "The first one that touches you, I will knock his b----y eye out"—after that, I was called into the court by the prosecutor—he was bleeding very much in the face—M'Carthy was there—he did not say anything—the prosecutor gave M'Carthy in charge, and told me his story—M'Carthy could hear him, and said nothing—I afterwards found Moore—in going to the station, I received a sovereign from Roberts.</p>

I am employed as private watchman in High-street, Shad well—I was in the Duke of York about half-past twelve—a sailor came in; not the prosecutor—something was said to Mr. Quin, and he gave me a sovereign to take to Moore, but I gave it to the officer—I could not see Moore at the top of the street—I came back—Moore came after me, and asked me for the sovereign—I said I should not give it her, I suspected she had robbed some one—I went with her to Mr. Quin's door, and left her there—I went to the station.</p>

I saw no money in the prosecutor's possession; if any one robbed him, it must have been the servant of the house: she has not been heard of since.</p>

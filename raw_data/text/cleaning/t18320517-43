On the 7th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate - he appeared bulky; I went, and laid hold of him - I asked what he had; he said, "I have nothing about me," but I found round his legs and body this wool - I asked where he got it; he said outside the dock, and that he went up a court to stow it about him - he afterwards said he got it at the east quay of the dock, and that he was led to do it by

I took the weight of the bag of wool; it was 4 cwt. 1 qr. 16lbs., and the next morning, from what Clement said, I weighed it again; it was 12lbs. short- it was the property of the London-dock Company; here is the Act which incorporates the Company - I have seen the prisoner working there.</p>

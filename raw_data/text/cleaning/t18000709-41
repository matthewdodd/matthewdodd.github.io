             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Simmons, No. 95, in the Strand, On Saturday last I saw the desk taken from Mr. Hanford's window, about nine o'clock in the evening; I had my hands full of boots; I was just by Mr. Hanford's door; it was an open window, the fash was out for shewing the goods; the prisoner is the man, he took it with both hands, and walked away very gently; two gentlemen stopped him before I could give the alarm; I cannot swear to the desk. (The desk produced.)</p>
               <p>Hanford. This desk was in the window; there might be three or four or five upon it; it was marked five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it; what would it cost you making? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Would it cost forty shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lowest priced desk in that window? - A.Fifteen shillings and sixpence; I never make any with brasses at the corners under two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hearne.) Do you think it was as large a desk as that? - A. Yes, full.</p>
               <p>Hanford. There was only one more desk of this size in the window, and that was marked four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that desk which you marked four guineas and a half stand you in more than forty shillings making? - A. Yes, it must.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The boy said, at the Justice's, that he saw me go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Hearne. I did not say so; I said I saw him take it from the window.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

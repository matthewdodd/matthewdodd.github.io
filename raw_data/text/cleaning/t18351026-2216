                  </hi>. I lived with Edwin Augustus Marvin, a haberdasher, on Oxford-street; he has left the shop three weeks age—the prisoner came into the shop with another young man, and asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs—I showed him several pieces—they remained about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but bought nothing—they had been in the shop several rimes before, but never bought any thing, and the last time they came, I missed the moment they were gone five silk handker<lb></lb>chiefs—they were in squares, so as when cut to form handkerchiefs—the prisoner had looked at the piece we missed—this is one of the handker<lb></lb>chiefs I missed.</p>

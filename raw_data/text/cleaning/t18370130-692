I was in the Borough on the 19th of December, with my father's chaise—I had a cape in it belonging to my father—I left it while I went some where, and was absent about ten minutes—when I came hack it was gone—I saw it in a marine store-shop in the Mint, about twenty minutes after it was stolen—I found the prisoner Sarah Day, and another female with a child—the officer asked for a cape, and it was, immediately produced—there was no denial that it was there—Day said, "It was brought in, put into the scale, and sold as old rags," and she was the person buying it—it has a rent under the arm.</p>

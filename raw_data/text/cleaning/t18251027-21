I was returning home on the 7th of August, about five o'clock in the morning; I had seen a friend home to Broad-court, Covent-garden. I saw the prisoner in Bow-street - he accosted me as I was trying to get a glass of porter at the Brown Bear, public-house; he said he could take me to a house, which he did, in <placeName id="t18251027-21-crimeloc117">Clare-market</placeName>

I should have known him from a thousand. I had been with him about a quarter of an hour before I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had got a little fresh? A. Yes, but I could walk; there were several persons in the tap-room, where I went to sleep, but none near me I think: I awoke before six o'clock; I can swear I was in a condition to swear to the prisoner; I had drank a little wine - I think not above a pint; but I had seen my friend home, who was worse than me, and the fatigue was such that I wanted a glass of porter before I got home; I did not see the prisoner again for seven weeks - I had looked at my watch in Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him before? A. No, but there was a little dialogue between us, because he said his name was Thompson, and a person said "Is that a namesake of yours," which made me look at him more than I should have done; he was there about five minutes - another person applied to redeem these articles about a fortnight afterwards. I saw the prisoner again at Bow-street: he offered me a pin at the time he brought them but I did not take it, because it was broken.</p>

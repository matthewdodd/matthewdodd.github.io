I was going along Queen-square, in company with another boy; we turned round the corner, and went down Great Ormond-street; my companion then began to run; I not having done any thing wrong, and not thinking any harm, ran also; presently a cry of "Stop thief!" was heard - I was stopped about half way down Ormond-street; they never attempted to stop the other boy - the prosecutor came up, and taking me by the collar, said to me, "Where is my handkerchief?" I told him I did not know; he then asked me where the other boy was; I told him I did not know; he then let go my collar - I could not tell him where to find the other boy, and he collared me again</p>

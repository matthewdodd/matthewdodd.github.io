                  </hi>. I live at 56, Fenchurch-street, in the parish of All Hallows Staining. On 7th Mary I came home at a quarter to twelve, and went to bed—my wife was up—after I had been asleep twenty or thirty minutes, I was awoke by her coming into the room and saying something—I heard the kitchen window go up, which is upon the first floor—I opened the window, and called, "Police!"—they came up, and went into the kitchen—I heard a scuffle, and the policeman came out again, saying, "The fellow has bundled himself out of window"—I saw the window open, and a man's hat in the room.</p>

               <p>DAVID PULLINGER. On the 17th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming along, at the end of Tothill-street, Westminster, with a heavy load on my shoulder, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner with two others. He came into the passage leading to the <placeName id="t18181028-113-crimeloc655">Almonry</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18181028-113-crimeloc655" type="placeName" value="Almonry"></interp>

I heard somebody following me through the passage. As soon as I came to the end, the prisoner came before me, and drew my watch out of my pocket. He ran back through the passage. I called out "Stop him!" A soldier collared him in the passage. He got from him. I laid down my load, and followed him into Dean-street, but lost him. I took him two days after. I am sure he is the man. I had seen him about before. I never found my watch.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES. I am in the third regiment of Guards. I was standing at the end of the passage, and saw the prosecutor come by with two boxes on his back. The prisoner followed him to the other end of the passage. I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" The prisoner then ran back. I collared him, and asked what he was running for? He asked what that was to me, and got from me. I am sure he is the man. I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Fulham at the time.</p>

I have been in the habit of having my hair cut at the prisoner's shop. I went there on the 8th, about twelve at noon. I took five one-pound notes in my pocket-book, which was in my inside pocket, in the lower part of my coat. I particularly marked the notes with my initials, and on my return I found they were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mark them - A. From my suspicion that I had of the person, having lost notes three times before. I went up stairs to have my hair cut. I sat down with my back to the fire. I took off my coat, as usual. I had been there many times before. After having my hair cut and dressed, I put on my coat again, and on my return down stairs, I found my pocket-book was in the same place, but no notes. The pocket-book was in my pocket, but the notes were taken out. I communicated it to the officer, who was below, and my friend. I had an officer below, who saw me place the notes in my pocketbook, and waited my return. The officer immediately proceeded up stairs with me, and charged the prisoner with having taken the notes, which he denied for some time. The officer began to search him and declared he would find the notes if they were in the house after his denying some little time he pointed to a box near the fire, which a cat was sitting upon. The officer opened the box and found the notes exactly as they had been in my pocketbook. They had never been opened. The officer took him in custody.</p>

               <p>Pritchard's Defence. Clark saw me take it, and went to pawn it with me - Crouch put me up to take it from the gentleman; he then took us to the coffee-shop, and hardly let us have time to drink any before he took us away; he wanted to get the watch from me, but I would not let him - he and Clark went with me to pawn it, but Clark staid outside while we went in; Crouch wanted me to give him the sovereign, but I would not, I gave him 5s. and Clark 2s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Crouch's Defence. I went into the house for some refreshment - I saw Clark in the corner, and then Pritchard came in; I afterwards went with them to the pawnbroker's, but I did not see what was pawned, nor did I have any money.</p>

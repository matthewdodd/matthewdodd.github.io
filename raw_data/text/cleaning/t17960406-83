Ellison and Oakley, musical instrument makers, in Fountain-court, they make instruments for Longman and Broderip. I have seen Baskerville and Geast together at different times, but never to take notice of their conversation. In the month of March, I believe it was, I was drinking at Anson's, a public-house, in Fountain-court, and Baskerville came in, and called me out to take an instrument away for Mr. Geast; when I first saw it, it was out of doors, about half-way down the arch way; Mr. Geast, the prisoner at the bar, helped me up with it on my knott; I don't know which way Baskerville went after he called me out; Geast directed me to take it to a butcher's-shop, in Noble-street, he said it was his own lodgings; I saw the butcher in the shop, and his wife, the butcher helped me up stairs with it, I was not paid for carrying it; I saw Geast several times afterwards, he told me he had no silver, he would pay me on Saturday night one shilling, for taking the instrument away; it was a square piano forte.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am a music-seller, in Manor-row, Tower-hill; I know the prisoner, I have seen him very often, I know him very well; I bought a piano forte of him in the month of February. Sometime previous to the purchase. I was at Mr. Longman's warehouse, I saw Geast, he was tuner there; he asked me if I wanted a piano forte cheap, as he knew a person who had one to dispose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060069"></xptr>of; I enquired who it was; he told me his name was Longate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that Longate is? - A. No; in about a week, or ten days, after this, he gave me a direction to call at Longate's, in Union-court, Holborn, but I had not an opportunity of going there; a day or two after that, I saw Geast, and told him I had not been able to go up to Longate's; he told me Mr. Longate wanted him to draw the strings up for the piano forte; a day or two after, a porter brought me the piano forte, the prisoner came with him, this was on Saturday, the 19th of February, about ten o'clock; he wanted the money for the piano forte; he said, that the man was very much distressed for it; he asked seven guineas; I agreed for six guineas; I told him, it Longate would step down in the morning, he might have the money as soon as he pleased; Geast came in the afternoon, and brought a receipt, as from Mr. Longate. (Produces it; it was read):</p>
               <p>Received, February 20, 1796, of Mr. Phillips, the sum of 6l. 6s. for a piano forte.</p>
               <p>Federick Longate.</p>
               <p>It was a new one since the introduction of the grand piano fortes; the small ones have grown of less value. I thought I have a fair price for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been able to find out any thing about Longate? - A. I have not been able to find such a person. Mr. Davis called at my house, it might be a fortnight after, and saw the instrument the Geast sold me.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Allen.) Q. Did you take that piano forte from Mr. Ellison's premisses, or Mr. Longman's? - A. Neither; I took it from the court.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no proof that this property was lost from Mr. Longman's. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is stated by the Counsel, that the accomplice is a man of infamous character; an accomplice cannot be received unless a foundation is laid for the felony; and in this case, without the accomplice, there is no proof at all, as against the prisoner at the bar, that this piano forte was a piano forte in which he had any concern; and that the piano forte is the piano forte of Messrs Lon man and Broderip-Under these circumstances you must acquit him.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took Geast, you know you told him it would be a very good thing for him, if he told all about it? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? - A. Nobody, in my presence, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Q. What induced you to go to Mr. Perry's house? - A. The prisoner consefsed to me that he had stolen a great quantity of instruments from Mr. Longman's; that was in the coach, as we went to Mr. Perry's; that he was very sorry for what he had done; that he had committed a vast variety of these kind of things, and hoped he should be got off for transportation.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the variety that he confessed he had stolen, did he point out where any one of those he had stolen was deposited? - A. This is one, he said, that had been sent to Clebows; I, and Geast, and Mr. Davis, and Johnson, all went in a coach to Mr. Perry's house, and when we came there, he examined this instrument, and said, that was it, and I put my initials upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davies. I was present at Mr. Perry's house, when Geast and Mr. Holland were there; I was present when this confession was made, and I put my name upon the instrument.</p>
               <p>(Clebow was called upon his recognizance, and not appearing, it was ordered to be estreated).</p>

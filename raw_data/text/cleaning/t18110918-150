            . I am a porter, I work at the Golden Lion, St. John-street. On the 1st of August, about nine in the morning, I met Cleaver with a flat of butter on his back in Charterhouse-square, Widdison was with him, I knew them both before by sight; they were about ten yards apart, but both in one direction. I knew the flat, I asked Cleaver where he was going with the flat, Cleaver told me he was carrying it for a gentleman, which was Widdison; there was no other person by him. Widdison told him to come along with it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180057"></xptr>He went on into Fan-street, I followed Cleaver, and Widdison went first. When they got into the middle of Fann-street I asked Cleaver to set it down; he set it down. I cut the flat open and shewed the note that was in it to a gentleman, the gentlemen said it did not appear to have been sold by any butter merchant or cheesemonger that morning. Cleaver said he was carrying it for Widdison; Widdison was at the bottom of the street, he went away and left the butter and Cleaver and me. A young man that was with me took the butter, and I took Cleaver to the Golden Lion, and when we came to the Golden Lion the carrier knew that it was delivered to Mr. Hazel. We sent for a constable and gave charge of Cleaver; Cleaver said he was to have sixpence for carrying this flat, of Widdison that was along with him. On the next morning I saw Widdison at Cow Cross, I catched hold of him and asked the carrier to assist me. I told Widdison he must go along with me. I took him to the officer that took the the other in custody, he tried to get away; I gave him in charge of the constable. I know both the prisoners well, I had seen them several times before in Newgate-street, and about Newgate-market. I am sure Widdison was one of the two.</p>

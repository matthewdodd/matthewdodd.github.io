             I suppose; I hit him on the side of the head with a stick I had in my hand, on which he instantly got out of the ditch and hegan to cut away at me; I kept off his cutlass with the stick some time, at last he cut me through the hat, (he shewed his hat with a cut in it about two inches long). I knocked the cutlass out of his hand, I thought I had broke it, he ran away; immediately after we found this in the ditch (producing the blade of a cutlass with a handle.)</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>How do you know it to be Harris? - I am sure of it, he passed me afterwards, he cut at me several times, and I saw his face perfectly clear, I am very sure he is the man that cut at me; he was one that staid behind, and I being the hindermost man of our company I looked at him and saw him and saw him very plain, I looked at him while I was engaging him; it is natural for a person when engaged in single stick to look at the man full, to look steady in his face to see his eyes.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge in single stick? - A little I have.</p>
               <p>Was it-light enough to see his face? - Yes; I have no doubt about his face.</p>
               <p>Have you nothing to say about the others? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. MYLES sworn.</p>
               <p>There were three men you met? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of them laid hold of Mr. Bull, I understand, and you attacked him? - Yes; I throw'd him into the ditch.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burrell. Did you hear any thing said by any body? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Myles. What did you hear said by any of them? - When Lake catched hold of Bull, he said, blast your eyes, or damn your eyes, stop; where are you going? Immediately I pushed at him, catched him round the arms and went into the ditch with him; he spoke to a man along side of him, and said, damn him fetch him back.</p>

               <p>Did you see any weapons? - When in the ditch I saw this dagger, as I looked on it to be.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing to say against Lee? - No; I cannot swear to him, I believe nobody can swear positively to Lee.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was the foremost, we were going from Bunhill-row on the 11th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I perceived three men behind me, I endeavoured to overtake them but could not, they walked very fast, about forty or fifty yards; when I came to Gray's farm, I found I was pretty near them, there was a path with two ditches, one on each side, when I got there I overtook one, two were on my left hand and one on my right, I saw the vacancy to go between, and I said, come along, to the rest of my friends, I had got a few yards a-head when the man came and seized hold of my collar, holding a cutlass up, and pointing it towards me; he said, blast your eyes you bloody bougre, where are you going? he had hold of me a few minutes, during which time I heard one of my friends say, damn me, I have done for one of them, for I have broke his cutlass; I thought he had an intent to let me go, by moving me from the spot where I was, I took hold of his hand and forced it from my collar, then he left me to go back to the other, I kept the path, and when I got up to the place where they had been engaging, I saw two men on the bank, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the man was that had hold of you? - I believe him to be the stoutest man there, Lee.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon? - He had a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for believing him to him to be the man? - I have not the least knowledge of his face, I cannot say to his face, I think by his size, he appeared to have a brown coat on, buttoned up, I saw him on the Friday following at the Rotation-office, I think he wore the same dress with the man that attacked me, I do not know his voice.</p>
               <p>Does that shake your opinion as to his being the man? - No, it does not, I still believe him to be the man, I thought he made use of another voice when he stopped me first, and a different one before the justice.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a shagreen case maker, springer and liner in the watch branch, we were five of us going to the Red-Lion, Islington, we meant to make a party to oblige a friend, and we met at the Blue Anchor, Bunhill-row, I never knew either of these men before.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Burrell. At what distance could you discern the face of the man that attacked you? - I was as close to him as any man that was engaging.</p>
               <p>Was it not rather dark? - Rather dark, not very dark, there were some stars out, Harris wore a flapped hat, not a round hat.</p>
               <p>Do you know that it is usual for sailors to carry cutlasses? - I do not know that he, was a sailor, I know he had a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harris was called on his defence, and said, I have nothing at all to say.</p>

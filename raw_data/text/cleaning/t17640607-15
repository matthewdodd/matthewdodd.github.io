            . I was coming from St. Martin's le Grand on the 6th of this inst. and saw a great many people standing to see the convicts get into the cart to be executed: the prisoner was standing at my right shoulder; and all on a sudden I felt a blow on my back, as I was in the crowd, within <placeName id="t17640607-15-crimeloc89">about twenty yards of Newgate, near the Magpye</placeName>

Directly I missed a pocket-handkerchief out of my pocket: I looked round, and saw the prisoner again; I thought I would say nothing about it; in about half a minute, or less, the prisoners were putting into the cart: the prisoner said to me, that is

            ; I gave no answer; and in a moment's time; I felt somebody at my fob: I turned short round, and saw a silver watch in the prisoner's right hand; I took him by the collar, and said, You rogue, give me my watch, you have got my watch, there it is; I went to make a snatch at it with my left hand, and my arm was stopped, so that I could not move it forwards: I saw it go out of his right hand, just about as high as the pocket of his breeches, into somebody's hand. I said, the watch is handed away. I said to the prisoner, I have a good mind to take and lick you well: said he, if you will but let me go, I'll box you. I heard several voices cry out, and particularly the man at the Magpy say, Don't let him go. for he is in an errant pick-pocket: I shoved him into the Magpye alehouse, and turned round, and saw a sheriff's officer on horseback, whom I knew some years. I called him, and said, here is a man that has picked my pocket, and desired he would assist me: he dismounted, and came and took hold of him, and said, I'll take care of him; he was taken before my Lord Mayor, and committed.</p>

            . I was among the rest of the spectators, to see the criminals go; at the loading of the first cart, I heard a gentleman say he had lost his watch: in a few minutes time, I heard something chink, which I thought to be the glass of a watch: when the second cart came up to be loaded, I set my foot upon a watch, and thought I had as good a right to take it up as any body; I took it up, and said nothing to the people, but carried it to my master, whom I serve, Mr. Bridges, in Foster-lane, to know what I should do about it: my master took it to the Mansion-house, and I was sent for: (The watch produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor; No. 28 l. Name, Brital.)</p>

I never saw the watch.</p>

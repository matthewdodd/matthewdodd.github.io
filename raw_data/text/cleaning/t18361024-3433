                  </hi>. I reside in Bedford-street, and have one partner—I am a gold and silver-lace manufacturer. The prisoner came to our ware-house before the 19th of September and wrote a note, stating, that if the executors of Mr. Nash would apply to Mr. Williams, an attorney at Lin<lb></lb>coln, they would obtain a settlement of their accounts—(Mr. Nash had formerly lived where I do)—he came again, and I asked how business was at Lincoln—he asked how business was at London—he said, as re<lb></lb>garding himself, he was rather busy—that he did the greatest part of the names as a draper—he did the most respectable business, being the most respectably connected—and said, he wondered we did not travel there—I said, we had done so—he said he dealt where he pleased, and I asked him if he would be disposed to deal with us—he said he did not know, he did not think it would answer his purpose—he accordingly went away—he stated he was dealing with other houses, and had no wish to change—on the 19th of September he made his appearance again, at about seven o'clock in the evening, and stated he had orders on his memorandum-book, for gold and silver lace, to supply Sir John Byng with laces to appear at Doncaster races, and he must have it—his manner was rather hasty—we endeavoured to put him of, saying we had not got the right patterns—which we had not—he said he must have the nearest we had to them—and he required us to be hasty about them, as it was near mail time; and if he did not and them that evening, it would be of no use—he accordingly chose some other patterns, which he said he thought would do very well—when they were ready, he said, "I shall now sleep comfortably, as I am certain I can got them off by the mail"—he said he had not got the whole of Sir John's custom, but he had no doubt he had no doubt he should get it all—we let him have seven hat-bands, and four yards and a half of silver-gilt vellum, believing he was in business in Lincoln—we then came to speak about the payment—he had said not a word about that—he said, "I have very little time to get these off, but I think I shall, and I shall call in a day or two, as I have other memorandums, and you will see what you can do with them"—we let him go—and, in consequence of my saying I wondered it this was all true, my assistant left the shop to go after him—the prisoner came again a few days afterwards, and agreed to take more lace, and said he</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Brown running from the Star, public-house; Johnson followed him, and Turner followed Johnson; Johnson fell down, or was knocked down, and Turner stood over him. Johnson called Watch! Patrol! I followed Brown - some sailors came up the street, and they caught Brown; Hawes could not stop himself soon enough, but ran by him. Brown had the watch in his hand while I held him by the shoulder. I said to Hawes,</p>
               <p>"Look out, he has thrown the watch away." Hawes took it up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner BROWN. Q. Did you see the watch in my hand - A. Yes, I did. There were some sailors coming up the street, but only one was round me when I took you - there were a good many persons in the street.</p>

               <p>BROWN'S Defence. I was coming out of another public-house, and heard the cry of Stop thief! about a dozen other persons came out; I ran with them, and was stopped by some sailors; a gentleman said he had got the watch.</p>

On the 30th of March I heard the latch of my shop-door go, as I was in my parlour; I looked into the shop and saw the prisoner walk in - my little girl went into the shop, and said "Some one will come directly," and went to ring the bell; the prisoner at that time put something in his righthand pocket, which I thought was a shell; he then said he would call again; I saw him stoop and put something into his left-hand pocket - I said Halloo, stop! he made a rush out and broke a pane of glass; I said to Mrs. Powell,"A man has run out and taken two shells in his pocket, run and call stop thief!" - in three minutes be was brought back to the shop; he said he had broken the window - I went and put my hand into his pocket, and partly pulled out a box; the officer then took him; these are my boxes - I had nothing on but my shirt and stockings at the time.</p>

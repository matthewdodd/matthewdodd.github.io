             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am headborough of St. Luke's parish. I was on duty at the watch-house the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170083"></xptr>21st of July, the prosecutor was brought to me for quarrelling with the watchman; he appeared very much in liquor; I could not get out of him where he lived, nor any thing else; I was obliged to put him in the Cage till the next morning. About one o'clock the prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house by the watchman, as a disorderly person in the streets; the prosecutor was brought between eleven and twelve; the prisoner came about one, in company with another.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he, drunk or sober? - Sober. I told him it was troublesome times, it was not proper to be out that time of the morning; I searched him, and asked him if any body knew him to give him a character? and I would let him go; the watchman came and I let him go. About three o'clock I took him again, with some lead about him; I searched him and found a knife and key, and seven farthings on him; I returned him that money, but the key and knife I kept; I then put him in the Cage, where the prosecutor was for an assault. At twelve o'clock the same day, I took them both down to Worship-street; the prosecutor told me in the coach, before the watchman, that he had lost his watch, twelve shillings in money, and his buckles broke, and he shewed me his buckles there; I said, have you really lost the things; he seemed to smile, and said, yes. I have; the prisoner made answer and said, d-mn me, you will think that I have it presently; I said, there was nobody else could have it, if he had lost them. I took them to the office and called out Blackiter, and we took them to a lock-up-room to search the prisoner, and the first time we found nothing, but the second time we found the watch up the sleeve of his coat; it was a tortoise-shell watch case outside; Blackiter has the watch. In the presence of me, he says to the other, d-mn me, if I had known your buckles had been wedge(meaning silver) you should never have had them any more. I have something else to say: While the prisoner was in custody, the man was very unhappy about the watch; he says, I will make the officer find the watch, for putting in the thief along with me; with that I went back to the place, and searched all about the place, and did not find any thing, and we returned back, and searched him again and found the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You very fairly stated that the prosecutor was extremely drunk? - Indeed he was persectly drunk.</p>

            Where did he say this? - In the public house, next to our office; and I asked him who had been in the watch-house with him? He said nobody but the prisoner at the bar; I said to Gass, we had better search the prisoner at the bar; and we went and searched him, and found eighteen-pence on him, in silver, but no watch; and I sent Gass back to the watch-house, for fear the watch was there; and when Gass came back we searched him again, and found the watch, we took his coat off, and we found the watch rolled up in his sleeve; I have kept the watch till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Blackiter, how long have you been an officer? - Ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. In that time you must have searched a great many people, in the course of your profession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you searched the first time, and had not the good fortune to find the watch? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched him in the usual way I suppose. How much time might elaple between the first and second examination? - Half an hour, not more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prosecutor was extremely drunk? - He seemed very ill used when I see him.</p>
               <p>

            Did not the prosecutor charge Mr. Gass, with having given him his watch, at the time he was in the watch house? - Upon my oath, I did not hear that.</p>

            Now, you say, the second search was half an hour after the first search, and you mean to have these gentlemen believe that you, who has been an officer ten or eleven years, did not make your search in the usual way the first time? - We did the first time, but did not take off his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you was not so strict at this time as at other times? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, that the prosecutor said, that he had delivered the watch to Gass? - No, I never heard that till now.</p>

            Then if Mr. Gass has been saying so in Court, you never heard it before? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about this business altogether? - I have had none; I did not want any conversation.</p>
               <p>Court to Gass. Was this watch delivered to you by this drunken man the over night? - No, nothing at all was delivered to me. The officer was in a very great hurry when he searched him the first time, having business to do in the office.</p>
               <p>Court to Blackiter. Had you the care of the buckles as well as of the watch? - No, the prosecutor has the buckles himself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the silver buckles, they are mine, I know them by the mark and pattern; they are the buckles I had in my shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long had you had them? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark that you can swear to them but the pattern? - No, no other than that I swear that the buckles are mine. This piece has S. on it; I put it on about twelve months ago, to know one side from the other, to put the straps in right.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you buy these buckles new when you bought them? - Yes, I did, It is a cross.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Just now you told me that you should know it by an S. which does not appear? - I made a mistake, it is a cross.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you mean the cross when you said the S. or do you mean a separate and different mark? - I meant the cross.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. On this night, what I saw first and foremost was, Mr. Steward, he was very much in liquor, like a mad man, and was obliged to be carried into the Cage by hands and feet, the officer of the night said they had got a mad man in the watch-house, and asked me to come in to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - I don't know, he could not stand, he was very obstreperous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about his watch the next day? - I did. When in the coach, he said, that he thought the officer had his money, and likewise his watch; and the prisoner made answer and said, d-mn me, I suppose you think I have the watch; and the prisoner was searched, and the first time he did not find the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about having delivered the watch to Gass when he came into the watch-house the first time? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that your watch? - It is, I have no doubt about it; I can swear to it by the maker's name,

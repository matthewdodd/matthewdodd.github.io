I was gone from my own home about a quarter of an hour, and on returning again I found the prisoner in the passage, and I asked her who she wanted? she said she had been up to one of our lodgers, I said we have no lodgers; I tried one arm and I could not see any thing under that, and I was trying the other and she ran back into a back yard, and went to put down this globe lamp, and I took it from her; it belongs to a religious society, and my father has the care of it; it was fixed there in a little round brass plate where the beam of it goes in, and it will take out with all the ease in the world; the lamp was there when I went out; it stands loose in a socket, it has no screw at all, there is nothing to fix it.

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along very much intoxicated, a woman was coming out of this house, and she asked me to stop with this lamp while she went backward, I stopped a great while, I thought she was gone to ease herself, with that these two women came to the door while I was standing there with the lamp, and that gentlewoman that stands there beat me and used me very ill; I said don't use me ill, if I have done any thing amiss there is justice to be done. I have no witness at all but God and myself.</p>

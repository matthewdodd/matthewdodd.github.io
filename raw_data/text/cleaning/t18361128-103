                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant S</hi> I.) On the afternoon of the 16th of November I saw the two prisoners in Prebend-street, Camden Town, walking and conversing freely together—Ley had a bundle under his jacket—I went up to him, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Nothing, Sir"—I said, "Do not say so"—I pulled his jacket on one side, and saw these things, which were wet—I said, "You have stolen these"—he said, "No, I picked them up close by"—Connor then ran away—I secured Ley, and a respectable man came out of his garden, I gave him Ley, and pursued Connor—I took them both—on the way to the station-house I said to Connor, "Where did you pick up the sheets?"—he said, "I do not know, but I could show you where we picked them up."</p>

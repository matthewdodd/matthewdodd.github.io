                  </hi>. I am a china man, and live in Oxford-street. Mr. Miskin is my surgeon. I knew the prisoner when he was his assist<lb></lb>ant, and did not know he had left—on the 16th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me and said he had come from Portman-square from Mr. Miskin—he gave me this note—it was wafered—I opened it, and found this cheque in it—my wife gave the prisoner cash for it my order—when he was going away, I called him back to sign his name on the back of the cheque, which he did in my pre<lb></lb>sence—he signed it "Henry Miskin"—I did not know that was not his name—I thought he was Mr. Miskin's nephew.</p>

               <p>"To Mr. Fullalove, No. 300, Oxford-street. Mr. Miskin presents his respects to Mr. Fullalove, and would feel particularly obliged if he would be so kind as to cash the enclosed cheque for Mr. Miskin, having been called to an old patient who is come to reside in Portman-square, who is likely to detain him some time, and my nephew is going to start for Oxford at half-past twelve o'clock, and consequently has not time to go to the Bank—if Mr. Fullalove would be kind enough, Mr. Miskin will call in the evening, and take the cheque from him, not to trouble him to send to my banker's—hoping you are all well, I remain yours truly, William Miskin. Friday morning, half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

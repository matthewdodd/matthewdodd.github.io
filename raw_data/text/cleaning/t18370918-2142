                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of the West India Dock Company. They have a warehouse in Fenchurch-street—I am stationed there—the prisoner Stokes was one of the workmen, and has been so about two years—there was a considerable quantity of canvas in the ware house where he was, which was under his especial care—it was given out by him, and the receipts recorded by him—I have found between two and three hundred yards of that canvas, which is a quantity that could not have been taken without his missing it—he never made any complaint or representation of missing any up to the time of his being taken into custody—I have seen a man of the name of Ridler at the warehouse in Fenchurch street speaking with Stokes—that was after the Company had received, (through a person of the name of Morris,) some intimation of some of their property being stolen by some of their servants—I desired one of our people, named Cooper, to follow Ridler when he went away—it was Stokes's duty to send out from the warehouse bags containing samples of indigo, and to accompany them as far as the outer gate, where the gate-keeper was stationed—that would give him an opportunity, if he were disposed, of putting canvas or any thing else into the bags containing the indigo—the gate-keeper would put his hand on them, but not examine them narrowly—that would not enable him to detect canvas in the bag—on the 18th of August, Stokes sent out some indigo in the way I have mentioned—I should say this is a part of the canvas under Stokes's care—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it corresponds with cloth we have on the premises made specially for our use—there is no mark on it, but I should say it is the property of the West India Dock Company—I should say it has not been made up thus for the honest purposes of the Company—this bag which was found on Wagstaff is also the Property of the Company—some of their canvas bags which were found on Wagstaff have the appearance of having rubbed against indigo.—(<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 662.)</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had Stokes been in the employment of the Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years or a little better, from June two years—I don't speak to any particular marks on that found at Hallem's house—I speak to it from its general appearance and from comparison with the other cloth—there have been from twenty to two hundred persons in the employ of the West India Dock Company—this canvas was in a room set specially apart for the stores—the doors of the warehouse are open during the hours of business—there are two doors to that in Stokes's department; one is open during the hours of business—Stokes has been employed in taking samples of indigo, which would take him off the premises—other people would have access to these rooms in his absence—they would go there to draw stores, but in his absence another man would be left there in charge—there is a carriage way through the yard used by the public—I cannot say what quantity of the canvas we had at one time—the whole quantity that was manufactured for the Company was 30,000 yards, but it was not all delivered at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why must Stokes have missed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was done up in bolts of seventy, seventy-one, or seventy-two yards, and therefore he must have missed it—the arrangement of the rolls round the room is such that he must—they begin at one part, and go on regularly through it—Stokes kept an account of all that came in, not of that that went out—he never made any statement of any being lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you acquaint ed with Mr. Morris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He first introduced himself to me in May—Mr. Tyrrell introduced the name, not the man—Morris stated that he could afford me information of a robbery being carried on at the West India Docks warehouse, by a man of the name of Stokes—Morris did not engage me to employ a person to purchase stolen commodities belonging to the Company, for the purpose of detecting the thief—I never made any offer of a bonus to Morris at any time, for doing any thing towards a discovery of any robbery on the Company, nor did any body in my presence to my re collection—I had an interview with Mr. Tyrrell—he informed me that information had been communicated, that the East India Dock Company had been robbed by one of their servants, which did not apply to them, but as we had a man of that name it must apply to us—I am not able to say whether Morris was employed by some official gentlemen, to use what means he thought proper for detecting robberies on the Company—he had an interview with me, and I took him to Mr. Longlands, the secretary, to afford the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Morris, at any time, that any servant in the employ of the Company, who was suspected, should have the opportunity of robbing the Company, for the purpose of detection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he should not be interfered with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that for the purpose of affording Mr. Morris greater facility in using his measures for the detection of robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of that—it was Mr. Morris's observation that he might not be interfered with—I did not propose at any time to absent myself for the purpose of affording facilities; on the contrary, I was more about the warehouse and the yard—I had not suspicion of any of the servants at that time—I had no suspicion after the communication made by Morris, and have not at this moment—the Company have been robbed, but the prisoner is no longer their servant—I have had this suspicion since I saw Morris—in con sequence of seeing him I entertained these suspicions slightly; but they were shaken very shortly after having seen Morris—I did not believe it—I believe it now—Mr. Dixon is the inspector of our Company's police—I have seen Morris in his company—he was not called in to a conference between me and Morris—Mr. Dixon is here—I did not give Mr. Dixon instructions to look out after any of the servants of the Company—by virtue of his office he took what measures he thought fit—he had no instructions from me—he directed me that a man would be sent up to watch the premises—I had nothing to do with it—I was desired to allow him to proceed as he thought proper under Mr. Dixon's direction—I afforded him the facility of residence on the premises, for their placing themselves on the premises—I mean Cooper and Mr. Dixon—I know nothing of Morris being employed—he was to be referred to Mr. Dixon—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that any sum of money was offered</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180103"></xptr>
               <p>Morris—Mr. Forrester was not employed, to my knowledge—I do not know the man—Morris asked that he should not be interfered with—we were from May till August before we discovered any delinquency in the servants—we abandoned all idea of detecting them after May—we discovered that depredations had been committed on the 11th of August, and our suspicions had been attempted to be excited in May; but they were not confirmed in August—when I was told of it in May I did not believe it—after the detection in August I began to think there was something in it—that proved there was some ground for my suspicions, and that I was mistaken in May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that you first saw Morris, after having heard him spoken of by Mr. Tyrrell; did he stipulate that he should be paid money by the Company on the apprehension of the party, and more on the conviction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He stated that he had been promised a sum of money—that he had had some engagement with Mr. Tyrrell to be remunerated for the information—I took him up to Mr. Longlands, and he referred him to Mr. Dixon, the principal of the police—Morris was under an engagement to furnish the West India Dock Company with information till the 19th or 20th of May, when they declined to have any more to do with him—he came to me to state why he had not detected the party, and said that the man should be forced to commit the robbery, if I would be a consenting party—he said the party should see Stokes, and tell him, if he did not make the supply of cloth that was required, that the man should come down and make the disclosure to me—I told him there was a probability that the man had seen his error, but I would never be a party to force a man to commit a crime, it should be on his own head, and he should take all the responsibility, but I could not lay my head on my pillow if I did—I do not know that Morris has been repeatedly charged with thefts—I did not know that at that time he had been charged with burglary, or I would not have admitted him into my presence—he came to me as a person who could give information—I did not know that he had received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Custom-house—I know he had presented himself to Mr. Tyrrel under the name and pretence of an attorney—I was not present at any thing that Morris said about the receivers—I did not know that he had made a stipulation that his men, the receivers, should be protected—I received Morris, and acted under the direction of my superior, under a belief that he was able to detect a robbery on the Company by some of their men, and I referred him to Mr. Longlands, the secretary, and then to Mr. Dixon—the discovery of the robbery on the 8th of August was totally unconnected with Morris, and unknown to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artist's colour-man, and live in Angel-court, Throgmorton-street. I know the prisoner Hallen—I know Mr. Tyrrell, the East India Dock Company's solicitor—I was introduced to him on the subject of the prisoner Hallen—I cannot say when—it is a good many months back—I gave Mr. Tyrrell to understand that I had an intimation given me that the Dock Company had been robbed—he asked me to pro duce some of the articles—I produced some pieces of canvas—he said he should like to see a bolt; and some time afterwards I produced a bolt to him, and after a great deal of inquiry, he said he believed this person was not in their employ, but the West India Dock Company's, and he gave me a note to Mr. Williams—I saw him on the subject, and Mr. Williams desired</p>

               <p>me to see Mr. Dixon, and said I had better go on the coach to Blackwall—I said I had some business to attend to, but I went down soon after, and saw Mr. Dixon, and there was an agreement—Mr. Williams and Mr. Dixon said that my men whom I employed in the affair should not be hurt—I told them I did not know this myself, that I had it from another per son who produced to me some portions of canvas, and I produced them to Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Williams—I had employed Hallem for the purpose of obtaining that canvas—Mr. Tyrrell gave me two sovereigns for the purpose of getting it, and I left a bolt of canvas at his office—Hallem was employed by me to purchase canvas of this description of the Company's servants, for the purpose of detection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which of the servants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the man's name was Stokes—I have been an artist's colourman, I suppose, eighteen months or two years—I have lived at No. 16, Angel-court, four or five months—I have the lease of the house—I have likewise a manufactory in Moorfields, where I keep several men at work—I get my living as a tradesman—I got a bolt of canvas from Hallen—I cannot tell on what day, but I produced it, as soon as I got it, to Mr. Tyrrell—I have been in custody, but the Magistrate would not hear the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been in custody for felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not under stand what you mean by felony—I have never been in custody for picking pockets—I have never been in custody for burglary—I know Lee the officer—I have never been locked up an hour—there was a man taken up, who was walking with me, but the Magistrate would not hear any thing against me—I may have had a glass of grog too much, and have been fined—I never was locked up—I never was detained an hour for felony—if I have been in custody half a dozen times, it has only been as I have stated, in an evening—I do not know that I have been in custody half a dozen times—I would not swear that I have—I have not acted as an attorney in the course of this prosecution—I was not taken to Mr. Price—it was done through the channel that introduced me to Mr. Timothy Tyrrell—I do not think the gentleman would like to be named—it was Mr. Hobler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it arranged between you and Mr. Hobler that you should go and instruct Mr. Price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of Mr. Hobler's clerks—if you can prove that I was in custody before that, it is more than I can recollect—I never was in custody for felony—I was taken in custody to Lambeth-street, and charged with felony by a policeman, for being along with a man, and the Magistrate would not hear any thing against me—I cannot tell when that was—it was six or seven years ago—I have never been locked up an hour since then—I do not recollect it—I say that I have not, upon my recollection—there is a great deal of prejudice between me and Lee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not get 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for affecting to give information on the subject of the Custom-house robbery, and then you did not give a word of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That has nothing to do with it—the government were well satisfied with what I did, and paid me very handsomely—Mr. Hobler paid me, I do not say what—Mr. Williams urged me to urge Hallem to urge Stokes to commit a felony—I might have said that Hallem was the man to manage these things, and would always <hi rend="italic">come it</hi> it me—I do not recollect saying that there was no fear of his being taken into custody, as he was too <hi rend="italic">downey</hi> a <hi rend="italic">cove</hi> to be caught with any property in his possession—I have applied to be let into Newgate to confer with Hallem—I have known Hallem eight or nine years, but I do not think he was acquainted with me—I knew a person of the name Jordan, the</p>

               <p>thief who was transported for robbing the Custom-house, and Sullivan—I do not know what you mean by his being a friend of mine—I have been in his company, and in Lords' company, and members of parliament—I have known Hallem some years—I never knew any dishonest action of him—I do not recollect saying there was hardly a good old thief left in London, and if Hallem was convicted, my work would be stopped—I do not like to swear anything that is wrong.</p>

I am solicitor to the East India Dock Company—I introduced Morris to the West India Dock Company for the purpose of detecting some robbery—I did not know Hallem's name, but Morris called, and said the person had got into difficulty, and as I had introduced him to Mr. Williams, he hoped I should interfere—this was a very short time ago.</p>

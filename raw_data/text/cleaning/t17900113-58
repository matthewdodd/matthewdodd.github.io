When I pawned these things I was in my master's service; I was kept in custody three days, and I lost my place: I was in a great stagnation what to do to get money to take out the spoons; and I thought to sell five or six, and bring the others. There was near three pounds fifteen in my master's hands for wages, and bills. It was my sole intention to take the remainder out. I lived with counsellor Schoen before, and with justice Addington. My witnesses were all here yesterday.</p>

            . I came from Melbourn, in Cambridgeshire. On the 7th of September I was at <placeName id="t18300916-298-crimeloc1522">Hadley, near Barnet</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q. How did she get it? A. I do not know; I did not unbutton my breeches - I had the purse in my hand, going down Barnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I would make the money good, because he frightened me so much; I would have parted with the last stitch of clothes I had to do it.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live at Hadley. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to my shop, and accused him of the robbery; I saw the two 10l. notes and the purse in his hand, and five farthings, instead of sovereigns; she said she would make them good.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARRIS. I took the prisoner; this is the purse.</p>
               <p>ELLIS STOCKBRIDGE, This is my purse, sixpence, button, and notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said he had lost his purse; I stooped down, and picked it up from the side of his foot- I said, "Here is your purse;" I believe he threw it down of his own accord.</p>

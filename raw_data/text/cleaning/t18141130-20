            . I am an officer. On Monday afternoon, the 28th of November, I was going up Holborn, I saw the two prisoners in company with another man; knowing their persons, I followed them about an hour, and there they followed every genteel person almost that was walking up and down Holborn; I followed them into Turnstile, and there they followed the prosecutor and another gentleman; the one not in custody, pulled the handkerchief out a little way, the two prisoners immediately closed the gentleman, and the prisoner Chapman took the handkerchief out, and put it in his pocket. I apprised the gentlemen of his loss, and told him to wait there until I returned with the prisoners; they went down Coal-yard, in Drury-lane, and I met them at the other end of the Coal-yard; when I got in the Coal-yard, the prisoner Chapman had got it in his hand wiping his nose with it; all three when they saw me coming down the Coal-yard, were making away; directly they saw me coming down the Coal-yard, they all set off running as hard as they could ran; I laid hold of Chapman, and Rice was catched in Drury-lane, and brought to me there; I am sure Rice is the other man; I am quite sure of the two prisoners. I searched Chapman, and found the handkerchief in his coat pocket; he put it in his coat pocket directly he saw me come down the Coal-yard. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dundee. Look at that handkerchief - A. It is my own handkerchief; the initials of my own name are on it.</p>
               <p>Chapman's Defence. A young man came up to me, and asked me to purchase a handkerchief; I told him I had no money.</p>
               <p>Rice's Defence. I was coming from the India House, I met Chapman and a young lad with him asking him to purchase a handkerchief; Johnson came and took me into custody.</p>

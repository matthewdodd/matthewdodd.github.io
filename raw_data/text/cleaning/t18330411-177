I received this letter by the post on the 22nd of February, and on the 14th of March I received this letter (No. 1), and on the 16th I received this by the post(No. 2); it inclosed ten 5l. Bank of England notes - (looking at them) these are the notes; I received the letter about half-past one o'clock at noon, and marked the notes in the evening - I have written my own name at the back of them; in consequence of the receipt of these notes, I went to the bankers in about ten minutes after receiving them from the postman, and I ascertained that they were forged - I went to Mr. Aberdein, a solicitor in Honiton, within a quarter of an hour after receiving the letter; I went to him in consequence of seeing a letter in the postman's hands directed to Miss Cox, who is a lace manufacturer, and I knew Mr. Aberdein was a friend of hers - she herself was at Brighton at the time; I had noticed that the letter was a very similar one to mine- I found the postman in the street, and got him to deliver Miss Cox's letter to Mr. Aberdein, who opened it in my presence (looking at it, No. 3); I have every reason to believe this is it - it was a letter bearing that appearance; I did not take it in my hands - it enclosed eight 5l., and one 10l. Bank notes; I made no mark on those notes - Mr. Aberdein and I transmitted the notes in separate letters to Messrs. Freshfield's, the Bank solicitors; I made up a letter the same morning, (and sent it by post, as desired, in the letter I had received,) purporting to be the invoice, addressed to "

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You received the notes on Saturday, but did not mark them till Sunday? A. I marked them on Saturday, four or five hours after I received them; they had not been out of my hands, except being in the banker's hands, to ascertain if they were forged, and then they were in my presence; Miss Cox's notes were not at all mixed with mine.</p>

Bishopsgate-street, instead of the number of the Bull Inn, as it was going from thence to Norwich - he asked me if I would take it in for him; I asked if there would be any thing to pay for it - he said No, as all his parcels from the country came paid; I then said there would most likely be the porterage, and if I paid any thing would he refund it - he said certainly, and I agreed to take it in; he said he would call in on Monday - on Monday two letters came, directed "Mr.

               <p>REBECCA STONE. I am bar-maid to Mr. Pearce, at the Four Swans. On Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in the bar, when one parcel came directed to William Jackson, No. 84, Bishopsgate-street - I gave it to Mr. Pearce; between ten and eleven o'clock the prisoner Coster came in, and asked for a glass of ale; I had seen him before, but did not know his name - he said he expected a person by the Ipswich coach, or he might come by the Bury coach; I told him we had no Ipswich coach until the evening, and the Bury did not call at our house; there was a letter in our bar addressed to Mr. Farmer - it had been there nearly a week; he saw the letter, and asked me if I knew Mr. Farmer - I said I did by sight; he said he had had money from him, and that he had taken a friend of his in, of the name of Jackson, for nearly 200l. - he said if Farmer called again, I might say a person had been there who knew him, and knew of his pawning a watch in St. Maryaxe - but he ought not to have named it, as he was a brother Mason; this was the second time that he came - he staid about a quarter of an hour the first time, and went out into the street, and I saw him standing against a post opposite the door - he could see into the bar from that post, but not into the yard; he came back in about a quarter of an hour, and staid nearly an hour - it was during that time that he had the conversation about Farmer and Jackson; he was standing against the bar at that time; he said he had been in the habit of using the Black Lion, but in future he should use our house - he had a glass of ale the second time that he came: he said Jackson kept a tavern at the west end of the town - I left the bar, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. If the Bury coach did not stop at your house, it would be necessary for a person to stop outside to stop it? A. Yes; he went out once - he spoke of Jackson as living at the west end of the town, not in Bishopsgate-street; I have seen Coster bring letters to the postman at our bar, and he has drank sometimes at the bar - the bar is in front of the street - the coach office is up the yard; he could see partly up the yard when he stood in the street, but not into the office.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLIFFORD. I am book-keeper at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street. On Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, Mr. Pearce brought these two letters to me, and these two parcels, and directed me to take charge of them till they were called for; he gave me the letters about seven o'clock in the morning, and the parcels came about nine or ten - the prisoner Smith called about two o'clock, and inquired if there was any parcel directed to Mr. W. Jackson; I asked him what part of the country he expected them from - he said from Honiton, in Devonshire; I told him I had two or three parcels for him, and gave him the two parcels and two letters - I told him there was 7s. 4d. to pay for them; he put down 8s. - I said he had given me 6d. too much; I returned him the 6d. and 2d. - there were three or four sixpences among the 8s.; he seemed rather confused, and told the money over two or three times - he then took the parcels and letters, and walked out of the office; he was pursued by Mealey the officer, who had been waiting in the office ever since eight o'clock that morning, and could not be seen by any body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did Smith appear in rather a bad state of health at the time? A. Yes, I thought he was agitated; he walked out rather quick, at the rate of four miles an hour - I am certain he did not say Mr. Jackson had sent him for the parcels.</p>

               <p>HENRY PEARCE. I keep the Four Swans, Nos. 83 and 84, Bishopsgate-street. These two letters were received there - I did not see them myself till the Monday evening; I had a communication that day with Mr. Cope, in consequence of which Roe was placed, on Tuesday morning, in a room over my gateway, and Mealey in the coach-office - Roe could see the coach-office door, and into the street, from the room he was in; I placed Mealey in the coach-office about half-past seven o'clock - in the course of the day two parcels arrived, one by the Exeter mail, and the other by the Devonport; the Exeter one came first - I took that in myself; Stone took the other in, and gave it to me - I took them each up stairs to Roe, then took them into the coach-office and gave them to the book-keeper, telling him when the person came for them, to ask him where the parcels came from; I was about the tavern, in my business, during the day - my son sent for me when Smith came, as I had desired him, and I went directly to the coach-office, expecting to find Jackson inquiring for his parcels; I did not find him, and I went to my son in the front bar, and learned that he had been there - I went into the street, and then up the gateway into the coach office - he had not been there; I went back to my son again; I went into the street again, and saw Coster on the opposite side of the street, looking up the gateway - I had never seen him before, to my knowledge; I went a little way down the street, and kept sight of him - I saw my brother-in-law on the opposite side of the street, and crossed over to speak to him; I stood talking to him, still keeping Coster in my eye, and Coster walked past me, towards Bishopsgate church, and after getting by me I saw him stoop to look under a hackney-coach - he was on the same side as me; he appeared to be looking at something on the opposite side of the street, and he looked under the next coach - I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110091"></xptr>turn round rather suddenly, after looking the second time under the coach, and run; I then turned round, and saw Mealey, the officer, coming across the street - Coster ran past me; I pursued, and overtook him - I turned round, and saw Roe coming with Smith and the two parcels; I gave Coster to Mealey, and went in a hackney-coach with them to the Mansion-house - when I stopped Coster he appeared to be in a hurry, and said he was going to the booking-office; he did not say what booking-office - when they were in the coach they did not appear to know each other at all; they appeared to be very strange.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A great many coaches go from Bishopsgate-street? A. Yes, Coster was standing still when I saw him; I did not see him leaning against a post - he was not walking up and down till he passed me; I saw him standing still for two or three minutes - he then walked by me, and looked under two coaches; the prisoners did not speak to each other in the coach - and by that I say they appeared strange.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. I was at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street, about half-past six o'clock in the morning of the 19th of March; I was placed in a room over the gateway, and could see the door of the booking-office - I saw Smith come there about two o'clock in the day; I saw him go into the booking-office, and come out with two brown paper parcels under his arm - I immediately ran down stairs, went out at the front door, and observed Smith going in a direction from Bishopsgate church; I immediately followed him, at a little distance, and observed Coster on the other side of the way, abreast of Smith - I saw Coster turn his head round, look towards me, and then towards Smith; I then observed Smith looking over his right shoulder with his right eye - I immediately ran forwards, and caught hold of Smith, and at that moment Coster turned round and ran away; he being on the other side of the street, I immediately called to Mealey to run and catch him - he did not appear to understand me, and I called out Stop thief! Mr. Pearce brought Coster to me; I knew him before - I cannot say that I knew Smith's person; I put them into a coach and conveyed them to the Mansion-house - Smith gave me the two letter out of his pocket; they had no conversation together in the coach - nothing passed to lead us to suppose they were acquainted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You were not many minutes going to the Mansion-house? A. No - they were on different sides of the street; my eye was on one and then on another - my attention was directed to them both: the street was not particularly crowded them; I knew Coster very well, and know he knew me - I have been an officer seven years; he has nodded to me, and I have been at a house where he has been - there were no coaches except those on the stand, to the best of my knowledge - no coach passed; it was not a minute and a half from the time I came out till I took Smith - I was at the end of the coach-stand when I saw Coster; I saw no coach with four horses pass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You were stationed over the gateway? A. Yes - it took me a little time to come down stairs; Smith had just turned the gatepost when I got out - I was about ten yards from him; I did not ask him for the letters - he gave them to me at once; he said, "Oh, take them."</p>

               <p>DANIEL MEALEY. I am one of the City Police - I was appointed nine months ago. I was at the Four Swans on Tuesday morning, the 19th of March, in plain clothes; I was in the booking-office, behind a partition; I could not be seen at the counter - I heard Smith come and ask if they had not a parcel left there in the name of Jackson - I looked round, and saw him go out with the parcels; I followed him about twenty yards - he was afterwards taken by Roe, who pointed on the other side of the way; I looked over, and saw nobody in particular running, as there was a coach-stand - I saw Coster with Mr. Pearce; I ran and took him from Pearce; he was put into a coach.(Letters read).</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I know both the prisoners - I first knew them in 1819; Smith was in the Fleet prison at that time; and about a month afterwards he came out of the Fleet; and I saw him in Coster's place in Staining-lane, and at Bridgewater-square also; Coster was then carrying on business in the name of Coates and Co. - Smith used to be there, writing letters for him; I knew them until the beginning of 1820: I became acquainted with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110092"></xptr>the hand-writing of both of them - this letter (No. 4) is in the hand-writing of Smith; they called themselves factors - I do not know whether Smith was a partner; Coster's private house was in Bridgewater-square - I have seen Smith there also, as well as at the counting-house; (looking at another letter No. 6) this is Smith's hand-writing, it is my belief; I have not the least doubt of it; (looking at the three letters Nos. 1, 2 and 3) these are in a hand-writing which I have seen Coster write many times, when he has not signed his own name to them; I have not a doubt of their being his hand-writing - (looking at a letter to Mrs. Cox, No. 5,) that is Coster's hand-writing, in which he used to write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your jeweller's shop? A. In Ray-street, Clerkenwell; I am a working jeweller, and do not keep an open shop - I work for myself, and sometimes as a journeyman.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WALKER. I am the brother of the last witness - we were in partnership together once, and became acquainted with Coster; we did business with him - our transactions lasted about a month; I did not see him afterwards till very lately - I know Smith, and I have seen Coster pay Smith wages for his service in his counting-house; I have very little recollection of Smith's handwriting - I know Coster's writing perfectly well; (looking at the letters Nos. 1,2,3, and 5,) these are decidedly in his hand-writing; I am certain of them - I am sure they are all four his writing; his burried hand-writing is very different when he is putting his thoughts together, to be copied, but that is the calm and collected hand he writes, after he is copying it out of a book, in which he writes - I have seen him write letters which he has not put his own name to; he unfortunately forged my name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You saw him in 1820? A. I believe it was in 1819 - I had nothing to do with him afterwards; I spoke to him about six months ago.</p>

             and Co.; he carried on business in that name from October, 1831, until about a month or six weeks before January - I believe he then took a counting-house in Windsor-street, and then went to New-street; I have been employed by him to copy letters for him - I commenced in October, 1831 - I wrote a great many letters for him, and during the whole time I was in the habit of seeing Smith in St. Helen's, acting as his clerk; I became acquainted with the hand-writing of both of them - these two letters are written by Smith, to the best of my opinion - these four I believe, on looking over them, to be written by Coster; they are not in his usual hand-writing, but I have seen such writing as this of his, when he has been particular, and had them written so as to be fully understood - but his general hand-writing is in a great hurry, and not so legible; I believe them to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are they not written in a current running hand? A. Yes, not a forced hand; I have not seen him write that hand very often - I think I have seen him write like this, but should be very sorry to swear positively; I have received written directions from him, which he has acknowledged - they were lists of names and addresses; I have written into the country for him, and those lists were returned to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure these letters are in Smith's writing? A. I believe them to be his - I know one Lewis; there is a similarity to Lewis' hand-writing, but I do not believe it to be Lewis' writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, whose writing do you believe it to be? A. I am not aware that I have seen this writing; I have seen Smith write like this, but it is impossible to say when persons are in the habit of varying their writing - I have done nothing for this year and a half, but writing letters for Coster; I never became bail for any body.</p>
               <p>SIR J. SCARLETT. Q.Have you been pretty much employed writing letters for Coster since 1831? A. Yes, I have written twelve letters a day, and twenty-four or thirty, according to the number he wanted; he appeared to carry on a great deal of business; Lewis was a clerk of Coster's - I have known him as long as Coster, for eleven years.</p>
               <p>MASON STEVENSON. I am an attorney. I have seen several letters from Coster, and have seen him write;(looking at four letters) these bear strong characters of his hand-writing, but the writing I have generally seen is more of a running hand, but still there are the strong characteristics of the hand, that I have not the least doubt of their being Coster's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since you saw him write? A. I think about eighteen months; I saw him write six times, but I have perhaps seen fifty or one hundred letters from him, addressed to my late partner, Mr. Gates - we dissolved partnership about eighteen months ago; I have seen no letters from him since.(The following letters were here read.)</p>

               <p>Coster's Defence. Were it not that my case has been prejudged, and that I had been libelled, vilified, and slandered, indeed already condemned, by the public newspapers,(and that in a manner little becoming the situation they hold in society,) I should await your verdict with the most perfect tranquillity, under a conviction, that my innocence fully entitles me to an acquittal; but a penny pamphlet has been sold in the street, professing to contain an account of our committal as two noted swindlers, for forgery; this has been carried about London, and the newspapers have thought proper to make statements about me; but when I see so respectable a Jury, I am satisfied I shall have a fair English trial, and I think I shall be able to convince you of my innocence - that I never wrote one of the letters, or caused one to be written; I have done business with a gentleman in your box some years back, to some considerable amount - I respectfully submit the case before you as a mere abstract question, whether the letters given in evidence were written by me - and I trust, the respectable evidence I shall produce, will place that question beyond the possibility of a doubt; I have been a general dealer in sundry articles for twenty years - I have paid hundreds of ready money to most respectable persons - the prosecutors' have rested their case solely on the evidence of the Walker's, to prove my writing; it is fifteen years since I had any connexion with them, and I paid 200l. to Joseph Walker for chains, which I supposed to be gold, but found them to be spurious, and could not make a farthing of them - they are the only persons who take upon themselves to swear to my writing; I believe all of you must know the difficulty of a man writing two different hands, without his hand being discovered, without being able to disguise it; you are well aware of the power that my prosecutors have, and the means they have of bribing people; and I know that they have bribed my clerks, whom I relied upon for my defence, and my papers have been taken away, which prevents my showing my bills; I declare most solemnly I know nothing of the letters in question; the respectable evidence I have to offer, in opposition to that of Walker's, will at once convince you of my innocence; you will recollect how ready and willing the Police-officer was in giving evidence, and saying he saw my fellow prisoner looking over his right shoulder with his right eye, and every device he could use to prejudice your minds against me; there cannot be a more public place than Bishopsgate-street, and coaches are going to and fro every moment; I assure you, I had nothing to apprehend to run for; I was not aware of Smith's being taken, nor had I been with him; I was not aware of his having gone to the Four Swans for any parcel; the reason of my running, was becasue I saw a friend a few yards before me, who was going from the Spread Eagle into the country; I might mend my pace to catch him - I said I was going to the booking-office, meaning the Spread Eagle. Gentlemen, you will observe, when I went to the bar of the Four Swans in the morning, I inquired when the Ipswich, not the Honiton coach came in; I told him I expected a gentleman from Ipswich to stop there; I had a note the day before, stating he would be in London, and expected him by some country coach that morning; all the Norfolk and Suffolk coaches which start from the other side of Ipswich, must come through Ipswich, and I could not tell what time he would come; I was waiting, thinking I might see a Norwich coach come in - I saw one put down a passenger at the next inn; I went and asked, Pearce, the son, if the Ipswich coach had come in, and he said No; I understood him, that one came in between one and two o'clock, that was the reason of my going there at that time; I declare I never mentioned the name of Jackson - I knew Farmer; he had taken a watch from a friend of mine, whose name is quite different from Jackson; how they connect the name of Jackson with it, I cannot tell - it is a similar name, but not Jackson; young Pearce, who has been trained, no doubt, by the powerful enemy I have, says

            ; why I should name William to one, and Mr. to the other, I must leave it to you to judge. If any of you gentlemen, belong to the Society of Guardians for the Protection of Trade, I trust you will waive all prejudice from your minds, as to having seen my name in their list for some years past; all I crave from you is justice without prejudice. I am informed that Lush has had a large sum for swearing to my writing; it is true I have paid him a deal of money for copying letters, knowing him to be in a starving condition, but he does not venture to swear that it is my writing. Mr. Stevenson has not brought one of my letters forward to compare - that would not suit Mr. Freshfield's purpose; there is not proof of my having put the notes into the letters; there is a chain of circumstantial, suspicious evidence; when I prove that neither of the letters are my hand-writing, I trust an end will be put to the case at once. I have been twenty years in credit, and can have at this time 1000l. on credit, if I wanted it, and if I could not obtain it, I should be merely arrested and kept in prison as a common debtor; and is it likely I should pass forged notes, to be transported for life. Smith never was my clerk in the whole course of his life - he has sold goods for me by commission, and I positively deny sending him for the parcel - they do not attempt to prove, the paper with the address of

             on it, is my writing - I saw that paper before the Lord Mayor - it appears to me the same as the letters; if I had been seen walking away in company with Smith, who was going after the parcel, it is no reason that I should be committing a criminal act. I trust you will say, it is too much to convict a man of felony, because an officer happens to be on him while he is running in the King's highway.

I solemnly declare I am totally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110094"></xptr>ignorant of the corrupt cause that has given rise to this prosecution; I knew Jackson when I was in the habit of visiting Manchester - he failed there, and I have lately renewed my acquaintance with him; I met him in Whitechapel - he said, "I want you to do a little business for me; we will go and take a glass of ale - I have written to two correspondents of mine in Devonshire for samples of light goods, they will be in two small parcels; I intended them to go to the Black Bull, but have addressed them to No. 84 - have the goodness to call at No. 84, in my name, and give them this paper when they come; I don't expect them before Monday or Tuesday - ask them to take them in; I know the party well, and expect, they will pay the carriage - my reason for not going myself is, because I expect there are one or two write out against me;" I agreed that it should be Tuesday before I saw Jackson again - I went to Bishopsgate-street, as the witnesses state; I called on Tuesday, and having learnt the parcels had come, went up the gateway, and came out with them as another man would, and had not got far down when Roe took me - I gave them up, not knowing there was any thing wrong; I have now stated nothing but the truth - it was in consequence of Jackson's representation I went; I have nothing to do with the correspondence.</p>

            , ESQ. ALD. I have been many years carrying on the profession of solicitor to a great extent - I have been concerned both for and against Coster for several years - I have had nothing to do for him for the last five years, but before that, for perhaps eight or ten years; I cannot bring to my recollection any instance of seeing him write, but I have had many letters from him, and have had communications with him upon them; I think I have means of forming a very accurate judgment of his writing - (looking at letters) I should say these letters are not his; they appear to me to be a better hand than his - than the letters I have treated as his; I should say this is a common ordinary hand - it does not seem to me to be a feigned hand; they are certainly different-to what I have always seen.</p>

               <persName id="t18330411-177-person1279">J. </persName>
            SCARLETT. Q. Have you been concerned for and against him in civil or criminal proceedings? A.Criminal; I was first concerned for him about fifteen years ago, when he had a prosecution against him - I do not know what his firm was then; I was not concerned for him for a long while after that - he has been at my house, and perhaps for an hour together, but I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Q.He never was in your house for a week? A. Oh, dear, no - never for a day; the letters I have had from him have not been in so good a hand, I should say it was a more illiterate hand; I have seen Smith - I think he has been at my house on Coster's business; I did not know Lewis, the clerk, by name - I have no recollection of seeing a letter written by Coster, but signed in a different name; his letters to me were on professional business, some very long; I think it is four or five years ago since I was last concersed for him; he was then a defendant - I think it was a proceeding about some bills; I do not recollect how it was arranged - I think the bills were given up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this his hand-writing (producing a book)? A. Yes, I should say it was - some of the writing in this book is his, and I should say some is not; I do not know that he carried on any business five years ago - there was a firm, but I believe he was out of business - I do not recollect what name the firm was; some persons with whom he corresponded have been with me as clients; I do not know whether his business was extensive - he was not a client of mine in a general sense; persons had bills which he obtained from them - he came to me as a client to give them up; I was concerned against him in a prosecution more than once.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you say the letters do not appear to you to be written in a constrained hand-writing? A. They do not - they appear to me a natural hand.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live in Church-court, Old Jewry. I have been acquainted with Coster fourteen or fifteen years - I have very often had opportunities of becoming acquainted with his hand-writing - I have seen him write; (looking at the four letters) I think these are not the hand-writing of Coster.</p>
               <p>SIR J. SCARLETT. Q. Did you ever see them before? A.Never; I have sold a very considerable quantity of woollen goods, to him by private contract, as well as at auctions - I have dealt very largely in woollen goods; I am not a general dealer - if linen, or any thing came into my hands, I should sell it; linen and other goods frequently come into my hands - it is only an accidental circumstance which makes me purchase; I have sold goods for Mr. Coster - I sold goods last for him in 1831; that was four bucks; he brought them to me to get an advance of money on them - I lent him money on them, sent them into the market, and they were sold by another person; I think I never sold goods by auction for him in my life - I am not a friend of his; he applied to me - very unfortunately I lent him money before on goods, and have lost money by them; I lent 3l. or 4l. on the bucks, and I lost money before by him - I knew him by living a few hundred yards from him; I live in Church-court, Old Jewry - when I first knew him I lived in Maiden-lane; he lived near me then: I do not know where he removed to; his residence was in Staining-lane; I never knew him by any other firm but Coster and Co.: he very frequently bought woollen goods of me; he always paid me either in cash or perhaps a draft on his banker - I think he has bought goods of me forty or fifty times, sometimes 20l., sometimes 10l., and sometimes 100l. worth; I unfortunately advanced him money on property which did not realise it - it was bills of lading for silks - I have frequently seen him write notes and orders; I certainly do not believe any part of these letters to be like his hand-writing; it does not require to read them to form a judgment of his writing - it is not his hand-writing, nor like it, in my opinion; I do not know Smith - I have been at the counting-house in Staining-lane; Coster told me he had bought the bucks, I do not recollect where; - I think the greater part of this book (looking at it) is in his writing, but here is some which I think is not his writing; here are some names and addresses which I think are not his.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Coster is in your debt? A. Yes - I have applied for it, and cannot get it; I never saw these letters before - it is apparent, from a slight inspection, that they are not Coster's writing.</p>
               <p>JAMES MORRIS PHILLIPS. I am a dealer in East India goods. I formerly kept a Manchester warehouse, and live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. I first knew Coster in 1819 and 1820; I have had repeated dealings with him to small amounts - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110095"></xptr>write, so as to form a judgment of his hand-writing; I should say these letters are decidedly not his hand-writing - I will take a more minute look at them; I am confirmed in what I stated - they are a considerably better hand - his is a stiff, illiterate hand; this is the hand of a tolerable good penman - I have not seen these letters before.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Have you any letters of his hand-writing with you? A. No; I think I have seen him write within these three months: he was giving me an account of some goods which he had for sale, and was transcribing the particulars and numbers - I have had frequent dealings with him from the year 1829 to 1832, and then there was a cessation; my first transaction with him was purchasing goods, chiefly British goods, linen, woollen and cotton; I have lately bought hats of him - I never bought hardware - I have sold him, within the last eight months, the materials with which hats are manufactured, and he has paid me for them - I never sold him goods; until the last eight months our transactions have been very frequent - I have not been intimate with him except on business; I did not visit his house - I dealt with him in the firm of Lyall, Phillips &amp; Son; I never dealt with him in any other name than Coster - I have taken a great number of bills from him; I have discounted bills for him at most of the London bankers that have country connections - he has never discounted for me: I began to discount bills for him about six years since - they have always been on London bankers, but I have not done any within these last six or eight months - they were always small amounts; I do not think any exceeded 80l. - I seldom did more than one at a time; he used to send them to me in a note, and that is the way I became acquainted with his hand-writing - I should think I have discounted 1000l. for him altogether, from 1000l. to 1500l. would be the extent - it is not part of my business to discount bills; I did it as a matter of favour - I did it running no risk; I did not discount bills for any body else - I may have done it, or procured them to be done as an accommodation; I never discounted any other bills but those drawn by country bankers, either on London bankers or the Bank of England - I never held any of his acceptances; I never knew the firm of Gibbons and Co. - I had no transactions with that firm; I have seen the name of Gibbons written on an office which Mr. Coster used to transact business at; I think it was in Great St. Helen's- I do not recollect the Christian name; I do not think it was written over the door; I think it was under a general list of parties who had offices there - I do not know the firm of Benvolio and Co., nor Hamilton and Co. - I have known him for many years in Staining-lane; the firm there was

             FIDLER. I live at No. 14, New-street, and am clerk to a solicitor. I have been acquainted with Coster about twenty years - I have seen him write very often, and have had opportunities of seeing his handwriting; I have seen two letters at Mr. Freshfield's about a week ago - I do not see them here; I believe these four are not his hand-writing - they are written too fine, in too good a hand-writing.</p>

            . Q. Who are you clerk to? A. Mr. Garnett, of the late firm of Gates and Garnett - Mr. Coster was Mr. Gates' client in money transactions; he drew bills, and got Coster to get money on them - I do not know who introduced Coster to Gates - I did not; the acquaintance commenced when I was a clerk in an agent's office, who did business in the Sheriffs' Court - Coster used to come there to take out actions and bring clients; Coster's connection with Gates was to discount bills, not to very large amounts, perhaps 300l. or 400l.; my acquaintance with him ceased when I left Gates, which was in March, 1831 - Gates was a bankrupt then; I never knew Coster accept bills for Gates - he used to get bills drawn, and send me for the money; I do not know what firm Coster dealt in - I have seen the name of Gibbons and Co. on his door, in Great St. Helen's; I have seen Smith in the office, but had no conversation with him; some of this book, I think, is in Coster's hand-writing - I do not believe the whole of the page on the left hand to be his; I think the last entry is not - I believe the rest to be his hand-writing, except some parts of the names; I do not think this, "Parker, London-dock," is his - on the other side, I think "

            . I am a poulterer, in Newgate-market. I have known Coster about twelve years - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing his hand-writing, and I think I can form a judgment of the characters of it; I should say his hand is a perfect scrawl, that of a man that could not write a good hand (looking at the letters) - most decidedly these are not his hand-writing; there is not a single character like it.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. He dealt in your business? A. He has sent me dead poultry to sell - not in very large quantities; he has sent me 10 or 15 geese, and 20 to 30 ducks - I do not remember any fowls, and never had any game; I do not know where he got them - I saw his hand-writing in a note, containing an advice of goods to sell, and in adjusting accounts, and have his letters requesting to know how the market went, and how it was likely to go; I have seen him write - he has given me an acknowledgment that he has had his different accounts from day to day; I have none of them with me - I have had a letter from him since he has been in prison, and have that in my pocket - (looking at the book) here is one entry of Coster's which takes my eye immediately, "Captain

               <p>Q. The letters are written at one time, and in one manner? A. Yes - I have received more than one hundred letters from him; I have not a doubt of a single character in them being his hand-writing - I think that the difference of writing before and after dinner in the book would make the difference, but there is not a single letter in the whole four letters a bit like his - I never knew a man disguise his hand-writing by writing a better hand than he ever wrote before - I have never seen these letters before.</p>

I knew him first when he failed in business - he was a commission-agent; I know Coster very well, but not so long as Smith - a person of the name of Green, who is dead, introduced me to Coster; Smith has since that been an accountant, and I have had business with him, in making up bankrupts' accounts - I do not know that he has been clerk to Coster, but he used to be in Coster's counting-house - he used to sell for Coster by commission; I understood so from Smith himself - I corresponded with him a great deal on bankrupts' business; I have employed him, and he me, to attend under different commissions, and to defend actions which have been brought against him - he has had many actions brought against him; I have been concerned for Coster too - he has not had many actions; I was never employed to negociate with Walker - I was never in the Golden Cross tap, Charing-cross, in my life - I swear that positively; since Coster's imprisonment I have seen Lewis, his clerk - I met him in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street; I have never been in a room with him since his master's imprisonment; I saw him at the Mansion-house, at the examination - I do not see him here; I should think I have known Lewis about two years - he was clerk to Coster; Coster had another clerk - his name was Nicholson; he had been clerk to Coster about six months - I have seen him writing in the counting-house six months before Coster's imprisonment; I know the Seven Stars, Carey-street - I have not been there within the last two years; I have not been there with Lewis since Coster's imprisonment; Smith was a friend of mine - I have lent him money; he owes me money now - a few pounds, I cannot exactly tell you how many exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q.As you had business with Smith, was it necessary you should call on him at times? A. Yes, and that took me to Coster's.</p>

            . I am an egg-dealer; I sell for myself - I have no shop; I live at No. 8, Poole-terrace, City-road. I have known Smith about two years; I was with him on the 16th of March, in Whitechapel-road - I saw a person who called himself William Jackson; I joined that person and the prisoner, about twelve o'clock - we walked down as far as Whitechapel-church, and went into a public-house opposite; I think it was the Two Bells, and drank out of a pint of porter or half-and-half - after that Jackson wrote a slip of paper for Smith to go for a parcel; he was to call at Bishopsgate-street and leave the paper - he said the parcel was expected from the country somewhere; Jackson said he could not go for them, as there was a writ or two out against him - I saw some money pass from Jackson to Smith; I cannot be sure, but I think he said from 7s. to 8s. - Smith undertook to go.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who gave the 7s. or 8s.? A.Jackson gave it to Smith; he left Jackson just by the church, by Whitechapel-church.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did Jackson say any thing before he went? A. He wished to see him again in the course of a day or two; I have seen Jackson call at Smith's, No. 15, Craven-street, Charles-square - I have been there when a person called (about a fortnight ago) and left his name as

            ; I left Smith, on this occasion at the corner of Houndsditch - I did not proceed with him to Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Is Smith married to your mother? A. No, my mother is housekeeper there; she has lived there about two years - I am twenty-two years old; I am not married - my sister keeps my house for me; I hawk eggs about to shops and families - I have only seen Jackson twice before I met him with Smith; I saw him at Smith's house - he called to see Smith while I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110097"></xptr>was there to see my mother; it was a fortnight before this happened - I have frequently heard Smith talk about him; and I know he left his name with my mother as William Jackson - but when I was with Smith in Whitechapel-road, he met us; they had a conversation about the parcel - I walked behind at first, till they got to the public-house, and then I went in, as they went in; I was going to see a friend at the Pavilion, and met Smith in Houndsditch, and we walked down Whitechapel-road together - I did not go to see my friend, but I came back with Smith to the Two Bells; I had no particular reason for seeing my friend; we stopped at the Two Bells for a quarter of an hour, and had a pint of half-and-half - I think the landlord was present; I believe he was - it was a man who served us; Jackson asked Smith if he would have any objection to fetch a parcel for him, and Smith said No, if it would do him any good he would - Jackson wrote a slip of paper to leave it there for him, and gave him the money to pay what expence there might be; he said he would place that in his hands to pay for the parcel - he said it was 7s. or 8s.; I cannot exactly say how much it was - I left Smith at the corner of Houndsditch: I did not go to my friends - I have seen Smith write; I cannot tell his hand-writing - I have heard of Coster, I do not know him; I have not seen Jackson since - I was at the Mansion-house when the prisoners were brought up, but not on the first day - I came to see Smith the day after he was brought there; I was there on the Wednesday - I was not there on the Tuesday; I am positive of that - I did not offer myself as a witness; I went merely to see Mr. Smith, to know what had become of him - my mother did not know where he was, being out all night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the gentlemen at the Mansion-house this story? A. No, I was not asked about it.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldgate ward. On Friday, the 12th of October, I observed the street door of Mr. Parnther's house, in <placeName id="t18321018-264-crimeloc1490">Old London-street</placeName>

             (Police-constable G 64.) At nine o'clock on the night of the 12th of October, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180107"></xptr>the prisoner go into the door of a shop, in Portpool-lane, carrying this dial under his left arm, and this umbrella in his right hand - he went into Mrs. Brown's - he set the dial and umbrella down; Mr. Cole was in the shop; he came out, and then the prisoner said, "Mistress, I think I have something here that will suit you;" she said, "I don't want to have any thing to do with it;" I went into the shop, and said, "George, what are you going to do with the ticker?" he said, "I know nothing about it" - I called in my serjeant and brother officers; as we were taking him down Portpool-lane - he put his hand into his left-hand pocket, pulled out a phosphorusbox, and dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was it you called that clock, a ticker? A. I meant this dial - I was close to the shop door, but his back was towards me- I waited to see if the woman bought them - we did not take her.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Michael Smith Parnther. This dial is his property - I have the key; it was on his premises, No. 12, London-street - this umbrella is the property of Edward Breese Robinson, who is his clerk; I left the premises about six o'clock that evening, and shut the door, as usual - no one slept there: the next morning I missed the dial and umbrella - I had seen two or three fellows lurking about, and I believe the prisoner was one.</p>

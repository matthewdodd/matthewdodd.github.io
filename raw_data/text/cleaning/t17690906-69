            . I am constable. On the 19th of July the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, for breaking his house. This was about one in the night, at the watch-house. We took him before justice Welch: there he confessed every thing that he had done; that he broke in at the back part of the house, and broke a square of glass, after he had wrenched the window shutter up, and got into the house. Then I was ordered to examine his pockets, and in the lining of his coat I found four cups and four saucers, gold weights and scales, a pair of stockings, and a hood. The prisoner confessed he had taken them all. The prosecutor is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this Mr. Lister?</p>
               <p>Huston. He was a baker, but he has enough to live upon, and he has laid down business. I think the prisoner is his brother-in-law.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the parish of St. Ann's, Soho. I was sitting in my watchbox in Chapel-street, about one o'clock, and I heard a noise. I saw two men together; one called watch, and said, This man has a looking-glass under his arm. I went and asked him (it was the prisoner) where he was going with it. He said into a street near Hanover-square. I followed him. Then he brought me back to Carnaby market, where I saw another watchman. I said, I am out of my bounds, so I charged him with the prisoner. After we got him to the watch-house, he desired us to send for Mr. Lister. In the morning Mr. Lister came to the watch-house, who owned the glass, and said the prisoner had robbed him now three times. The prisoner owned he wrenched open the window, got in, and took it.</p>

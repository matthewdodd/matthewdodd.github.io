On the 13th of April, I was sitting at dinner with my brother; who, being an invalid, invariably has pudding for dinner, and a desert spoon is laid to him only. The prisoner was in the room; I thought I would have some pudding, which I seldom take. I called for a desert spoon; instead of which he brought a tea-spoon; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is there no desert-spoons in the house - what do you mean by this?" He went out of the room, and returned in four or five minutes, and laid a spoon on the table; which upon looking at, I discovered not to be ours; it belonged to Dr. Tweedy. I said,</p>
               <p>"Hallo! what is all this? what have you done with the plate?" he immediately bolted out of the door without his hat, and ran off. I did not see him again till last Monday fortnight, when I found him at the sign of the Exeter Arms public-house. I had advertised him, and taken every step to find him. The moment he left, I examined, and missed plate to the amount of 20 or 30 l. at least. I have found most of it in pawn. I had given the plate into his care, when he came into my service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. I believe Ely-place is extra parochial - A. It is considered so; we pay for lighting, paving, &amp;c. ourselves, but we consider ourselves in St. Andrew's parish. They call on us occasionally for particular rates; we are exempted as belonging to the Bishop's Palace; Ely-place and Thaves-inn are both in the the same situation; we pay no poor-rates. The prisoner was about a year and a half in my service.</p>

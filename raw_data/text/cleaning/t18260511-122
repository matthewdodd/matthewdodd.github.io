            . I keep a sadler's shop in Edgware-road. On Monday morning last I came home and found some harness in my shop, which I was told two men had brought - soon after the prisoner and another young man came into the shop; I told them I was afraid it was stolen - the other said it was not, and he would fetch the person he got it of; I said I must detain it - I fetched the constable, and as we came back we met the prisoner coming out of my house, and he was taken; the harness is rather heavy, but one man might have taken it.</p>

            . I am a constable. Hazleman fetched me - I went and took the prisoner back to the shop; I asked if he got the harness honestly - he said Yes, and his partner was gone to fetch the person who sold it - we staid a long time, and he did not come; I said I must take him to the watch-house - he then said he would tell me where he got it - at Mr. Buckingham's the night before - he had said before, that he bought it at a sale on Barnetcommon about three weeks before - I locked him up, and went to Mr. Buckingham.</p>

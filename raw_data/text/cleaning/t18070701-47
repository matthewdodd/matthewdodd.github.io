He was; I was ordered by Mrs. Wynne to discharge him; she said she would have nothing more to do with him, and the next day when he came I desired him to deliver up his box great coat and his rough suit, his stable things, and I would discharge him and pay him his wages, which was one pound sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge where these things were kept, where did he sleep. - A. He slept at his mistresses's house, but he never kept his box or any of his clothes there; he kept his great coat in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the stable situated to your dwelling house. A. There is no stable belonging to the house, it is a livery stable; he had all his livery on when I called him to discharge him.</p>

On the 20th of June the prisoner brought me a box drab great coat, with livery buttons; I gave him two guineas and a half for it and two twopenny glasses of rum. On Tuesday he brought me a livery coat, waistcoat, and breeches; I gave him ten shillings for that suit; the great coat was nearly new; I asked him how he came by it, he said his mistress was gone to Ireland, and she had given him all the clothes. The officer came and took them away.</p>

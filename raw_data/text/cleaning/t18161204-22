He had an opportunity of seeing that I was coming that way, I nearly fell forwards; a person pretended to assist me; he came up to me, and then moved behind, and took hold of both my arms, and kept them confined. I had no means of assisting myself. I saw the prisoner take out my watch. I could not prevent him, as my arms were confined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner run away - A. My face was towards Exeter 'Change, I turned round and called out stop thief. The person, who held my arms, went away very leisurely across the street. The prisoner ran towards New castle-street; I pursued him immediately, and saw the watch-chain hanging out of his hand; I did not loose sight of him till he was taken, opposite Somerset-house. He had the watch in his hand, with the chain hanging out. He was apprehended, and I assisted in taking the watch from him. I produce it. I have had it ever since. I am sure the prisoner in the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. If your face was towards Exeter'Change how could you see me - A. My face was towards Exeter'Change at the time my arms were confined.</p>

On the evening of the 22d of November, as I was walking up the Strand, I heard a cry of, stop thief, he has my watch; and immediately the prisoner rushed by me; I pursued him; the constable caught him; Sterry came up immediately; I assisted in securing him; the constable said, what has he between his legs; I put my hand down, he had his hands between his legs, and I took the watch out of them. Mr. Sterry claimed it, and I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DAVIS. I am a watchman of St. Dunstan, in the West. I was going along the Strand, about seven o'clock in the evening, to my beat, I heard the alarm, and saw the prisoner run across the street; he was making for the gate-way of Somerset-house; I collared him; he had something between his legs, for he kept his hands down there; I told the last witness of it; he took the watch from him; two patroles came up, and I gave him in charge. Several persons wanted to take him from me before, but I resisted.</p>

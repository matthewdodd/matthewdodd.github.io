                  </hi>. I had been living with the prisoner for a little better than twelve months, but had been part of the time in service—I left him, and went to service again, five days before this matter occurred—I left him on Friday evening, and I went back on Tuesday night to get my clothes, and to see him—I found him in a public house—he told me to sit down and drink with him—I did so—he took me to another public house, and called for a quartern of the best rum—I staid there till it was getting on for 10 o'clock—he called for another half quartern, which we drank between us, and then he wanted me to have a pint of half and half—I said if I did I should be tipsy, and could not go home to my place—he said, "Come and make my bed, ray bed has not been made since you left me"—I said I could not go up stairs because my mistress only gave me leave for two hours, and I could not stop—he said, "Come up, and I will not delay you half an hour"—I said, "I shall go up and make your bed"—we went up stairs at about a quarter or half past 10—he then locked me in, and said, "You won't go home to your place to night; I shall be up early in the morning, and then you can go to your place"—I went to bed—I said I should lose my place for staying out—I had been such a short time in it—about 2 or 3 in the morning he put his hand across me, got kissing me, and he had got a razor open in his hand—I said, "Don't murder me"—he said, "I will serve you out now"—he gave me the first cut here (<hi rend="italic">on the chin</hi>)—he wanted to cut my throat—I put my arm up, and he cut it, in two places—I kept my arm all the time to my throat—I said, "White, you have done for me at last"—he said, "You are not murdered yet," and gave me another cut on my arm, as I was at the door—I opened the door and ran down stairs, leaving the door open—a policeman took me to the hospital directly, and I became unconscious—I have been an out patient ever since, and have lost the use of my arm—there was nothing</p>

On 9th June, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!" by several women—I went to the spot, and found Mrs. Hurley coming out of the court bleeding from the face and arm, and holding the cut together—I went to the second floor of 11, Devonshire-place, and found the door fastened on the inside by this piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) being placed above the latch—I called to White to open the door—I received no answer—I called a second time, and threatened to break the door in, which I did, and found the prisoner lying on the edge of the bed undressed and bleeding from a wound in the throat—he said, "I did not think she would have done this to me"—he directed my attention to where I should find a razor—I found this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) covered with blood and the handle broken; it seems to have been twisted—the blade is not broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Painter, a surgeon, of Broad-way, Westminster. I am in the habit of attending Westminster Hospital, and assisting in dressing wounds—I saw the prosecutrix on the morning she was brought in—the surgeon who first dressed her wounds is ill—I saw two wounds on her face and two on her right arm—those on the arm were very deep; one was three inches long, and divided some of the muscles and tendons, which will prevent her using her hand for a length of time, and will quite cripple her—those on the face were deep, but did not go through the lip, and she had another deep wound on the arm—I think the wounds on the arm were received while putting her hand up to defend her throat from being cut—I saw the prisoner's wound—it was about two inches long—the trachea was not divided at all—no large vessel had been cut, but he had lost a good deal of blood—I should say it had been inflicted by himself because it was cut on the left side, and the point where the razor would go in was consider<lb></lb>ably deeper—it was such a wound as is commonly inflicted by a right handed person cutting his throat.</p>

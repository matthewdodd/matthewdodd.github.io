                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Grady, we live in Church-lane, Whitechapel—my husband is on the stage. On the 28th of April, about eight o'clock, I was in High-street, Whitechapel—something was said to me, and in consequence of that I followed the prisoner to the corner of George-yard, where she went into a public-house with another girl—the prisoner came out by herself, and turned up George-yard—I followed her and said, "I want to speak to you, my dear"—she said, "I can't stay"—I said, "You must, you have robbed me"—she directly ran away—I called "Stop thief"—I had spoken to her in consequence of something that was said to me by a little boy, and I felt in my pocket, and missed 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in sixpences—I am quite sure I had that in my pocket.</p>

               <p>said to that other girl, "Here, take this, and I will go and get some more"—the prisoner then followed the lady to a butcher's shop, and then she lifted up her gown again, and took some more money—they then went into a public-house, at the corner of George-yard, and then the prisoner came out, and went up George-yard—I told the lady what I saw—Meadows was with me, and saw what I did.</p>

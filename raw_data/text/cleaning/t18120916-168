When I went into the fair I had a bill of exchange of twenty-one pound, ten shillings and four pence, and an eighteen-penny stamp paper, in my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you had it when you set off from your own home - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the fair, when any thing happened to you which induced you to suspect your pocket had been picked - A. About an hour. When I got out of the mob, I felt in my pocket and found my pocket-book was gone. There was a great mob by Bartholomew coffee-house, just by the Hospital. I was very much crowded there, and when I got to Long-lane, the end next to Smithfield, I felt in my pocket and missed my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, being in the crowd, were you able to distinguish the person of the prisoner. - A No; I do not recollect seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see your pocket-book again - A. No; I saw the bill of exchange and stamp paper since, in the hands of the constable; his name is Hutchins. I knew the bill of exchange when I saw it again.</p>
               <p>- HUTCHINS. I am a constable of St Luke's, Middlesex. I took the prisoner to custody for stealing a watch on the 12th of September. I found in the room that he lodged this bill of exchange, and the eighteen-penny stamp paper. I took him out of bed; in that room there were two young women, one was in bed. I knew it was his lodging; the landlady said it was. I rent the bottom part of that house. I knew that was his room; I have seen him there all hours in the day, and night likewise. I found the bill of exchange and the stamp paper under a tumbler-glass on the mantle-piece. One of the young women constantly lived with him there, and has done for three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other young woman, who was in the room, lodge in the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing, to him about these papers - A. I asked him whether they belonged to him, he said, they did. I asked him what he called them; he said, waste paper. I then took him in custody. I was not in the fair at the time he was there. I afterwards shewed them to Mr. Green; he claimed them.</p>
               <p>JAMES MILLER. I am an officer of St. Luke's. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended. I was with Hutchins. We took him in bed. I was present when Hutchins found the papers in the same room, under the glass on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. I cannot say I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, lately happen to meet with a gentleman who gave you a paper instead of silver - A. Yes, I did, in fair time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the paper he gave you - - A. I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a thing that you thought to be a bank-note that turned out to be a Fleet-note, did it not - A. Yes; and I found some papers at the door. The young man slept with me that gave me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been in the room besides that young man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He left you, and you thought it to be a one pound note - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the papers when you found them - A. I picked up the papers. I did not think them of any consequence; I left them there in case he should call again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put them, under a beer-glass, or any thing - A. No; they were behind a vinegar-cruet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Not behind any glass - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Had they been there some days before the officers came and took the young man - A. They had been there about two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known that young man - A. I only know him by sleeping with him sometimes, a night in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has that intercourse been - A. Several weeks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that you have not been acquainted with him more than several weeks - A. No, sir, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in bed that night the officers came with you - A. Yes; but he had not been there before since the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know any thing of these papers on the mantle-piece - A. No; he knew nothing at all about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room when the officer challenged him about them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be very cautious what you say; three officers were present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. They may contradict you, therefore be very cautious. Then, what did the officers say when they went up to the young man - A. The officers asked him, what they were; he said, he did not know, they were some waste papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ask him what they were - A. No, they did not; the officer said, if he did not, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man say they were his - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you claim them as yours - A. No, I did not say a word about them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Now, young woman, how long have you been acquainted with the last young woman,

             before at all - A. I have heard of him, my husband being in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person at all, until you had heard Featherday represent him as her husband - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You made the bargain with her for four shillings and sixpence a week - A. Yes; and the next day they came into the place as man and wife together, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him the next morning you say - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to him the terms that you had let the room to his wife for - A. No; no further than respecting the rent that I expected. I had enquired into them; I heard the family had been respectable, but had become reduced. I had two shillings; I requested to have that in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you made the agreement - A. In their own room, in the two pair room; they paid me regular, and kept good hours.</p>
               <p>Q. If any other men came to the room to sleep there, was it unknown to you - A. It was unknown to me; I would not have permitted it; for I had no benefit in it. I understood, from Mrs. Featherday, that her husband was very particular about men visiting her. I would not have allowed it; I let it to them, and to them only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear or see him coming home pretty often - A. I dont't know that he had any meal at home, except a breakfast or a supper, to the best of my knowledge, together.</p>
               <p>Q. Except the time he was out at work, did you ever know him to be absent a week together - A. I could almost take an oath, that he was not absent a night out of my house. I was in the habit of going into the room to borrow a pair of bellows, mine being at the mender's, therefore I was a true judge that he was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160089"></xptr> Q. Do you think if the room had been a resort of different men, you must have known it - A. I must I can take an oath that it was not suffered, nor would have been suffered by her husband. I am very confident that different men did not come.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolplus. The woman took a lodging of you - A. Yes; but the next day I went and saw her husband. I related the circumstance to him myself: the circumstance of the agreement; and I did see Collard the next day in his own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time that you bargained about the lodging - A. That was not the only time; I had to go up to him about the rent; chiefly he paid me.</p>

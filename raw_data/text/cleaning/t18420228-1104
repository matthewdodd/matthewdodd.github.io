                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. On the morning of the 17th of February, the four male prisoners were locked up in the cell at Queen-square office, and the two female prisoners brought refreshments to the four male prisoners—I desired two constables to take the two women to the station, and I followed in the rear—they gave their address as Nos. 10 and 11, New-square, Orchard-street, Westminster—Wells said No. 10—they accosted a girl on their way to the station, whose name I do not know, gave her the keys to open the apartments, and desired her to do something in the apartments—I took that girl into custody also—Wells said she was sister to Brown, and Dudley said Crawley was her brother-in-law—I went with the girl to whom the female prisoners gave the keys, to No. 11, New-square, to the first-floor, front-room—she un<lb></lb>locked the door with the key which had been given her by Well—I searched that room, and found there a pistol secreted in the mattress—I have since shown the pistol to the prosecutor's servants—I found nothing else there—I went with the same girl to No. 10—she unlocked the door of the first-floor front-room there with the key which Dudley had given her—I found this bead purse in a drawer in that room—I took this silk handkerchief from Wells's neck at the station—at that time I had not heard any thing of Mr. Pigeon's robbery, and I let the female prisoners go—after hearing of this robbery, I caused them to be taken again, on the 22nd—I went to their lodging on the 21st, and they were not there—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280217"></xptr>
               <p>took from Wells's ears, at the station, these jet ear-rings—I have shown them to Kendall, and she claims them—Wells said she had had them fifteen months in her possession—both the female prisoners admitted lodging at No.7, Mint-street, Borough, on the night of the 21st—I have examined the state of the houses in Mint-street, with reference to Mr. Pigeon's pre<lb></lb>mises—from what I have observed, a person could go from the houses in Mint-street on to the roof of the distillery, and so in at the window of the knife-room—I did so myself, and saw there were marks on the tiles—I have no doubt a person could open the window of the knife-room by means of the broken pane of glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis. Q.</hi> You say these females brought us refreshment at Queen-square, did you see them bring any to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw them bring it to you all four—you were all in custody at the time—the first I saw of you and Harris was in the tap-room of a public-house, and from the description given by the constable at Knightsbridge, I sent him with two or three other officers to see if you were the parties—they did not find you there, but close by, in the neighbourhood—I am sure you were in custody at the time the refreshment was brought—it was taken to the man's-cell—there is but one man's-cell, and all the four male prisoners were in it—I did not sec the refreshment distributed, but you were all talking together before you were locked up—when Harris and you were taken into custody you were taken into the officers' waiting-room, while I took your names and addresses, and you had to pass Crawley and Brown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> I had no refreshment; my friends did not know I was taken up; Harris and I sat by the fire, and we saw neither of the other prisoners till we were brought in before the Magistrate; <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not correct—they had to pass by the other prisoners who were waiting to go before the Magistrate—they had opportunities of speaking before, and I have no doubt they did speak together—I heard them do so—I could not distinctly hear what they said, but I heard them speak as they passed—they recognised each other—in going from the street to the office, they had to pass the prisoners Crawley and Brown, and after taking down their names and addresses in the officers' waiting-room, they had to pass them again—there is a room kept entirely for prisoners to wait in before they go before the Magistrate—Crawley and Brown were waiting there, and Harris and Davis when taken, had to pass them to come into the officers' waiting-room—then on the charge being called in against Crawley and Brown, Davis and Harris had to puss them again—they were nearly together in passing—it was quite momentarily—I am quite positive they spoke to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dudley.</hi> I deny taking any food to any body but my brother-in-law Crawley. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I conclude it was for the four, from the abundant quan<lb></lb>tity—Wells represented Brown to be her brother.</p>

The prisoners Crawley, Harris, Davis, and Dudley lodged at No. 10—I have seen them in No, 10 several times—I have seen Brown in company with the other three male prisoners—Brown lived at No. 11, in the first-floor, front-room, and Wells with him—I could see them quite plainly from my house—I have seen all the four male prisoners go in and out of both those houses several different times—the last time I saw them go into those houses, was in the early part of the week previous to their apprehension—I saw all of them—it was about the 13th—on the Monday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw Crawley, Harris, and Davis go down the street together from their home, in the direction of Broadway, Westminster, and I saw them come back again in the space of half-an-hour—one of them, I cannot swear which, had a bundle about the size of a hat, or possibly smaller—it hung down from a handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Evans, and live at No. 9, Mint-street, Borough. About three weeks before I was examined before the Magistrate, the prisoner Wells came to my house in company with the prisoner Brown, after a room which I had empty at the time, at No. 7, Mint-street, which is opposite my house—she did not take it—she said she would call in the evening, but she did not—the backs of the houses in Mint-street adjoin Mr. Pigeon's distillery—I did not see the prisoners again till they were at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wells.</hi> How can you say there was any male with me? I was by my<lb></lb>self; Brown was not with me; the room would not suit me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You did not say anything about the room, but Brown was with you—there was a person lodging at No. 7 at that time, and since they have been taken up she has gone away—she left last Saturday night—after I showed Wells the room, she walked up stairs to that person, whom they knew—I do not know when they went out—the room I showed them was in No. 7—both Brown and Wells went into the room—the person they seemed to be acquainted with was named Brookes, and lodged in the second-floor back<lb></lb>room—they both went into that room—when Brown was down stairs he called "Sarah," which was the name of Mrs. Brookes, and he and Wells then went up to her in that room—that back-room commands a view of Mr. Pigeon's distillery, and I should think they could get out of that window—I cannot tell on what day this was—I did not hear of the robbery for nearly three weeks afterwards—I do not know when the man who lived with Mrs. Brookes went away, for I did not know that he was gone—the woman left last Saturday—she did not pay me my rent before she went, nor did the man—they had lodged there since January.</p>

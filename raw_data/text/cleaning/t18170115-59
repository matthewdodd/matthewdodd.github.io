            , who was convicted of stealing my cloth. I accompanied Vann, the officer, to the prisoner's house, in Middle-street, Cloth-fair, on the 3d of November; the prisoner, Eliza Macginnis was at home, she had a handkerchief on her neck, which I recognized to be the same pattern, as one of Ellen's gowns. I asked her what she had done with my blue superfine cloth, and if she had any. She at first said, she knew nothing about it. The prisoner, Thomas Macginnis was present; I told her I knew she had some, and that I had got proof of it. She told me to search the premises. I found nothing. I asked her about the handkerchief. She said, it was a small remnant that she had bought in Field-lane. I told her she must go with us. She lives in a small room, with a bed in it, and sells greens; when I got her to the watchhouse, I confronted Ellen, who was in custody, with her.

             said, she knew nothing about Ellen. Ellen said she was the woman who gave her 2l. 10s. for the cloth.

             said, she had seen Ellen twice; she said, she had given her a gown of the same pattern as the handkerchief, and 1l. note for the first parcel, and Ellen had that very gown on at the time. Ellen said, that the prisoner, Thomas Macginnis, was not present at the time.</p>

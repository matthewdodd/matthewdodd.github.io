On the 18th of February, about four o'clock, I received two 1 l. notes at an office in Doctor's Commons; I put them into a canvass purse in my jacket-pocket. I was with Thompson, and told him I had lost them; the prisoner was before me. He turned back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you say I have got your money?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know, but there was nobody in the office but you" - he was in the office when I received it; he scratched my face. I turned back to see if I had dropped it in the office, but could not find it; he was secured while I was gone. I had noticed Nos. 2 and 4, on the notes when I took them - he was quite a stranger.</p>

            . I am a seaman, and was with Miller; he received his money, and I saw him put two notes into a bag, and put the bag into his pocket in a public-house - the prisoner stood close by us at the time - he was a stranger. In about five minutes Miller said he had lost his money. I told the prisoner that Miller had lost his money, and blamed him for it, as nobody but him was near enough to take it. The prisoner went forward, swore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170019"></xptr>at him, pushed him about, and struck him in the face. I advised Miller to go back, and see if he had dropped it, and he went; I saw the prisoner throw away a small canvass bag, and then put his hand to his breeches-pocket. I seized him, and called for assistance; he pulled his hand out, and put some paper into his mouth, then dropped it - it was two 1 l. notes. He was secured.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Cloak-lane. I was coming down Dowgate-hill between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and saw several people wrangling; Thompson desired me to come and take the part of a poor sailor; he said the prisoner had put two pieces of paper into his mouth - he was in the custody of several carmen. I said</p>
               <p>"You had better give the man his money, or I will give you in charge" - he made no answer. I told the men to take him to the constable's, which was done; he struggled to get away. One of the carmen said it was in his mouth, seized his throat, and I saw him disgorge the two 1 l. notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Dorset-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone, and keep the house. On the 27th of Oct. I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night—I was the last person up—the doors and windows were properly fastened—about three o'clock in the morning I heard a noise, and got up—I put my hand under my pillow, where I had put my trowsers the night before, and missed them—there was some money in the pockets when I put them there—I sleep in the parlour, level with the shop—I went into the shop, and found the door open—the pannel under the stall-board had been removed—a person could get in there if it was pulled out more than I found it—it might have been pulled more inward after they got in—I found a pair of boots in the shop belonging to a stranger, and a sack of potatoes which are mine—I found some rag with marks of blood on it in the toes of the boots—I also found by my bed-side some pieces of rag with blood on them—I gave the boots to the policeman—the prisoner was in my service for a short time, and since that he has passed and repassed the shop several times.</p>

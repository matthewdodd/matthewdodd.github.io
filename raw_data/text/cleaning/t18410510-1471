                  </hi>. I live in Union-place, New-road. On Sunday, the 2nd of May, I went out, and took my key with me—I returned at a quarter past eleven o'clock—I got in by a latch-key, which I had with me—I found my parlour-door open, and missed a pair of boots from the shop-window, and from the parlour a silk handkerchief, an old pair of Welling-ton boots, and other things—I examined my apprentice's box, and found all his clothes were gone, as well as himself—I have never teen him since—I had left him in charge of the house—on the Thursday after I saw the prisoner in Paradise-street, at the corner of Gravel-passage, leading to Marylebone Police-office—he had on a pair of trowsers and boots belong<lb></lb>ing to me—I questioned him—he said he had bought them of a Jew in Holborn for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had never seen the prisoner near my premises—I do not know what has become of the apprentice—I have made every inquiry, but cannot find him any where—the things the prisoner had on were part of the apprentice's apparel which I had given him to wear—I have not found any of my own things but the boots—the apprentice was transferred from Mr. Sparkes, of Guildford-street, to me—I have made inquiry there, but can ascertain nothing about him.</p>

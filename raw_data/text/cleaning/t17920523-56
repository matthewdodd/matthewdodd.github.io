               <p>On the 14th of this month, about half past seven, I was opening the shop; the prisoner came to the shop and asked if Mr. Littler was at home; I said no; he asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230043"></xptr>what time would he be at home; I said perhaps in half an hour; he said he had told him of a gold repeating watch; I asked him if it was set round with pearl? I then shewed him the watch; he said that would do, and asked me the price; before I shewed him the watch he said don't you know me; he said I am Dr. Cooper, of Norfolk-street; I recollected there was such a person in Norfolk-street, therefore I had no doubt he was the person; then I shewed him the watch; there were some more watches in a glass case, and that he would take the gold watch also that Lady Caroline might have her choice: he put them both in his pocket; then I shewed some chains; he pitched upon one chain of three guineas, then he went away: as soon as he was gone I missed the other gold chain marked 3 l 5 s. there was no other person in the shop; I saw the chain at Sir Sampson's.</p>

                  </hi>I am a waterman, and live in Albion-street, Commercial-road. On the night of the 21st of May, I was keeping watch at Ratcliff-Cross-stairs—about twelve o'clock the prisoner came to our watch door, and asked if there was any lodging there—I said, "No"—(I had seen him about ten minutes before going in a direction to Narrow<lb></lb>street)—I told him to go his own lodging—he then went into Mr. Wright's craft, and I lost sight of him for about ten minutes, when I saw him again come up the causeway with a quantity of rope on his back—there was a</p>

                  </hi>I am lighterman to Mr. William Consett Wright, a coal merchant, at Ratcliff-cross. I know this rope—it was used as headfasts to Mr. Wright's barges—here is some of my splicing on them—they were fastened to the barges, and must have been untied or cut—they appear to have been cut—I went in consequence of what I heard to the wharf, and missed the headfasts—I had seen them safe at seven o'clock on the evening before—I have not the least doubt of these being them.</p>

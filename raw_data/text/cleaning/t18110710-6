            . I am foreman to Mr. Fennell, 38, Shoreditch; he is a shoe-maker; in the Parish of St. Leonards, Shoreditch; he keeps a shop there, the shop is part of the house; he is the house keeper. On Thursday, the 20th of June, about a quarter to nine o'clock the prosecutor and two persons with him came into the shop, the prisoner was one of them; the prosecutor asked for a pair of shoes, I served him, they came to eight shillings and six-pence; he sat upon the edge of the counter; he pulled out a piece of rag from his fob pocket, and in his rag was a liberty ticket, two five pound Bank of England notes; I saw them at the time. He said give me change of a five pound note; the prisoner said, what do you want change for a five pound note when you have got a two. The prosecutor said what his that to you, what do you follow me about for, I think you are a thief, I do not want any of your company, and go about your business. And the prisoner made himself so intimate that I thought the was his shipmate. I took the five pound note as he insisted he would have change. I went to my employer and asked him for change; I gave the prosecutor a two pound notes two ones, and eleven shillings and sixpence in silver. The other notes laid on the counter under his guard, as if he was protecting them to fold them up again. When I brought him the change there was one of our curriers in the shop; I gave him a look, to mind what I did; I said, here is your change; he said how much have I got now; I said there was eight pound eleven and sixpence; A five pound note was gone; he said I told him there were fourteen pounds, I said I did; he said he was robbed; I said to the prisoner, where is your partner; he had ran away, he said he knew nothing about him; I said to the prisoner, you d - nd rascal you have robbed this man; he said, me; do you think that I would do such a thing. He put his hand over the counter; I catched hold of his wrist, and turned it up; there was the five pound note clinched in his hand; I opened his hand and took it from him; it was folded up then very small; I opened it; it was the five pound note; I said before I opened it; it was a five pound note, my suspection it was as he had it in his hand that it was that note, and it was a five pound note. Two City officers were coming past; I gave the five pound note to one of them and the prisoner to the other. The prosecutor was intoxicated; the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

             was with me. I observed the sailor and the prisoner standing at the shoe shop door, and another man; I said to Smith, stop a minute; the sailor is much in liquor, they mean to rob him. I looked in the window and saw the last witness give the sailor change for a five pound note. The prisoner came out and stood along side of me at the window; the sailor was in the shop; the prisoner went in again, and the other man that was with him came out and went away. I heard the sailor make a noise about the notes. I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop with Smith, the officer. Mr. Trotter gave me this five pound note, I have had it in custody ever since. The prisoner said he picked it off the ground.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Thursday, the 20th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in company with a young man, we were going to Billingsgate, to seek employ; in Bishopsgate Street we met the prosecutor; he alighted from a post chaise, and enquireed of me to take him to a house, to get some drink. We all went to a public house in Leadenhall Market, and continued drinking there upwards of an hour and a half; the Prosecutor being the worse for liquor, prevailed upon us to stay with him, and when he found himself refreshed; he went with us to the Four Swans, to book his place, leaving at the office his new clothes; we afterwards went to another public house, drank four pots of ale, and four pots of porter; he gave me a shilling to buy some chops, he want into a hoster shop, to purchase stocking, from there to a shoe warehouse in Shoreditch, and bought a pair of shoes, for eight shillings and sixpence; he took from his pocket the Bank notes, holding the notes in his hand; he exclaimed he had been done; the other young man went out, and upon looking about the counter, he found the note in question among some papers; some altercation taking place, two officers came in, whereupon I was taken in custody, and fully committed to trial. I most solemnly declare myself innocent.</p>

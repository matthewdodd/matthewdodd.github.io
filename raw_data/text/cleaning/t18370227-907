                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On the 9th of February, I was employed to watch Mr. Summers' lug-boat that was alongside a barge at a wharf—about ten minutes before one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, who is a lighterman, standing on his own craft, which was along side the the lug-boat—he looked all round him about a couple of minutes, and then got out of his own craft into Mr. Summers' lug-boat—I saw him turn the tarpauling over which covered the sacks—he turned aside a bundle of empty sacks, and then turned a sack of barley out of the lug-boat into his own craft—I asked him what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing"—I told him he was; that he had taken a sack of corn out of the lug-boat and put it into his own—he said he had not—I said he had, and he should not go away till he put it back again—I got into the craft, took hold of him, and held him till he was in custody—he said if I would let him go, be would see me another day, and make me amends—I said I would not do any thing of the kind; that he had come to the wrong place—the corn was found in his boat.</p>

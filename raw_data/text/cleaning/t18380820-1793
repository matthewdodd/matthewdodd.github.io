               <p>out of the office money—there were two sums, I believe, paid to him of a guinea each—I did not pay both—the prisoner paid the other, believe—he stated to me that he did.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200034"></xptr>
               <p>cannot say whether I have said that before or not—the prisoner was not in the habit of transacting business on his own account in the office-nobody did so but Mr. Vincent—I went into the office in 1834—he never, to my knowledge, did any business in the office on his own account—he never did business for his own clients in the name of the firm—I will swear I know nothing about that—there was a book kept in the office with an account of causes, brought into the office by Shaw—that account was known to Mr. Vincent-a page of that book contained a list of causes brought into the office by Shaw—Mr. Vincent knew that—I do not know that they were called Shaw's causes—I never called them so—they were not called so—we called them by the names of the causes—I will not swear I never heard Mr. Vincent call them Shaw's causes—I might have done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many of those causes were there about the time he was arrested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were Bradley and Bradley, Wallis and Philpott, and Lee and Shaw—I believe those were all the Chancery causes—there were some writs he brought in—there might be eight or ten since he was in the office—I can<lb></lb>not say how many there were when he was arrested—I am not in the Common Law office—I think there were not so many as ten or twelve—there might be eight or nine—Mr. Vincent's clerks used to work them—I was not in the habit of receiving money from clients—I have received money—it was not usual for the clerks to receive money—they have done so when Mr. Vincent was out of the way—I did not know of the bill of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Bigg's till after Shaw went from the office, or that then had been such work done—it was before I went into the Chancery office—the prisoner was managing clerk, and I was a junior—that was the only instruction I got—I had to find out what I could myself—there was no<lb></lb>body in the office to instruct me-before this time it had been the custom to hand in to Mr. Vincent pieces of paper with sums of money received from different parties—I have done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now after doing so, has he forgotten it, and come and asked what it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to me—I have heard him come into the office and asked others what that money was—I have not heard him say he has lost the paper, and forgotten all about it—I have known such a thing as bills sent down to clients, and they have written up to say the money had been paid—I never heard from Mr. Vincent that he had received it and forgotten it—I never read an answer to that effect—I am not aware that the prisoner had any opportunity of accounting to Mr. Vincent, or giving any explanation, after he had been arrested.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

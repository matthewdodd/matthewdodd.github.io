            . I am a servant to Mess. Stansbury and Smith; I came into the shop while the two prisoners were sitting by the counter, looking at the cloaks; I was engaged with a lady, who bought a cloak of me; after the prisoners went out, I heard Mr. Smith say something to them; when they came in, they went on their knees; they seemed to shake themselves, and I saw a cloak drop from each of them; they were on their knees at the time; they begged forgiveness, and made a great noise, squalling out, while the hackney coach was getting ready to take them away.</p>

When I came down, I found the two prisoners sitting by the counter; White had a long scarlet cardinal on, which covered her child's head; I examined the cloaks, and found a figured cloak, as my servant had told me, was missing; when Matthews was out of the shop, I stopped them, and desired her to come in again; at that time White had left 6 d. earnest, saying, she had but 18 d. in her pocket; I told them. I wanted to speak to them; they said, they knew what I wanted, and went both on their knees, and begged for mercy for the sake of their children, crying, Mercy, mercy, mercy, which raised the whole neighbourhood; when they got up, the two cloaks lay as it were behind them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any thing lying on the floor before there?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, there were not; they were about six yards from the place where they had been shewed the cloaks.</p>
               <p>The prisoners in their defence said, if there were any cloaks on the ground, they fell from the counter, and begged mercy on account of their children.</p>

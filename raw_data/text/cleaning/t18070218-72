               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the loss of a pelisse. - A. Yes, from Mr. Brown's shop door; it hung partly in and partly out, I had seen it hang there about five minutes before it was taken away. About five o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at the end of the counter, and having an idea that something was pulled from the door, I went out, I saw it was missing; I saw some men at the corner of an alley, I ran to the alley, I saw the prisoner running up the alley with the pelisse under his arm, which he was endeavouring to put under his coat; I ran directly after him, he looked back and immediately dropped the pelisse; I called out stop thief, he ran to Grey Eagle street, Spital fields; he went in at a back door of that street. I attempted to go after him, I could not, the door was fastened; I went to the other door of the house, I was informed that he went into the house opposite. I went for the officer; he came and searched the house, he could not find him. In half an hour after that he was brought to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that he was the same man that you saw running away with the pelisse; I am positive of it. It is a cotton velvet pelisse, it is worth fifty shillings.</p>

               <p>I told him what I took him for; he said a man had given the pelisse to him in the street to carry. I took him to Mr. Brown's, when the last witness saw him he said he was the man.</p>

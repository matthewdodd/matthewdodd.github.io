The neighbours call'd out to me, that there were thieves in my house, upon which I got up, and call'd Rose! Keeper! and t'other dog's name - a young puppy that I have, and they all fell a roaring like mad. I then thought there could not be thieves in the house, but however I ran up stairs, and White was gone, I perceived; so I struck a light and went to the street door, and saw him (White) coming in. I ask'd him where he had been? He said he could not sleep, and had been to take a walk: What, says I, do you walk without shoes? He said he was very hot, so I took him in, and told him, he or somebody else had robb'd me, and I took a stick and 'nointed him heartily. After this I set him to work, and got a pipe of tobacco, and watch'd him a little while, and then I call'd up my foreman and went to bed. When I got up again, I order'd 1200 of bolt staves, which I knew the weight of, to be weigh'd over again; and then White desired my foreman to save him, and say there was an hundred weight more than there was. The foreman informing me of this, I told the boy, if my cane was a sword I would run him through, and ask'd him what he had done with the Iron, and he told me, Gray had got them in his house. Upon this I went to Justice Jones and got a search warrant; and when I came to Gray's house there he was sitting with his back against a closet, but I took him from thence, and found 96 lb. of my iron standing upright in the closet before me. When I had found my iron, Gray fell on his knees, and both he and his wife offer'd me a bond of 50 l. to let him go; but I told him he must expect nothing from me but what the law directed.</p>

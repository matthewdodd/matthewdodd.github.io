                  </hi>. I am sister to Joseph Feather, a tailor, in Bunhill-row. The prisoner worked for us about five weeks—she did not live in the house—I discharged her on the afternoon of the 30th of October—after she was gone Foster gave me information—I followed her, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner waiting in Chiswell-street—I asked her if she had any thing—she said, "No"—a little girl was with her, who had got the sleeves, and the prisoner had the other property about her—this is the cloth—it is called Lama cloth—it is worth 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—our foreman came up and took her to the station-house.</p>

The prisoner worked in the same factory—she told me she had been discharged in consequence of a piece of work between her and a little girl—she told me the coat was under the form—I saw her look under the form—she wanted me to be a party concerned in the robbery—I would not—I told another female, and then I told my mistress—I went out with her, and found the prisoner—we went to the bottom of Bunhill-row, and the prisoner said she had got nothing, but afterwards she said she had done it, and was very sorry—when she was at the station-house yard she took the remainder of the coat from her pocket.</p>

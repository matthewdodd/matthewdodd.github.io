On the next day I met the prisoner in Ratcliff Highway, with one chaldron of coals; after I unloaded the chaldron of coals, he gave me a seven shilling piece, and he asked me whether I had put the ticket in safe with the others, I said I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by putting the tickets where the other tickets were put? - A. The tickets of the coals are put in the lobby, where they clean boots in the yard. He gave me a ticket on the 14th, when I met him in the Minories, and desired me to put it in the brewhouse.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are one of the officers of Worship-street. In consequence of information that you received in May last, did you endeavour to apprehend the prisoner? - A. I did. I could not find him. I went to the infirmary, he was stated to be so ill that it would not be prudent to take him. I took him at Chatham. My warrant is dated in May. I went to the London Infirmary, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him at Chatham in the name of Fisher? - A. I did, and I read the warrant to him, he said he knew nothing of the charge. I brought him up to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was only entrusted with two loads, I went with one load to the stoke-hole,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040082"></xptr>and the next time I came, one of the horses threw two of his shoes, after I got in the gateway I took the horse off, and took him to Mr. Hanbury's farrier to put the shoes on; I went and searched for Jerry, but not finding him I began to unload the coals myself, at the coal-hole door. A man comes to me, and says, you must not shoot the coals here, we have left the stoke-hole to be filled. I unloaded the coals where the man ordered me; I fetched my horse, and the farrier gave me a receipt for two shillings for putting the horse's shoes on, which I gave to Mr. Back. I went with another load to the Haymarket, I met Mr.

             coming along the Haymarket as I was coming from my last load; how could I be in the Minories at that time. It is all a spiteful piece of business through Mr. Briant taking the wharf. Mr. Tunbridge said if he could do Mr. Briant an injury he would, if it cost him twenty guineas, therefore he has done this business to try to hurt Mr. Briant. A fellow-servant threw me against the cart and broke my ribs, that is how I went to the infirmary; I worked for Mr. Briant again on the next day, till that happened. Why did not Mr. Tunbridge apprehend me on that day. The next morning I was so bad I went to the hospital, they could only bleed me and bind me up, after they had done that I went to the door, I fainted away, the gentleman took me back, I stopped there a day and a night, then I went to a sister of mine, who lived in Dog-row, and stopped there a night. I went down to Chatham to see a friend of mine. I went to work there, at the King's work, at a guinea a week, I thought it was better than laying on my club for ten shillings a week. The way I went by the name of Fisher was, my father was drowned when I was five years old, my mother married a man of the name of Fisher. I was at Chatham till this gentleman came and asked me, if I was the person that delivered the coals at the French Horn. Todd said at the justice's he did not know me, and the man at the French Horn said that I was not the person. Am I not remarkable, think you gentlemen, would not all of you know me again.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Todd.) You saw the waggon go from the Minories to Crutched Friars. Did you see any body else with the waggon? - A. There was a man of the name of

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Bolland. I keep the French Horn, Crutched Friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I saw him once at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been stated to us that the prisoner at the bar, on the 14th of May, delivered to you two chaldron of coals? - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he without your knowledge deliver the coals? - A. No, that I am certain of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any coals delivered on the 14th of May? - A. Yes, I gave an order to Mr. Garford for five chaldron, I never received any more than two and a half. There was only one man that delivered the coals, he was at the tail of the cart and I was at the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the prisoner at the bar was the man? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never paid for the coals, nor has any man applied for payment? - A. No one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any application since Fleet was in custody to Mr. Briant to pay the money for the coals? - A. I believe I went to Mr. Briant, on the Coal Exchange, on the Monday following, when I heard they came by them dishonestly, I told him I would pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the person you deal with? - A. I deal with several.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever deal with Messrs Briant's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually receive a ticket when you buy coals? - A. Generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have a ticket when you had Garford's coals? - A. No, the man told me he would bring me two tickets together when he brought the other coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - A. No, I never saw him before nor after till I saw him in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had never employed him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Q. Did the prisoner ever apply to you for any money for the coals? - A. No, I have never seen the person since that I ordered them of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner that delivered them to you - A. I cannot swear whether it was or no, it is impossible, when a man comes with a black face to swear to him now. Garford had been a neighbour, he was a person employed in the India warehouse, I have bought coals of him before, they might come this way, but I do not know, he told me he had coals by contract.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Who else were there in the shop? - A. Mr. Willes, and John-Augustus Brookes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he your partner? - A. No; they were setting an account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You said nothing to this woman before she put this piece of cotton to the other side of the counter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not charged her with any thing? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you been serving upon that spot? - A. On the spot where the prisoner first came in, I had shewn a lady some things; but where the prisoner threw the print from her, was three yards from where the print had laid.</p>
               <p>Q. All that she did, was to remove this to the other side of the counter? - A. No; she had it between her thighs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280013"></xptr>Q. Did you see it between her thighs? - A. No. I saw her take it from there; she put her hand there, and the print flew from there to the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been sliding down, and she removed it up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not - do you mean to swear the print might not have slipped down on the side of the counter on which she was? - A. She was not near enough to catch it; if the print had been lying there, I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not come up to her? - A. Yes; I was standing close by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know any thing of this woman before? - A. No, I have never seen her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-FAIR WILLES sworn. - I am shopman to Messrs. Janaway and Brookes; I was standing at the farther end of the shop, and was desired by Mr. Janaway to pick up a piece of print, which I did; how it came there I do not know; I had my back towards her at the time.(John Hobbs, the officer, produced the property, which was identified by the prosecutors.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the piece of print till the gentleman picked it off the ground, and said, I meant to steal it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her an excellent character. GUILTY, aged 27.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Coakley. - A. Yes, he had worked with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the month of August, had he left your employ. - A. Three months before, I think he came to my shop about six weeks before that, and did some work, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a workshop have not you. - A. Yes, the house stands in the street, and the shop is built in my yard, between the house that I live in, and the next house in the next street, it all belongs to one landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the door of the workshop go to. - A. In the yard. On the 30th of August, about two o'clock, I and a young man that worked along with me went down to Blackwall, to see a ship launched. I had not been in the shop from two o'clock on the Saturday till about seven o'clock the next morning; I then observed a drawer on my bench, and another man's bench with many of the articles that should have been in them out, but nothing from that part gone, this gave me a suspicion; I looked about the place, I found there was a cramp gone, a stock, and four saws; I missed these at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a yard. - A. Yes, our common way of entering into the yard is through the house, but there is a gate that leads into the street, and there is a door by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what state you left that door. - A. I had not opened that door for two or three days, we do not open it only when we get timber in, if any person is in the yard they have free access to the shop; I did not observe any door or window broken open. I have seen some of the articles again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask my master to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was one circumstance which I think was rather to his advantage. A young child had been playing with a pair of boots the prisoner had of me, the child had dropped a silver tea-spoon in one of them without our knowledge, the prisoner took them home and returned the spoon. While he worked with me, his character was that of an honest man.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the second of September, and upon searching him, I found two duplicates; one is a duplicate of two saws, pledged at Mr. Tillier's in Field-lane, the other is a duplicate of another saw, pledged on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170047"></xptr>same day, the 1st of September, at Mr. Fleming's in Fleet-market; I asked Mr. Tillier if he knew the person that pledged them, he said yes. I went to Mr. M'Milian's and he swore to the property.</p>
               <p>- TILLIER sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I produce two saws, pledged by Gommersall, in the name of the White, for three shillings and sixpence, on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>- GOMERSALL sworn. I am in the East-London militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time pawn at Mr. Tillier's two hand saws. - A. Yes, on Monday, in the name of White, they gave me three shillings and sixpence on them. I got these saws from the prisoner, he gave them me on Monday about nine o'clock, for the purpose of pawning them, and he told me they were his own saws.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pawn them in his own name. - A. He told me that as he was a chair maker and was going to sell the tickets, he did not like his fellow tradesmen to know he was so poor. Mr. Tillier asked me whose they were? I told him they belonged to Coakley, he knew Coakley very well, and then he took them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood they were his. - A. Yes. On Sunday morning between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with these hand saws, he asked one Parkes and me in Field-lane, to wait there for him, he said he had some tools at his landlady's that he had left for some rent, and he went and fetched them. He said going along, Parkes, you did not think that I had got such good tools as these, as I was a soldier; I said that I did think that he had, because he had often told me that he had such tools; we carried them over Blackfriar's bridge, and left them at a public house. On Monday when we were at the parade, he said to me, Gomersall, come up to London with me. I want to pledge some of them tools, I went with him, we went into Fleet-market and pledged a saw, and I took two saws to Mr. Tillier's in Field-lane; I only pawned the saws for him. The next day he asked me to carry the things to Shoe-lane, I carried them up in the middle of the day to a public house in Shoe-lane. He then asked me to go to Mr. Tillier's, and ask him if he would take a cramp in pawn, I told him I should not go, as I did not understand what a cramp was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What hour did I ask you to go to Mr. Tillier's and pawn that cramp. - A. About five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go. - A. I did. Mr. Tillier would not take it in, he asked what this work was about the two saws. Previous to that time, Stanton had been to me, I told him the saws belonged to Coakley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in custody at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Stanton.) Did Gomersall tell you that the saws belonged to Coakley. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Gommersall) What time on Sunday morning was it that you separated from him. - A.The left of our parting was when he went to fetch the things from Mother Burke's house, when he came t, d - n her, says he, I have got the things from the old b - h, and I will not pay her a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Saturday night we were playing a game at back gammon, at a house of an acquaintance of his, where did you part with me at that time.</p>
               <p>A. At the public house door. He had got some money for some stools that we had been making, and he would not pay the reckoning, ; we quarrelled, and I was almost ready to fight with him, then he parted with half the money. There is one thing will prove that he is the person; he said that when he was at the gate he was stopped by the watchman of the night, he told them at the watch-house that he was a soldier and a cabinet-maker; the constable of the night let him go, he having his apron on.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, I produce two saws, pledged on the 1st of September; one was pledged by the prisoner to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- TURNER sworn. I took in the stock and one bit, on the 2d of September, on the early part of the day, which I suppose was pledged by the prisoner. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never pawned the articles, I believe I was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>TURNER. From the slight knowledge I have of him, I have no doubt. He told me at Hatton-Garden that he was in custody at the time, the magistrate told him he was apprehended in the afternoon, this was pledged in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>(The articles identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gomersall and I was both in one regiment and in one company. He was generally at me when I was working at Greenwich, to learn him my trade; the chief objection was, I had not tools when I was at Mr. M'Millan's place, he wanted me to take these tools, I said if such a thing happens, I shall be the only person to blame, I will have nothing to do with it. On the evening we came up from Greenwich, we were together till between twelve and one o'clock, the reason that we quarreled, I wanted to go home. I was sitting down looking on at them at back-gammon; I went to the Artillery passage and slept there two hours, he came and another man to me, he had these things; this man met him in Finsbury-square, if he was here, he he would prove that he met this man with the things this man asked him if he knew me, he told him that he knew me, and that he had left me asleep in Artillery-lane, they both came together and awoke me out of my sleep; I never knew a word of it till he brought them to me, though the pawnbroker says I pawned the tools. I never pawned any of the tools.</p>

On 1st July I went to No. 32, King Edward-street, Mile-end New-town—I went to the top room—the door was open—the prisoner was standing by the side of the fireplace—when I entered he threw something white from his right hand, and stamped on it—I took him into custody with the assistance of Groves—I picked up what the prisoner threw down—I found it was a half crown, very hot, and some pieces of the mould—I found twelve bad half crowns on the hearth, in front of the fire—there was a brisk fire, on which was a ladle with some melted metal in it—I searched the other parts of the room—I found some ladles, this bottle of liquid, some sand, a galvanic battery, and a file—I searched the prisoner, and found a bad half crown in his waistcoat pocket, in a finished state—there were some holes in the floor—I broke one up—the prisoner said, "It is no use your breaking the boards up, you will find nothing else"—I have known the prisoner some time—he used to live in George-street, but he then lived in that room—Mr. Phillips keeps the house.</p>

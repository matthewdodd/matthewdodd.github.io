Miss Henrietta Greene occupied a room at the back of the house, looking into the Park—I have the adjoining room, on the same landing. On the 24th of Aug., about half-past seven, I went up stairs into my own room—everything was then safe, and not disturbed—I left my room window open so that anybody could walk in—when I came out I shut the door—I noticed that Miss Greene's room door</p>

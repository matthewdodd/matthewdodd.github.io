                  </hi>. I live at 12, Queen-street, Horsleydown. On Monday morning, 18th Feb., I saw two ladies looking into a shop in Bishopsgate-street, and I saw the prisoner trying pockets—when be was trying the pockets his hand was uncovered—the ladies went to the next house, and then the prisoner put his hand under his own coat, and put his hand to the lady's pocket, and took something out and put it into his own pocket—I followed him down Threadneedle-street—I there saw him take some money out of his pocket and count it, and in Finch-lane I saw him take a piece of paper out of his pocket and chew it, and spit it out—I followed him to Cornhill.</p>

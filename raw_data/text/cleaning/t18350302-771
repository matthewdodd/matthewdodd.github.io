                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Portpool-lane. On the 16th of February, in the evening, I was coming out of my shop door—I saw the prisoner and two others in company pass my shop door—I followed them and heard the taller one say, "Go right past and go straight in"—I went on till they came to Mr. Lowe's door, where they made a full stop—I saw a policeman, and told him I thought their intention was to plunder the premises—I then saw one of the others go into the shop and the prisoner behind him—the prisoner came but with these calf skins, which he was rolling round—he crossed over to where I was—I went towards him and he dropped the skins—I took them up—he said they had been thrown at him by a boy, and he was running as hard as he could to give them to the first policeman—I took him to Mr. Lowe's parlour—he was not at home, but Mrs. Lowe was—he fell on his knees and asked her to forgive him, and said it was the first time.</p>

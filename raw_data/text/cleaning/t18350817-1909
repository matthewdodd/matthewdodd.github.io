                  </hi>. I live at No. 12 1/2, Bolingbroke-row, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 19th of June, I was in my back parlour—I had occasion to go into my shop—I observed the prisoner and another at the window—one of them had his finger through a hole previously made in the square—it was not the prisoner, but they were standing together—I went to the door quietly, and they both walked away together—I took hold of them, but could not told both, and the prisoner got away from me—I was more anxious to secure the other—I missed a gold watch, worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., (it cost 12 guineas,)and two silver watches, worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of them was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—were safe in the window at eight o'clock in the evening, five or six inches from the pane of glass—the glass was safe then—I observed the fingers of the other man through the hole—that attracted my attention—I found a hole in the glass on my return—I am quite certain of the prisoner being the man who escaped from me—?I never expressed a doubt of him—I said I would rather not swear to him once, because I understood there were two charges against him, and I had so much trouble in prosecuting the other man that I did not wish to have the trouble against, but I was quite confident he was the man—they were standing close together, both looking in at the win<lb></lb>dow, and the other had his hand through the glass.</p>

I was returning home with my wife about eight o'clock—I was in Bolingbroke-row, and saw Lawrence struggling with two men—one of them escaped—I saw his figure and appearance—the prisoner resembles the man who escaped in figure and resemblance—my opinion is, he was about his height, age, and figure—I did not see his face; he was dressed like that man.</p>

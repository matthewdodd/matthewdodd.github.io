            . I said he was not within, but if he had any thing to say to him he might communicate it to me, and I would acquaint him with it. He went away, and in a very few minutes returned, and without any ceremony came up to the table where I sat, threw down the candle from the table, and put the light out. He then offered a paper, which I suppose was to amuse me while he seized me. He seized me, and demanded my watch and money; which I told him he should have, and gave him the watch, which was a gold one, in a shagreen case, with a cornelian seal to it. I gave him a guinea in gold, three or four shillings in silver, an old shilling, and a square piece of silver, with the marshal De Surely's name on it. Then he threatened greatly what he'd do, if I attempted to hinder his getting off. He went then out at the door, and I bolted it after him, and call'd out thieves, and I believe murder, and every thing I could, to induce people to stop him; but upon hearing no more of him I went to justice Fielding, and described his person. The description was thus: '' A young man, middle size, slender, with something '' remarkable on his face, either a scald or '' small-pox, or other distemper or accident, his '' face being very red.'' * I saw him at justice Fielding's five weeks and a day afterwards. He was taken up by a pawnbroker, in attempting to pawn this watch.</p>
               <p> * The prisoner answered all the descriptions, except that of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it to be the same person that came the second time?</p>
               <p>Harper. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him then?</p>
               <p>Harper. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Harper. Yes, I did, very well. He was an apprentice part of his time to a stationer, that is employed to write for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he disguised?</p>
               <p>Harper. From what I observed since, I believe he was. I believe he had some skin or paint put over the lower part of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think with regard to his voice?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't say I could believe it to be his, or any other particular person's voice.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of Russel-Court. On the 21st of January, about eight in the evening, or a little after, the prisoner brought a watch to me to pawn. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor to be the same watch he delivered to the person who demanded it, the 28th of December, &amp;c.) I was in the parlour, and saw the watch delivered to the boy. The prisoner wanted three guineas and a half upon it. I said to the boy bring the book, that is, a book in which we set all the watches down we find advertised to be stolen. There I saw, Lost a gold watch, a shagreen case, name

He said, it was his father's, that he was dead, and his mother had given it to him. I said, here is a watch advertised like this, but no number; this may not be the watch, but it is described very nearly. Then he said, I'll call to morrow morning. I said, it is but a little way to go to enquire, you may as well go with me now. He was going out, and I laid hold on his coat. He said, don't hold me. Going to justice Fielding's, where it was advertised, I took hold of him, and we went hand in hand. About fifty or sixty yards before we got there, he got away from me, about four or five yards. I said, this does not look well to want to run away. Then he said, I beg you will not take me to justice Fielding. I took him there, and the justice sent for Mr. Harper, who came, and swore to the watch in the prisoner's presence. Mr. Fielding asked the prisoner where he had the watch. He said, the person he had it of should be nameless, for reasons best known to himself.</p>

               <p>I bought this watch. I'll read a paper how I came by it. (He reads a paper as follows:) '' I '' happened to go to Johnson's coffee-house, in '' Johnson's-Court, Charing Cross, on Friday the '' 17th of January, 1757, in the morning about '' eleven o'clock, where a person sitting opposite '' to me happen'd to read an advertisement of a '' person on Snow-Hill, or Ludgate-Hill, I can't '' say which, giving the full value for any thing '' that was pledged. He said, he thought a watch '' and such things were unnecessary on board a '' ship, and therefore would dispose of them at the '' aforesaid place. I said, I believed they would '' never advance so much money by half, as the '' commodity was worth, and that it was better '' to sell them outright; for as he was going on '' ship board he could not take them out again '' before the time was past, in which they were '' to be redeemed; then they would be unavoidably '' lost. He seem'd to acquiesce to what I said, '' and immediately pull'd out a watch from his '' pocket, and shew'd it me. I said, I am no '' judge, but if we could agree about the price, I '' would buy it of him; so I gave him a written '' direction where to find me, which was at Mr. '' Boyden's, in Plough Court, Fetter-Lane. He '' came to me the Sunday following, and left me '' the watch; saying, he would call again at night. '' He accordingly came, and took the watch '' with him. I put on a pair of shoes, and went '' to him immediately where he ordered, which '' was at the Black-Raven, Fetter-Lane, just '' opposite. I paid him 4 l. 10 s. there for it. I '' have a receipt here to produce for the money. '' That is the same watch which I offered to '' pawn. The name of the person I bought it '' of was John Green. I believe he is now at sea. '' I never saw him before, or since. I have fourteen '' or fifteen persons here to my character.''</p>

               <p>Boyden. No, I know nothing of his acquaintance. I serv'd my time to the same gentleman that he did part of his. I had employed him about a fortnight before he was taken up, and he behaved extremely well. I look upon him to be a very sober, diligent, honest man. I remember I had been out and heard of this robbery, and when I came home I told him of it, and he seem'd to be very much surprised at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure whether he was in your house all that night, the time of the robbery?</p>
               <p>Boyden. No, I cannot. He wrote by his own choice that night, but whether all night, I can't say. One Sunday I had been to take a walk, and when I came back the prisoner had been writing some skins for me. There hung a yellow watch by him. I asked him what watch that was. He said a young man had lent it to him to write by.</p>

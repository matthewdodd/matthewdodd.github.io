            . I live with Mr. George, a sugar-baker, in Deal-street. On Saturday, the 18th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I met Jones near Whitechapel church; there were two other females with her, but I do not know whether Baxter was one - I went home with Jones to <placeName id="t18320405-138-crimeloc834">Wentworth-street</placeName>

            , (Police-constable H 135.) I took the prisoners; some money passed from Jones to Baxter, and some fell on the ground - whether it dropped or not, I cannot tell; I found on Jones, one half-crown, two sixpences, and 8d. in copper; and on Baxter, one shilling, two sixpences, and 6d. in copper; the money, fell on a grating - I do not know whether any went down.</p>
               <p>Baxter's Defence. As soon as I got to the room he got up and came away; I did not receive any money from Jones - I had half a crown when I met them.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. He gave me 3s. 6d., and sent for some gin; we went out, and got some more - I then asked him to let this young woman come in; I went out to buy a candle, and dropped 1d. - he wanted me to give him the money back; I would not - I said he might stop with me.</p>

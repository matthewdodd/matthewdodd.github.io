            . I am watchman to Messrs. Walker and Co. On the 5th of March, the barge came to the wharf; I went on duty at ten o'clock at night, there was 300 pigs of lead there then; I counted them; I saw them all safe at half-past two, and missed three pigs, about five o'clock in the morning - They were taken from one pile.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. On the 7th of March, I was walking by the river side, at Millbank, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, and saw a peter-boat, come under Vauxhall-bridge. When I came up, two men where in the boat, putting some lead ashore; the prisoner was in a cart, which was coming along the road; he stopped exactly opposite the boat. I went to the public-house for assistance, then went to the cart and stopped it, with the lead it; it was coming towards Westminster. I took three pigs of lead out of the cart-the prisoner was driving it; we desired him to stop; he wished to go on, and whipped his horse; we stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the service of Mr. David Williams Wire, who lives at Stone-house in the Lewisham-road—he and his family left town on Thursday, 23d Aug.—I secured the house that night, and went to bed at the usual time—I saw that the plate and other articles were safe when I went to bed—I came down next morning about six o'clock—I then discovered that some person had been in the house, and missed a good deal of my master's property.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 40). On Friday morning, 24th Aug., about six o'clock, I was on duty near Lewisham, and saw the prisoner with a bundle—I stopped him, and asked where he was going to—he said, "To Greenwich"—I asked where he came from—he said, "Greenwich"—I said, "What have you got in your bundle?"—he said, "That is my business"—I said, "I must look"—he said, "Oh, certainly you shall"—he put the bundle down and began to untie it, and as he was stooping I saw part of the plate sticking out of one of his pockets behind—I took him to the station, searched him, and found in bis pocket this plate (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it</hi>)—in the bundle I found a time-piece, a black frock coat, two towels, and a variety of other things—in consequence of what I heard, I soon after went to Mr. Wire's house, and there found an upper window unfastened and open—there is a spout outside, which would enable a person to climb up to that window—he had then tied a stair-carpet to the banisters and let himself down a well-staircase; that would give him access to all the bottom part of the house—I could see on the water-spout the marks of the nails of shoes which were made in the person's climbing up, and the spout, which was a zinc one, was pushed out of its place—the house is in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford.</p>

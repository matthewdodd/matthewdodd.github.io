            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor, and heard one of them call out, "What right had you in my room?" I ran up; they had hold of each other; I took hold of Brown, and the prisoner ran away directly - Brown then told me he had been robbed; I let him go; he ran up the yard after the prisoner, then returned, and I went with him and Phillips to Duck-yard; I knocked at the door very loud, received no answer, and burst it open - the prisoner was on the bed, and said he had been asleep; I took him to the watch-house, and in his waistcoat pocket found the money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called, about half-past four o'clock, by Dempsey - Brown said that he had been robbed of two half-crowns and seven shillings - we broke the door open; the prisoner was on the bed, with his clothes on - I asked why he did not open the door; he said he was fast asleep - I looked round, and he bolted out of the room; Dempsey met him at the door, they closed, struggled, and both fell; I ran out, and took hold of the prisoner; he seized my lantern, and broke it in pieces - he begged of me to let him go - we took him to the watch-house; he swore we should not search him; he then pulled out two half-crowns and seven shillings in a purse - I knew him; he is a pauper in the workhouse - Brown was sober.</p>

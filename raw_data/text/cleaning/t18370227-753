                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. I was in Holborn, with a friend, opposite the Bell and Crown, on Tuesday, the 28th of February, between a quarter and half-past six o'clock—I felt what appeared to me to be a man's hand in my pocket—I turned round immediately, putting one hand on my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I then turned round on the right and saw the prisoner within arm's length, I should say, and no one near him—he was just starting from the pavement—I ran and caught him about three or four paces off, and charged him with the theft, which he denied—I brought him back, and on my return I saw my handkerchief lying on the curb, just by the spot where we had just left the pavement—I took him into the shop of Mr. Cross, the map-seller, about ten or twenty yards off, and sent for a police<lb></lb>man—it is impossible the handkerchief could have dropped out of my poc<lb></lb>ket—in coining from Holborn-hill I put it into my pocket with considerable care, having mentioned to my friend that there had been so many robberies about there.</p>

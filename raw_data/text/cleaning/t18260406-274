            . I live at No. 3, Union-place, Orchard-street, Westminster. From Tuesday last to Thursday last the prisoner was in my room making a pigeon-house; I am quite certain of it - his mother gave him the wood - he had taken medicine, which caused him to be rather ill; he went to his mother after he left me - he lives at home with his mother - he left me about seven o'clock on Thursday last.</p>

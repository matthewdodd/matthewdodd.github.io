On the 14th of June, about eight o'clock at night, I went out to sell some apparel - I locked my door; I came home at half-past one o'clock in the morning, and as I came along the back passage, I found a lot of things under my feet - I had entered at the back door, which was locked when I went out, but I found it broken open; I found under my feet some coats, waistcoats, and trousers - four times as many as are here; I had left some of them hanging on lines in the kitchen, but more on shelves - I proceeded into my kitchen, and said, "Who is here?" the prisoner answered,"It is me, John, that has come in before you;" he had worked in my place at the tayloring business for the last six months, but had no business there then - he had left work about seven o'clock, and was to come again on the Monday; I sang out to Sellers, who lives in the shop over me, that there was a thief in my kitchen - Sellers came down, undressed; a light was procured - he told me to take care of the prisoner, while he fetched a constable, but while he was gone, the prisoner escaped out of the front door; I knew his voice very well when he spoke - Sellers and the constable came to my place; they went in pursuit, and took him at the bottom of Monmouth-street - he had got in by forcing the staple out of the door; the constable has eight of the articles found in the passage -I am sure they are mine, and that they were in the kitchen when I went out that night.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went with Sellers at half-past one o'clock in the morning, to look after the prisoner, and found him about thirty yards from the prosecutor's door, among a crowd of people - he said,"What do you take me for?" I said, "On a charge of breaking open McCarthy's door;" he told me he knew that - when he came out, he said he would do for Sellers, McCarthy, and us, and that he would serve us out; I took him to the watch-house, and returned to McCarthy's - I found the greatest confusion in his room, and a quantity of clothes in the passage; I have brought five pairs of trousers, two waistcoats, and a coat here.</p>

               <p>- SELLERS. I rent the shop and parlour in this house. The prosecutor called me - I went down, and saw the prisoner there; I am certain he is the man -I knew him before; I had a light, and heard what he said to the prosecutor - when I came back he was gone.</p>

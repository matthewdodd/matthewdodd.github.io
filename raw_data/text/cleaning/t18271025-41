            . I am a silk-mercer, and live in Cheapside; the prosecutor came into my shop with Humphries; he was very much intoxicated, and asked for a handkerchief; he chose one, which came to 3s. 6d.; I cut it off, and then they made some scruple about the price; both said they would not give more than 2s. 6d.; I said I should not take less - they were both intoxicated, but the man was most so; I went to the end of the counter for some paper to wrap it in, and thought she was taking my handkerchiefs; I found his watch was gone; she immediately went out; Dent was outside the window - I saw Humphries give her the watch - she put it into her pocket, and Humphries returned into the shop; I had seen Dent standing outside, but did not particularly notice her - I did not see her come to the door with them; the prosecutor had not sufficient money to pay for the handkerchief; I insisted on his leaving; I asked if the woman belonged to him, and said, "I suppose you are aware she had taken your watch, and delivered it to the other one outside;" he began to swear; I could not leave the shop, but went to the door, and called Dent three times; she declared she had not got the watch; Humphries said, "Come, we will go to the public-house where we were before," and they went away.</p>

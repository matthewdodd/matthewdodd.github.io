On the 1st of June the two prisoners came and asked me for some bonnet ribbons - I showed them some, but they did not like them; I then produced a basket of ribbons - they chose one, and told me to cut off two yards, which came to 6d.; they had but 51/2d. between them - they told me to put the money and the ribbon by, and they would call again for it; they then went out, and a young man went after them, but I did not know what for - I have since seen two pieces of ribbons, which are part of what had been in the basket; the shop-mark is on them - I had not sold either of them to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How long was it before you saw them? A. Not an hour; there were some other customers in the shop; there might have been forty- I believe there were persons on the opposite side of the shop.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. I saw Robertson lay the corner of her shawl on the counter, where I saw a piece of pearl-white ribbon; she then drew her shawl off the counter, and I missed the ribbon at the same time - the prisoners then went out; I followed them out of the door - I there took hold of Robertson, and said she must come back; I did not charge her with any thing at that time - this piece of pearl-white ribbon was picked up in the kennel, about a yard from where she was; I then took hold of Milton, and this piece of green ribbon fell from under her arm - I saw the end of it under her arm, and the roll fell on the pavement; these ribbons have our shop-marks on them - I took the prisoners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080032"></xptr>to the passage, and Robertson went down on her knees; I think it was about twelve yards from the door that the green ribbon fell down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not go into the street, and charge them with having taken the ribbon? A.No; Robertson did not throw open her shawl, and say, "I have no property of yours;" I am certain of that - I did not ask her for the length of white ribbon; I am not aware that I swore that before the Magistrate - this is my signature; I believe this deposition was read over to me, but it is not correctly taken - it is a very bad systemed office; Milton was about three yards from the door when the end of the ribbon was under her arm, and the roll in the street - the end of the shawl covered the pearl ribbon; it might fall on the counter, and be over the goods - Miss Day was directly before them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the ribbon was picked up a yard from Robertson, was Milton as near to it as she was? A. No - if it had been swept down by the shawl it would have fallen in the shop, and it was picked up two yards out of the shop; the ribbon was taken up in their presence, and given to me before they were taken to the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a constable of Broad-street. On the 23d of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another in <placeName id="t18270531-314-crimeloc1687">Cornhill</placeName>

I do not know the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he out of your sight? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had bought the handkerchief on Monday, and gave 2s. 6d. for it - I put it into my hat, and was going down the Old Jewry; this man came and took me - the handkerchief has a blue stain on it; I got into conversation with the other lad, and he went to the pump.</p>

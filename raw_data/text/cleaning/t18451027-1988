                  </hi>. I live at 27, Queen-street, Brompton, in the parish of St. Mary Abbots, Kensington. I have an aunt named Sarah Walton, residing in the house—on Saturday, 26th of July, the prisoner came to look at apartments which were to let on the drawing-room floor—I said I had another apartment on the second floor, he said that would do—I asked him for a reference—he gave me one to Mr. John Lee, his uncle, at the Travellers' Club, Pall-mall—I said I could not take him in until Monday—he said he should not want to come in then, if so soon—he wrote his name down, I have not got it—I afterwards received two letters, one on Monday evening—I afterwards spoke to him respecting that one—this is it—before I received it I had made inquiry at the Travellers' Club—I told him the result of my inquiries, that his uncle's name was spelt differently at the club, as the porter at the club told me—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Monday morning—Not knowing whether you have inquired respecting my uncle, as I should with you to, inquire about the name as Legh—Lee, our name, is distinguished from the Cheshire family, as for Stoneleigh, which by inquiry of the porter you will find")—I ascertained that there was a gentleman at the club from Cheshire, whose name was Legh—I said, "They say the name is spelt differently, but they know nothing of the younger branches"—he said it was reversionary property which caused his uncle to change his name—I thought that a sufficient explanation, and took him—he occupied the apartment for three weeks—on Sunday morning, 17th of Aug., my aunt went to church about eleven o'clock, leaving me in the house—about a quarter after eleven o'clock, the prisoner came down stairs, and asked the servant, "Ann, can Miss Rice give me change for a sovereign?"—I said, "No, I could not"—he called out, and said, "Perhaps, Miss Rice, you would like to see the newspaper?"—I said, "Yes"—he brought me down the paper, and then sent the girl out for change for a sovereign—she returned soon after—the prisoner was in the passage when she came in—he gave her seven shillings for herself, and went out—he had taken his writing-desk to be repaired the week before, and he told her, as he went out, to take it in if it was brought back—he paid fifteen shillings a week for his lodging, and extra for breakfast—he paid me a sovereign and sixpence that morning, for one week—he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note Co take the rent out of—that was before the robbery—there was no one in the house from the time my aunt went out and came home, except myself and the servant—when my aunt came home she complained of losing her money—I went into her room—herdesk was in the back top room—the prisoner's apartment was the room under it—I saw her desk after she came home—the papers were pushed away from the drawer of the desk where the motley had been—the drawer was open, it does not lock—the desk had been locked, it was forced open, and the money gone—I saw none there—the desk was locked again, and my aunt opened it with another key—sne could not open it with her own key—I tried it—the prisoner wore purple spectacles.</p>

I never saw the prisoner in the house—I met him once coming out of his room, but did not look at him—this is my desk—it was in my room on Sunday morning, 17th Aug.—in the top drawer inside the desk I had twenty-five sovereigns, four half-sovereigns, four half-crowns, ten shillings, four sixpences, and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I had occasion to go to the drawer before I went to church, and the money was then safe—I did not examine it to see if there was the same quantity as before—some was in a box, and some loose in a paper—I saw the sovereigns and notes safe at that time—I unscrewed the box—I am quite sure the notes and sovereigns were safe—I went up stain about two o'clock, and tried a drawer standing against the desk, it was deranged a good deal—I saw the cover of the desk a little bit lifted up—I took the keys and tried to open the desk, but could not—my niece was coming up to clean herself—she took the keys—the key which used to open it would not, but another little key opened it—I then opened the top drawer, and all the money was gone—I had taken all my keys to church in my pocket—I had been home from church an hour before I found it out—the lodgers are not here—there was nobody in the house but the prisoner, the servant, and my niece—the widow and her daughter had gone to church, and had not come home—I believe they had come home when I discovered my loss.</p>

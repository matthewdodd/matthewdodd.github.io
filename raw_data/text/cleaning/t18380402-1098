                  </hi>. I am a widow, and carry on business as a house-agent in Park-street, Grosvenor-square. The prisoner, Mary Glover, came into my service on the 14th of December—on the 19th I went out, and when I came home at night I found her gone, and she had taken her box with her—she had given me no notice at all—I missed part of my property very soon after she left—I did not miss the stockings—she was brought to my house three weeks ago last Sunday night, in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 18th of March I went to Wild-court, Drury-lane, and watched a public-home there—I saw the two prisoners come out, in company with another man and woman—they all went up into Oxford-street, and at the end of Marylebone-lane, the male prisoner and the other persons draw back, and the female prisoner went up the lane, in company with another young man—they left her in Little George-street, and she ran down to No. 21, King-street—I went up to her to the area-gate, and said I had a letter for her—she said, "From whom?"—I said, "From a gentleman named Williams"—(I was in my private dress)—I asked her if her name was not Fanny Glavin—she said, "No, Glover"—I asked if she had ever lived with Mrs. Marsh—she said, "Yes"—I then said I was an officer, and she was in my custody for robbing her—she said it was not very likely she should rob her—I took her to Montague-square, and the male prisoner came up, and asked me what I was doing with his sister—I had him given into custody, and took her to Mrs. Marsh—I found the male prisoner at the station-house when I returned—he said he lived at No. 12, Wild-court, and the female said she lived at No. 21, King-street, Portman-square, in service—I and Mrs. Marsh went to No. 21, King-street, and a per<lb></lb>son there named Reddick, who was the master of the prisoner, to whom she wished me to go, gave me these keys—they opened a box in the house, and in it I found three stockings, which were identified by Mrs. Marsh—I after<lb></lb>wards went to No. 12, Wild-court, and there found two men and a female, and a large trunk, locked—I could not open it, and desired the woman there to give me the keys, which she did—I believe her to be the prisoner's mo<lb></lb>ther—I then opened it, and found a smaller trunk, with two cups and ameers, the plates, and other things—I went to another house opposite, and found these two cups, a saucer, and a piece of net.</p>

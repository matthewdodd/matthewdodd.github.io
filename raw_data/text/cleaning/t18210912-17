            . I live with Mr. Paley, at No. 76, Holborn-bridge. On Friday, the 11th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was going from my master's house down Newgate-street, and saw the prisoner, in company with another person; they followed me at some distance, then went before me, and crossed the way - I suspected, and watched them; they followed a gentleman, who was going towards Cheapside; they looked about them, and then left him. Another gentleman came down the street, going towards Skinner-street - they turned, and followed him; he went down Butcherhall-lane, they left him, went towards Cheapside, and followed another gentleman, and as I crossed into <placeName id="t18210912-17-crimeloc95">Cheapside</placeName>

I seized him, and took him into Crawford's shop, undid his breeches, and took it out. I ran, but could not find the gentleman. I do not know who he was. I have seen the prisoner's companion since.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner in Crawford's shop.</p>

I had left my master in St. Ann's-lane, and came to Newgate-street, to look for my sister; I could not find her, returned towards Cheapside, and two young men, taller than myself, dropped the handkerchief. I picked it up, called after them, then blew my nose with it, and put it into my breeches.</p>

            . I was married to the prisoner at Shoreditch, on the 14th of November, 1819. I have one child by him, and am now in the family way. He lived about two years at first with me; then left me in distress without a penny to buy bread; he returned to me about seven months ago, and left me in the family way again, after saying he had a comfortable home for me. He went by the name of

             when he married me; I heard he was married before, and told him of it; he said she was only a kept woman, this was some time after I married him. I was acquainted with him for three months before I married him. I had no fortune, I believed him to be single; my uncle was foreman in Bishopsgate-street, were he worked as a tailor; he pawned the ring off my finger and my clothes, and then deserted me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner in a long address to the Court, contended that the first marriage was not proved, as the clerk must have forgotten his person, and that the attesting witnesses and clergyman should be called.</p>

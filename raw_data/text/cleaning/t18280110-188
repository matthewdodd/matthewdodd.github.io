On Thursday last, a little after five o'clock, I, and another officer, saw the prisoner, and several others, near the shop - the prisoner went up to the shop, took hold of a basket in his hand, and tried to lift it from a hook - he tried three times, and the fourth time he got down a basket and a shallow; we took him four or five yards of with this basket - the shallow he had dropped.</p>

These baskets were brought into my shop - I could not swear to them; I had two such baskets hanging up in the morning, when I went out - I returned in the evening, and found fault with my boy for not having taken them down; the officer then came and brought them in - I believe they are what were hung up in the morning, and they were so hung that one would fall in taking them down.</p>

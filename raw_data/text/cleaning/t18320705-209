            . I am a builder. The prisoner gave me this watch-movement on the Thursday night after the fire; I had spoken to him, in consequence of having heard that some things had been taken, and he brought this watch-movement, and stated it was all he had got, except a ring, which appeared more like a brass ring than any thing else - I had employed him to remove the rubbish of the fire, and what was found he was to give to me, as I was in possession for the Westminster Fire-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Did you give him instructions to give all he found to you? A. Yes: I desired all who were there to put all they found in a fireplace-I do not know that I desired the prisoner in particular.</p>

I saw the prisoner with this gold chain, a silver chain, and this watch, which he took out of his pocket in Mr. Smart's shop: I work for Mr. Burgess, but I was not at this job - the prisoner told me he had picked up these things in Soho-square, where Mr. Burgess' cart shot the rubbish; Mr. Smart objected to buy the watch, and he took that and some other things to Mr. Sharp's, and delivered them at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was it you saw in possession of the prisoner? A.

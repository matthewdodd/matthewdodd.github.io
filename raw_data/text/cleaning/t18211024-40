            . I am a patrol. I searched the prisoners' house in consequence of a warrant; the male prisoner was in custody at the time, but I did not know it. I searched the house three times. The first time I searched nobody was there; I found various articles there the first time, part of which I produce. I have a list of the articles which I brought away. Here are (producing them) five shirts, two silk handkerchiefs, four silver spoons - three tea and one salt spoon - five pillow-cases, five pair of silk stockings, and I found a pair of new silk stockings rolled up in a paper, directed to Mr. Rothschild; and four muslim handkerchiefs, that is all I found on the first search, which was on the 29th of August; the house was shut up then, there are only two rooms, part was found in a trunk in the upper room, and part concealed under the bed; there was three or four bolsters, and six or seven pillows. On removing the bed-clothes there were parcels of property. I saw Barrett at Mr. Bevill's door on the 29th of August, and said, in his hearing that I had found a great quantity of fine linen in his house, which could not, I thought, belong to a man of his description; he pulled out his shirt and said "I always wear fine linen." I went again to the house on the 30th, and found his wife there, Lappan went with me; we went up stairs and she was in the room. Lappan was there before me and let me in. I made further search about the bed; and found eight cut glass rummers. I found in the bed twenty-two towels and napkins, three sheets, five night-caps, two table-cloths, three cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, six muslin neck-handkerchiefs, five pair of silk stockings, and one pair new, in a paper. I am not able to say what was found the first time. The shirts, handkerchiefs, and sheets were found the first day I know, and on the second day I found the napkins and towels. When I came to one particular towel, she said, "That's my own." She then said, "I will give you anything to desist from making further search." I afterwards found four white Marseilles waistcoats, two shifts, three pillowcases, two pin-cloths, a childs's shirt, four volumes of Classic Tales, one with Mr. Rothschild's name in it, and a lady's tortoiseshell writing-desk. Barrett claimed a pair of breeches, gaiters, watch, spoons, and other things which I found at the house, and he wished the key of the house to be given to his daughter. I found a child's coral head there the first time, and some knives and forks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. On the 29th you told Barrett you had found shirts finer than he could have - A. Yes, and the next day I found his wife at the house, she was at large.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you find the knives and forks - A. I found twenty-seven knives and forks, on the second day. I made a third search on the 31st, and found twenty-seven China plates, thirteen China saucers, forty-four blue and white plates, and four jugs; the plates were packed in five or six different hampers with hay, and full of glass and China.</p>

            . I am one of the horse patrol of Bow-street. I was with Joss at the second search, I got there before him, and found Mrs. Barrett there - Joss came in a quarter of an hour after, I told Mrs. Barrett, I was come to search the house again; I had been present at the first search; at the second search a variety of articles were found. When we were turning the napkins over, she said one was her own, and on searching further she said, "Pray do not search any more, and I will give you something for yourselves," I was present at the third search, and I made a fourth search on the Saturday, and only found a few small things; some clothes were found, which Barrett claimed, also the keys of the house.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of August, he spent the evening with us, and at half-past one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240022"></xptr>o'clock in the morning left me in one of the rooms, where I had been sitting, and wished me good night to go to bed, I did not see him again at daylight, Mrs. Barrett, was generally the first person up in the family. I saw the property produced at the office, here are some towels with my master's name on them, they were under my care, and in daily use, the marks have been picked out of some of the things. I often missed things from time to time, but did not mention it, as I thought they might be left at the town house. I kept the linen in a press in my bedroom.

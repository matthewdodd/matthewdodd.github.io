                  </hi>. I am a seaman. My ship was lying at Bell Wharf, at Yardsley—I had a bag and hammock at the Plough public-house, Kidney<lb></lb>stairs—I have known the prisoner twelve years—he heard me say my things were there—I afterwards went there and found they were gone from there—I received, information from a waterman-went to Phillips's at Shad well, and found my things there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Plough public-house, at Kidney-stairs. The prisoner came to me and asked if there was a hammock and bag left at my house—I said there was—he wished to see it, and said it belonged to him—he asked what there was to pay for it—I said sixpence—he said he had no money, and must go and borrow it—in about two hours he brought a waterman with him, paid the sixpence, and I gave him the bundle—it contained the articles belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. My ship had gone away and left me, and taken away my clothes—I did not know where they were left—I asked the gentleman if a hammock and bag were left there—he said, "Yes, and sixpence to pay"—I went to Mr. Phillips to borrow sixpence, and he sent a man with me to fetch them—I thought they were my own which had been left there—the prosecutor came after me in about an hour or two, and said I had taken his—I had not left my things there, but I inquired at different houses for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop in High-street, Shadwell. The pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked me to cash a seaman's note for him—I said I had no objection, and asked him where his clothes were—he said he had a ham<lb></lb>mock and bag at Kidney-stairs, Ratcliffe-cross, and there was sixpence to pay on it—he asked me to go with him—I sent a waterman with him to fetch them and gave him sixpence—I went out, and when I came home they were brought to my house—my wife gave him a shilling-in the even<lb></lb>ing he came and asked me to give him another shilling, which I did—he then said, "I want a clean shirt out of it," which I gave him, and in half an hour the prosecutor came and claimed them-a seaman's note is given by a captain on the faith that a man will come on board and serve the voyage—we generally ask if they Lave clothes on board, because sometimes they leave the ship, and then the note is not paid.</p>

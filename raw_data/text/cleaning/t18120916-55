               <p>Q. How long before you missed the seal and key had you seen it safe - A. A few minutes before I saw the prisoner I was passing through Smithfield. Miles's caravan was coming in with the wild beasts. The caravan was drawn by eight grey horses. The caravan stopped, and I stopped to look at the caravan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near you - A. No. I had my hand on my watch, in my fob. I felt a little tug at my watch. I cast my eyes down. I saw the prisoner's hand pass from my fob, and I missed my seal and key. The prisoner turned round to make off. I seized him. I saw the prisoner throw the seal, key, and scissars on the ground. A witness here picked them up. In the mean time an officer took the prisoner out of my hands. It was a family seal. I valued it at seven shillings, and the key sixpence.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the last witness pick up the seal and key and scissars. In taking the prisoner to the Compter, the prisoner threw a scissar-sheath away. I picked it up. It fits the scissars; and the ribbon which remains on the prosecutor's watch corresponds with that cut off. I produce the seal and key.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my seal and key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was standing by at the time as the mob of people were. It is true I was at the side of the gentleman there. When I was walking away he came after me, and said, he had lost his seal. I said, I did not know any thing of it. A tall man passed me, and made a rush, which almost knocked me down, and then these things were found.</p>

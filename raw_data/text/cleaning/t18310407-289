I was there about twelve o'clock in the day on the 5th of March; I fastened the doors when I left; I received some information in about half an hour, and returned; I looked through the parlour window, and saw the prisoner in the parlour, with a stove in his hand; I put the key into the lock, and heard a bolt-shot on the other side - I broke a pane of glass, unfastened the window, and got in; I saw him going out at the back door; he went down the garden - some persons met him, and he jumped into the common sewer; I followed him; he got out, went over a wall, and across a nursery-ground - he was afterwards taken - the stove had been taken out of its place, and set behind the parlour door; I had lost a grate from the same house on the Saturday before - a key was given to me by one of the witnesses, which opened the door very easily.</p>

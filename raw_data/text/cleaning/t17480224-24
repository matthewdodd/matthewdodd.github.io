This sword was taken from Harding, the evidence, and he said it cost a halfpenny: I asked him what he did with it; he said they made use of it to lift up windows, and get any thing they could come at, and to cut any body that should oppose them. I believe your Lordship will find them to be a wicked gang of rogues, and the eldest of them is not above seventeen years of age. Williams and Harding brought these stockings to me, [some stockings were produced] and said he would give me a penny if I would take them home for them. [This was contradicted by Harding.]</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; I gave orders for a certain quantity of this wheat, which was a particular sort, called rivet-wheat, and what I intended for my own use, was put in the ground; the wheat in question was stolen from the barn, where it had been for several days, it was intended for my servant's brother. In consequence of information that I received from Mr. Basso, a miller, at Hadley, in Middlesex, I went to his mill; he shewed me near a bushel of wheat in a sack; W. Peacock, my bailiff, was with me at the time; I then saw it was wheat of the same description that I had lost, it was rivet-wheat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is rivet-wheat? - A. It is wheat that grows with a beard.</p>
               <p>Q. It is common enough in many countries? - A. Yes, but not in that part of Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Upon looking at that wheat, which was found at the miller's, had you any doubt of that being part of the wheat that you lost -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You only knew of its being rivet-wheat, you thought it was your's? - A. Yes, being an uncommon thing in that part of the country. It was in a bag which I did not know any thing of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you previous to this time looked to see if you had missed any of your wheat? - A. I did; I went the same evening that I had seen the wheat at the miller's, to obtain a warrant, and the next morning I went with Davidson, the constable, to the prisoner's house, at Hadley; the prisoner was not at home, we searched the house, and found some wheat in a peck measure, about half full in a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that rivet-wheat? - A. It was, and there was a sack found in the cupboard with my surname in full length on it. I have no doubt but it was my sack; we went up stairs to another room, and there we found a spade behind the bed; I am not able to speak to that spade; it belonged to Watson, one of my workmen. He was apprehended by two of my workmen in the road that leads from Hadley to Enfield; he was brought to the Magistrate at Hadley; on the same day I saw these things at his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner; I knew him and all his family; he rented a cottage of me, I was obliged to remove him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300060"></xptr>Q. Did he ever work for you? - A. I never would employ him.</p>

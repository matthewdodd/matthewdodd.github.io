I turned round, said I had lost my pocket-book, and Mr. Pike pointed the prisoner out as the man who took it; I stooped down immediately, and picked it up at his feet - He was close to me at the time, pushing me forward; I seized him, and charged him with taking it - He denied it. I think it could not have fallen from any other person. He was on one side of me, rather behind. My pocket was cut in five or six places.</p>

             PIKE. I was in the hall at the time. Mr. Shaw passed me. I had noticed the prisoner feeling several person's pockets - He felt mine; he followed Mr. Shaw. I think there was a gentleman with Mr. Shaw-the prisoner kept close behind him, he took his station before me, and the prisoner behind him; I drew back to watch him, a young man stood by the prisoner's side, the prisoner kept pressing between them, with his hands down, and appeared in the act of cutting Mr. Shaw's pocket; I saw him move his hands up, and collared him: Mr. Shaw said he was robbed, I said, I have got the thief; I saw the prisoner drop the pocket-book at his feet-Mr. Shaw picked it up. I then seized the other man, charged him with being with the prisoner, but let him go, as he denied it. As I was taking him out I felt a knife at my feet-no person claimed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was behind Mr. Shaw, the people were clapping their hands, the prosecutor's pocketbook fell out of his pocket, he picked it up, and it fell out again, he then said I must be the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the police. On Monday, the 6th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went to No. 2, Charles-street, Drury-lane, accompanied by Reynolds and Ashton—I found the outer door of the house open—we went up stairs to the first floor back room—the door was fast—I burst it open, and found the three prisoners in the room—Wilson was Bitting on a chair in front of the fire by the side of a table—there was a good fire, and a candle burning—on my entering she immediately rose from her seat, and leaned forwards to the fire-place—I perceived that she had taken something white from the front of the fire-place, she endeavoured to break it with her hands—I seized her hands, and in the scuffle she fell on the floor, and I found what she had in her hand was these pieces—they are different portions of a mould, and are made of plaster of Paris—the other two prisoners were standing by the fire-place—I proceeded to search the room, and found in the table drawer this Knife with plaster of Paris on it—I observed in front <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the fire an old shovel stuck into the bars; that appeared to be the spot where the mould was taken from—it formed a sort of ledge, and would have kept the mould</p>

I went with Duke, and followed him up stairs—when I entered the room I seized Brady on the right band side of the fire-place, where she was standing—I kept her in custody till the other officers, came, and I then delivered her over to Palmer—are the prisoners were all secured, I searched the room, and on the left hand side of the fire-place I found a small bag on the ground—it contained some powder of plaster of Paris—between the bars in the fire-place I found an old shovel stuck in, and a piece of brown paper in it with plaster of Paris on it—on the hob I found two pieces of broken moulds—I brought Wilson away with me, and on the road I said to her, "You seem very much agitated"—she said "Yes"—I said, "You are engaged in a dangerous business"—she said, "You can't blame me for breaking them for my own safety, if I get over this you shan't find me at the like again."</p>

I accompanied the other officers—the first thing I saw on entering the room was Duke take hold of Wilson—she fell on the floor, and I found a good sixpence where she fell—I saw Duke take some plaster of Paris from her hand, which was quite warm—it was the pieces that have been produced—I found on the left hob, this iron spoon with some metal in it, and close by the spoon I found this little piece of plaster of Paris—under the stove in the ashes I found several pieces of plaster of Paris, which appear to have been moulds for casting money—on the mantel-piece I found this metal spoon; and part of an old knife with plaster of Paris adhering to it, in a table drawer in front of the fire, and a small file with white metal adhering to the teeth of it—I took the prisoner Wild into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a watch at any time - A. I had. That watch was taken from me last Monday evening, it had just struck nine; I was coming from Islington on foot; I was with my mother and my younger brother. I was in <placeName id="t18140525-33-crimeloc191">Goswell-street</placeName>

I was walking along; the prisoner was meeting of me; he came very violently, he was walking. My little brother was inside of the wall, I outside, and my mother in the middle. He came violently, and pushed against my mother, so violent, it knocked my my little brother down upon the step. I felt the watch go out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive how it went, did you - A. No, I did not. He partly pushed against me; he came between me and my mother. He pushed his left hand against the pit of my mother's stomach. I felt my watch go. I have every reason to believe he took it out. I only felt the watch go; I said that he had stolen my watch. My mother told me not to be alarmed; she said, she knew the man, it was young

            . He then turned the corner of Rawsterne-street, and ran down Rawsterne-street. I hallooed out stop thief directly; he was stopped in Rawsterne-street; my watch had a dark blue ribbon and a key attacked to it. A person came up, and told me to shew him the man who stole my watch. I stepped in among the crowd, and said, that is the man who stole my watch. I saw my watch again that evening, and I saw it afterwards at Bow-street office. I am sure the prisoner is the person; it was a light evening.</p>

               <p>Q. We understand you were coming home with him and his little brother from Islington - A. Yes; we were in Goswell-street-road; I had one son on each arm. About six or eight yards of me, I saw the prisoner coming towards Islington, as we were on the road; he was not coming very quick. Just as we got to the corner, he stepped quicker: he was walking in the middle of the pavement; he came in that way, that I was not able to make way for him; with his left hand, he threw the little one down on the inside. He pushed me violently on the stomach with his left hand; he then threw his shoulder on to mine, and turned himself round, and with his right hand he drew out my son's watch; I saw that. Knowing of the man before, and the character of him, I kept my eye on him, and saw the method he took it; he bent his finger as a hook; he caught the watch in the hollow of his hand, and kept it so. I am sure the prisoner is the person; I knew him before. He ran some distance before he was stopped; we called stop thief. Prior to that, I saw him throw his arm out, and then he cried stop thief louder than we did; he was stopped. I did not lose sight of him. I am sure of his person. The watch was found by two gentlemen that followed us to Bow-street office; the gentleman is in court that picked the watch up.</p>

            . I was in St. John-street-road, about nine o'clock, last Monday evening, that is near Goswell-street-road. I perceived a man running very hard; a little boy was after him, crying stop thief; the little boy tumbled down. He begged me to stop him. I ran after him, and catched at him; he held his hand up, as if to knock me down, and then he said what do you stop me for, and then I ran away. A gentleman that was with me walked by the side of him, and kept the prisoner in conversation until the mob came up, and then they said the prisoner is the man that ran away, and he is the man that went to strike me. I went into the public-house with the people, and then I returned to look for the watch. I tumbled on the watch in Rawsterne-street, in an open place. I found the watch in about ten minutes after he was taken, not more. I found the watch in that part of Rawsterne-street where the prisoner had been running. I saw him coming out of Rawsterne-street, and it was in that street where I saw the prisoner coming out, that I found the watch. I found the watch without the case; the case has been found; I did not find the case. I delivered the watch to Edwards, the officer, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS. I am an officer. On account of illness, I gave my place up. I live in St. John-street. There was no officer to be found, and knowing me in the neighbourhood, I was sent for. The prisoner was taken in St. John-street-road. I searched him in the public-house; I found nothing on him but a box. The mother and the lad were in the public-house with me. I proceeded to Bow-street with the prisoner. When I came there no magistrate was sitting. I took him to the watchhouse. The watch was delivered into my hands by Mr. Cowland. It had no case. I never had the case. The man that found the case, left it with the lad's mother. He did not give any address. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the watch to be mine; it is a metal watch. It has the same ribbon to it now as when I lost it. It had an outside case when lost.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gothey. I know the watch; the maker's name is Bent, London. I paid fifty shillings for it to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250022"></xptr>particular friend of his father; he let me have it cheap.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

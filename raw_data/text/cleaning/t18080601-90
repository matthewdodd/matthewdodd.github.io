               <p>Q. Does he keep stables and horses - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose his stables were in his yard - A. Yes. I was informed on the 14th of May, before four o'clock in the afternoon; I was at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody informed you something which made you come back to your masters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you returned to your masters - A. Yes, I made my way to this yard as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoners about when you came into the yard - A. They had loaded the dung which they had come to fetch away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Severn and King kept their oats in that yard - A. They kept it in the lost over the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any oats in sacks at that time - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the stable door open when they loaded the dung - A. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the dung loaded on their cart; did you find any oats or any sacks of your masters in the cart - A. There were three sacks in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they laying open in the cart - A. No, covered up with dung.</p>
               <p>Q. Any oats in the sack - A. Yes, there were about seven or eight bushel of oats in three sacks; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say in consequence of your finding the sacks in that situation - A. Our foreman came along with us, he accused them of taking the oats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell them where he suspected they had taken them. - A. No, he charged them with taking the oats; they said what they had got did not belong to the place; they did not take it from there.</p>
               <p>Q. They said it did not belong to your master - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say who they did belong to - A. No, not then. Mr. Bishop sent for the officer then, Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer come directly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Griffiths came did the foreman charge him with the thest then - A. Yes, they said it did not belong to our yard; they persisted in it that it did not belong to our yard. Mr. Griffiths secured them; he searched for the oats first, and found the oats upon them; at this time the oats had not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you did not know where the oats and the sacks were - A. No, we only suspected they had got them; Mr. Griffiths took one of the sacks from the side of the cart, under a small quantity of dung that was over it; the others were near the bottom of the cart; the cart was tilted up to find them.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they were discovered by shooting the dung - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this cart came from - A. Yes, from Eastham.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day did they arrive in your yard - A. I cannot tell; it was about four o'clock in the day when I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You know that Tollson is a servant that drives up hay to town, and the other prisoner a labourer - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they repeatedly say that the oats did not belong to you; I do not know whether you are countryman enough to know that turnpikes allow them to take any weight of manure; if there is a board or a sack then they are weighed; and if they have only a board above their weight then they are compelled to pay the penalty. You missed no oats, and they constantly denied them being your oats - A. I know nothing of the oats.</p>

            . I came to the yard; I sold them the dung, and I went from the yard into Whitechapel; and I came back into the yard again at four o'clock; they bought the dung before they loaded it, at eleven o'clock in the day; I went from the yard at three o'clock, and returned at four; and they had loaded it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the care of the corn and the sacks - A. I had, it was not kept in sacks; it was loose in a bin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the corn bin shortly before you left the yard that day - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there in the corn bin that day - A. There may be as near as I can guess five or six quarters loose in the bin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you when you returned perceive that any quantity had been taken from that bin - A. I could, there was an apparent deficiency in the bulk.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you could guess what quantity might be missing - A. I saw there was some quantity gone, and it appeared to be lessened about six or seven bushel.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any sacks in the bin - A. Yes, some was lying on the bin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found there was a deficiency in the bulk of the corn, did you see there was a deficiency in the sacks - A. Yes, there was; there should have been twenty sacks before these men came.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks were there when you perceived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010066"></xptr>this bulk of corn was diminished - A. There were nine teen sacks left that was missing; the sack that was missing is marked with a stripe; it is my masters sack there is two blue stripes on it.</p>

            . I went and informed my master that there was a sack short; our foreman, Mr. Bishop, stopped them and sent for an officer; we charged them with having stolen the sack and the oats I said as soon as the sack was taken out it was my master's sack.</p>
               <p>Q. They were charged with it and denied it - A. Yes; they said what corn they had it belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Did you mark your master's sacks - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These stripes are not your master's marks, they are the maker's marks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. He only proves that this is a sack the same as his master's was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. I will ask you whether you do not know that these men who come to town with heavy loads, who are fond of their teams, they bring more corn than they are allowed, and that if the turnpike man see anything in the cart he will make them pay toll.</p>
               <p>COURT. Though farmers' men may take some more corn than is allowed them by their masters, six or seven bushels is an enormous sum, they could not want six or seven bushels, the horses stomachs could not hold it.</p>

            . Q. You were sent for upon this business - A. I was; I searched the cart after I went in the yard; the men were charged with stealing the corn by Mr. Bishop, the foreman; I asked the men whether they had any corn in the cart, they said they did not know whether there was any there or not; if there was any they brought it with them; I desired the cart might be searched; I got somebody to go upon the top of the cart; I asked the two men if they had any more, to save us unloading of it; they said they did not know that there was any more, if there was they brought it with them; I desired the cart load of dung to be shot out, and then they found the other two sacks, they tumbled out. (The sacks produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of corn was there - A. I had it measured; it wanted much about a peck of eight bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. to Winning You have seen these sacks, look at them - does one or more of them bear a resemblance to your master's sacks - A. One of them appears to be the same as my master's; the other two I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the corn - Griffiths. They are valued at thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q Are they worth twenty - Winning. Yes.</p>
               <p>Lebeck's Defence. We took up the corn in Whitechapel; the man said he would satisfy us if we would carry it down the road for him so far as the Plough at Mile End.</p>
               <p>Tollson's Defence. The man asked me in Whitechapel to take the corn down to the Plough; he told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010067"></xptr>he would give me half a gallon of beer. Just after we had loaded the dung I asked this man to give it me up, to cover it under the dung, because of the weighbridge, because my master might be angry about it. While we were loading the dung I laid it behind some sugar hogsheads, because there were some pigs there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must be close to the cart - A. No. I was not close to the cart; I was at the head of the cart; the men were not at the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Why if your cart was two or three yards off, your cart must be near to them; now this was not Goswell street - A. No.</p>

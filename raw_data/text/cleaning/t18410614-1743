                  </hi>. I am a labouring man. On the 29th of May I met the prisoner in company with her sister and another woman, who was a friend of hers—I had not known her before—I went and slept with her at Westminster—I do not know the name of the place—we went to bed—I put my money into my trowsers' pocket, under my head—I had these two sovereigns and other money—I awoke about half an hour after I had been there, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw her with the trowsers, and when I awoke, she threw the trowsers into the room, and away she went, and left part of her clothes in the room—I found the money was gone—the next day I met her and her sister, and a man—I asked her for the money which she had the night before—she said she had no money, she gave what money she had to her sister, and she gave it to the man, who ran away—her sister struck me two or three times.</p>

            . I am hostler at the George Inn; the prisoner followed the waggon. He said he had a sack of flour in it - he came into the stable, and helped it to feed the horses; he kept hanging about the stable - he went to the tail of the waggon and looked in; I asked him what he wanted? but he made no answer. Soon after that he lifted up the lid of the box, took this parcel out, put it under his smock-frock, and ran down a lane. I followed him about a quarter of a mile - when I came nearly up to him he threw the bundle down. We caught him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go, and I will go back with you." He said if we did not loose him, he would soon do for us, and twenty such as us, and if he could get his hands at liberty he would do it - I gave him in charge. He said he hoped that it would transport him, as he was tired of the country.</p>

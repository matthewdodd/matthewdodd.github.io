                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Lower Union-place, King's-cross. On Monday, the 11th of September, the prisoner took lodging at my house, and was to pay sixpence for the night—he came down stairs in the morning, and asked for his hat—he smoked his pipe there and had breakfast—he returned in the evening, and in the morning about half-past nine o'clock came down and asked for his hat and braces—I got up and gave them to him, and not hearing him go out I went up stain, and missed a bolster, sheet, blanket, counterpane, and a variety of articles—my daughter's things are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and mine about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

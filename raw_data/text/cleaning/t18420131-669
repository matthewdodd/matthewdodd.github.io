                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old, and live with my mother, Mary Middlebrook, in Tabernacle-walk. About nine o'clock on the 9th of January, I was returning from chapel—I had my bag on my arm containing a hymn-book and a pair of gloves—when I got within three or four doors of my own home, the prisoner came up and snatched my bag from my arm with violence—the string broke—I said, "He has got my bag"—the policeman came up and caught him up against the gates—the bag was found next morning—this now produced is it—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

I was on duty—the prosecutrix said she was robbed, and said, "Run round the first corner," which was a dark yard leading to some stabling—I followed the prisoner to the bottom of the yard, and found him standing against some gates—I took him by the arm and asked him what he did there—he said he came there to ease him<lb></lb>self—I brought him to the light, and she said, "That is the boy that robbed me of my bag"—I took him, and then went to look for the bag—I could not find it till four o'clock in the morning—he had thrown it over the gates, which are very high.</p>

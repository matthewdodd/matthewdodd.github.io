I looked round, and saw the prisoner running across the Five-fields with something in his hand. We both followed him. I saw him throw the bundle away. Green picked it up, and gave it to me; it contained the articles stated in the indictment, which are mine, and had hung on the lines in the drying ground. Welch stopped him without my losing sight of him; another boy came up and tried to rescue him.</p>

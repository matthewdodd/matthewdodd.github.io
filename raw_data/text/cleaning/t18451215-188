                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at No. 92, Wardour-street, Soho. On the 23rd of Oct., about a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, I was going along Great Russell-street, Covent-garden—I had got a far as the corner of Brydges-street, and as I was walking along I was accosted by a female—I did not stop to speak to her—I went on—when I had got a few yards, I noticed three men—I can recognise the prisoner as one of them—the men jostled me, and the prisoner thrust against me in a manner that I took fora blow—the female at that moment cried out, "He has taken your pin, Sir"—I felt my stock directly after, and missed my pin—I had noticed it a few minutes previously—it was a gold pin, with a white stone and chain to it—there were two pins connected by a chain—one was left in my scarf—the chain was broken close to the smaller pin—I immediately gave an alarm to the police—the men ran down Brydges-street—I saw the prisoner stopped I had not lost sight of him—he merely ran round the cabs—I had made such observation of him when he pushed against me as to be sure he was one of the threes—there was a gas-light where I was attacked—I saw him sufficiently</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 150.) On the night of the 23rd of Oct. I was on duty in Brydges-street, Covent-garden—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner run behind the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, as if from die corner, on the left side of Brydges-street, as though he ran oat of Russell-street—he ran down to the lower pillar of Drury-lane theatre—I caught hold of him—the prosecutor came up and stated that he had lost a pin—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner to the station, but found nothing upon him relating to this charge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Is it not likely, if he was in company with this female, that she should take the pin; and then, to screen herself, say one of those men took the pin? If she was an honest woman, would she not have come the small distance of thirty yards to see about it, for these females are generally very fond of setting into any bother or any row?</p>

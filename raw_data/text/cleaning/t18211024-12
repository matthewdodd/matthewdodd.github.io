            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre. I was coming down the Strand about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the three prisoners together, I watched them through Temple-bar down Fleet-street, and saw them try several gentlemens' pockets, they did not succeed till they got to Mr. Pilgrim; about four or five doors from the stick-shop, I saw Lockyer draw the handkerchief out of Mr. Pilgrim's pocket, the other two were close to him - I was on the opposite side of the street, I crossed over immediately, and do not know what was done with the handkerchief. I seized Smith and Lockyer, and Keys, who was with me seized Nicholls, and drove him back to where the handkerchief was lying - it was a door or two from the shop.</p>

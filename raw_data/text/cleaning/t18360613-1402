                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 21st of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to No. 3, Kennedy's-court, Church-street, St. Giles's, with Ashton, Fink, Hall, and Duke—they are all officers—the street-door being open, I proceeded up-stairs with Ashton and Fink—the other two waited outside—the room door being rather ajar, somebody inside ran to shut it—I heard them do that, and I forced it open against them, and entered the room—on the right-hand side of the fire<lb></lb>place stood Newland, Leonard on the left, and Kelly on the left-hand side of the window—I laid hold of Newland and Leonard, and pushed them towards the window, and Leonard threw something white out of the window with her right hand—I could not see what it was—I put them into one corner of the room, and from the window I saw Hall stooping and picking something up in a public-house yard, which faces the window—I kept the prisoners in the corner of the room till the other officers arrived—I was seized by the left leg by a large dog, which held by my leg till it was knocked off by Ashton—I saw a pen-knife lying just outside the the window—on a little shelf on the left-hand side of the fir-place, I took off this half sheet of scouring paper—I searched Newland—he said I should find nothing on him, nor did I—I searched Leonard, and found on her a</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to His Majesty's Mint, and have had experience in examining coin for a great number of years. This is a plaster-of-Paris mould, intended for casting counterfeit shillings—it is composed of the pieces produced by Hall—it has the impressions of the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling—there are five shillings produced, which are all counterfeit, and cast in white metal—I have compared two of them with the mould, and believe they were cast in it—there is an acci<lb></lb>dental break in the mould, with which they exactly correspond—the other shillings I have compared with the mould and I believe they have been cast in it, but the break has been removed from these—that is some surplus metal which could be field off—these are in a more finished state—this file might be applied to remove the surplus metal—there appears to be white metal in the teeth of it—the iron spoon might be used to melt the metal before it is poured into the mould—there is white metal in it now, which appears to have been an imperfect cast—the mould is made of plaster of Paris, and is similar to the plaster of Paris now produced.</p>

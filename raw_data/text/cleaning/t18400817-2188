                  </hi>. I am a comedian. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of August, I went into the Coach and Horses public-house, Lam<lb></lb>beth, and had two glasses of gin and water with another gentleman—I was returning home between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock, and was in High-street, on a parallel with Lambeth-walk—I was not affected with liquor when I went into the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was there while I was there—some of the company were talking about Ireland—one of them referred to me, and I jokingly replied, "I like Ireland," or "I like the boys, for I consider myself half an Irishman"—the prisoner ad<lb></lb>dressed himself to me, and called me a b——impostor, or something, and I said he was a dirty carpenter for swearing—I afterwards called for liquor, for the purpose of making peace, but the landlord refused to serve it, and I left the house instantly, at his request—after leaving I saw two persons opposite, and spoke to them—as I walked direct towards my own home, I heard a footstep by the side of me, and the prisoner, on the instant, struck me on the front of my head, and I fell—I had my hat on—I lost my senses—when I came a little to myself I was in a doctor's shop, but lost myself again after that, and found myself in bed at my lodging.</p>

I was on duty in Broad-street, Lambeth, on the 2nd of August, and saw Cullen and the prisoner—by the shade of the lamp I saw Cullen fall (as I was walking on my beat) on the pavement, and the prisoner run away—I pursued him down the street—he was turned back by a person—I tripped him up, and in falling, he dropped this poker, which I have had ever since—Cullen appeared a little intoxicated, and lay on the pavement—he was taken to the doctor's—I got this hat at the doctor's—it is cut—as the prisoner rose off the ground, I laid hold of him, and said, "You villain, what do you mean by this?"—he said, "I will kill the b—lot of them"—I said, "If you don't be quiet, I shall give you what you have not had yet," and then he went quietly with me.</p>

On Sunday night, the 2nd of August, Cullen was brought to my house be<lb></lb>tween twelve and one o'clock—he was literally covered with blood—on examining him, I found an extensive wound from the left protuberance of the forehead, extending down to the inner angle of the eye—it was as if it had been grooved—it was cut directly through, and the outer plate of the skull was as if you had taken a saw and made a groove in it—part of the bone was coming through the orifice—I washed him and sent him home—I at<lb></lb>tended him—inflammatory symptoms arose in about thirty-six hours, and he had erysipelas in the face, all over—his life was undoubtedly in danger—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by this poker—I considered his life in danger for about a week—I have attended him till the present time—the wound is not perfectly healed now—in my judg<lb></lb>ment, if he had not had his hat on, the wound would have produced instant death—I have no doubt of it.</p>

The prisoner lived in my service for nineteen months; and on the 21st of March, in the morning, I gave her warning to leave that day month - and after I had gone out, she left, and not returning, I searched and missed sheets, table-cloths, spoons, shirts, stockings, and bed furniture - I mentioned it to one of the day police, and on the 12th of April she was taken into custody - I have found the greatest part of my property - when the prisoner was apprehended, (I neither threatened nor promised her,) I asked her what she did with my property - she said she had it all safe, and I should have it - that was about ten o'clock at night - I took her to the watch-house, which was close by, and gave her in charge - they took her up stairs, and presently I was called up, and twenty-six duplicates were produced in her presence - on my pointing to one, and asking if it was the bolster of her bed, she said it was.</p>

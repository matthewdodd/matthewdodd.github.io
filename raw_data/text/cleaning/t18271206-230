            . I have two odd boots, and one pair of top-boots, which I found on Smith, about six o'clock in the evening, on the 2d of November, in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, about half a mile from the prosecutor's shop. I saw nothing of Brown at that time - I believe two Lambeth-street officers took him.</p>

            . I am the son of James Purcell; I am nine years old; my father left me in the shop while he went to get his tea; the two prisoners came to the shop; Smith said he wanted a boot-lace; I stooped to get one, and on lifting my head up, I saw Smith take the boots off the peggs by the wall, and give them to Brown, who stood near the door; they then ran away by the window - I had not seen them before, but I am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Have you not said that Brown was outside the shop? A. Yes; he went outside the door again, and then the other reached him the boots - it was about five o'clock - it was dark; they were there about ten minutes. I am sure I cannot be mistaken in them. I do not know how many pairs of boots Smith took.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. I was going along Whitechapel, and a person gave me the boots to pawn - I did not know they were stolen; I was going into a pawnbroker's shop with them, and the officer took me.</p>
               <p>BROWN's Defence. I am quite innocent - I never saw Smith before.</p>

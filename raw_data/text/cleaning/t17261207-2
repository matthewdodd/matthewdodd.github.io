             thus depos'd. I had been taking a Glass of Wine, and when I came home I saw two or three Men upon my Lighters, two of them run away, the Prisoner was in the Boat with the Coals, I believe there might be about 33 Bushels in the Boat, I mist 19 Bushels out of my Lighter, the other I suppose he might take out of another Lighter which lay just by mine, for his Boat was between the two Lighters; When I seiz'd him I ask'd him what he did there, he gave a very random Account, first, that he bought the Coals below Bridge, and afterwards came over the Water with them.</p>

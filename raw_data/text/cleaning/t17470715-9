             . I was in Company with a Friend of mine in the Evening , and it was so late that he was lock'd out of his Lodging, so he desired me to go with him and pass the Time away. He was obliged to get up at four o'Clock in the Morning. About three o'Clock I took a Walk over Tower-Hill to Whitechapel Mount . So I came back again, and there stood a Woman in Whitechapel . So, says she, walk in; so she brought me into her House. I thought it was a Publick House . When I came into the House I saw a great many People, so I was afraid. I was going back again, and the Woman that invited me in came to me, and said, Don't be afraid , walk in; so I followed her, and went up one Pair of Stairs , and set myself down at a Table. So they ask'd me what I wanted to drink? I said I did not care for any Thing. I said, if you want to drink you may ; so they brought up some Stuff, Gin, or something. So while they were drinking this Woman took hold of my Neck, and robbed me of my Stock-Buckle . So they called me so many Names; so they wanted me to go out of the House. I said here is a Shilling if you will let me have my Buckle again , so she sweared very much. So it happened that the Constable came by, and I said I was robbed by this Woman, so afterwards it was found upon her, this Gentleman saw it.</p>

             . I came off from the Watch in the Morning, about four o'Clock. I heard a Disturbance in the Alley; when I came down there were four or five Fellows in the House, and the Gentleman said, if he knew of any Constable he would charge her. I did not let him know what I was. This Woman, the Prisoner, was out of the House. I heard him say, he would give a Shilling for it. This was a noted bad House, and it is routed since. The Man that kept this bad House, he said he would knock her Brains out if she did not deliver it; so she took it out of her Bosom, and was a going to drop it and I took it from her.</p>

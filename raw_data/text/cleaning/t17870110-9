               <p>Were these part of the handkerchiefs you had shewn to her? - I cannot recollect whether I shewed her them or not, but I must take them down.</p>
               <p>When she was fumbling about her coats did you see the handkerchiefs? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Were there not two men in the shop? - No, to the best of my knowledge there were not.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop? - There were two or three more women buying other goods; strangers.</p>
               <p>Did any body come in with this woman? - There were four or five came in as it were in a party; one of them went out at the same time when I pursued the prisoner, the other was with her, but she went up a passage, perceiving me I suppose.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop? - Only my mistress and me.</p>
               <p>What was she doing? - She was serving some other customer.</p>

               <p>How long had she been in the shop? - She might be about five minutes, and she took a stool and sat down.</p>

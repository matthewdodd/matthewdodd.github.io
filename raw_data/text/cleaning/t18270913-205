On the evening of the 12th of July, I saw Braham resting his basket on a post, near the corner of Church-street, St. Giles' - I stood talking to him - these young women came up; Graham took the paper of halfpence out of the basket, and passed it to Smith; I told him of it, and helped him down with his basket, while he pursued them - I saw the paper brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. Q. Was there not a fight in the street? A. There was a crowd, but I saw no fight; Braham had 10l. worth of copper in his basket. I at first thought she took it in fun, till she gave it to Smith.</p>

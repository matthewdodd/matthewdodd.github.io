            . In August last, I observed a woman in Oxford-road exposing china and earthenware for sale. Something about it attracted my notice, and from the conversation I had with her, I was induced to examine the plates, and found my master's name on them - I informed my father. The woman lived at No. 9, White Hart-yard - the prisoner was in our employ.</p>

            . I have been 35 years in the prosecutor's service. On the 7th of September, in consequence of what my son informed me, I went to Oxford-street, and saw the woman - she said her name was Wilson, and with some trouble I got from her, that she lived at No. 9, White Hart-yard, Drury-lane - Tilley keeps the house. I went with Perry to search that lodging about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was at the warehouse at the time. I went to the front garret, found the same woman there, and said we were come for more plates, the same as we had bought of her in Oxford-road - she said she had more. I found all this property there, and bought it of her for 12 s. 6 d.; it was the property of Messrs. Spode and Copeland, and has their name on it. I bought 48 plates of her, and found 31, and these things at her lodgings. The water-craft I know by a flaw, and the plates also - we never sold any of that pattern. I could not bring them all away at once, and on going a second time, I found them removed. We apprehended the prisoner at the warehouse, and asked him where he lived? He at first refused to tell the officer. Mr. Copeland then asked him, and he said, at No. 9, White Hart-yard, in the garret, and said he had a wife and two children - he was taken to the office. I keep the keys of the warehouse, and am always there the first and the last. The prisoner always came first, and went to work immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long was he in your service - A. Eleven months - we took him out of charity. We sell all our damaged goods to one man, but these are not damaged.</p>

On 12th Feb., the prisoner Wellfare came into our shop about a quarter or half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—she purchased a few articles, amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made out a bill of parcels, and a duplicate of it—this is the duplicate which I made out (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I retained it, she gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in payment—I gave it to the cashier Clewet, and he gave me a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gold and silver in exchange—this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I believe to be the one he gave me—I gave the same check that I received from Clewet to Wellfare—another of the assistants named Stocks was near me when the purchase was made—I heard him offer to send the parcel, and I heard her say, "No thank you, I'll take it myself," and I think she said that she lived close at hand in King-street—something was said in reference to living in King-street—I heard the words "King-street"—she then went away, and took the parcel with her.</p>

Taking the different items of evidence proved—the living together, their denial of each other, the disposal of the check, &amp;c, coupled with the fact about to be proved, that both notes came from the same plate, there was reasonable evidence of co-operation to go to the Jury; at the same time, he cautioned the Jury that unless they were of opinion that both the prisoners co-operated in the uttering on the 12th, the forthcoming evidence was not to be taken into their consideration as against Brown.</hi>

I owed Mr. Steward some money, and said, if he would take the note, I would pay him what I owed him: he asked me how I came by it? I said, it is no matter. I went to him after that, and wanted more money, and I took and indorsed it to him. I declare I never saw no note but that. It never was advertised after I found it.</p>

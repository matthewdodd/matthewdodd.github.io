We had to go down stairs before we could come at him, and to go up a bit of a street; we went, and as soon as they saw us one of them ran up Chancery-lane; Wood was standing at a step of a door, tying up the bundle in a handkerchief, in Bell-yard, about one hundred yards from the house, or further. As soon as he saw us he threw his bundle down, and run down Bell-yard into Fleet-street, and ran across into the Temple, and there we took him, and a boy brought the bundle to me in about ten minutes. I am sure it was the same bundle that the prisoner threw down. It was given to Scammel at the justice's; I had it at the justice's; I gave it to the constable,

When the prisoner saw us he threw down the bundle, and ran off; we followed him down Bell-yard, and took him in the Temple; the bundle was brought to us by a boy; the bundle was delivered at this time to me from Mr. Smith's hands, the constable. I produce it now.</p>
               <p>As soon as the young man gave them you, did you see what was in it? - I did, Mr. Smith opened it, there was a gown, an handkerchief, a check apron, and a pair of worsted stockings in the bundle.</p>

On the 13th of June, I had occasion to go to the Theatre; every thing was in its usual state; I went again on the next day, which was Saturday, and close to the stage-door in Suffolk-street, I observed a doll which was used in the Theatre, and was kept in the ladies' wardrobe; it was not there on the 13th; and in the passage from Suffolk-street door to the stage, there was a quantity of black baize, and going towards the stage, I found a curtain was let down, and some scenes thrown across the stage; I found the things in a different state to what they were on the day before; there had been no performance-the pier-glass had been taken down in the green-room, and part of it taking away-there was writing on the wall-the door appeared to have been burst open-the whole seemed in the utmost confusion-the furniture of the King's box was taken out of the press, and put on a dresser, and appeared to have been packed up to be taken away; it was worth 50l. or 60l., the fringe was all of real silver - We found an iron crow-bar behind the dresser in the wardrobe - I compared it with the marks on the door-it fitted exactly. There was a box of beads opened, but none taken away - A candle had been left burning on the dresser-it was then out - I left every thing in the same state as I found it, and set persons to watch, in consequence of what I heard. On the Monday following, on the 16th, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I went again and saw the doll, which had been in the passage, was removed, I went to the ladies' wardrobe, it was shut and fastened inside; the watchman and patrols who were with me forced it open, and we found the four prisoners there; they were taken into custody, and searched at the watch-house. On Holmes we found some beads, which appeared to be what I had seen in the box on the 14th. On Davis was found a large skeleton key, and I believe twenty-five smaller keys, and on Holmes we found a dark lantborn, and on one of them was found a phosphorus box; I then returned to the Theatre and found a helmet in the pit, and part of the furniture of the King's box was on the ground; the fifty yards of drugget was in the ladies' wardrobe, which was on the stairs on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There are only three proprietors of the Theatre, only we three are included in the licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Colman's interest in the house ceased - A. I understand he has mortgaged his interest.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Does Mr. Colman act as one of the joint owners - A. He does, he exercises his vote as a proprietor, and those votes are carried into effect; he acts as a proprietor in every description of the word-no other person attends the meetings, or acts in the arrangements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Every thing appeared in the same state when I went on the Monday, except the furniture of the King's box; part of which was on the floor; the black baize was not in the wardrobe on the Saturday.</p>

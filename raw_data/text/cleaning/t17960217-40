               <p>I shall be ten years old next June. I was going to Sir Benjamin Hammett's with a bundle of cloths for three of the clerks; This the bundle (producing it). In the middle of Newgate-street, the prisoner got up behind the coach with me, and he asked me where I was going; I told him I was going along Cheapside, that was all the conversation that passed between him and me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do then? - A. He did not do any thing to me; but, at the bottom of Newgate-street, he snatched the bundle from me behind the coach, and he fell down, and the gentleman took him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lockyer). Is that your property? - A. They belonged to Sir

               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice; were these cloaths in your hand after they were made? - A. There is a particular mark upon one coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge; I know nothing at all about it; when I was taken, I was upwards of thirty yards from the coach, and, I declare to God, I am as innocent of it as the child unborn, in regard of taking it away; I was lame at that time, was the reason of my riding behind the coach.</p>

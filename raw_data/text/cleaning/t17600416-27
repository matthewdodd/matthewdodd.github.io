               <p>Smith. That is four bushels. I ordered them to bring the prisoner to justice Cox's, which they did, and I met him there. I asked him how he could use me so, as he got his bread under me. He said he was drunk or he had not done it.</p>

             came and told me he had seen the prisoner going away with a sack of malt, which he thought was my master the prosecutor's property. I went up into the warehouses, and thought there was a sack gone. I went down stairs, and saw some malt scattered. I followed the trail, and saw the prisoner going down the stairs at Ivy Bridge. I took hold of him, brought him up to my master's warehouses, and told him I was informed he had stoln a sack of malt from my master's warehouse. He said he had not. At last he said he would go and shew me where it was. I went and saw it, and ordered one of our men to carry it again to our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Dunford. There were four bushels of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you reckon it worth?</p>
               <p>Dunford. I reckon it worth about ten shillings. We took him before the justice, where he confessed the taking of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you lived servant with the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years—before that I had been working in the trade for another man—I had failed in business—at the time the defendant counted out the money, he owed me 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—no, I think it was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was it, to the best of my belief—I am wrong, I made a mistake—at the time of the trial, he paid me none—I was thinking you meant what he owed me at the time of his bankruptcy—at the time he counted out the money, he owed me 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has paid me some since his trial—I did not apply to him for payment at that time—I knew he was going to be tried—I saw each note as he counted it—I cannot say whether they were Bank of England notes, or provincial notes, or whether they were fives, tens, or twenties—there were three different number, I believe—I do not think there was a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note among them—I was within two or three yards of him at the time he was counting them—we both sat at the table—I cannot say how many sovereigns there were—there were not fifty—there were more than ten—I cannot speak to there being twenty or thirty—the 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he owed me was for money lent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you get the money to lend him; you say you had failed in business some time before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some I had saved, and some I had given to me by my wife's family—part of it I had saved in his service—I cannot recollect how much—I had had about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given to me, I think—that was at the time I was in his service—must I say who gave it me?—it was given to me by my wife's grandfather, whose name was Addy—I was examined at the Bankruptcy Court—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the examination</hi>)—this is my signature—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's examination being read, stated, "I saved</hi> 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">as a journeyman currier, in four or five years;" but it contained no mention of the</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">being given to him</hi>)—I did not say anything on that occasion as to the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been given to me—I said I had saved part of the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a journeyman, in four or five years—what I stated then was true enough—I cannot call to my recollection whether I stated that I had saved 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in four or five years—my wages, as a journey<lb></lb>man, were about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I lived out of the house—during those four or five years I paid a good deal of what I owed my creditors, little monies round about—I cannot recollect how much I paid my creditors in those four or five years—I was examined as a witness for the defendant on his trial—I do not know that I went to prove that he was not the person who committed the assault—I do not remember what I swore at the trial—since the trial I have been charged with assisting the defendant in removing his goods to get them out of the way of his creditors—I did do so—he employed me to do it—I hid a quantity of leather in a false ceiling—I saw Mr. West the day before yes<lb></lb>terday—I told him that part of what I had stated before the Commissioner of Bankruptcy was untrue, for I had been led into it by my master unawares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you did not tell him that the whole of what you had stated, about seeing your master count out the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was untrue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—I said it was false—I believe it was false that Mr. Bickmore had it through what I had heard since the last hearing—my master has told me that he did not give Mr. Bickmore 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he gave him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>with the clerk to the attorney for this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was, with Mr. West—he subpœnaed me to attend here to-day—he did not serve me with it—Mr. Mayhew served me—the conversation that I had with Mr. West was at Mr. Lott's office—I went there by appointment—it was written on the subpœnaed that I was to be at Mr. Lott's office at such a time, and I went there accordingly—nothing was said about prosecution me for concealing this property, or about my saving myself from prosecution—I did not tell Mr. West what I should say in particular if I was called as a witness—he did not ask me in particular what I should say—he told me that he did not know whether they should want me or not, but he thought the others would, and it would be about the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I was sorry for it, I did want to say anything about it, but if I was called I should tell the truth about it—nothing else passed—I was to be at the Court at such a time, and not to be away from my time—he said he thought they should not want me, but the other side probably would, about the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect that he said anything more.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, living at Coggleshall—I know the defendant, and was present at his trial, at Chelmsford, in July, 1843—I saw him give Mr. Bickmore a canvas-bag, or purse—I believe it was after the Jury had given their verdict—it appeared to contain something—I should not like to form an opinion as to how many sovereigns it might contain—Wilt<lb></lb>shire was there at the time—I saw the defendant and Mr. Bickmore talking together at the time the bag was given—I did not hear what they said.</p>

                  </hi> I am the brother of the defendant, and am an ironmonger, living at Coggleshall. On the 16th of Sept., 1843, while my brother was in prisoner, I went to Mr. Bickmore's office—that was by my brother's orders—I saw Mr. Bickmore, and told him that I was going to Chelmsford after my brother—Mr. Bickmore asked me what time we should return from Chelms<lb></lb>ford—I said between one and two o'clock—Mr. Bickmore said he should not be at home between one and two o'clock, but between five and six o'clock he should be at home—he told me that he had received a large sum of money of my brother, and he said, "Do you tell your brother to cell, then I will settle with him <hi rend="italic">of the monies</hi>"—I had not said anything to him about what he had received—on returning from Chelmsford, I called at Mr. Bickmore's between five and six o'clock—I saw a servant up at the chamber-window, and in<lb></lb>qured if Mr. Bickmore was at home—I did not see him or hear him—about the Nov. or Dec. following, I saw him at my father's shop—he said, "I un<lb></lb>derstand your father intends to have his business settled, and I should like to settle it"—I asked him if he had brought my father's account, and my bro<lb></lb>ther's account, and the account of the money he had received—he said that he and my brother would not fall out, they would make it all right one day—I asked him whether it was 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or whether it was more or less—he said, "Your brother and I shall not fall out, but will make it all right one day"—I said nothing on that—I thought he would settle—about March, 1844, I saw him again at my shop—my mother was present—Mr. Bickmore selected some goods—my mother asked him for her husband's account, and</p>

               <p>my brother's account, and the account of the money that he had received—he said he should see my brother, and make it all right one day—he wanted to purchased a stove—he looked one out, but we did not send it—we did not say anything to him about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your ironmongery business carried on under the same roof as your brother's curriery business was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was carried on separately—I was not accused of helping to remove hi goods, to conceal them from the assignees—I did not assist my brother, or Wiltshire, to conceal his goods from the assignees—I was examined privately at the Bankruptcy-court; but not regarding the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or my interview with Mr. Bickmore—my brother never brought me to the Bankruptcy-court when he was examined about the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I was present once when my brother was ex<lb></lb>amined; but I was not examined—I heard Mr. Bickmore there state that no application had been made to him for the money by my brother—my brother did not then ask me to be a witness for him—that was in the year 1843—it was in the autumn, I think—I was not there when Mr. Duncan was my brother's counsel, nor when my brother was examined about the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a previous occasion—I was there in Nov. or Dec., I think—he was then examined about the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think Mr. Bickmore was examined the same day—I was not examined as a witness then—when I saw Mr. Bickmore, while my brother was in goal, I commenced the conversation by telling him I was going to Chelmsford after my brother—I did not ask him anything about money, before he spoke about money to me—he told me had received a large sum of money from my brother, and when my brother returned, he would see and settle with him—he did not say what the sum of money was—I did not ask him to give my brother some money to help him to come out of prison—I called on him again in the evening with my brother, but did not see him—I think I next saw him in Nov.; that was before my brother became bankrupt—I think it was in 1843; the same year in which he went to prison—I then had the conversation with him that I have stated—Mr. Payne was my brother's at<lb></lb>torney in the bankruptcy—I saw him in Court about the time the discussion was going on as to the 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not sate to him the conversation I had had with Mr. Bickmore—I never had any conversation with Mr. Payne—I told my brother about it when he came home—I don't know that I said any<lb></lb>thing particular about it to any one but my brother.</p>

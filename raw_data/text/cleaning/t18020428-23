                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280024"></xptr>Q. Is there any way to go to the cellar without coming through your shop? - A. There is no other way, it is impossible; I came back between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was then in the cellar; I had not time to pull off my bonnet and cloak when the officer came and took the prisoner into custody, he told him he wanted him about a little tobacco; he seemed very much confused, and said he did not know any thing about a little tobacco; I went down stairs directly the officer took him away, and examined the boxes; upon a large cover-head, upon which the boxes stood, was some loose tobacco, about six pounds, and the boxes standing by the side of a tub, quite empty.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they stand in the same place in which they were in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time you were in the house, after you had seen the boxes filled, did any body else than the prisoner go into the cellar before you went out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man had been a manufacturer of tobacco for himself, had not be? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he carried on no business in tobacco himself? - A.For the sale of tobacco, about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the journeyman then employed with him? - A. Not any one.</p>
               <p>Q. You had employed a man of the name of Stevens before, had not you? - A. Never in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not weigh the tobacco in the morning? - A. I did not; the boxes generally contain about five pounds each.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is your son? - A. Twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any thing more to be done by the prisoner to this tobacco, in order to manufacture it? - A. Only to run it through a sieve.</p>
               <p>Q. He must have taken it out of the boxes for that purpose? - A. He must.</p>
               <p>Q. And would this cover-head be a proper place for him to put it before he put it in the sieve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KEMP called. Q. How old are you? - A. Twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you are to be sworn to? - A. To speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What will become of any person, if, having sworn to speak the truth, they should speak that which is not true? - A. They will go into flames.(He is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 19th of March, did you take care of the shop while your mother was out? - A. Yes; she went out about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time who was in the cellar? - A.Hobleman; he went away to dinner in about half an hour, he usually came back from dinner about one o'clock; that day he did not come back till above half after four.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time he was gone, did any other person go into the cellar? - A. No; he went down into the cellar before he went out; I asked him what made him stay so late; he said his child had had an accident, and had fell in the fire; I said, very well, and he went down; my mother came in in about twenty minutes, or half an hour after; and in about ten minutes after that the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that time, till the officer came, had any other person but your mother been into the cellar? - A. No; I had been in the shop the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure nobody had been in the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not take any bundle with him, did he? - A. No; he went with his hat under his coat, as he generally does.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am one of the officers employed at Shadwell-office: On the 19th of March, I was sent for to the shop of a Mrs. Stevens, in Ratcliff-highway, where I found a woman of the name of Coles, in the custody of Elby; Mrs. Stevens, and I, went to the house of Mrs. Kemp, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Stevens's house from Mrs. Kemp's? - A.About three quarters of a mile; Hobleman asked me what I took him for; I told him for a little tobacco; he told me he knew nothing about it. I took him into custody, and brought him away to Shadwell office; in going along to the office, he told me his mistress allowed him tobacco; I then asked him where he lived, and he pointed the house out to me; I afterwards went and searched that house, and, in a cupboard in the bed-room, I found these two parcels of tobacco, weighing six pounds and a half, (produces them;) I searched further in a little bit of a shed in a back part of the house, and found several parcels of tobacco in different parts of the place, but Mrs. Kemp did not identify them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Who was present when this conversation passed about his mistress allowing him tobacco? - A.There was no person with me, Elby was waiting in the New-road for me.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not talk very good English, does he? - A. Very good for a German.</p>
               <p>Q. He speaks broken English, like a German? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you might very easily have mistaken what he said? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a quantity of ochre at his house, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A large quantity? - A. Yes, there was a little cask about three parts full.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that will give a colour to tobacco? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not his master admit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280025"></xptr>that she had sent that ochre to his house? - A. Yes, she did.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kemp.) Look at these parcels of tobacco found at his house; is it the same sort of tobacco that was contained in the boxes you speak of? - A. The very same; it had been cut that morning, I saw him at work upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it finished tobacco? - A. It was not; it had not gone through the sieve, nor ever does, it is returns, which will not go through.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Fourteen pounds of tobacco would make a pretty large bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a process by which old tobacco may be made to resemble newly cut tobacco? - A. It may be mended, but cannot be made so perfect as that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe ochre will give it a better appearance? - A. Ochre never was used by any person in the trade to tobacco of this description.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect will ochre have upon tobacco? - A. Ochre, when used, is used to tobacco of a different colour, to make it appear the colour of this.</p>
               <p>Q. Will that give to inferior tobacco the appearance of superior? - A. It is never used for that purpose, it is merely to alter the colour, and not the qualtity.</p>

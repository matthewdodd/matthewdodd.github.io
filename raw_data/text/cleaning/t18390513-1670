                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Carver Knowles, and live in King-street, Tower-hill—he is a labourer at the St. Katherine Docks—I keep a green shop, and have a small cart, which I let out at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour. On Wednesday morning, the 15th of May, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, the prisoner came to the door and asked my brother if he knew where he could get a truck—my brother said, "We have one"—he said that would do, and took it away with the dog to drag it—it is a small four-wheeled dog van—about ten o'clock a policeman came to me—I went to King David-lane station-house the same day, and found the prisoner sitting at the Thames Police with the dog—he called the dog Lion, but his name is Rose.</p>

About ten o'clock in the morning, on the 15th of May, I saw the prisoner in Back-lane, about a mile from Knowles's shop—he was going entirely away from St. Kathe<lb></lb>rine's Docks—he was in conversation with a man named Ives—I heard him say to him "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you may make inquiry, if you choose"—he had the truck and dog with him—I asked him whose it was—he said, "My own"—I asked how long he had had it—he said "Upwards of twelve months"—I asked where he came from—he said, "7, Essex-street, Whitechapel"—I immediately turned round, looked at the wheels of the van, and found they had not been at work—I took him to the station-house, made inquiry, and found the owner.</p>

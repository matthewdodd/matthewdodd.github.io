            . Last Sunday was fortnight, about two o'clock on the Sunday morning, the Prisoners took my watch, chain, and seal, out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be with you?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. They enticed me to go to their house; I had been at the Bull-Head just by where I live in Ratcliff Highway; I staid there from four in the afternoon till half an hour after six, and staid in company with the Prisoners till eleven.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060019"></xptr>Q. What condition was you in then?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. I was not drunk, I was a little heavy headed; I said I was afraid of being locked out; she said I need not mind that, for she had a good lodging; I agreed to have a bed at her house, and paid her a shilling for it: we had a tankard of beer (I gave her six-pence, but she returned no money:) I took a drink of it, and laid down upon the bed about one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. No, there was no bed to lie on, but a sort of a blanket: about an hour afterwards Foster came and put his hand under the blanket, and he waked me in doing it; and then he made towards his wife (that woman) the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she his wife?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. He calls her his wife; and then they both went out of the room, and presently I found my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to lay hold of the watch when he took it from you?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. No, then I immediately got off the bed. for I had some valuable things in my pocketbook; then he came into the room again, and threatened me, and asked me why I did not go out; and he told me he would knock me on the head if I did not go out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. In <placeName id="t17480706-28-crimeloc138">Elbow-Lane, by Ratcliff Highway</placeName>

I told him I demanded my watch or his body, and then he said he would knock me on the head if I did not go out, and he put the candle out; I told him I had a right to be there till daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have got into the street?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Yes, but then he would have locked me out; and he said if I would treat him, he would help me to my watch again: I told him I would if he would let me have my watch again; and I was in the porch [he explained it afterwards to be the stair-case] and he pulled me down stairs, and I thought the street was the best place for me, for I did not know but I might have been knocked on the head.

               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. She said if I would not hurt her, I should have my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Foster carried before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. They were both carried before the Justice on Monday morning, and she said she took the watch off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you know to be false?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the watch again?</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. Mr. Gosden has the watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gosden produced the watch.</p>
               <p>Beauchamp. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you ask this witness any questions?</p>
               <p>Pris. Foster. No, my Lord, he has said too much already.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Pris. Foster. I do not know, I have not been at home since I have been here.</p>

On Sunday was fortnight I was sitting at the house that I live at between seven and eight in the morning, and this woman came by, and said, who will buy a watch? I said if I would, she had never an one to sell; she said she had, and shewed it to me: I asked her how she came by it (for I thought she did not look like one that had come honestly by it) and she said it was her brother's. I challenged it, and she said she would trust it in my hands; I said I would keep it till I knew how she came by it: and I carried an advertisement on Sunday night, which was published on Monday morning; and the Gentleman had taken her up: she brought the Prosecutor to my house, and she said nothing to me, nor I to her.

               <p>Pris. Kerr.

               <p>Q. You say you went to bed to him?</p>
               <p>Pris. Kerr. Yes, and when I found myself in bed with a man, I got up.</p>

On Monday evening, the 8th of October, from suspicion, I went for a constable and returned with him; I told the prisoner to go into my back shop, the constable followed him. I told the constable I suspected he had robbed me; the constable shewed his authority; the prisoner then put his hands into his pocket and pulled out a wicker bottle with a silver cap, a hair brush, two wooden snuff boxes, a small silver box, two pieces of soap, and two silk purses, the other articles were found at his lodgings. The prisoner asked me if I would grant him one favour, to permit him to go to Westminster-bridge and throw himself over, he wished to drown himself; I told him I could not comply with that request; we took him to the watchhouse. The constable has the property found upon his person, and Bly, the officer, the things found at his lodgings.</p>

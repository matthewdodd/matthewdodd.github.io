I ran down stairs quickly, and when I found my friend Mr. Bolland in pursuit of him, I ran up stairs again, for the purpose of seeing if any other person was there, or any property gone; I found no person there, but I found my Bank-notes that I had left in this part of the desk, a seal, and a glass bottle, were all gone; all the drawers in the second room were open; nothing gone but what I have mentioned; there was nothing in the drawers to take out; the contents of the bags I have mentioned were laying on the chairs; Mr. Bolland very soon returned, and in consequence of some information I received I went round immediately into Garden-court, leaving a person at the same time in possession of my chambers; I went into Garden-court with intent to look into different stair-cases; I ran up one stair-case very quickly, and down again, and when I came down I observed a person as if he came from the watermens' stairs; he had no hat or coat on, but something under his arm contained in a silk handkerchief, he was walking along very leisurely, and to me he had the appearance of a waterman, I thought at first he was a waterman; I immediately went up to him and said, have you seen a man in a brown coat; he said, no; I said, where did you come from; he said from the water; I said, you are the very man I want, I have had my chambers robbed and you must assist me to find the thief; the man said he could not stop; directly he said he could not stop, I said, if you cannot stay with me, I must go with you, for I shall not part with you; I then asked him very sharply, where do you live; I am not certain whether he said Essex-street or Exeter-street. As the man did not seem to be inclined to stay with me, I went with him; we went through Garden-court, and met no one, up the steps, through Fountain-court, then into New-court; as soon as we came out at the gate I observed him not going to Essex-street, where I thought he said he was going; he turned short round to go to Devereaux-court. As soon as I discovered that, I said, where did you say you lived; he said, Exeter-street; I thought then I would not let him go any further; I said, you had better come back with me, if you do not I shall take you into custody; I placed myself immediately before him, and to a gentleman who was passing by I said, Sir, I have had my chambers robbed, I do not say that this is the man that robbed me; the gentleman caught hold of the man and I slipped the parcel from under his arm; I moved aside the silk handkerchief, and as soon as I observed the colour of the coat, I said, I will take this man into custody; the man expressed an anxiety to have his hat (the bundle contained a coat and a hat); I said, Sir, there is no sort of objection to that; another person came up; I did not then search the hat, upon that there is another witness; we turned round and came through the Temple; we met my friend Mr. Bolland; I said, call a coach; I took the prisoner with me and Mr. Bolland also, and we went together to Bow-street, the Magistrate was not sitting at Bow-street at that time; the person who picked up the hat brought it with him, his name is Jackson; I took the coat, and Jackson who picked up the hat, as I had desired him, brought it with him to Bow-street; Jackson, soon after we had turned round the corner of Devereaux-court, said, here, Sir, are your notes, and delivered them to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was that in the prisoner's hearing? - A. It was; he delivered to me the notes, which I immediately put into my pocket; the notes which I had left in my desk amounted to 21 l.; when the prisoner was taken to the

               <p>Q. What was the amount of the notes found? A. Twenty-one pounds in the desk, and the notes delivered to me amounted to twenty-one pounds.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300016"></xptr>- BOLLAND, Esq. sworn. - Mr. Gleed came to my chambers in October, as he has stated; after remaining there three quarters of an hour, I accompanied him to the bottom of his stair-case; I had remained there near a minute, when I heard a cry of stop him; I thought it was some joke of the workmen that were working on the staircase, as I knew there were workmen there; a man passed me with his coat and hat on, and in his right hand he held a chissel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man? - A. I think I have but little doubt of the person of the prisoner; I am as certain as I can be of the fact from the observation of his running down the stairs and passing me, and in the pursuit I had after him; when he came down the stairs I stood, then, rather out of his reach; I could have sprung upon him, but thinking it was a joke I thought it would be useless to throw the man down, and if it was serious I did not like the chissel; when I found two persons following of him, and that it was serious, I followed him, and in Pump-court I should have caught him, but he doubled as he went down, by which means he threw me out; I was obliged to see which turning he went as there were three; he turned the right hand turning through into Middle Temple-lane, he having then the start of me about twenty yards, having still the chissel in his hand; he ran up the Middle Temple hall stair-case; I remained there some time; I did not see him return: I put some people to watch him and I went and met Mr. Gleed with the prisoner; I then thought he was the man that I had seen come down the stairs. There was a chissel found in his bag, that is not the chissel he had in his hand, the chissel found being a small chissel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner did not brandish the chissel at you, nor attempt to do you any harm? - A. No; whether he be or not be the man he was as quiet as a child.</p>
               <p>- JACKSON sworn. - On the 5th of October I was walking in the Middle Temple hall; a man went past me; I heard the cry of stop thief; Mr. Bolland came into the Middle Temple, and I lost sight of him; from there I walked up Devereaux-court, there I saw the prisoner and Mr. Gleed; I went up to them; Mr. Gleed said, you are the man that robbed my chambers, you must go with me; I turned round and saw the hat lay, I picked it up, I put my hand into the crown of it and took out the Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Bank-notes you gave to Mr. Gleed? - A. Yes; and then we went to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gleed. There is nothing particular on the seal; I had a seal of this impression, of this shape, and form.</p>
               <p>Q. What impression is it? - A. A figure, with a dot; it may be Diana; I have no doubt but that it is my seal, I purchased it at Stafford last circuit; I am more positive with respect to the bottle, it is rather singular in its form, the top of it, instead of being perfectly strait, is rather bent on one side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was moving at the time; I was going to my brother to get a cart and horse; I had crossed the water, and going up Temple-lane I picked up the bundle; I was going through Temple-lane when Mr. Gleed stopped me; I knew nothing whatever what the coat contained.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for the hat? - A. I had never opened the bundle, at the time I picked it up it was laying in the first turning from the waterside; I had no coat nor hat on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

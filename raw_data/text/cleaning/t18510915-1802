                  </hi>. I get my living by jobbing with a horse and cart; I live at No. 24, Ann's-place, Hackney-road. I had a bay mare, which I kept in my stable there—I had another horse at the time in that stable—or Saturday, 23rd Aug., I left my mare safe in the stable about 4 o'clock; the stable was not locked—I went to the stable again about 6 that evening, and the mare was gone—I saw it again on the following Tuesday in North-street, Whitechapel, in possession of Thompson—on the Sunday morning, the day after I lost the mare, I saw the prisoner—I asked him what he had done with the mare—he said he had sold it to a gentleman—I asked him who authorized him to take the mare—he told me I might <hi rend="italic">ax</hi> his b—y a——the mare was worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

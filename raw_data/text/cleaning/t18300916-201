On the 1st of September this property was taken from my drawer - I missed it about twenty minutes before two o'clock in the day - I had opened the street door, and left it a-jar, and my parlour door also - I went down to finish washing my hands, and heard a noise, as if a Pembroke table was thrown down; I went up and saw the prisoner, who was trying to make a rush out; I was startled at the moment, and as soon as I recovered I asked what he wanted - he said Mrs. Jones - I said I had no Mrs. Jones there, and what business had he at the table - he said he had not been there - I asked why he did not knock at the door, and he said he had - he then went out, I turned and saw these things on the sofa - I went to the street-door, and asked the witness if he had seen him; he said he had seen him - I had seen these things safe about an hour before; the drawer they were in was not in the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons are there in your house? A. Four separate lodgers; I have no servant; I had been in the room about two moments before - I had never seen the prisoner before; I lost nothing; it was the third drawer which was opened, and these things were taken from it; I suppose it did not occupy a second.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Minories, and am a slop-seller. On Saturday, the 9th of February, the prisoner came to my shop—he inquired the price of my shirts—I told him—he said he should want from four to six hundred, to go to Carolina—he went away, and returned, and said he thought the shirts would do very well, that be would pay me half the money on Monday, and the other half before the goods were sent from my house—on the Monday I received a note from him, which I have here—I sent my son down with four patterns, as he requested, to show his friends—he came afterwards, and said the shirts would do very well, and he was to have a hundred and fifty of each pattern—I had sent the patterns merely to show his friends—I expected them to come back, to form a portion of what were to be sent—I did not give him credit, to pay for them after they were delivered—the declaration the prisoner made was, "I am ready money, I shall pay you half the money on Monday, and the other half before the goods go out of your house"—I received this note on Monday evening—I had not sent any before I received it, nor did I know where to send them—I sent the shirts merely as samples, not upon sale—I sent eight shirts as samples, and he selected four.</p>

I saw the prisoner the second time he came on the Saturday—he said the shirts would answer the purpose, and on Monday he would bring part of the money—the Monday came, and we began to have our doubts till this note came; and on the Tuesday, in consequence of this note, I took eight shirts to the prisoner's lodgings—he took four—I saw him, and he said, "You have come here with the patterns."</p>

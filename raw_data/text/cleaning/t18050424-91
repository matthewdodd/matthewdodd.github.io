I will do for you; I then got up, and said, if he hit me again, I would knock his head against the settle; he called me a bl - y b - r; I was desired to repeat the words by the Magistrate, though they are very vulgar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. It is the most infamous villainy for this man to say this - Did not you ask me if I would carry a parcel for you, coming by Newport-court? - A. I never saw you in my life before I saw you take up the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you would leave me a shilling, if I would carry these for you? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Newport-market, coming down St. Martin's-lane; as I came down there, I met this man, and I asked him if he knew any place I could sleep in that night; he told me, no, he would leave me a shilling to get a lodging if I would carry a parcel; he told me to come and take up these things, and carry them; immediately I took hold of them, he called out, stop thief; this man came out, and caught hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness? - A. I know no person in London.</p>

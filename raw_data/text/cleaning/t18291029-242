            . I missed my wife on the 25th of October - I went to look for her, and found her in Bunhill-row watch-house; the officer had got these articles - I knew them all to be mine, and they had been in my wife's possession.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. On Saturday, the 24th of October, the prisoner was brought to Bunhill-row watch-house in a state of intoxication - soon after the prosecutor's wife was brought in, and was placed with the prisoner; she was also intoxicated - the prosecutor came in the course of the night to inquire for his wife; we went into the place, and found his wife laying dead and the prisoner was rising from her person - we took the prisoner, and found all these articles on her, which the prosecutor has identified.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER. I was in the watch-house when the deceased was brought in; I saw the prisoner there - these articles were found on her - I believe she did not say any thing; I found this bonnet on her head - I took her to Finsbury watch-house in the morning.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. The prosecutor said he would give me a pint of beer to show him the way to Execution-dock; I did not know him before- the prisoner came in with another man while we were having the beer - they sat down by us; they heard the prosecutor ask me which way we were to go, and they followed us; the prosecutor had his hand on my shoulder - the two men followed us in Back-lane, and the prisoner laid hold of him by the arm, and some money fell on the ground; the other man stooped down, picked something up, and called after the other man, Tom; they both ran away - I had seen the prisoner selling fish in the streets before - I swear he is the man.</p>

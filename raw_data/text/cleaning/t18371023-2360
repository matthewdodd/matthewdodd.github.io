                  </hi>. I live in Skinner's-place, Somers-town. I received my quarter's pension in Oxford-street, on the 13th of October, about one o'clock, and met the two prisoners—I went to an ale-house—I had three sovereigns, three half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence—I drank with them, but did not get drunk—Uriah Smith forced me out of the house, and threw me down, and stunned me—George was in the same company, but not near me—I do not recollect his putting his hand on me—when I got up I was stunned—I walked a considerable distance, and when I came to myself I found my money was gone—I went back to the public-house, and the landlord went after them, but could not find them—I had some dupli<lb></lb>cates in my pocket, tied up in my handkerchief, and I found them still in my pocket.</p>

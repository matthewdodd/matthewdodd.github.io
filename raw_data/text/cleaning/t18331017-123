            . I am the Witham waggoner; my eldest son is between twelve and thirteen years old, but the prisoner is not him - the prisoner is not my son; I have seen him several times - I never gave him any money for me, and never owned him as my son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge - I never saw Mr. Lee, nor any of his men till I was in custody - I never was in his shop in my life; Mr. Lee accused another man of it as I was told, and stuck hard and fast that it was him, until Mr. Dell said that man was not in town on that day; and then he said it was the other man, and Mr. Dell asked me if I would come up and show myself, and clear myself of the charge, and I did so; and when I came, Mr. Lee said I was not the person, and then he said he thought I was.</p>
               <p>HENRY LEE. I said at first that I thought the prisoner was not the man, as he had not his smock frock on - I never accused any one else of it; the other man was shown to me, and I said he was not the man.</p>

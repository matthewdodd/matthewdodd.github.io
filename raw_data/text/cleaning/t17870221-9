               <p>On the 1st of this month, there was a waggon load of hay brought into my yard in <placeName id="t17870221-9-crimeloc55">Kingsland-road</placeName>

               <p>I am a hay binder; I know this hay by my bands; I bind hay for the prosecutor; I turn mine on a stick, and our hay binders turn them on their thumb.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I had the search warrant; and I found the hay on the premises; we took the prisoners out of their beds that night; the prisoners said, they found the hay in the road by the Black Horse; they acknowledged having taken the hay to Collins's; I am sure of that; the road was then exceeding dirty, and there was not a mark of mud on the hay; they said, they found it over right Shoreditch watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My waggon never goes nigh that place; I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. Can you undertake to swear to that hay band that is produced? - Yes, in the make of it, it is more common to turn it upon the thumb; nobody does it so in our part of the country; we could not make them quite so regular with a stick.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you swear that that was one of the trusses of hay that was on that waggon? - Yes, by the string of the hay, and the make; there was no hay I believe sold to any other person but the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Will you swear this, that there is no meadow in the country that produces the same sort of hay as your master's? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you think you think you could know the hay that grows in your master's meadow from any other in the kingdom? - No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I bought the stack, and no man ever had a truss of that hay but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We found the hay.</p>

               <p>Q. How near do you live to the canal - A. About a mile; I had two goslings; I saw them on the over night, I secured them in my yard; they were not in a poultry house. In the morning I was awakened by hearing the noise of the geese; I got out of bed and called my husband and brother and told them the geese were stolen; they had left the gate open; about a quarter of an hour afterwards I went out a washing.</p>

It was between two and three o'clock when my sister called me; I got up directly; I missed six geese, and the gates were open; on the over night I had placed them in the barn and left the barn door open, because I thought it might be too hot for them; between two and three o'clock in the morning my father and me traced the print of naked feet backwards and forwards to the water; there were the print of several more feet, but not without shoes or stockings; we traced them down to the barge in the river; at six o'clock William Read, the constable, went with us and Cox joined us; we went to search the barge, the constable went to them; they were at breakfast; he said they were his prisoners.</p>

Yes; a little after six I went to Mason's yard; I saw in the yard and outside, the track of naked feet, and the mark of a dog's foot; there were four tracks of shoes: we traced the marks down the road to the barge; when I got to the barge I saw the prisoners; I knew Chapman to be one of the men that worked the barge, I told him I wanted him, I had a warrant against him for stealing of geese; I asked Morgan if he was not master of the barge; he said he was, and they were his men that were standing close by; I then told them they must all go with me; Chapman and Cox had no shoes on; I told Morgan. I must search the barge; he said, and welcome, he was sure there was nothing there; I saw the stain and dung of geese and a few feathers littering about the barge; I asked for the key of the fore cabin; he said he would go and fetch it; and went on shore; he did not return so soon or quick as I expected with it; I looked at the other end of the barge where they sleep; I saw some fowls laid uppermost and some ducks, then I saw two goslings; I saw Morgan, as I thought, rather in a shuffle; I handcuffed him; Cook made use of desperate words, he said he did not mind two or three men; I took hold of his collar; he kicked me on my legs and kicked me on my private parts; I told him I would chop his head off if he resisted any more; after I secured him I broke open the cabin; the father of the prosecutor brought the key afterwards, and there I found eight live geese, one hen, and three or four ducks; the parties came and swore to the property; Cox owned the dead goslings the moment he saw them; the live ones Mason owned, and other persons six of the others; after they were taken to the magistrate and after they were examined, we divided them and put them in confinement at Uxbridge; they offered me some money if I would get it made up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I dare say you would rather lose a few guineas rather than to stand in the Old Bailey bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- MURRAY. Q. You are constable of Uxbridge - A. Yes. There were two of the prisoners put into my custody, Cook and Chapman; I went at nine o'clock at night to carry them some beer and bread and cheese; after they had their supper I locked the door and staid outside to hear if any conversation passed between them; one of them said they could not swear to us last night, and the other said if it had not been for your bare feet they would not have found us in the morning.</p>

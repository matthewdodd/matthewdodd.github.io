            . I am servant to Mr. Prior: I went with the warrant to White's-yard, where the prisoner lodged; I found five hampers there in the back yard that belong to Mr. Prior: the prisoner is a basket maker, and keeps a shop there. He said when I took him, that he bought the hampers of a waterman at Billingsgate, coming down from Chelsea; I can swear the hampers are my master's because I made them; I can swear to my work in any part of the world.</p>

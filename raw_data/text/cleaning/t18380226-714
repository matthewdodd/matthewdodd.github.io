                  </hi>. I am the wife of George White, and live in Byrne-street. On the evening of the 12th of February, a boy, who I believe to be the prisoner, came into my shop—he took a 14lb weight out of the scale and went out into the street—I ran after him, and fetched him back—he had not got the weight then.</p>

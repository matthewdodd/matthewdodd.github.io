            . I accordingly informed the master painter that some of his men had robbed me, but not finding any thing I desired Mr. Lawrence, who is our principal warehouseman, to be upon his guard, I desired him to inform me as soon as he had any suspicion. On Tuesday the 5th I missed seven of the quilts mentioned in the indictment, quilt carpets, covered for quilts. I informed Mr. Lawrence, and I marked every one of that bundle that these seven were taken out. From another bundle on Wednesday, the next day, the 6th, I lost two more, I then marked the other parcel, as I found he had shifted the parcel, on Thursday they were all safe; Friday the 8th I lost two more; on Saturday morning I lost another; on Saturday afternoon the prisoner stole another, and I detected him with it; I found one on him, in his breeches, about a quarter before two o'clock, I detected him at the Vine Inn, he was taken a hundred yards from our house, I called to him at the inn, and insisted on searching him; he would not let me; I took him to the warehouse, and began to search him, and I asked him what he had got in his breeches, seeing something; he said, you know what I have got there; and I said, you will be very sorry too, when I have got it out, and I took him home to my counting house, and he owned there that it was the only one that he ever took.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other part of your property in his possession? - Not any more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you charge him with the whole, from your having lost in the dif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040023"></xptr>ferent days a number of carpets to a large amount, because you found one of these in his breeches? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do not suppose that, because it is necessary on the part of the defendant to ask you some questions, that I mean to give you any offence, for I assure you I do not. I take it for granted you was extremely anxious to find out the thief especially when you supposed it was in your own house; was not you led to make some promises to some person in your house to know who was the thief? - To my knowledge I never mentioned a word about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hold out a threat to him or make a promise to him that if you get the property you would be merciful? - Not to him, nor to any man living.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no promise to him at the Vine Inn? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you would prosecute him if he did not tell the truth? - I did not, I was very cautious; I was only here two sessions ago, and this man gave information against the very man that I then prosecuted, he said he knew the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the size of one of these carpets? - They are made of different sizes, I believe this one is about five quarters wide.</p>
               <p>Q. That would occupy a considerable space? - About half the size of that book when put up together, a common octavo, not more.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for; Mr. Galindo had searched him before, he gave charge of him, and gave me the carpet, and it has been in my custody ever since, this is it.</p>
               <p>Galindo. This is the carpet that I lost; I put an S on it with a pencil, a saint mark that it might not be noticed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This seems to me to be more like a coverlid or counterpane? - It is not, it is nothing more than a piece of linen, printed on purpose to cover a quilt.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the mark is the letter S. there is no other mark on it? - No other of my making.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no shop mark at all? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the letter S is the only marks; will you swear that you yourself put that S on the linen, and that that letter S is your own writing? - I will take on myself to swear that it is, because it is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many might you have marked the letter S? - About five or six and thirty; I marked some on Monday afternoon the first parcel, I marked some on Wednesday, and I don't know whether I marked any after.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great many persons that assist you in your shop? - No more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that one? - Mr. Lawrence; he is here present.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to say that from the time of your putting on the letter S. none of those were sold? - By our books I know there were none sold.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is the proprietor and occupier of the house? - Nobody at all but myself alone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What is the value of this one piece? - About five or six shillings.</p>

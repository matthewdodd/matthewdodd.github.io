                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and silversmith, and live at No. 389, Strand, in the house of Louis Kyezor, my brother-in-law—he does not live in it—nobody lives there but myself and a lodger on the third floor—I do not rent the house, but carry on the business for my brother<lb></lb>in-law there—it is his property, and the house also—I have the care and charge of all the property to do as I think proper with. On Friday, the 22nd of November, I came out of the parlour into the shop, at about half-past five o'clock in the evening—I went to attend to the shop, having called the boy in, to get his tea—when I got into the shop I saw a man's hand through a pane of glass, with a watch in his hand—the glass had been cut by some person about a month back, but that did not make it</p>

               <p>loose in the least, it was completely firm, and there was do aperture—when I saw the hand through, the hit of glass was taken completely out—the pane is about twenty inches long, it is common glass—the hole was at the upper corner—I instantly ran out, and saw three persons as close as they could stand together—the prisoner, who is the one I perceived with his hand through the hole, gave the right-hand man something, and the pri<lb></lb>soner and the man on the left, turned towards Southampton-street, which is only one door from my house—the man on the right crossed the road into the Strand—I followed the prisoner five or six yards from my door, and when in the act of taking hold of him, the policeman was coming up, and J gave him in charge—he was between us, the policeman coming towards him, as I was following him—I had seen the pane of glass safe and perfect within ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—the watch cost my brother 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not miss any thing else at the same time, as I had not an opportunity of looking—there are three gas-lights in the shop, by which I could distinguish any body walking on the opposite side of the way even—I saw the prisoner's face distinctly, to know him again, even if he had no jacket on—I have not the slightest doubt of him—I have not found my watch.</p>

I was on duty on the 22nd of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, and coming down Southampton-street I met the prisoner running, and the prosecutor following him—the prosecutor gave him in charge—it was just at the corner, at the second house in Southampton-street—the prisoner was between us—Myers charged him with stealing a watch—the prisoner said nothing—I took him back to the prosecutor's, and searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

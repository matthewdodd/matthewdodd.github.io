Anderson, in Pall-mall - on the 13th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was near the Haymarket - the prisoner accosted me - I went with her to a house - when I went in, I took my purse in my hand to pay for the room; and when I got into the room, I put it into my left hand pocket - I had in it three sovereigns, one crown, one half-crown, and seven shillings; that was beside what I paid for the room - I was not in the room more than five minutes before I missed my purse, and accused the prisoner of it - she denied all knowledge of it - I made an alarm in the house, and requested the people to fetch a policeman - the serjeant of police came with two men - they found the purse and money, but not in my presence - I had undone my trousers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I speak to you, before you spoke to me? A. You spoke to me first - when we got to the house you asked me for a shilling to pay for the room - I did not say I would give you the purse, and what was in it - I was on the bed, but took no liberties with her.</p>

             (police-serjeant C 15). I was sent for, and searched the prisoner to her shift and stockings - I then sent for a female, who found the purse under her petticoats - she steadfastly denied having had the purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He is speaking very falsely - I said I had the purse, but would not give it up. Witness. She denied having it, and abused the prosecutor very much.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 225). On Wednesday evening, 8th Oct., between 6 and 7 o'clock, I was on duty in plain clothes in Holborn, and saw the three prisoners there—I saw Agar go and touch a lady's pocket—he then stopped and sent Burke on in front, and he and Nelhams followed—Burke lifted up the lady's dress, tried the pocket, and turned back to Agar again—Agar sent him back a second time, but he did not succeed in getting anything—they then all three went on as far as Holborn-bars, where there was an obstruction caused by an omnibus—Burke there put his hand into a gentle<lb></lb>man's pocket, drew out a handkerchief, and passed it to Nelhams, who went on ahead with it—I then came up with Agar and Burke, and took them into custody; as I was taking them to the Smithfield station Agar sent two or three boys, one to Plumtree-court, one to Field-lane, and one to St. John's-court, and said to them, "Go and tell them that I am <hi rend="italic">nailed</hi>; tell Mary Paton"—I know Mary Paton well—she and a number of other girls came, and I gave Agar into Hewitt's custody—when the girls came, Burke began struggling to get away, but I secured him and took him to the station—I did not see Nelhams again that night—he was afterwards taken outside Guildhall—I have known them all three or four years, and have frequently seen them together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 3, Meeting-house-court, Water-lane. On the evening of 8th Oct., about 7 o'clock, I was in Holborn, and saw the three prisoners there—I have known them all for eighteen months or two years—I saw Burke try a lady's pocket; the others were close behind him—I do not think he succeeded—he came back to the other two, and they then all went on as far as Gray's-inn-lane, where Burke went close behind a gentleman and took something from his pocket, which, I believe, was a hand<lb></lb>kerchief—the others were close behind him, and he gave the handkerchief to Nelhams, who made off with it; and when I turned round I saw Burke and Agar in Moss's custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where are you a porter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no regular place—I occasionally work at the Royal Hotel; the last time I did so was a fortnight ago—I was not at work on this day—about three weeks ago I worked in Earl-street—I was about two yards off Burke when he took the handkerchief—the other prisoners were immediately behind Burke—there was no one between me and them—I first saw them near Castle-street, and fol<lb></lb>lowed them, taking notice of them—I should have told a policeman, if I had seen one—I have been a witness about twice before within the last twelve months—it may be three times; it is not five times; they were all regarding what I had seen in the streets.</p>

            . I am an officer, of Worship-street. In consequence of information, I took the prisoner in custody, at Mr. Fuller's, Islington; where she was in service - I asked if she had any pocket on, she said, No; she was going to put her hand down, I found she had one on, and three keys in it, I asked her what keys they were, she said, her aunt's, who lived in Vine-court, Spitalfields. As I brought her along, she said, she was innocent - she then said, the keys were those of her boxes, which were at her aunt's, but that her aunt knew nothing of what she had taken there. After taking her to the office, I went with Mr. and Mrs. Fuller, to Vine-court, Spitalfields - I opened one trunk first with this key, it contained a great quantity of linen; I found a tea caddy, a metal watch, a seal, a glove, a 10 l. note, and 14 l. 6 s. 6 d., in silver, shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns.</p>

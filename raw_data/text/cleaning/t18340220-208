            , JUN. I am the son of James Lynn, who is a shell-fish-monger, in Fleet-street - I knew the defendant in Mr. Lovegrove's employ, previous to the 13th of January, for about two years - he came to my father's shop during those two years frequently for brawn, herrings, potted shrimps, and lobsters, for Samuel Lovegrove, his master, who keeps the London Coffee House and Tavern, Ludgate-hill - he has said, on former occasions, that he came from Mr. Lovegrove's, but not always - while he was in Mr. Lovegrove's service, he used to come for these articles on his account, and received them for him, and carried them away himself. - he received them from our shopman and servants on different occasions - they were sold and delivered to him by my father, myself, and the servants - my father has no partner - on the 10th of January, I was not present, but in consequence of a communication made to me by Collis, four slices of brawn were booked to Mr. Lovegrove - on the morning of the 13th of January the defendant came and said to me, "I want three slices of brawn" - I said, "Collis, cut that brawn" - he did so - I said to the defendant, "How many sons has your master in the business?" - he said, "Two," - I said, "Both in the business?" - he said, "Yes; both of them" - I did not mention Mr. Lovegrove's name - I went down the street, and fetched a policeman - I told him to wait outside, and he was taken into custody by the policeman - I gave him the goods, let him go out, and put him in the policeman's hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did not believe the pretence he made? A. No; not on that day, because I was aware of it on the Saturday night - he did not obtain these goods in consequence of the pretence - I delivered them to complete the case against him - Mr. Lovegrove paid for the goods as long as the prisoner was in his service.</p>

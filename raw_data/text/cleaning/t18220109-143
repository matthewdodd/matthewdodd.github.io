            . I am an officer of Islington. I saw Smith in Farringdon-street, Russell-square, (which leads into the mews behind Mr. Phillimore's house) with a large bundle. I went after him, and asked him what he had there - he said he did not know. I asked whose it was - he said it was not his. I told him that was an evasive answer, and I should take him custody. I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182201090057"></xptr>it contained the articles stated in the indictment - I asked where it came from - he at first said it belonged to his fellow-servant, and then that he brought it from Mr. Phillimore's stables. I took him to the watch-house - then went to Mr. Phillimore's, and saw the coachman in the stable. I searched for the prisoner Nicholls; but could not find her. About five minutes after, I saw her in the house, in a very great perspiration, and very muddy - it was wet weather. I took her into the library, and asked how she became possessed of the property I had taken from Smith - she said she could account for every thing but the iron pot - and that some of them were given to her; which Mrs. Phillimore denied. I took her to No. 5, Coram-place, to Smith's, her brother-in-law, as she called him; but could find no such person. I searched her at the watch-house, and found twenty-six keys, and sixteen sovereigns on her - she said it was a general custom with servants who had been a long time in place, to take care of themselves, and she supposed I saw no harm in it - she then asked if there was no way of getting a friend to bribe me. I desired her to hold her tongue.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you first see her - A. About nine o'clock - I saw Smith at eight o'clock. Mr. Phillimore claimed three or four of the keys, and I found they opened the drawers which he pointed out.</p>

            . On the 14th of December, about half-past eight o'clock, I went to Mrs. Phillimore's - Smith had been taken - we went to the stables, and saw the coachman there - went into the house, to look for Nicholls; but was not there - in about ten minutes, I saw her come in at the back door, from the street. She was asked where she had been? she said she had not been out of the house - she was very muddy, wet, and in a dreadful perspiration. She was questioned before Mrs. Phillimore, and said Mrs. Phillimore had given her the things - which Mrs. Phillimore denied. She did not say the iron pot was given to her; she said her brother-in-law, Smith, lived at No. 5, Coram-place. I asked why she said she had not been out - she said she did it to please her mistress. We went to Coram-place; but could not find him. I was present when she was told the bundle was found on Smith. The articles were read over to her - she said every thing but the iron pot was given to her.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. Phillimore. When the officers came to the house, I was in the pantry. Nicholls came and asked me for the key of the area gate - I unlocked it for her; and while I stood there, I was told the officers were in the house. She ran across the road as hard as she could, in the direction for Coram-place, which is not above five minutes walk from the house. I think she returned before she could have gone there.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Upper Montagu-street. Nicholls was four years in my service, as cook. The officer produced two bundles of keys, and several separate ones. I told him immediately that one loose one would open the tea-caddy, and the other the library table drawer, where I keep the keys of my cellar. I tried them, and they opened it - and four more on one of the bunches, I believe to be mine. One fitted the library table at my chambers, and the other the celeret. I had lost them about a year.</p>

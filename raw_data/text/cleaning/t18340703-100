             kept an account with us - I knew the prisoner as being one his lordship's establishment -(looking at a bill) on the 30th of January the prisoner presented this bill for payment - at that time this endorsement,"R. Aickman," was on the back of it, and nothing more - after some little hesitation about the endorsement, I paid the bill - this receipt above the endorsement, and the prisoner's name below it, was written by the prisoner after he presented it - the prisoner said he received it for Mr. Aikman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he received it for Aikman? A. Yes. I saw him write, "Received for," and his name - I am positive the name of Aickman was there before he wrote that - the regular way of receipting a bill of exchange would have been, to have written, "Received," and his own name, if he received it for himself - a banker's clerk always signs as received for the firm - if he had received it for himself, I should not have paid the money, as I knew he was not Mr. Aikman.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had presented the bill, and written on it "Received, J. Aikman," that would have done? A. Yes, If he had said it was paid him by Aikman, as I knew him, I should have made some inquiry - if a stranger had presented it, that would have been another thing - there was some difficulty in making out the name - there is a blot on the name - I am not certain the blot was on the name when it was presented - it might have been blotted at the time he wrote, or not - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Would the bill be payable at all without the endorsement, "R. Aikman," on it? A. Certainly not.</p>

I was employed by Lord Bristol - in January last I had a demand on his Lordship for 184l. 9s. - I delivered a bill to that amount to the prisoner, about the 18th of January - this is the bill (looking at it) - I have been paid the amount of the bill since this investigation - I received no payment from the prisoner for it at any time - this receipt is not my handwriting, nor did I authorize any body to write it - I never received any bill from the prisoner for payment of my bill, or authorized him or any body to endorse any bill - the endorsement on this bill is not my handwriting, nor was it done with my authority - it is not spelt right - my name has no c in it - after delivering my bill, in January, I called at Lord Bristol's to see the prisoner, on Saturday morning, the 29th of January - I spoke to him about my bill, and he said my cheque would be up the beginning of the week from his Lordship - I went there on the 5th February again, and saw him - I asked him if I might write down to his Lordship at Ickworth, on the subject of his bill - I saw him at Lord Bristol's house, at Putney-heath - he told me to call next day at twelve o'clock, and I should receive my money - I went next day - I could not find him - I made every inquiry for him afterwards, but without success.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never gave him authority to put your name on that bill? A. No; I did not - I never saw that bill - I might authorize him to put my name on some papers, but not such a thing as this - never on any bill of exchange, or order for the payment of money - he once drew a bill on me for 10l., for his own accommodation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030046"></xptr>- this is the bill (looking at it) - I never accepted any other accommodation bill for him, nor he for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you may have given him leave to put your name on something or other, what do you mean? A. That bill - that is all - I suffer that to be drawn on me - he did not put my name on it - the acceptance is my own handwriting - I put that name myself - I cannot tell you what I authorized him to write my name on - I did not give him a general leave to use my name - not any thing except this.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you gave him leave on some occasions to use your name, did you not? A. No; I did not - I have not given him permission in any way - this 10l. bill was outstanding at the time the Marquis's bill came to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you ever in your life authorize him to write your name on any bill of exchange, or draft, or order for payment of money? A. No; I permitted him to draw that 10l. bill on me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of the prisoner having written your name on any other paper with your permission? A. No.</p>

            . In January last I was in Lord Bristol's employ - (looking at an account) this is in the prisoner's handwriting - in February last, by the direction of Lord Bristol, I went to Roehampton - I did not find the prisoner there - I made inquiry - I afterwards inquired in town at his Lordship's residence, but did not find him - I went into a public-house, in Crown-court, St. James's, on the 8th of February, and called for a glass of ale; and while they were drawing the ale I heard somebody come in - I took the ale off the counter, turned round, and saw the prisoner come in - the moment he saw me he turned round and went out - I put my glass of ale down, went out into the passage, and into the court, but I did not overtake him - it being a very foggy night, I lost sight of him - I afterwards made inquiry for him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you see him? A. In Crown-court, at the Red Lion - I was standing - he came in behind me - I have not a doubt he saw me, or he would not have gone out - he never spoke to me - he saw me, for he turned out - he looked at me - I was in my livery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no apartments in St. James's-square? Witness. No; not at his Lordship's house.</p>
               <p>THE MOST NOBLE THE MARQUIS OF BRISTOL. The prisoner was in my employ as <rs id="t18340703-100-deflabel560" type="occupation">house-steward</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18340703-100-defend638 t18340703-100-deflabel560"></join> for about a year and a quarter - he ceased to be so in October or November last - I employed him afterwards to pay the Christmas bills for the year he had been in my employ - I did that as a mark of confidence, he having been ten months in my employ in that year, and being satisfied of his honesty - in January I was staying at Ickworth-hall, Bury - I received from the prisoner a list of the outstanding bills - here is an account of a bill due to Aikman - (it is spelt Aickman) - to the amount of 184l. 9s. - the different tradesmen's bills were forwarded to me after they were paid - I think not with the list - it was always my custom, on receiving lists of the bills, to enclose drafts for the amount to the prisoner - this bill (looking at it) is drawn by me, and was forwarded to the prisoner with others - I sent my steward for the stamps - there could have been no endorsement on the back of it, of course, but I did not look at the backs of each of them - I afterwards received this receipt from the prisoner, for Aikman's account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You sent orders for money with this? A. Yes, altogether - I cannot say that every one of them came faithfully into the hands of the parties - there were a great many, and all came back duly receipted, except two, and I ascertained that those two persons happened to be out the day he called to pay them - I transmitted this bill to the prisoner, probably the same evening as I drew it - I addressed them to him at Roehampton, or St. James's-square.</p>
               <p>(The bill was here put in and read; also a receipt for the amount, signed R. Aickman.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, although unfortunately placed in this degrading situation, I will not encroach on your time, except to assure you of the absence of any improper motives on my part when I gave the receipt for Aikman's money, not having had any intention of misappropriating his money - on that day I paid several tradesmen's bills, and by drinking with them, I got intoxicated - not having time to pay Aikman, I sent his Lordship all the receipts that night, as he requested; and knowing his Lordship would feel disappointed at not receiving the receipts, I thought it no harm to send a receipt for Aikman, intending to pay him the following morning; but unfortunately for me, in a state of intoxication, I entered a gaming-house, where, I believe, I lost all the money - this was inquired into by the officer, and found to be true - the only recollection I have of the affair is, that I went to the gaming-house - perceiving the loss I sustained next morning, I wrote to my friends for money to pay Aikman - Gentlemen, you have heard from the cashier to Goslings that he knew me - can you then, or any thinking men, suppose, as I was known there, that I should myself have presented the cheque, if I intended a forgery or a fraud? - Might not the money have been obtained without my appearing for it, or giving my receipt for it? - if fraud had been my intent, should not I have appropriated the whole sum to my purpose, and have left the country? - in obtaining the money, I acted by the desire of Aikman - he authorized me to receive it - there was nobody to take up the Â£10 bill where it was payable - he authorized me to receive this money for the purpose - I admit receiving it, and writing the receipt; but through the losses I sustained, I could not pay him - having received it by his desire, he knew he had no claim on Lord Bristol or the banker - hence the origin of my being accused of forgery - by charging me with forgery, he secures himself from the loss - I hope, from your knowledge of business and the world, you will not submit me to the sentence of having committed forgery.</p>

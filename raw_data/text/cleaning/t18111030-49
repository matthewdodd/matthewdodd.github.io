From information on the 30th of October we sent for Branscomb and Drinkwater, two officers, and during the time that we were relating to them the information that we had received, the prisoner was leaving our premises at the bottom of the gateway, he was going to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that he had been that day in the warehouse where the cantharides were. - A. I only know from report. When Branscomb was in possession of the information, he immediately stopped the prisoner, he took him to the warehouse and searched him, I saw Branscomb take a paper bag from him containing a pound of cantharides, they were worth thirty-nine shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a species of drug that you had in your warehouse. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you produced this paper bag did Mr. Beckworth claim the property. - A. He did, they were his.</p>
               <p>- DRINKWATER. I am a constable, I went to the prisoner's house with Branscomb I found a great many articles, cayene, pepper, cloves, black lead as much as half a bushel.</p>

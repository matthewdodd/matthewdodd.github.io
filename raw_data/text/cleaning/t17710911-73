            . On the 14th of July, about nine in the evening, I was going along <placeName id="t17710911-73-crimeloc389">Cornhill</placeName>

I catched hold of his Collar, and never let him go till I got him to the compter. I am sure it is the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Why did not you stop the woman?</p>
               <p>Hollaway. I spoke to a woman in a crowd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110080"></xptr> and said I believe you have my handkerchief; she pulled out a blue and white handkerchief, and said, you rascal, is this your handkerchief; and being a croud the woman got away.</p>

               <p>I go about with hardware, and sometimes with lemons. I am eleven years old. The gentleman laid hold of my collar, he was very much in liquor, and said I had got his handkerchief, and he dragged me to Wood street compter. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was as sober as I am now.</p>

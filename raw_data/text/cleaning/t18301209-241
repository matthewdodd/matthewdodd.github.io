            . I am servant to Mr. Fisher. I saw the coach-house safe at eight o'clock in the evening - every thing was then locked up; I got up next morning at a quarter before seven, and found the coach-house door was broken off - the staple of the lock was drawn; part of a pane of glass was cut out of the stable window, but there was an iron bar inside; the coach-house door was broken open by some strong instrument - I missed a cap and a towel of my own, the other things were master's; I found the prisoner in custody with the whole of them, at six o'clock in the morning - they were in a bag, which had been in the coach-house; the prisoner worked at Little Chelsea about twelve months ago, and I have seen him once since - he said nothing to me at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was coming home at half-past one o'clock at night, and heard somebody at the back of the prosecutor's premises; I stood still till it came close to me, and it turned out to be the prisoner - he heard me coming towards him, and bolted as hard as he could; I followed after him as hard as I could - he passed the stable, and had a bundle on his shoulder; he got over a bedge, and threw the bundle over a fence - I saw no one with him; I got over the fence, leaving the bundle there, and never lost sight of him till I caught him, and brought him back to the bundle, which I sold him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090119"></xptr>carry to the station-house, but he would not; I sprang my rattle, and a private watchman came - he carried the bundle to the station; Mr. Fisher and his son came and claimed the property - I found inside the coach-house door another bundle, ready to be carried away.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

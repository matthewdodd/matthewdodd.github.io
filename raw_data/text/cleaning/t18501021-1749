                  </hi>. I am a builder, my father's name is Redding Watts; he has some carcass houses in Eaton-place, Belgrave-square. On the morn<lb></lb>ing of 2nd Oct., I went there with M'Keene, and saw a basket with a white cloth over it—M'Keene lifted up the cloth; the basket contained this lead—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went on to the roof, and found one of the lead flats cut up—I left M'Keene to watch, and gave information at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Redding Watts, and know the pre<lb></lb>mises in Eaton-place. On 2nd Oct. I went there and found the basket with the cloth over it—I left it there—on 3rd Oct., about half-past three o'clock, I saw the two prisoners; one got into the building, and the other stood outside—they were not working there, and had no business there—I never saw them before, but I am quite sure they are the persons—I compared the lead pro<lb></lb>duced with the roof of the house, and the cuts correspond exactly—the cuts appeared very recent.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Watts. On 3rd Oct. I was on the 2nd flight of stairs watching—I could see where the basket of lead was—about half-past three o'clock both the prisoners came up side by side; Severs looked in, and then they both went up Eaton-place, and came back again—Dance got over the pole in front, through the door, took the cloth off, and walked off with the basket—when Dance got in, Severs was in the street against the scaffold pole, six feet nine inches off him—I pursued Dance, he threw the basket over the wall of No. 7, and the cloth over St. Michael's Churchyard railing—I called, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped by a policeman—I have compared the lead found with that on the roof, and it corresponds exactly; but there is twenty-two feet more missing.</p>

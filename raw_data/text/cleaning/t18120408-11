            . I am an officer. On the 20th of March, about half past seven o'clock, on going up Wood-street I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way to where the cart was, on the same side that I was on, and then he crossed over the way to the cart that was standing at the door; he looked up at the number or the name of the cart; I saw him take something out from behind the horse in the front of the cart I presume it must be. He came away seemingly talking to himself, he came away from the cart. The cart was about two doors from Bull's Head passage; he turned up Bull's Head passage; I was close to his heels; I said to my partner, Jem, here; I catched hold of the prisoner's jacket at the hind part, he immediately dropped the bundle; I said, Jem, you pick it up; I jumped over the bundle; the prisoner got away; I pursued him into Oat-lane, he was not a yard before me the whole time, I called out stop thief, and he called out stop thief as lustily as I did, and just as he got to the top of Bull's Head passage; I struck him over the legs with a stick, he fell down and rolled over two or three times, and called out stop thief the whole time, I got hold of him; he got up again and said he would not be taken, he said he was an honest man.</p>
               <p>JAMES TOMPKINS. I was in company with Waugh at the time. This is the bundle the prisoner dropped in the passage, I took up the bundle, and followed him. We secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Waugh. Did you see any other man in the passage besides him - A.No.</p>
               <p>Nichols. That is the bundle that was in my cart; I delivered nineteen instead of twenty, this made the twentieth.</p>

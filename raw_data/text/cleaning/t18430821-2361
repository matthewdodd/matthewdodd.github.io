I live at Whetston—these are my father Wil<lb></lb>liam Matthews's sheep—I saw them safe on the 18th of January, in the almshouse field, in the parish of Friern Barnet; and on the 20th, I found six carcasses and six skins in Newgate market—I was in search of them from the 18th till the 20th, and I identified them—I took one prisoner named Thompson at that time—he was tried and transported for ten years—I did not see any thing of this prisoner to my knowledge.</p>

I live in West-street, Saffron-hill—on the 19th of Jan<lb></lb>uary, I saw the prisoner with Thompson, helping to dress some sheep at Bowling-street, Clerkenwell—he was taking the skins off—there were three skins hanging up, and three on the ground—I saw the prisoner, and Thomp<lb></lb>son, and Shelcross, the next morning, coming to fetch them away in a truck; the prisoner said, "Good morning," and said he had taken the premises and should have a slaughter-house built there—I said I was a bricklayer, if he had not spoken to any one else, I should be glad to have the job—he said, "Very well, as you are a neighbour I shall employ you"—I never saw any more of him.</p>

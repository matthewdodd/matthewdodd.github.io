Last Tuesday about five in the afternoon, I was stooping down to get some chips to light the fire; when I looked up I saw the prisoner at the door going out, I did not see him come in; thinking he had taken something from the shop, I missed a piece of cloth from the counter; I followed him, and saw him with it under his arm; he ran, and I after him, and called, stop thief; he ran round into the next street, there he dropped the piece; I took it up; the mob ran after him and caught him, and brought him back to our shop. I asked him how he could go to do such a thing, he seemed very much in liquor. (The cloth produced and deposed to)</p>

            . I live facing Mr. Philips's. I saw the prisoner with the cloth under his arm, walking as fast as he could walk; the evidence came after him, and called stop thief; he then ran, and I ran after him; he dropped the cloth; Mr. Martin took that up; I followed the prisoner; he was stopped; I went up to him, he seemed very full of liquor; we brought him back, and he was committed.</p>

I happened of a friend that came from Scotland; I went to an alehouse with him and drank, and sometime after I was in prison, I did not know what was come to me.

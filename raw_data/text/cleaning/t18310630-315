I have known the prisoner about five months - she lived at a lodging-house, and got ill-used; we took her in out of kindness - my wife and I went out on the 16th of February; the prisoner walked with us a little way, - I gave her the key to go back to our house, and to finish some stay-stitching that was in the house; she was to stay till we returned from Greenwich - I came home at five o'clock in the evening, and expected to find her at home, but she had locked the house up, and left the key next door; we went in, and missed the property stated from the drawers - she had knocked the top of the drawers up, got the top drawer out, got the others open, and taken these things; the money had been in the middle drawer - I heard of her, and had her taken on the 4th of June; I have not got any of my property.</p>

I had onions growing on my premises in a ground enclosed with a quickset hedge; they were growing there on the morning of the 13th. On the morning of the 15th, about two o'clock, the watchman called me up, I went into the ground and missed them - they must have been pulled up within an hour, as the ground was quite fresh. The patrols brought them to me in a basket and sack - they appeared to have been recently drawn, and were of the same size and appearance as mine. There was about a bushel and a half, and were worth 8 s.</p>

            . I am a foot patrol of Fulham. On the 15th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I was going my rounds, and heard somebody in Mr. Jefferys' premises. I got over the hedge, and told Jee to remain there. I saw the prisoner with the sack on his back - I knew him well before. I was going to lay hold of him, but slipped down. He spoke to me, then threw the sack down, and escaped through the hedge and over the water. The sack contained onions. I took it and called the prosecutor. On the 17th of June I apprehended the prisoner. As he was going before the magistrate he confessed it, and said he borrowed the sack of Mr. Boulton, who was going to buy the onions of him.</p>

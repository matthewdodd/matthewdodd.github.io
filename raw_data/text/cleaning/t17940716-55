I had been abroad for sometime; I returned on the 3d of June; I looked for my clothes when I came home, and I missed them; I missed all the articles in the indictment, and more. I left the house last November; she was the only servant left in the house; there was the counting house kept there, to which the clerks had access; one of the clerks resided in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of this property? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you impute it to the prisoner? - About ten days after my return, I came home one night, and found her in liquor, I was obliged, with the assistance of the other gentleman, to carry her to bed by force, and locked the door that she could not get out; before I delivered her in the morning, I looked through my drawers and other places in the house, one drawer in particular, which I knew to be full of table linen when I went away; the linen was taken out, and a large blanket was substituted in the place of the several things, that had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160089"></xptr>taken out, and slightly covered over with table linen, which was sufficient to confirm my suspicions; I went immediately to Guildhall, and got an officer, and charged him with the prisoner. It appeared that she had got false keys by the blacksmith's bill that was found upon her, with some duplicates to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any injury done at all to these drawers? - Some of them I cannot use again with the same keys as formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do those duplicates answer to any of these things in the indictment? - The indictment was drawn from these duplicates, and a table cloth that was taken from her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you before you went abroad? - Four or five months. I got a character from a near relation of her's; and she appears to have began this practice very few days after she came into my service.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I want to know, as you are a single man, whether this woman was not in the habit of advancing money for the things that were used in the house? have you never, for instance, paid her money that she had before advanced; as when you have ordered a dinner for your friends, she may have had some things of your green grocer, which she paid, and you paid for afterwards? - No, I don't know any such thing.</p>

            Did not you owe her half a year's wages at the time you came home? - I made out her accounts, and there is a balance owing to her of three or four pounds, granting she paid all the bills that she debits me for, which she has not, for they have come in since, two bills came in this week.</p>

            Is not the door of the house constantly open? - No, there is a counting house bell to ring.</p>
               <p>Jury. How does that door open when the bell is rung? - There is a bell handle in the counting house, just by the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the clerk must pull to open the shop door? - They must; the pully from the counting house draws the lock of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand that there was three or four pounds due to her; has she demanded that sum or not? - She has not; she asked for money after I did come home, and I gave her a guinea.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any duplicates found that applied to your linen? - I cannot tell. The prisoner came home one night in liquor, and the prosecutor desired me to see if I had any thing wrong; and I found some things wrong; I missed some shirts, handkerchief, and a waistcoat; which I recognized before the alderman; but I cannot swear to it, because it has no mark on it; I saw a pair of stockings also; I cannot say exactly what I have lost, because I have no note of my clothes.</p>

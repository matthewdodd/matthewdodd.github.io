            . I am the prosecutor's housemaid. On the 7th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in the back-kitchen - the butler's pantry is in front - I heard a rattling of spoons, went to the area, and saw the prisoner, Brooker, at the top of the area-steps, within the rails; I ran up the steps, and called out Stop thief! I pursued him, and lost sight only as he turned the corner. I followed him till he was caught - he was not out of my sight two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running - A. When I called out he began to run. Several persons came round when he was taken. I do not know who stopped him.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 7th of October, a little before four o'clock, I was going up Wimpole-street, and saw the prisoner, Brooker, down an area there, talking to a footman - I had no suspicion of him, and went on about my business, and saw Cox standing about, I then thought something not right was going on. I watched, and saw Brooker leave the footman, and join Cox. I went down Weymouth-street, and as I returned up Devonshire-street, I saw Cox and two or three more waiting at the corner of Devonshire-place (not one hundred yards from the prosecutor's). I live at No. 6, Devonshire-place. I rang the bell to go in, and saw Brooker come out of Mr. Walter's area, with something under his coat. I was going after him, and saw the girl come out of the area and cry Stop him! he then ran, I followed him round the corner into Beaumont-street, and he was there taken - I never lost sight of him. I saw him stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270011"></xptr>and searched - a few halfpence and a knife were found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cox at the time - A. Yes, he came up, and tried to rescue him; when I saw that I secured Cox. Nothing particular was found on him. There were one or two more, who escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Brooker close to Cox, or the others, before he was taken - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>FDEDERICK TABOR. I am a builder. I was in Beaumont-street on the 7th of October, about four o'clock, heard the cry of Stop thief, and saw Brooker running, with something under his coat. I pursued, and when I got a short distance he dropped something, which on passing I observed to be plate. I did not stop to pick it up, but followed him about a hundred yards down the street - he was stopped by another man. As I returned with him Long brought me part of the plate - I had not lost sight of it. Lloyd brought me some more - I delivered the prisoner to him, and took the whole of the plate, gave it to a hair-dresser in the street, who carried it before me into his house.</p>

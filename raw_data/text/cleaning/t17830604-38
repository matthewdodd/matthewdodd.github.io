               <p>The prisoner came to my house on the 21st of May, in the evening, with a person that I know, to look for a lodging; he had one in my house, he staid in my taproom about five or six minutes, and went up to bed, and I saw no more of him; I believe he stole the clothes out of the room; Youngman lodged in that room, he was out that night, and I told him to lay in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040051"></xptr> bed; the watchman told me, he saw a man in brown clothes, come out of my house, at three in the morning, and he left the door open, and that he shut it himself; I am positive this is the man that came and lodged that night at my house; he was taken the Tuesday after.</p>

               <p>I came from Portsmouth, on Thursday the 23d of May, and I was going to Queen-street, and I bought the coat, waistcoat, and breeches at a clothes shop, and I wore them through London for three or four days, and one night coming up the Strand, I was taken, and I was examined the next day, and this gentleman said, the property that was on my back belonged to him; I told the Lord Mayor where I bought them, I never was in Biggerstaff's house in my life; I was not in London, I was in his Majesty's service almost a dozen years since, and then I was pressed, I was going to Ireland.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL THOMPSON. I am a policeman - I was going my rounds, near Mr. Harvey's house, on the night in question, and observed the area-gate, which leads to the tap-room window open from the wall, and the tap-room window drawn down half-way - I went my rounds, came back to the house, and stood by a door leading to a court - I heard a noise inside, and footsteps of somebody come towards the side door, as if to listen, then return and go back to behind where he made a noise; the footsteps came back again, and I heard the bolt drawn gently from the door; the noise went back again, and then went up to the parlour; and I heard a loud noise within - then the footsteps came towards the door, as if he was walking on the top of his feet; a constable came to my assistance - I placed him at the door, and I went to the front door and gave the alarm; and after some time, a female answered me from the first floor window - I told her to make haste and open the door - I heard that the thieves were escaping at the back of the house, and, in a few minutes, the prisoner was taken - I heard a cry of policeman, and found him in custody of Parish; Mr. Harvey came down dressed - I am sure it was the prisoner that was found that night - I have known him a long time; another constable took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know if he saw any marks of violence on the shutters? Witness. I saw marks of violence on the window and the sash, as if it was fresh broken - I went on the lead flat afterwards, and found the spoon and sugar-tongs.</p>

            . I am a policeman - I heard the rattle spring - I immediately ran to the place, and took the prisoner into custody inside the house - he was inside the door, outside the bar - I found no property on him - I took him into custody, and he immediately dropped down, as if very drunk; but I believe he was sober: he walked as steady to the station-house as I did; and as we went along he put his hand into his pocket, and dropped some money out of his pocket - after putting him into the station-house, I brought a light, and picked up two half-pence, and two farthings, on that place.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. I know the spoon - there is no particular mark on the tongs; but they are like mine - he did not use any violence to me - I think it very likely the fall down stairs might have made him sober - I think when I first laid hold of him he was intoxicated - I have seen him intoxicated before - I believe he has no command over himself at those times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."On the day stated in the indictment I had been drinking freely all the afternoon - I went into the Duke of Clarence public-house late in the evening, for the purpose of going to the water-closet, where, overcome with liquor, I unfortunately fell asleep, and remained in that situation until I heard a noise, which awoke me - I endeavoured, after I found myself in this situation, to get out and make my escape over the leads - the landlord found me making the attempt, and challenged me - I went towards him - we went down stairs, and he gave me into custody of the police, from whence I was taken into the station-house - after searching me, nothing was found upon me; nor do I know anything of the articles found by the policeman - I entirely throw myself on your merciful consideration and humanity - I am innocent of the crime, and was unfortunately found on the premises through the circumstance I have stated - I leave my case for the mercy of the court, and place myself entirely in their hands."</p>
               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK FIELD. I took the prisoner on the 2d of February last, for stealing a quantity of sharouts, value 5s. - he was tried here - I produce a certificate of his conviction - (read) - the prisoner is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was brought here on that charge I was quite innocent.</p>

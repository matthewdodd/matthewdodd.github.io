The prisoner's father came to me, and in consequence of what he said, I went to Hogg-lane—I saw the prisoner there—her father said to her, "Now, Mary, tell the policeman what you have been doing—tell him the, truth"—I did not encourage her to tell me—I said nothing to her—another girl of the name of Gainey was taken that night for stealing linen, and her father said that he had heard that some policemen had been to his house after his girl.

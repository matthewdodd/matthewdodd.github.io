             (Police-constable H 69). On the 18th of March I was in <placeName id="t18330411-117-crimeloc648">Cable-street</placeName>

               <p>MARY FORD. I sent the prisoner to St. Katharine's-docks for a number of mats of sugar, for Messrs. Goodheart, on the day in question; I was sent for to the station, where I saw the waggon and the mats of sugar, five or six of which had been opened - the sugar found in this bag corresponds with that in the mats; there are 61 lbs. of sugar, worth 5d. per lb.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GARTON. I am an officer. I got this certificate from Mr. Clark's office - I was present when the prisoner was tried in the name of John Tingay, in September, 1827 - he is the same man; he was tried for stealing sugar, and sentenced to be transported for seven years.</p>

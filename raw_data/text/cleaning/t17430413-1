            . I have seen the Prisoner at our Shop before she brought this Piece of Goods; I believe she might bring some odd trifling Things of her own before, but I cannot be positive. - I stopped her when she brought this, because I thought it a Thing of too much Consequence for her to be the Owner of. I asked her how she came by it, and she said the Person she had it of was gone into Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. A Fellow-Servant of my Daughter's gave her this Piece of Cloth to pawn, and she unfortunately carried it to pawn. I believe she had no Suspicion that she came dishonestly by it. She lived Fellow-Servant with her. She is a French Woman, her Name is Crushee. My Daughter came to me, and the Person called upon her while I was in the Room. - I think it was on Saturday was three Weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this Woman brought this Piece of Cloth to your Daughter?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. My Daughter had been out at Service, and had been come Home but three Days. I know that Woman has brought several Things to her.</p>

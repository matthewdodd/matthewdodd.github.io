I saw the prisoner in my house about twelve o'clock at noon on that day - she came for a glass of liquor - the stairs come down into the passage, and a person could go up them before they get to the tap-room. I had seen them safe about ten o'clock, and missed them while she was in the house. I went to Mr. Cameron, the pawnbroker's, about one o'clock, and found them.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Cameron, pawnbroker, Strand. I took in two sheets for 6 s. about half an hour before they were claimed by Mr. Jones. I am pretty certain it was the prisoner who pawned them; she brought another pair the next day - I accused her of having stolen those she brought the day before - she denied it, and I thought from her denying it so strongly, that I might be mistaken, but I have no doubt she is the person; they were pawned in the name of

            . I am a stable-keeper. On the 22d of December I was in my yard, at the back of the Peacock, about ten o'clock in the morning of that day, and saw the prisoner go in at the back door, which opens into my yard. I did not see her come out again. I went into the Peacock about twelve o'clock; I then saw her taking a glass of liquor at the bar. I had heard of the robbery about eleven o'clock - I told Mr. Jones I had seen her go into the house before, while she was drinking her glass of liquor. I have seen her a hundred times before, and have known her these ten years.</p>

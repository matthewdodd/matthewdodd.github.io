On the 7th of November, be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor informed me of this—I made inquiry where I should be able to meet the prisoner—I met him with the fire-irons in his hand about nine o'clock—I said, "Halloo, what have you there?"—he said, "A set of fire-irons—I will sell them you, if you like, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Seven shillings!"—he said sooner than have words about it, I should have them for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him back to the prosecutor's shop—he said he was the man.</p>

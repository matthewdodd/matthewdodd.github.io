            . I took the prisoner on the 13th, and found the planes on him, but the Policeman who has them is not here: the prisoner was rather tipsy, and let them fall at the bar - they were left there till the morning - the same planes were shown to the prosecutor, who claimed them; the prisoner offered them to me for 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you see them? A. At the bar of the Maidenhead; they were left with the servant, who is not here - I took notice of them, and have seen them since at the office; the Policeman took them there - that was the day after they were taken.</p>
               <p>ROBERT MATTHEWS. They were two of the planes I lost; I saw the Policeman take them off the board at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them for 3s. of a man who came into the Maidenhead in distress - he said he was a carpenter.</p>
               <p>MR. MATTHEWS. He said he bought them of a man, but he did not know who he was, and the Magistrate said,"You are the thief."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had given 3s. for them? A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings - A. Yes; I let lodgings to this man and woman about four months ago. The woman came in the afternoon, and the man in the evening, as I supposed, when he came from work. They had the kitchen at three shillings a week; it was furnished; it contained all the articles mentioned in the indictment; they were to have the use of them. Some weeks after they had been in my house they were quarrelling; I went and begged they would be quiet. The man said, he had great reason for doing what he had done, and if I knew I would be as angry as he was, she had been pawning my bed clothes. I begged them to be quiet, and in the morning I would see about it. On Monday morning I went and found there were some things missing; he promised he would get them again, and leave my house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210053"></xptr>quietly. They were brought back that time, I saw them; some weeks passed, and they were there, I begged of them to leave my place, they would not; I could not get rid of them, then by way of seeing whether my things were safe, I said, I was afraid my bed tick wanted mending, if she would let me see it, I would place some pieces on it, and send my children to sew it, I saw the blankets and sheets were all gone, except the bed, an under blanket and a rug; she told me, that her husband had not minded his work in a proper manner, and through this they were made away with, but not without his knowledge. The man went regular to his work, in the evening when he returned from his work I spoke to Mr. Clarke, he told me, that his misfortunes were much worse than mine, I should not be injured by it, if I would wait till Saturday night he would restore me all my things again, and he would leave my house quietly. On the Saturday night following, they returned in the evening, my husband did not return till twelve o'clock, they quarrelled and abused each other, and were fighting, I was afraid to go near them, on the Sunday morning they got up and went out together, in the evening they came home together, and laid down the three shillings for the last weeks rent. On the Monday morning the door was shut, I could not go in to see what they had done with the things. On the Wednesday or the Thursday about six o'clock I saw the man coming out of the kitchen; I said, Mr. Clarke, I have been looking for you, I want to see if my things are safe; he said, it was through the misconduct of his wife, if I could let it be till the Saturday night, he had a considerable sum of money to receive. On the Friday evening I went down; I said, Mr. Clarke, I understand you have got your wife with you, she had been shut out three days; I said, open the door; he said, excuse me opening the door, she is not here; I was convinced she was there; I went out to Worship-street, the magistrate did not sit. On Saturday morning, I went to the kitchen, I said, Mr. Clarke, are not you up; he said, no; I went out, and he sent his wife out before him; he went out, and I followed them into George-yard, Whitechapel, they separated to look, they saw me, they got out of my reach, I could not find them; they never returned. I found the duplicates in my kitchen.</p>

            . I am a constable of Brentford. I took the prisoner on the evening of the 25th of December, in Mr. Trimmer's house; I took him the next afternoon before Colonel Clitherow - I searched his lodging, in Upper Butts, Brentford, and found these shoes, two padlocks, a drinking-horn, ring-case, and wafer-stamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know the prisoner's wife lived with Mr. Trimmer? A. She did; I do not know who took them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was in my service - he came on the 27th of April, 1828; he had left me before Christmas-day - I had a female servant, and it turned out that she was his wife; I gave him permission on Christmas-day to dine with my servants - in the course of that day two officers came to my house; I know this wafer-stamp, padlock, Morocco ring-case, and rake to be mine - I believe the poker and tongs are mine; I never gave the prisoner authority to take any of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had lived in your service? A. Yes, and his wife continued up to Christmas-day; I discharged him on the 9th of September - I did not miss these articles till I saw them at three o'clock in the morning of the next day, in the officer's possession - some of them might have been stolen between the 9th of September and Christmas-day, but some of them I saw after the 1st of December; the prisoner came to the next house, and was admitted by a man who I keep as a gardener.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you discharged him, did you know he was married to the female-servant? A. No- I had seen this wafer-stamp on the 1st of December; he was well acquainted with the house; I had left him there for two months in charge with his wife: this cravat is mine - it has my name on it in full.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of visiting at your house? A. I forbade him the house till I discovered he was married, and then I told his wife he might come; he came the first time on the 14th of December, and then the second time on the 25th.</p>

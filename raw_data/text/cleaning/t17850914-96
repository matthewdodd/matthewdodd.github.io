               <p>You did not see him before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>He was not at the door and tripped up your heels? - I have no recollection of that man, he came up and offered me four guineas to make it up and not to appear, and I sent in to the Justice.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He offered me four guineas not to appear against the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Was any body present when he made that offer? - Yes, there was one Brown, that was with him, and one Mr. Burton, a master blacksmith at Blackwall, but he is lame and not able to come.</p>
               <p>Was there anybody present with you here now? - No, Sir, nobody at all, this man himself went to the Justice, to ask whether I might take the money or not.</p>

               <p>Were you ever, at any time with the prosecutor at the King's Arms in East Smithfield? - I saw him there, he came in there, but I never spoke to him, nor drank with him, he gave the girls something to drink.</p>
               <p>You never spoke to him in the King's Arms? - I never spoke to him in the King's Arms.</p>

               <p>How long was it after the prosecutor went home with Langley, that you went afterwards there to light a candle? - I look upon it not to be above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Where had you staid then? - I was standing talking to Mrs. Taylor.</p>
               <p>When you went to Jenny Langley's to light your candle, where did you find the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140133"></xptr> prosecutor and her? - He was sitting at a table or a stool in her appartment; I left them in the room together, but as I crossed over the way, I saw him go away.</p>
               <p>If Jenny Langley, as you say, was no acquaintance of your's, how came you to go to her apartment? - I went to light my candle.</p>
               <p>Had you any other business there, or did you go there for any other purpose than to light your candle? - I did not so help me God.</p>
               <p>Positively? - Positively I did not.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor keeps a chandlers shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray did you buy any bacon and eggs at her shop that night? - I cannot rightly say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mrs. Taylor's shop after you had been to light your candle at Langley's? - No, I did not, I went home directly and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Then if you bought any things there, it must be before? - Yes, it must, for I went home directly, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your wife at home? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What time did she come home that evening? - I cannot tell rightly, about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was she alarmed at this, did she come out upon the occasion? - I cannot rightly remember, but I went home and went to bed.</p>
               <p>She was at home when you went home from Langley's to go to bed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Before you give your evidence, hear what I have to say to you; be cautious what you say, I have two other witnesses that have been examined before, you have not heard their examination, they have contradicted each other very materially; I wish to save you from the guilt of perjury: I have ordered them to be detained in Court, with an intention of committing them to Newgate for perjury, if the Jury does not believe their evidence, and if you should give an evidence that the Jury should not believe, you will share the same fate; now, with that caution, if you wish to be examined, it is upon your own head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. I shall speak nothing but truth; on Friday night about a quarter after 11; I was in bed and asleep, and my husband likewise, and some person knocked at the door, I asked who was there, and the man said he was a friend, and I immediately asked him what he wanted; he said to come in doors; my husband asked him what he wanted; he said no more; he went to the next door to Mr. West's, who is an elderly old gentleman, and his wife is old, and she spins; he knocked at the door and begged for a bit of candle, and they gave him a bit, and he came to my door again with a light in his hand, and I said to my husband, get out and see what the gentleman wants, and he got out in his shirt, and I got out in my shift, and stood behind the door, and my husband said, friend what is that you want, and he said he had been robbed, and my husband said, friend, was you robbed here, and he looked about a bit, and he said no, he was not; he went away, and I shut the door and went to bed, and I know no farther.</p>

               <p>How high was this? - In the one pair of stairs; I slept in the one pair stairs; I pursued, and took one of them, which is the prisoner; I have the key of the room, where I found the prisoner; the lock must have been picked; I locked it myself; it was open in the morning.</p>
               <p>How got they into the house? - I cannot tell indeed; the things were in, in the evening, and in the morning they were gone; the hat was found on the stairs; the other things were never found; they jumped down stairs when I unlocked my door, and ran out; the street door was open when they came to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Perhaps some of the lodgers might have gone out before that time in the morning? - I always lock that room every night, and take the key into my room; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Did you ever try the other keys of your house? - No one opens it that I know of.</p>
               <p>Are they men or women that lodge in your house? - Men and women both; I saw the prisoner in the room.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the windows, to see if any body had got through the window? - No, Sir, there was no marks of that; I missed two tea-spoons, the one marked, the other unmarked; two pistols, a hat of my husband's; I never knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. There were a good many people come backwards and forwards to your lodgers? - Yes; no key will open that door, of any other of the doors to my knowledge.</p>

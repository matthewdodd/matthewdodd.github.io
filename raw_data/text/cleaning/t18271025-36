            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge, at the watch-house, in Vine-street, Piccadilly - I asked him where the sovereign was; he said he had left it at home at his mother's, as he had a hole in his pocket, and was afraid of losing it - I said, that was not true; he persisted in saying he had left the fruit at the Marquis', till a messenger, whom I had sent, returned from there - I found 8s. 21/2d. on him; he then acknowledged that he had not been to the Marquis', but had eaten part of the fruit, and given the rest away; he said he had spent the money, and was sorry for it, and hoped he should be forgiven.</p>

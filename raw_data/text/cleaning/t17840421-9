               <p>Was there any appearance of any body having got in? - There was no appearance of that, but both the windows were very much dirtied; I do not know whether any of the family had been in since.</p>

               <p>Court. What may be the value of these things?</p>
               <p>Golightly. I should think they must be worth five pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, with respect to the burglary, there seems to be no precise evidence to bring that part of the charge home to the prisoner, or any body else; there is strong presumptive evidence, that whoever committed this robbery, got in at the drawing room window; but in order to make it a burglary, you should have precise proof that the window through which the thieves entered was shut at the time; of that there is no precise proof. She has valued the whole of the things at five pounds, but you will judge of the value; the gown only is deposed to particularly.</p>

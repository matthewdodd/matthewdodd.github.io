            , I am an officer. On the 20th of February I went with the prosecutor to this house, and found the lead and copper stripped, and some on the garret stairs, and while he was gone to find a place where we could watch I heard a noise in the kitchen. I waited about ten minutes, and saw a light come up stairs, and

             the prisoner went into the front parlour; he had a dark lantern. I caught hold of him, we scuffled - I got him into the back yard - rose an alarm - and sent another officer down stairs, and he brought Myers out of the coal-hole - the lantern was thrown down in the scuffle, and I found a box of matches on the floor, and a latch key on Jones.</p>
               <p>MR. QUARRILL. I was at the house a fortnight before, and every thing was safe, The key was lent to me by the auctioneer. I mended the roof myself, and had some glass put in previous to the robbery.</p>

I found another dark lantern, a can of oil, and a phosphorous bottle there.</p>

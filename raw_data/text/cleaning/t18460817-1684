Neil would discount it for him—I agreed to that, and told my brother and he agreed to it—on the 6th of May my brother went to the prisoner and he accepted the bill—my brother came back about half-past one with the bill—I saw it purported to be accepted by George Marriott and Son—my brother then went to Neil and Mellish to get it discounted—after he was gone the prisoner came—he said he wanted the paper very bad indeed—he wanted to ship a large quantity of ironmongery on board the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> that evening, and he wanted the paper immediately—my brother bad not given me authority to part with any of the goods, but I did part with the twenty-four reams of paper, because I thought my brother would succeed in getting the bill discounted at Neil and Mellishfs—I sent the twenty-four reams of paper by the boy—the value of them was 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

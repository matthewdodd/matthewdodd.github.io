             . I am a ticket porter. On the 25th of January, at night, about ten minutes before six o'clock, half a firkin of butter was delivered to me ; I put it into the boot of the coach; I saw Brown by; he was attending upon some passengers while it was put in; there was some cheese, I cannot tell how much; the prisoner took it out of the boot of the coach; I was at some distance, and the prisoner's back towards me; I saw him deliver it to another person, who went off with it as far as the head of the horses; the passengers were on the near side , and the prisoner on the off side; the prisoner in stepping back from the place, after he had delivered it out, tumbled down between the wheel and the wheel iron; upon this I saw the man go as far as the horses; I ran up and caught him; at first there was a great tustle between me and the man that had the butter; for the prisoner calling out, the man came from the horses heads and put the butter into the boot; then he came and hit me with a stick over my arm, and numbed me so that I could not keep my hold; upon that I changed hands and took hold of him with the other hand; we fought together some time; at last I took him away, and then he went to where Brown was, who was gone to call the passengers; I had a tustle with him again, and threw him down; I got more assistance and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same cask that was carried away?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. I had marked it. ( Looks at the bottom for the mark).</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you made it?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. Not when it went away but when Mr. Brown brought it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it?</p>
               <p>Gadsden. I read the direction when it went down; I always do; I cannot exactly tell you the gentleman's name, but I am sure it is John somebody, Esq; at Greenwich, or some such name. I did not see his face at that distance to distinguish it, but could have seen any body at that distance that did take it out; but at the time that he took it out he slipped down; I am very-sure that he is the man. When I took the prisoner he said that he was only going to get hay out of the boot for his rabbits.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who said he sold-oranges and lemons, and bore a very good character.</p>

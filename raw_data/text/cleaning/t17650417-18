            . I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, till I saw him before the justice: about the 2d of March last I lost a parcel of handkerchiefs out of my shop: I can't say positively to the number. About a month after Mr. Hudson sent for me; when I came there the prisoner was before him: I was asked whether I did not lose some handkerchiefs? I said, Yes. The justice said the prisoner had confessed, before I came, and described the house where he took them from; he had also told the place where the handkerchiefs were pawned: I went with the constable and him to Mrs. Adams's in Ratcliff-Highway; the boy asked for the handkerchief he had pawned; Mrs. Adams delivered one; I think it is my handkerchief; (Produced in court.) I had such a one as this in my window for two or three years.</p>

            . These lads had lodged at the house of one Talbot on Salt-petre Bank: they had given this watch to a lodger there: I was sent for to the White Lion in White Lion Street; there was Talbot; he keeps a very infamous house, the worst in our parish; he is bound over to appear as an evidence, but he will not come: there was Johnson, the man that the lads had given the watch to; I asked the lads, that is, the prisoners at the bar, how they came by this watch; Talbot had shewed it to the beadle; the beadle said Talbot had stopped the watch and brought it to him. We went before a magistrate; Talbot there produced it: Magin said Talbot had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170009"></xptr> knocked him down in order to run away with the watch; (his forehead was swelled) he said Talbot told him he should not have a needle's worth of the watch; and as he was running away with it, they overtook him, and stopped him; and then Talbot laid hold of them, and said he would carry the watch to an officer, and upon that he went to our beadle: this was said before Talbot's face: I said, Talbot, are not you ashamed of these things? there has been people enough hanged out of your house already; you ought to know better. The lads told the Justice where, and how they got the watch; and also of a great many more robberies they had done: they said another lad, in company with them, entered into a chandler's shop facing the Hermitage Stairs, betwixt 2 butcher's shop and some other, and when he came out he gave them the watch to sell. By this description I found the prosecutor; Magin said they carried it to a one-armed man named Johnson, who said he would not sell it for them, but would buy it; and that Talbot had got a pension ticket of Johnson's, and if Talbot would let him have the money, he would give them 30 s. then they went to carry it to Talbot, and he took it, and was going to run away with it, after he had knocked the boy down.

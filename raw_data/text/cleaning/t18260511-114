               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not lost sight of him? A. No; he turned some corners; I was close to him, and never lost sight of him: he ran up Castle-court and turned into Chandos-street, and then into Bedford-street; I did not see him drop it; I fancy he dropped it in the scuffle.</p>

            . I was in the Strand, walking with Mr. Johnson, when he caught hold of the prisoner, and said"You have got my handkerchief;" and I saw a handkerchief in his hand - a scuffle ensued and the prisoner tore away - he ran a little way up the Strand, along Castle-court, Chandos-street, and then to Bedford-street, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the handkerchief dropped? A. No; I was about two yards behind my friend, and he was about two yards behind the prisoner, while he was running.</p>

I was in the Strand on the 25th of April, a little before nine o'clock; I heard the cry of Stop thief! opposite to me; I saw the prisoner run along the Strand, and up Castle-court, followed by the two witnesses - I followed him, and at the corner of Bedford-street there was a scuffle; I went up and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you overtook me at the corner of Bedford-street - did not you meet me there? A. No; I was behind him, but his face was turned towards me in running - I was close to him; he saw I was coming after him, and he said "What do you want, Sir."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking from Northampton-street down Maiden-lane with a female - we heard a cry of Stop thief! and a person ran by us - Johnson came up and said he was officer, and took me.</p>

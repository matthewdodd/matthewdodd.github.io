               <p>Suppose there had been a person there whom you had never seen before, was it light enough to have distinguished his features, so as to have remembered him again? - I do not know that I could; we found the back door open, the cellar window broke open, the money gone out of the bar, about five or six pounds in halfpence, six china bowls, and several other things which I did not miss; the gold weights and scales are here; I did not know the prisoner before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Was the cellar door shut when you went to bed? - No, it was not quite close: after breaking into the cellar, they had fifteen butts of beer to get over; they broke the cellar window open; the flap was chained with a very large, heavy chain that they broke open.</p>

               <p>I produce some implements I found in the lodging of Thompson; I have frequently seen him there in bed, and eating and drinking; I found this paper of tobacco and some halfpence, bad and good, and some farthings and a pocket-piece: Thompson was there, and the woman prisoner, and another woman was at breakfast; I asked Thompson if he lived there, and he said, yes; I began to search the room, and at the side of the room there is a kind of a wash-house; I went there and took a light with me; Thompson followed me, he held the candle while I was searching; then I saw the mouth of the pistol over my head, and I saw Thompson going up to the side of the room, and in the plaister there was a hole, and I saw something in his hand in a cloth, but I cannot say it was this; I took down the pistol and these implements; then I went to this place, and there I found this cloth with the pieces tied.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not the woman instantly say, no, I keep the house? - No, she did not; she did before the magistrate say so, and that Thompson had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Were not both the women, women of the town? - I do not know what the woman prisoner is; the pocket-piece was found under the rugg.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know them scales to be my property, I can swear to them, the weights are new; I know the bowls to be my own, I have had them these seven years and more; the pocket-piece, I am upon oath, I saw in my till, when I locked up the drawer.</p>
               <p>To Dawson. Did you find that pocket-piece in the house? - Yes, with the half-pence in this cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you know the pocket-piece by? - I have given it to the child to make her take physic, and made her believe it was a guinea, and she got somebody to weigh it, and she found it was not weight.</p>
               <p>Now look at this, and tell me in what they differ? - That is very different.</p>
               <p>What is the difference? - One is very good, and that is very indifferent; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240064"></xptr>is a particular mark on the head of the one, a little bit of a straight stroke on the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will shew them to the Jury that they may see whether it is possible to swear to such a one.</p>
               <p>Court. What halfpence were your's? - There were fifteen shillings worth of bad halfpence tied together; those that I saw were not in papers, those that I lost were; this pound of tobacco I bought on the Saturday night; I never untied it; there is no mark on the paper.</p>
               <p>Mayne. I apprehended the prisoner, Cozier, the night after the house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. When you came down, could you distinguish the features of a man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. How many halfpence and farthings did you find in Thompson's lodging? - Three shillings and six-pence, or three shillings and seven-pence.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 4th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, Lee, the patrol, called me out of bed; in consequence of his information I went to Day's house in Pear-street; I broke Day's door open, and there I found these two bundles of linen, but not him. I expected I should find him either at Thompson's or Jones's lodgings; I went to Jones, and in Jones's garden I found Day. I took Day to his own lodging, handcuffed him, and went back to the same place, there I found Jones laying on the floor in the two pair of stairs. I thought at first it was a bundle. I kicked my foot so I thought against the bundle; his father said that is my son. I said I must have that bundle. I then went to Thompson's lodging; I broke open Thompson's door; there I found Thompson partly undressed, just going to bed; I told him to dress himself, which he did; and under his bed was another large bundle of linen; as soon as he had dressed himself he jumped upon the bed; he said now, Gillmore, I will show you something. He clapped his hand to a sword on the top of the tester; I told him if that was what he meaned to shew me, I had got another, and I would run him through as sure as he was alive, if he dared to take it down. He said no; I will not serve you so; but if these b - y charleys had been here by themselves there would be something the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. That, was meaning the patrols - A. Yes; I have seen the whole three of these chaps together frequently; and I saw them all three together that evening.</p>

            . On the morning of the 4th of June, I heard of Mrs. Bradley's robbery; I and Bradman went to Day's house; we saw Day, Jones, and Thompson come out. I told Bradman I thought the linen was there; I went to Gilmore, and told him of it; he came, and broke Day's door open, and found two bundles of wet linen; I went and told Mrs. Bradley to come to the office.</p>
               <p>- POPE. I compared this button to Thompson's coat, it fitted the shank left on the coat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my linen.</p>

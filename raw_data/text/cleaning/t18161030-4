             and Co.; I received it in three ten-pound notes, four five-pound notes, and the rest in one-pound notes; I put them into a box of my own and locked it, and I am quite sure I did not myself unlock it between the 13th and 19th; I know the prisoner, he was my servent. I moved on the 19th from the coffee-house, and I missed this note after I moved on that day. I went to my chambers in the Temple, and immediately on getting there, I opened my box, and found that one five-pound note was gone. I went on the same day to the coffee-house, to inquire; Mr. Price the master of it made inquiries among his <rs id="t18161030-4-deflabel21" type="occupation">servant</rs>

In consequence of that he gave me some information, and I requested him to go to a certain place and get something; the ship at Charing Cross. He got the note and brought it to me; I took it to my bankers, and I asked him the number of the five-pound notes they had given me, and I found this note was one of them.</p>

            . I keep the Ship, in Charing Cross; I know the prisoner, and have seen him there several times, I remember giving him change of a five-pound note; that was on the 18th or 19th of September. I look at this note, there is 13th 9th upon it. I had no other five-pound note at that time. I am certain this is it.</p>
               <p>MR. PARSONS. I am clerk in the house of Pole and Co.; they are bankers. I remember Mr. Camerons receiving some money from me; one of the partners came to me with Mr. Cameron's check, and I paid it; it was for sixty pounds, and drawn by C. H. Cameron; I paid it in three tens, four fives, and ten ones; I took the numbers of the fives, and one of those numbers correspond with the number of the note produced, No. 12413, dated March 13th; I think there can be no doubt that this is one of the five-pound notes paid in payment of Mr. Cameron's check. I took nothing more than the number and date of the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite clear of what my master accuses me of. The time I was paid off, I had eleven pounds given me for wages, and I brought eight pounds to London; some was notes and some was silver.</p>

               <p>I lost a tub of salt butter on the 12th of August, on Wednesday; the prisoner came to my house, and said he was sent by Mess. Keysell and Co.; that the carman had made a mistake, and left a wrong firkin of butter; and if I would return it, I should have a better the next morning; I told the prisoner, that when Mr. Keysell sent me another tub, I would return that; he then went away, and returned again in about an hour, with a very pressing message;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090158"></xptr>and said, Mr. Keysell was distressed for a firkin of butter to send to another place, where they were not so particular; as being a young man who had lately taken a shop, he thought the butter would hurt me in my customers; in consequence of which pressing message, I let the prisoner have the firkin of butter: I had some suspicion he did not come from Mr. Keysell; in consequence of which, I watched him; he went in a straight line for Mr. Keysell's warehouse, to the end of the street where I live; and to the end of another street; at the end of the first street, he rested at one of the posts; at the end of the second, he crossed Monmouth-street, and there he set it down at the step of a door, and sat upon it; he then went a contrary way to my house, or to Mr. Keysell's, down Monmouth-street, near the middle of it, neither the way to Mr. Keysell's, nor back to my house; I took him to Mr. Keysell's, and he said he never knew him, or employed him.</p>

               <p>Court to Fish. Did he give you this account when he took him? - No; to the best of my recollection, he said, had not I been in so great hurry, he should have brought it back again.</p>

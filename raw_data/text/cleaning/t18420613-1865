                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Anning. On Thursday, the 19th of May, I landed from a vessel, about two o'clock, and went to Tower-hill—there were five men about there—I noticed one of them—Marshall came and told me something—I missed three shillings and two sixpences from my right hand'—I had seen them safe about five minutes before—I observed Gwynn looked at me very hard.</p>

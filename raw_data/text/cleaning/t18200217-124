            . I am an officer. About a quarter before twelve o'clock I was returning from duty down George-street, heard a man call watch, and saw the three prisoners running down on the opposite side of the way; I and Gill ran after them, they crossed, turned towards me, and stopped - each had a hat in his hand besides what he wore; they made a momentary stand, and Weedon said he could or would have had the old b - g - r's shoes. I seized them, and asked them how they came by those three hats, Weedon said,</p>
               <p>"That is nothing to you, let me go." He used bad language, said he knew who we were, and he would not be taken by any bl - dy patrol. I said I should insist on knowing how they got the hats, he said</p>
               <p>"What hat?" and immediately dropped his behind him. We secured them. The hats all appeared to belong to poor people. Wormwood had the prosecutor's - Weedon had two handkerchiefs, and a shawl. On his way to the watch-house he said he would cut his throat, and so I took a knife from him. I found the prosecutor about two hundred yards off - he was sober, and so were the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Farringdon-without. On Saturday, the 30th of December, I saw the prisoner, with two others, in Fleet-street—I was on one side, and he on the other—I saw him pick a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief, and turn to give it to his companions, but they saw me run across the way, and would not take it—he threw it down—I picked it up—he turned up Fetter-lane, and I lost sight of him for a second, but I am positive he is the person, I had known him before.</p>

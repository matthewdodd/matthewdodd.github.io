                  </hi>. I live in Tooley-street. Last Monday morning, about twenty minutes to two o'clock, I was coming down Charlotte-street to go into the Borough—I had been over Blackfriars-bridge—I saw the prisoner with another man, walking together—I had never seen them before—I did not see any other persons walking the same way with them—I heard the prisoner say, "If you will not give me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one way, I will have ft another way"—I then saw him take the penknife out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he said to the one that he murdered, "I want to speak to you"—I saw him open the knife—he made a step while he was palling, it open—the other was going on—he turned to the prisoner again, and asked him what he wanted—he did not make any answer, but stuck the penknife tote his side—after he had done that he wanted to wipe the penknife on ray frock—I was close by them—he was going to catch bold of the skirt of my frock, to wipe the penknife—I would not let him, and he gave roe a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me off the kerb, and in putting my arm out to save myself a spot of the blood came on the sleeve of my frock—I did not fell—I did not go to the police-court to give my evidence, I was not able—from his <hi rend="italic">shaving</hi> me off the kerb it jolted my side, and caused me such pain I could not go—I went by Rowland Hill's chapel, and sat on the step of a door till I was able to walk, I was in such pain—I then walked as far as the Borough—I went into a coffee-shop, and sat down, and stopped there till the morning—I then went to the Court when it was open, out I was not able to stop, I was taken so bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first come forward to give this evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to the station last night—that was the first time—I was told there was an inquest on the Tuesday morning—I was not able to go there—I was in bed—two policemen led me to St. George's workhouse on the same Monday afternoon that this took place—I am an unfortunate girl—I had been in the Royal Oak, in Blackfriars-road, on the Monday morning, nowhere else—I had not been drinking there—I had not been in any one's company that day—I was jn the workhouse from Monday evening till Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning—I have seen many persons since that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not speak to some one at the time while you were sitting down by Rowland Hill's chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one came, no policeman or any one passed me—there were plenty of persons on the other side of the way—I never called to any of them—I told the doctor about it when I was at the workhouse—I have been unfortunate six weeks—I was a servant of all work before—I went to the station last night through telling a young man of it, and he told the policeman—I did not know that this Court opened last Monday—I did not see two or three of the policemen before I came here—there was nobody near at the time I saw this act done, not a soul—the. man's wife was a little distance from them—I dare say she saw me—I did not see any of the other men—I was taken so bad with the pain, that I went and sat down, and did not see any one else there—I was not for from them—I did not call out at all—I have no mode of getting my living but by going about the streets.</p>

               <p>do not know his name—when the man was stabbed he fell down—I did not see anybody come up to assist him till a lot of people rushed up—I went a distance from them towards Union-street—I did not go far before I sat down on the step—I saw some people rush up to him a few minutes afterwards, not directly afterwards—I saw a woman standing—I did not know then that she was his wife—she was very near to them when it took place, on the same side of the way—I did not see the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> go off—I sat there some time—the people were standing there some time—it was on the left-hand side as you go to the Borough that I sat on the steps, the chapel side, not the first steps you come to—I think it was the steps of the third house.</p>

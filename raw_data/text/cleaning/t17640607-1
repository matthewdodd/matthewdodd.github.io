I saw a man put his hand into Mr. Lewis's pocket; we apprized him of it, and followed the man down a court: there Mr. Lewis found the prisoner, and by his appearance when in the public-house. I believe him to be the man that put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket. Soon after we were in the house, Drawwater went out, and brought in the handkerchief, which Mr. Lewis said was his property.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that court to the place you saw the hand in the prosecutor's pocket?</p>
               <p>Gordon. The court was on the opposite side of the way, about half a dozen doors distant; the man immediately made cross the way, and ran down the hill, and got out of my sight before he got to the court: when I got to the court, a person told me a man was just gone down there; there was no thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give any account how he came there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No, he did not.</p>

            . I was going up Ludgate-hill, and heard the cry, Stop thief; I ran cross the way, and saw a man run down an alley; I went and saw the prosecutor have hold of his collar, and took him into the tavern: it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that man that you saw run down the alley was the same man you saw the prosecutor had by the collar?</p>
               <p>Drawwater. No, I cannot. I saw no other man run down that court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Drawwater. He said he knew nothing of the handkerchief, and desired to be searched, and pulled off his coat: the prosecutor went out, and returned again, and said he could not see his handkerchief; then I took a candle, and went to the place, and saw the handkerchief lying in a spout; it seemed to be tucked in: this spout is within about a yard of the bottom of the court. I brought it in, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

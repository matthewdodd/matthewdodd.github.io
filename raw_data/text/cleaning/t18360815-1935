On Saturday night, the 30th of July, I was coming home, and met the prisoner in the street—I asked her the way to George-street, St. Giles's—she told me the would take me there—as she was going on my right hand side, she took my watch from my right-hand waistcoat pocket—she ran off, and I after her—there were some persons who struck me—I have got the marks now—I went home and told the policeman, and he found her in about two hour—there were three men knocking me about—I should not know the men—the watch has not been found.</p>

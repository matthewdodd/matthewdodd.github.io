I asked her for my bundle; she swore I never brought any bundle there; she then gave the candle to her younger sister to light me down; she would not; then the prisoner took the candle and lighted me down: I said I would not go without my money and bundle; then she said, if I would not by fair means I should by foul means; she took me by the two shoulders and shoved me out of the room, and from thence out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090048"></xptr>the house; I asked the daughter to shew me into Holborn; she would not. I met two watchmen, and told them I had been robbed; they told me I was a woman of the town, and said I was a dirty hussey, and if I did not go about my business he would take me to the watch-house; I then met another watchman, I told him; he went with me to the house, but we could not find any thing of mine; then I saw Mr. Treadway, who searched the room, and found a cap, a black cloak, two handkerchiefs, and a cotton stocking.</p>

On Saturday night last between two and three o'clock the watchman brought in the two prisoners; I went and searched with a candle, and broke open the door, and under a fish basket I found a black cloak in the ashes, this handkerchief under the bed, this cap and apron, this handkerchief in another corner of the room; I found nothing else.

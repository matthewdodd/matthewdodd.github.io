                  </hi>. I live in Dowling-street, Deptford, and am the wife of Thomas Jackson. I keep a lodging-house—I let the two prisoners a furnished lodging, which contained the articles stated in this indictment—on the 13th of December I thought it necessary to examine their lodging, and then these things were all gone—I did not authorise them to take any thing—I have seen these things since they are here—my husband has been away from me nearly five years—he is alive.</p>

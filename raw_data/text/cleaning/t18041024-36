               <p>THE COUNTESS NORTH sworn. - Q. What country do you come from? - A. France; my husband and I have been naturalized in England; his name is Louis-Ann Caesar; we had a house first in Park-lane, then in Manchester-street, and now in Beaumont-street, where we have lived about fifteen months: I lost things at each of these places, but did not perceive I was robbed, till I lived in <placeName id="t18041024-36-crimeloc186">Manchester-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who had the care of your linen at the different places? - A. Myself; I had the key in my pocket; it was kept in a closet in our bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went to the closet beside yourself? - A. Nobody; if any one went to fetch linen for use I went with them; I have seen part since at Bow-street; the prisoners were discharged before it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was not entrusted with the care of the linen? - A. No; we found false keys in their room after they were discharged, that would open three closets; I found the key of the closet in one of the closets in their own room; the locks in our bed-room, and the locks where the linen was, were entirely spoiled; I could not open them.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the house in Beaumont-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- ADKINS sworn. - I am an Officer of Bow-street: On the 2d of October the Countess came to Bow-street to give information; I went with her to her house in Beaumont-street; I suspected the servants that had been discharged; I had a list of the things that were lost; I went to Mr. Ensor's, the nearest pawnbroker, and found a shirt, a shift, and some lace; I went the next morning and found the prisoners in North-street, just at the back of the pawnbroker's; they lodged in the garret; I searched the woman and found a number of duplicates, the man was present, they were not duplicates of the things at Mr. Ensor's, I told her it would save a great deal of trouble if she would tell me where the others were; she fainted away, and when she came to herself she went to the window, threw up the sash, and, from a hole in the window-case, she took out a paper with thirty-one duplicates (produces them), all of them Mr. Ensor's; I found duplicates in her pocket which led to some articles in Long-acre and Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>DANIEL M'CARTHY sworn. - (Produces the property.) - I am servant to Mr. Ensor, High-street, Mary-le-Bone; I know the woman prisoner; she has pawned a great number of articles at our shop; the first was in April last and the last in September, all in the name of

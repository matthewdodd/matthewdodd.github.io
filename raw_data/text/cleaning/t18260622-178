I had been out on the 8th of June, and had two or three pints of beer; I was going home a little before eleven o'clock at night, down Long-alley; I went into two public-houses to look for a cabinet-maker - first into the Admiral Vernon, and then into the White Swan, but I could not find him. The two prisoners followed me out of the White Swan, and as I was walking home four persons came and surrounded me, knocked me down with a stick, and cut my head; Sayer took the money from my pocket while the others surrounded me; I felt his hand in my pocket; I had five half-crowns of George III. and one of George IV., one shilling, one sixpence, and 2d.; they ran away. I pursued Sayer closely, and called Stop thief! he struck me several times, and knocked me down close at my own door; I was taken up for dead; he was taken by Cutbill. I have seen the money since; I believe King got away at that time, but he was at the office on another charge, and I knew him; I had not known either of the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of these men? A. Yes; Sayer is the man who took the money from me and beat me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. What are you? A. I am a journeyman upholsterer - I work for Mr. Cutbill; I had a sofa doing for him. I never had a brain fever, and have never been attended for any complaint in the head. I began to drink that day about four o'clock; I had been to several places. When I was before the Magistrate, the first time, I mentioned I had been robbed, and said I had six half-crowns and 1s. 8 1/2d.; I had a sovereign from my wife, and that was part of the change - it was all in my right-hand breeches pocket. The prisoners had been in the public-house, but I was not a minute in the house - I only went in to look for my friend, and came out; I was attacked in the street a few minutes after I left the house; I raised a cry of Stop thief! a great many people ran after them - there was a great crowd at last. There were a great many persons running after the people who were running away. I swear I was perfectly sober; I believe I had taken three or four pints of beer, or I might have had five - I had not drank any liquor; it was in Long-alley, Moorfields, which is a great thoroughfare.</p>

I heard the cry of Stop thief! while I was at supper - I got up, and saw some people running towards Finsbury-market; I saw Sayer running towards me; I opened my arms, and caught him - I gave him to the constable.

I heard the cry of Stop thief! and came up while Cutbill had got Sayer on the ground; a stick and handkerchief were brought to me at the watch-house - I found on Sayer six half-crowns, a shilling, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d., which he brought out of his pocket. I found there were five half-crowns of one coin, and one of another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor that night? A. Yes; he did not say what sort of money he had lost. I went to him the next morning, and asked what he had lost; I told him I had found some money, but I did not tell him what; when he described the money I told him it was just the money I had found.</p>

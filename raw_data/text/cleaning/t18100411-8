               <p>Q. In consequence of that information did you go there - A. Yes, on Friday; I went there with Gillmore the officer; I discovered two feather beds gone, three looking glasses, two of them swing looking glasses, a counterpane, a blanket, a gown, and three sets of bed furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Those things you missed, how lately had you seen them before - A. Not since the Monday I was there. I have not recovered any of the property since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lived in this house yourself - A. Yes. I had rented it two years last November; the last time I slept in it was the night of the illumination; I had not slept in the house before that time for a twelvemonth Mr. Templer lived in it a twelvemonth; it had been shut up for a twelvemonth prior to the illumination night, except a fortnight, it was let as a lodging house. Butcher and his wife went to live in it about the 21st of January. I considered Cork-street my home; I slept in Cork-street a twelvemonth, except on the Jubilee night.

On the 6th of March I was looking out of the two pair of stair window, about twelve o'clock in the day; I saw a hackney coach stand in the gateway of the stable-yard that goes, into the Treasury; I saw the prisoners come from under the gateway and put some things into a hackney coach; a bird cage, a swing glass, and a cat.

I saw a coach standing in the gateway; it was Wednesday or Thursday the 5th, 6th, or 7th of March; I saw a bed given to the coach man to put into the coach, and that man gave the coachman a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that. - A. I did not see the man: I saw the coachman draw the bed, and put it into the coach, and after that I saw a man bring a bird cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see whether you know him. - A. Yes, I saw this man, these two prisoners go into the coach; I saw the man prisoner put a swing glass and bird cage into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the coachman got the bed from. - No; the coachman came from under the archway, and put the bed into the coach, and then came the man and woman, and they both went into the coach, and away they drove.</p>

            's Defence. When I went home, my wife was crying; she said her mistress had been there making a noise. When I came away from Flushing, I had some money to take. I said, you had better take a hackney-coach, and carry your things to your father's; go to your mistress, and let her see that every thing is safe. I wish I had taken the number of the hackney-coach when I took my wife's things away; it would have been a good thing for me.</p>

He is a Frenchman born, but can speak English very well; he said he did not receive his wages from his master; he made that a sort of an excuse for committing the robbery. I had given him either one or two guineas, I do not know which; his wages are but eight guineas a year; he had not lived with me more than a quarter of a year or four months at farthest.</p>

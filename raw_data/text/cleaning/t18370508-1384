                  </hi>. I am a licensed hawker. I was stopping at the Two Brewers, London-wall, on the 20th of April—I left there that morn<lb></lb>ing with a bundle of eight yards of silk, eleven shawls, and the handker<lb></lb>chiefs and cloth stated in the indictment—I went about my business, and after that as I was coming from Camberwell I went into the Alfred's Head. and saw the two prisoners there, and other persons—Jackson asked me if I would treat her, which I did, to a glass of rum—I was going home, and she followed me outside the door, and asked me if I would go Home with her—my bundle, containing these things, was on my arm—I laid I would not, and directly afterwards Coleman and two others came, and Coleman struck at me, and Jackson snatched the bundle off my arm—Coleman and others prevented me from apprehending her—I am sure he is the man—the bundle contained eleven shawls, two pieces of handkerchiefs, and the other things—I have only found two of the handkerchiefs, which were in pawn—they were on a piece, and have been cut off—they are damaged goods, and have holes in them.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I heard the cry of Stop thief! about half-past two o'clock; I saw some women running, and I followed them - I asked them which way the thief had gone; they told me to go after one who had gone across the Bird-cage-field, which I did - I saw two men running in the field before me, and in pursuing them I saw this bundle in a blue woollen apron - I took it up, and it was this property; it laid by the side of the hedge, near where the men had run, and I think one of them was one of the prisoners.</p>

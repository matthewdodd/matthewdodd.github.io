            . I am servant to Mrs. Halsey. I went into the shop and found the handkerchiefs were missing out of the shop window. They were all in one piece.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Poynting. On the 18th of November, and on the 9th of Dec. the evidence Holmes was brought to our house. The person that brought him asked, if we had lost any handkerchiefs. I went to justice Rickards's, and got a search warrant, and searched the house of one Plump, in Rag-fair, where I was informed they were sold; but I could see nothing of them, neither have I seen them since. The prisoners were taken up the night before, and carried before justice Rickards, who committed them to Newgate, and Holmes to Clerkenwell Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners own any thing of it?</p>
               <p>Poynting. No, they did not confess any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body come into the shop when the handkerchiefs were lost ?</p>
               <p>Poynting. No. They were taken out of the window from the outside.</p>

             and William Gold came to my mother's house in Angel-alley, Whitechapel; Shervil said, I know where you may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150007"></xptr> get a crown presently, I went with them, and going along Gracechurch-street there was a paper before Mrs. Halsey's window, to keep the wind out, the glass being broke. Shervil ran his hand thro' the paper, and took out a parcel of handkerchiefs, and put them in his apron. This was about 5 or 6 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you and the other at that time?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We were on the other side of the way. Then he gave a whistle, and we went to him. I said, How many handkerchiefs are there? He said, About seven. They went into Plump's shop and sold them; but would not let me go in: so I stood at the door. When they came out Shervil told twelve shillings in his hand, which he said he had for them; out of that he gave me one, and they kept the other eleven themselves. Two or three nights after, as I was going along Tower-Hill with one Barnes, he snatched a sixpenny pye; the pastry-cook ran out and took me; he went to my mother, who told him I was got in a gang of thieves. Then I was taken before justice Rickards, and gave an account of this; and the prisoners were taken up, but they denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Plump live?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He lives in Rosemary Lane, facing Well-close square. I have sold many handkerchiefs and things, which I and others have stolen, to his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you they were going to Mrs. Halsey's?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes. They had observed the pane of glass being broke in the day time.</p>
               <p>Gold's defence. I know no more of it than the child unborn. I was taken when I was fast asleep in the glass-house.</p>
               <p>Shervil's defence. I know nothing of it.</p>

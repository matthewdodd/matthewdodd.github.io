                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Costin, a tobacconist, in Baker-street, Strand. Between twelve and one o'clock, on the morning of the 18th of January, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for two Cuba cigars, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered a half-crown in payment—when he put it on the counter I saw that it was bad, and asked him if he had any more like it—he said, "No," and he did not know what I meant by that—I said, "This is not a good one"—my husband, who was in the parlour, came out on hearing me say that, and called a policeman, who took the prisoner into the parlour, and searched him—I kept the half-crown, and showed it to my husband—the prisoner was let go—as only having one piece, we thought it no use keeping him in custody—I kept the half-crown till the 29th of January, and then gave it to the policeman at Bow-street—I am quite satisfied the prisoner is the man who gave me that half-crown.</p>

On the 3d of June we were in the house together - none of the other servants were at home; she desired me to get the tea ready in the kitchen, while she went up stairs to dress herself - I did so; after which I went up stairs, and saw her in my master's room on a chair, with a bit of wire, in the act of opening the wardrobe, by pulling the upper bolt down with the wire, and the lower bolt also. I went out of the room; she did not open the door then, as she saw me, and jumped off the chair. I went up into my own room, and in coming down I heard the wardrobe-doors creak on the hinges, I looked in, and saw her in the act of shutting them, she then had a bunch of keys in her hand. I said to her,</p>
               <p>"Mary, you have not opened the wardrobe-doors to get the keys, have you?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have, and that is nothing to you. It is no sin to take things from my mistress, as she has not been the best of mistresses to me" - she went down with the keys in her hand, I followed her. She went into my pantry, where there is a store-cupboard. I went into the kitchen, and in a few minutes I saw her put some things in the kitchen-drawer; she then went into the back-kitchen - in a minute or two I followed her, and saw her at the wine-cellar. She brought four bottles of Port out, opened one bottle, and presented me with a teacup full of it - I refused to drink. She said.</p>
               <p>"You may as well drink it, for you are as deep in the mud as I am in the mire." She drank some of it, and took the keys up again. Sometime after that I gave information.</p>

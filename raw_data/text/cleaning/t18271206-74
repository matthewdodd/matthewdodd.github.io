On the 2d of December, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was in Gray's Inn-lane, having spent the evening with a friend in Whitechapel; the prisoner accosted me in <placeName id="t18271206-74-crimeloc378">Gray's Inn-lane</placeName>

I had 17s. in my breeches pocket, and 10d. in my waistcoat-pocket - I felt it safe not a moment before, as I kept my hand in my pocket. I had not spoken to her; she came up to me as I passed the end of a court, put her hand round my neck, and said "My dear, how are you?" and in a moment a man passed by. I said, "What the d - l are you about?" and missed my money directly. I charged her with it - she said, "Oh! my dear, if you are fond of going to the watch-house, you shall go." I asked her three times for my money; she said she had not got it. I gave her in charge. I had been drinking.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in. Cluse charged her with robbing him of 17s. or 18s. I searched her in the back room; she at first said she had only 1s. 6d. I found 2s. on her. I then came out, and on the spot she had stood, I found 17s. - nobody else had been there - it must have come from her. Cluse was not drunk, he gave a distinct account of the transaction.</p>

The prosecutor said he had been robbed, and pointed the prisoner out - he cried, said he was sorry for it, and hoped we would not be hard with him; the prosecutor had the handkerchief in his hand - he had let go of him, and pointed him out to me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The gentleman was seeing some fowls sold - I saw the handkerchief lay at his heels, took it up, and put it into my trousers pocket; he turned round, and asked for it - I said I had not got it, and some people who saw me pick it up, told me to give it him, which I did.</p>

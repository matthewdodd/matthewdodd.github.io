                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Whitechapel—I know the prisoner—I have purchased cards of him from 9th March to the 21st July, about six times in all—here are some of them—these are not all that I have left—I can swear I bought these of him at one time, and I believe on the 21st March, but I cannot swear positively to that, having bought the same sizes of him at different times—I know the make of Messrs. Dickenson's cards—these are their make—they are very well known in the market—I asked the prisoner where he got them—he said he had sold his business where he had been a printer for many years in Leman-street, Whitechapel, to Thomas Penny, and that he was unable to keep up his payments in cash, and he supplied him with cards which he had received from his brother, Henry Penny, who had them from Dickenson and Co., and he bad received them as part payment, instead of money, for the purchase of the printing business—I believed that, and bought the cards, having known the prisoner eight or nine years, and knowing he had parted with his business—I gave 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for them, that is 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for this parcel, which is half-a-gross—the prosecutor's price would be 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the half gross.</p>

Dickenson's make from my general knowledge of them, having dealt with them many years—they are called Dickenson's make—I should say they were the largest manu<lb></lb>facturers in London—I presume they supply all the wholesale houses in London—the prisoner was at this time carrying on the business of a copper<lb></lb>plate printer in Sydney-square—he did not profess to make a profit by selling these cards, but he said he wanted the money, and Thomas Penny could not pay him—that is not an uncommon mode of dealing with general stationery, but is not common with these cards—where there is a large manufactory, there are frequently goods of inferior make, and they arc sold off, but I never</p>

               <p>knew it in the case of Dickenson's cards—we are manufacturers of account<lb></lb>books chiefly, and there are some injured in the make, and some of them are sold at a less price—there are persons who generally look out for that sort of goods.</p>

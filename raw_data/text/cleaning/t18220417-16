On the 26th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, some person came into my house, and asked if he could have a bed; he was told that he could, and paid for it then; I did not see him at that time - I saw him afterwards, and gave him a candle to go to bed; I believe it to be the prisoner, but I cannot swear positively to him. The pot-boy lit him up; he went up and came down in five minutes - I saw him then also, and have no doubt of his being the person, but am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. If you have no doubt, why cannot you be certain - A. I did not take notice enough to swear to him; he is the same stature and appearance. He came down stairs, said he had left his pocket-book behind him, and would return in five minutes, but never did. Next morning I missed a watch from a room opposite his, which was there an hour before he came. On the 6th of April, in consequence of what I saw in the newspaper, I went to Guildhall, and saw my watch; I described him to the officer as well as I could. He was then in custody on another charge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found this watch in the prisoner's pocket - I apprehended him on the 4th of April, and asked him where he got it from; he said it was his father's, who was dead - he said the glass was broken, and he should send the watch-maker to me to repair it, and desired me to keep it going as it was a good one. The watch-maker never came.</p>

I was at a public-house, and gave a man my father's watch and 1 l. for this - I put my chain and seal on it, and took it to be valued; they said it was worth three guineas and a half. The man came from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170012"></xptr>Coventry - I have written to him several times; but had no answer. There is a bruise in it, which I did in getting over a wall.</p>

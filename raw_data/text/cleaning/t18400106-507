                  </hi>I am a labourer, I live in Yorkshire. I came up to London to buy some onions, and met the prisoner on the 23rd of Decem<lb></lb>ber, at one o'clock in the morning—she spoke to me first, and asked me to give her a drop of gin—we went to the Three Tuns, public-house, and I gave her a little—I afterwards went with her to a house in West-street, and we went up stairs—I gave her a shilling, and the woman of the house a shilling—I was only to stay a short time—I was on the bed with three prisoner—I had a pocket-book in my waistcoat-pocket, containing three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. promissory-note—I fell asleep till about seven o'clock—the prisoner was then gone, and another woman came up, awoke me, and said some other persons wanted the bed—I did not seem willing to go, and she pushed me down—when I got to the passage I put my hand to my pocket, and found my money was gone—I saw the prisoner in the lower room with two men—I was pushed out—I went and told the policeman—I lost a handkerchief, which was taken from my hat—the prisoner was taken that morning, and my handkerchief was found on her neck, under her shawl—I never gave it to her—my money and note was gone—I did not take my waistcoat off.</p>

I thought proper to return, and the prisoner was soon after brought by the mob; I found nothing upon him, but when he came back, I looked at his hands, and they were bloody with breaking the glass; I know his person particularly, the globe lamp shone in his face, and I was at the back of him directly; I saw nobody with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Council. Describe a little what sort of a shew glass this is? - It is what is commonly called a stall-board, the stall-board is out.</p>
               <p>You draw it in to the inside of the shop for customers? - No, I list up this shew-glass, and take it out.</p>
               <p>Court. It is moveable? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Court. Then there is an end of the burglary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have windows to the front of your shop; I have not, I have a press fixed, a piece of furniture, this shew-glass projects an inch or two over the shop, it projects, in short, beyond the upright of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these things in any part of the shew-glass that projected beyond the shop, or were they in a line drawn from the top? - The extent, I believe, is above the bounds from the line of the foundation.</p>

               <p>Mr. G arrow. What part of St. Paul's Church-yard is Mr. Parker's shop in? - About twenty or thirty yards from the corner next Cheapside.</p>
               <p>The cushion that was picked up, was it in the course that the person must have taken in running from that shop towards you, or was it beyond where he had run? - He threw it on one side, I saw him fling it against the rails of the church.</p>
               <p>Was not it found on the Ludgate-hill side of him? - I believe it was found nearer Ludgate-hill.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Hedges, a pawnbroker. I was in the habit of giving gold or notes to the prisoner, for silver, for his master - on the 11th of October he did not come at all, nor about that time; I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He used to send me frequently with 30l. or 40l., to get gold or notes, and that time it hap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060079"></xptr>pened to be but 10l. - I saw a mob between Long-acre and Mr. Hedges; I ran with the money in my side pocket, and did not think of it - when I came out of the mob the money was gone; I was afraid to go back, and have been in great distress about the town till I was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. TAPLIN. He had been often sent with larger sums of money - when we found he did not return, I went to Bow-street, and was advised to go to his native place, in Berkshire; I went there, but could not trace him - he had been twelve days in Tothill-fields when I found him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the money in a bag? A. Yes, tied up, as was customary; I believe we took the prisoner without a character - we expected 10l. for this silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it not have been of considerable weight? A. Yes, it was in a sample bag - I believe he usually put it into his breeches pocket; I should think it would be such a bulk that it would be missed immediately - we have a great many servants, with coaches and cabriolets, in different parts of the town, and we offered them a reward if they could find the prisoner, but they could not - I have often cautioned him, and he said he never took his hand out of the pocket the silver was in.</p>

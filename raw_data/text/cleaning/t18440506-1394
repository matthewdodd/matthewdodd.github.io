                  </hi>. I am single, and carry on the business of a dress-maker, in Old Cavendish-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner came into my service about the 9th or 10th of April—on Sunday,</p>

               <p>the 14th, I placed my cash-box under my bed, between the mattress and sacking—it contained a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Lewis, on the Bank of England, for the firm of Hodson and Palmer—Mr. Lewis is gentleman living in Woburn<lb></lb>place—I transacted business with his sister and family, as a dress-maker—I have no partner—the check was my own—it was trust-money—I have to replace it—I am liable for it—it was in trust for myself and my late partner—the money was my own—it did not all belong to myself—part of it I have to refund to my late partner—it was received as joint money belonging to the late estate—he partnership was dissolved in Dec. last, and this money was paid over to me for the joint benefit of the estate.</p>

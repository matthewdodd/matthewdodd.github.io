            's business, and that he wanted twenty-four head-stall collars, six pair of overall chains, twelve cavalry feathers and cases, twelve pair of spurs and twelve pair of spur-leathers; he said he wanted them for Captain

            's troops - they were to be sent to the Yarmouth Arms, Thames-street, and he was to receive them there to take to Yarmouth. We have served Captain

             ever since 1817. He was very urgent to get them off, and said the troop could not go on duty without them. I have authority to execute all orders, in consequence of which I sent them off on the 17th - I have never seen them since. I then believed them to be for the troop, as I knew the prisoner belonged to it. I saw him the latter end of April, when he was apprehended - they were worth 10 l.</p>

            , ESQ. I am Captain in the Yarmouth Yeomanry Cavalry, the prisoner had been a sergeant in my corps. He had no authority to order any things for me, he had left the troop. I discharged him the latter end of 1818, or beginning of 1819. I never received the goods - he was perfectly unknown to me at the time. The troop was not in want of them. He was discharged by being struck off the rolls, and sending for his accoutrements. He never was on duty after that, neither would he be permitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the prisoner was discharged - A. Certainly.</p>

               <persName id="t18200517-58-person642">Lacon</persName>
            , I was authorized by him to order what things might be wanted, but I have never ordered anything since. I never did receive any things at the Yarmouth Arms.</p>

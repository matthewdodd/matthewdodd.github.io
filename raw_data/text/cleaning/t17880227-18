               <p>Did you hear what they said? - No, Mundy left Crafts, and he and I went and got a pint of purl; we had not been there long, before Windsor Tom called me out, and said he wanted Crafts; they said they wanted Mundy or my master, I cannot tell which.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the heifer you found at Mundy's, was your heifer? - Yes, I knew it perfectly well.</p>

               <p>I saw a man coming down St. John's-street, with a black heifer, and he gave me six-pence to drive it to Mr. Mundy's, he bid me tell him it belonged to Mr. Swaine in Thames-street; I met Mr. Mundy, and told him it was a heifer of Mr. Swaine's, Thames-street.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MUNDY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I desired Lyons to tie up the heifer, and ordered the boy to give it some hay; Lyons locked the door, and locked it in, that if I should hear any body had lost it they might have it again; I said I fancied it was heavy in calf, that I believed it belonged to Mr. Marsh of Hampstead, he had just such another; I had not time to send to any body when Mr. Scott came; I said, Sir I am very glad you have got it again.</p>

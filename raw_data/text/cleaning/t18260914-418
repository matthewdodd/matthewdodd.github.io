            . I am an officer. About four o'clock on the 18th of August, I was at the corner of Heath-street, and heard a noise - I saw the prisoner running, and Welch following him - we took him; I found this crow-bar in his right-hand pocket; I had passed the house just before, and heard a noise, but I thought it was a family affair; I asked how he came to break into any person's house; he said he was sorry for it - that he was in distress; there was no marks of violence whatever on the door.</p>

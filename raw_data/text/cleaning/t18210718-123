            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 16th of June, in consequence of information, I landed at Lambeth stairs between three and four o'clock in the morning; I was in Fore-street, and looked down one of the alleys, and saw a quantity of loose corn laying in an old barge's head, called the King, and some spilt on shore. I borrowed a sack and gathered it up, it was about a bushel and a half. I searched the craft, and went to Dunkley's back door in my own boat, to see if his boat was stowed there, and found she was not. I then crossed the water, and went to Lack's wharf, and found a punt there belonging to Bradbury, covered with tarpauling, named the Friends, and found the four outer sacks had been taken from the bulk; the sternfast had been cut, to make the barge turn round, so that on coming up the river the vacancy would not be seen. In the fore part of the barge I found four sacks of oats between the bulk, partly in and partly out, they were marked</p>

             on it; one of Dunkley's sculls was broken about four feet of the blade, it was broken in two parts and tied together with two sack tyers. About eleven o'clock in the morning, I went with Dalby and Blyth to Armstrong's house, close to the Europa, public-house, Rotherhithe, and took the prisoners; I waited at the back of the house - they denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About two bushels appeared to be gone from the four sacks - A. Yes, I found the four sacks at the end of the barge; they must have been brought back, and put in the barge again; I cannot say they were ever taken out. Dunkley's scull appeared to be mended with sack tyers about a foot long, which is the usual length; they appeared the same sort as the sacks were tied with.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. Dalby and I went to apprehend the prisoners about eleven o'clock in the morning; we knocked repeatedly at Armstrong's door, they would not let us in, and we entered at the window, passed through the front room, and went into the kitchen; the prisoners came down stairs. Armstrong then said, you bl - y - , what do you want here? They appeared to be going to resist. We secured them; Armstrong asked what he was taken for. I said, on suspicion of stealing four sacks of oats. They denied knowing any thing of it. I asked Armstrong if he had been above bridge that night; he said, yes, he had, and that Green, one of the other officers, had seen him; they said, they had done nothing they were afraid of. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then why not let us in when we knocked;" he said,</p>
               <p>"You did not give us time to put our things on."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found them coming down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182107180053"></xptr>stairs - A. Yes, they both put themselves in a posture of defence. We had knocked a dozen times at the door, and stood there a quarter of an hour; they did not answer any of our knocks.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 16th of June, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I saw Armstrong laying on the gunnel of a barge, at the back of Dunkley's door, apparently asleep, and I saw Dunkley in his boat, which then laid between the craft and his door, he is a druggerman; I have frequently seen them together.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Look at the samples of the bulk, that which was found in the prisoner's boat, and that found in the alley - A. I have been sixteen years in the corn trade; it is impossible to speak to that found in the boat - it being wet and dirty; the other two appear to be samples of the same corn. The four sacks of oats cost me 33 s.</p>

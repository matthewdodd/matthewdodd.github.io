About four o'clock on Wednesday, the 17th of March, I saw O'Brien lying outside a shed sawing a leaden water-spout belonging to Mr. Johnson—he got in at a window, went up to the top of the house, put his arm out of the win<lb></lb>dow, and pulled the lead out of the gutter, took the saw and sawed it, doubled the lead against the wall, and put it under his apron, he then went down and went across Cough-square—I followed him to John son's-court, where Clark lives—he went in there, took the lead from under his apron, and laid it on the bench—I got a policeman—O'Brien was then gone—he went and took him at Mr. Johnson's.</p>

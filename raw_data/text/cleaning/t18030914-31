             sworn. - I am a constable: I went with Mrs. Lewis, on the 30th of July, to Lawrence's lodging; he said, it was his own; Leary was standing by the side of the bench, and Lawrence was at work; these two bundles (producing them) were laying on the tool-chest belonging to Lawrence; Lewis said, that is my handkerchief and property; I said to Lawrence, have you any thing more here, and who brought these; he said, that man, meaning Leary; I said, have you nothing more; no, said Lawrence, nothing more that I know of; I went into the bed-room, and found the bed, two blankets, two pillows, and a pair of sheets; I said to Leary, you must go along with me; he began to be a little rumbustical, but I tied his hands together, and searched him, and found a pair of black stockings in his pocket, and a pocket-book; this handkerchief was taken off his neck before the Magistrate, and was sworn to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What time was it? - A. About nine o'clock; Lawrence was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. The account of Mrs. Lewis is correct? - Yes.(The property produced, and identified by Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Lewis.)</p>
               <p>Leary's defence was read as follows: - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, Having an impediment in my speech, and no Counsel or friend to assist me, but what I can adduce to give me a good character, I beg leave to state, that as I was going along, I met two persons, one of whom I knew; I said, I was going to Lawrence's; he said, it would be handy, and would be glad to leave some goods there, as he was going to be seized upon for rent; I went to Lawrence at a public-house, and, got the key of his room; the things were put in, and were to be called for next day, but were not.</p>
               <p>Lawrence called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

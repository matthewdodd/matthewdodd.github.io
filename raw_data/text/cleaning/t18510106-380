                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 52). I have known the prisoners five Or six years—on 23rd Dec, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I saw them together, coming down High-street, Putney, in the direction from Hammersmith—Beasley had a large bundle under his left<lb></lb>arm—I was in plain clothes—I was on one side of the road, and they on the other; and before they got up to me, Fleming stopped behind—it was a very foggy night—when Beasley got past a shop where there was a light, he turned, and saw me; and when he got past the lights, he ran, and I followed him 300 or 400 yards into Putney-fields, and lost sight of him—I was satisfied he had not gone on, and turned back, and met Fleming coming on; when he saw me, he began singing—I stopped him, and asked him where his mate was; he said he had not been with any one—I asked what he had about him; he said, "Nothing"—I unbuttoned his jacket, and found a flannel-jacket under his jacket and over his waistcoat; I felt it, and it was damp—I asked where he got it from, and he said he bought it of a Jew, in Petticoat-lane—I told him to pull it off; he did so—I examined it, and noticed on the right cuff a button about half off, and partly worn—I thought it might be his, and let him go—in about half a minute I met Beasley, and said, "Where is the bundle you were carrying?" he said, "I was carrying no bundle"—I said, "Yes, you were, a large bundle"—he said, "I was only carrying a few rags, which I have in my pocket—I searched him, and found under his jacket a flannel-shirt, which was wet—I said, "Where did you get it? it is very damp"—he said, "I know it is; I bought it in Petticoat-lane"—I told him to pull it off—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his waistcoat was under it—the flannel-jacket produced is the one Fleming had on, I know it by a speck of black on one of the buttons.</p>

I am the wife of William Randell, of Albion-row, Hammersmith—we keep a meat-shop, 200 or 300 yards from Mr. Clark's—on 23rd Dec., about five o'clock in the afternoon, Beasley came, and asked if we sold sausages—I said we did not; and from a suspicion I had, I followed him to the door, and saw him joined by a youth who I am not able to identify—I had no light in the shop, but there was a lamp close by—I looked full at him.</p>

I was passing through the crowd - the prisoner was coming in another direction, so as to meet me. I felt him hustle against me, which I thought might arise merely from the crowd, but as he was hustling against me, I felt his hand go from my fob. I looked down, and perceived that the ribbon had been cut, and the seals were gone - no other hand was near my fob but the prisoner's. I turned to catch hold of him - he was near me, but in consequence of two ladies being in the way, I could not secure him. I immediately called out Stop thief! and he turned the corner of Charlotte-row. I followed him, and saw him throw the seals down an area, and the scissars also, but the scissars hung on the rail. He was secured within twenty yards of that place, and was never out of my sight. The seals were delivered to me from the area by the gentleman of the house, and on coming back I found the remainder of the ribbon on the pavement, which had been cut off.</p>

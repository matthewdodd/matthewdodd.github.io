                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live in Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I was proceeding home on the 10th of March, accompanied by the two prisoners—one Woodfield was with the prisoners when I met them—they were walking together—Speed had been a schoolfellow of mine, and I used to play with Bridges—I was intoxicated—we walked on together—they accompanied me to my own door in Lisle-street, where I live with my mother—I did not miss any thing that night, but next morning I missed a watch and two rings—I cannot say where they were when I last had them—the rings were on the guard, and the watch in my fob, at nine o'clock, and I fell in with the prisoners between nine and half-past nine o'clock—I was too much intoxicated to miss them that night—I saw the watch next morning in possession of Kelly.</p>

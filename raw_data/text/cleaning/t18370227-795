                  </hi>. I live in Frederick-street, Hampstead-road. On Sunday morning, the 13th of February, I was taken to the station-house for being drunk—I was sober enough to know I had some halfpence in my pocket—I saw them last at twelve o'clock at night—I had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had taken 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packet which I had received that night, as part of my wages—I went and drank till twelve o'clock, and was then taken to the station-house—I know I had the halfpence safe then, in my great coat pocket—I took my great coat to lie upon, and felt the halfpence safe—there were four persons there, the prisoner was one—after I had been there some time, I laid down on the bench—I felt the halfpence there then—I had not been there long before I was pulled about, and one of the tails of my coat was torn off—I made a noise and was left alone, and went to sleep—I then awoke up, and felt the breast pocket of my great coat, and the halfpence were gone—I called, and the policeman came and looked through the door; I told him I had lost a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packet of halfpence—he said he knew nothing of it—another officer came, and I told him the same—when daylight came (about seven o'clock I suppose) the Inspector came—I told him—he ordered the prisoner and another man to be searched, and on the prisoner was found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all in halfpence—there was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

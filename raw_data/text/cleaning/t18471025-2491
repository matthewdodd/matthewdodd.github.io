                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Knapp, a barrister, and live at No. 1, Walcot-square, Lambeth. On Saturday night, the 9th of Oct., I was at the Cornwall Arms, Cornwall-road, and saw the prisoner there—I asked if he would go of an errand for me to Princes-street—he went, and returned in twenty minutes—there were several persons there besides the prisoner, but he was drinking with two in particular—I had to change half-a-sovereign for the purpose of his going on the errand—he saw me do that—I paid for two pints of ale, which he drank the best part of—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for going on the errand—he said I had given the landlord a sovereign instead of a half-sovereign, and told me to look—I put my hand into my pocket, found my</p>

                  </hi> I am landlord of the Cornwall Arms.

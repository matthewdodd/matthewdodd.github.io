                  </hi>. I am one of the officers of the City of London. On Friday, the 8th of November, in consequence of directions I received, I went to the prisoner's lodging, 561/2, Pear Tree-court, Clerkenwell—he wrote me that address himself—I there found a great quantity of India rubber, black-lead, and carpenters' pencils, wafer stamps, pen-holders, and memorandum books, all new—some were in a box, some under the bed, and some in a bag (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—the prisoner was not at home at the time—I found his wife there, and she permitted me to search.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Sir James Williams and others, wholesale stationers in West Smithfield—the prisoner was in their service, first to assist in the warehouse and afterwards as porter—he had access to all the articles dealt in by the firm—he had 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he did not carry on any trade himself—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—this parcel of memorandum books I tied up on the 21st of September, when taking stock, and it has my own writing on it—these packets of wafer-stamps bear our private mark, and they are tied up as we tie them—there are twelve in each packet—they have not been sold—if they had, the private mark would have been taken off—this piece of India rubber was bought with a quantity on the 21st of October—I think this is the piece we had with the parcel, for I have looked over the parcel and cannot find it—I do not swear to it, but I think this is the piece—this parcel of pen-holders bears the mark of George Hall, one of our men—it has no private mark—I believe all this to be my masters' property—they deal in such things—it has not been missed—our stock is too large to ascertain such a loss.</p>

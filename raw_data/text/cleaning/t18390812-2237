                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at Harefield. On the 3rd of August, I saw the deceased Moses gates at his stall, about a quar<lb></lb>ter or half-past nine o'clock in the evening—I was between five and six yards from his stall, as near as I can guess—I heard tome noise at the stall, and on looking towards it, I saw Gates strike the prisoner twice on the side of the head—I am quite sure I saw two blows—he said he would not cut and maul his salmon about for him—the prisoner then went away a little distance, and returned in half-a-minute—he was saucy to Gates, but I did not hear the words distinctly—Gates ran after him two or three yards—he then came back, and Coker followed him, and said if he bit him again, he would not run away, he would give him something for himself—Gates again ran after him, and just struck him with his finger on the head, as his hand could just reach him—it was his open hand—Gates immediately after came back, and said he had stabbed him—there was a candle in a lantern there, and I observed a cut in Gates's trowsers, just about the stomach, when he made the exclamation, and the blood was running—the light was taken out of the lantern, and one button of his trowsers was undone—he afterwards went to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone-mason, and live at Harefield. On the night in question, I saw Gates at his fish-stall—I was about four or five feet from it—I saw Coker there—Gates was weighing some pickled sal<lb></lb>mon—he told Coker it weighed seven ounces, and asked 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the answer Coker made was, "Go to hell; who do you think is going to give 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for your salmon?"—Gates made no answer just for the moment, but Coker kept grumbling about the price, and with that, Oates gave him one rap on the head—he said, "Be off about your business; who do you think is going to weigh salmon for you?"—or "Why do you come here to order salmon, and not take it when it is weighed?" and gave him a rap on the head—it was with his open hand—it was a smartish rap on the cheek—it was not sufficient to knock him down—it was a kind of blow which a man who was angry at the salmon not being bought would give—after this rap was given, the prisoner then said, "You b—if you hit me again, you shall have something for it"—this passed in front of the stall—the prisoner then left the front of the stall, and went to the back of the stall in the horse road—he came back again in a short time after—it might be a minute and a half—I should not suppose it was above a couple of minutes at most, and the first word I heard the prisoner say was, "Now come and hit me; you shall have something for it"—he said, "I sha'nt run"—these words were repeated by the prisoner move than once or twice—after he had dared the deceased in that way, the de<lb></lb>ceased went towards him—he was then standing with his back a little way towards the road—the prisoner then ran backwards, and the deceased fol<lb></lb>lowed him to nearly the middle of the road—when the prisoner was running backwards, followed by the deceased—he was waving his arms about, but whether it was for self-defence, I cannot say—I saw no blows pass, and Just as they got to near the middle of the road, I saw the prisoner make a stand, and a sort of rush towards the deceased—they were not a yard apart—the next thing I heard was, Coker said, "You have got it"—the deceased put his</p>

               <p>hand to his belly, and came back to his stall, and said, "He has stabbed me—he has run a dagger into me"—that was not more than half-a-minute after the prisoner said "You have got it"—he had not three yards to walk—I taw some blood on his trowsers—I did not see the deceased again till Monday evening—he was dead then—this happened on Saturday evenings</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many times altogether did Gates strike the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once that I saw—there were a great many more per<lb></lb>sons round—I did not hear Grates say any thing to Coker when he was running after him the last time—I was ten yards from the middle of the road where they were—I could not tell whether Gates was running after Coker to hit him or to send him away—he did not go very fast—I cannot say what he was going to do—perhaps he might be going to hit him again—I did not see what his meaning was—I did not hear him say if he caught him he would break his back—I think if he had said so I was near enough to have heard it—he did not say any thing before he left the stall—he left the stall when the prisoner was daring him in his business—I did not see him attempt to kick the prisoner—it was just getting dusk—there was no moon.</p>

I had my child in my lap by the parlour fire on the evening of the 1st of February, and heard a footstep in the shop - I turned my head, and saw the prisoner reaching his arm to the end of the counter, where part of a cheese stood on a jar of pickled onions - I followed him to the door, and called Stop thief! Woodgate, the officer, pursued, and took him about fifteen yards from my shop - I did not lose sight of him after he turned from the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any cheese on the counter besides this? A. No, that was all we had; I had seen the cheese not five minutes before; there is a glass door to the parlour - it has no curtain, I had had the prisoner pointed out to me several times before, as a very suspicious person - I knew him again; he is a remarkable man - it was a double Gloucester cheese. I believe, and has a taster at one end; I did not tell the Magistrate, I did not know what cheese it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any other person come out? A. No - I was on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WOODGATE. I saw the prisoner in James-street, Old-street; Mrs. Free said, "That man has got the cheese;" I collared him, and the cheese dropped from under his coat - I took it up; this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any one else about? A. Only a patrol - it was a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

On the 1st of February I had been to Islington, to take a parcel and a great coat for a young man who was going by the Boston coach - I then went down James-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I stood against the wall for two or three minutes - the officer came and took hold of my collar; they did not see me drop any cheese - I said, "Go to the stand and ask the wateringman if I did not leave him within five minutes;" they would not go, but said he was as bad as me; I said,"Look at my coat - if I had had the cheese under it there would be marks of it;" I never had it in my possession, nor saw it - I had not time to get to the shop.</p>

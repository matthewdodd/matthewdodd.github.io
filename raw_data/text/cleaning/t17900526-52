               <p>I am a constable at Deptford. On the 20th of April I was informed there was some stolen iron in a boat, in the Creek: I went with Mr. Cox, and found the prisoner asleep in the boat; we waked him, and asked him where the iron came from? he said, from Mr. Bradley's, Bankside; I asked him where it was going to? he said, it was consigned to Mr. Banks, of Deptford; I saw a loose pair of sculls in the boat, besides the oars that belonged to it; I asked how he came by the boat? he said, it was borrowed; I asked him if he had got the key belonging to the locker of the oars? he said, no; the person never lent the key out that belonged to it; I said, I thought it was very odd to lend a boat, and not the key to the oars; I said, I thought he had stole the boat, as well as the iron; I desired him to come out of the boat; and took him, and asked Mr. Banks if the iron was coming to him? he said, no; I sent to the prosecutor to see if they had lost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179005260050"></xptr>boat; he said, his boats were all at the wharf; he did not miss it till the next day; I took the prisoner before Mr. Russel, a magistrate; he said there, that he was employed by a strange man, to bring the boat down; but he did not know him: the magistrate ordered Mr. Cox and I to bring the prisoner and the boat to town, and take him before the sitting alderman; I advertised the iron, but nobody owned it.</p>

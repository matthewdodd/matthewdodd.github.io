               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. What time did you go there? A. About twelve o'clock; I missed the property about half-past four - there were five or six people there; there was a bustle there, but my coat was not thrown about - I found it where I hung it; the property could not fall out - the prisoner had left the ground, and as a man lost his handkerchief, I looked and missed my things, and went after him; I was sober.</p>

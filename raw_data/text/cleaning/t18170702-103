Just as one of them had passed me, I saw my watch in his hand, and said, "that man has got my watch - He must have snatched it as he passed me." I did not feel it go, but saw it in his hand before he could conceal it. I called stop thief! and ran after him, the watchman stopped him, and found the watch upon him.</p>

I was walking down the road between four and five o'clock in the morning, and heard the cry of stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and several people after him - He was stopped; I saw him throw the watch from his right hand, I picked it up, and took him to the watchhouse. The prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

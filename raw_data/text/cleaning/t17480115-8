               <p>Wilkins. C. W. 1747. upon five of the shillings, and the other I marked with a cross; the shilling that he took he produced, and laid it down upon the desk; it was marked C. W. 1747.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was in the drawer besides ?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. Nothing but a six-pence, and the six marked shillings, besides the shilling he took of a customer.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mrs. Foster and Mr. Wilkins, at the Olive-Tree in Tower-Street; I was in the compting-house when my master marked six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark did he put upon them?</p>
               <p>Harling. He marked five with

            1747. and another with another mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of his marking these?</p>
               <p>Harling. Because he had missed some money, and suspected the Prisoner; a person came into the shop and bespoke some things, the woman gave him a shilling, and I saw him put that into the till and take another out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master challenge the Prisoner, or say any thing to him that he had taken a shilling out of the till?</p>
               <p>Harling. Yes, he called him into the compting-house, and asked him what money he had about him; he said he had five shillings and six pence; my master said he had some of his, and desired to look at his money; he then pulled out five shillings and six pence, and laid it down upon the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you see them?</p>
               <p>Harling. Yes; and a shilling, marked C. W. 1747. was among them. He was carried before my Lord Mayor, and he owned it then.</p>

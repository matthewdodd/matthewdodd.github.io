            . I am a constable of Hanwell, I received the prisoner in charge of Dowdell upon the charge of robbing Mr. Commerell's premises; I searched the prisoner, and gave him into the charge of Davis at the Spencer's Arms Hanwell; I sent with with Dowdell, the last witness to inspect Mr. Commerell's premises; the outer door towards the brew-house was broken open: the window had been broken open at the kitchen; I found a considerable quantity of lead had been taken from the house, and gone; the case of a kitchen dial was carried into the wine cellar, the inside works of the dial was gone; the curtain of the library door had been torn away. I matched the curtain, Dowdell found it in the prisoner's pocket, it matched exactly. I then went back to the Spencer's Arms, where I had left Barrenger in custody; when I came there, I found he was gone. On Sunday I went to Hayes from information; I apprehended Carr there, he is the accomplice, the next morning Carr made a compleat disclosure of the whole transaction. I told the magistrate; he made the same confession to the magistrate, in consequence of what I learned from Carr; I searched Mr. Commerell's pond; we pulled out of the pound five hundred pounds weight of lead; it was lead that covered Mr. Commerell's house, I fitted part of it, it corresponded exactly. In consequence of information I went to Mr. Merrill's, a clock and watch maker, at Brentford; there I found the works of a dial, I fitted the works to the case<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150027"></xptr>on Mr. Commerell's premises, it fitted exactly; I am a watch and clock maker myself.

               <p>MR.

               <p>Q. Had you a dial in your kitchen - A. I had; I am perfectly well acquainted with the case; I never locked at the works so as to say that is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find by inspection, that your house has undergone a considerable loss of lead - A. I have been there myself, I have seen that a considerable quantity of lead has been taken away; the lead has been taken away from the roof of the house.</p>

            . Q. Now, say nothing else but what is true - A. I have known the prisoner Barrenger about seven weeks before this happened; I saw him on the 3rd of January, at the Waggon and Horses at Hayes; I had a little conversation with him there, he told me he had been at Hanwell, he had taken the inside works of a clock, and some lead, and some bells; the inside works of the clock he had sold to a clock-maker at the market place at Brentford; the bells he had sold to Mrs. Muckelow at Brentford. He asked me if I would go with him. The next morning we both went from Hayes to Hanwell, and took some more lead at Mr. Commerell's house; Barrenger said he had left the door open; he went in; then he shewed me a hole in the window, that he had broken to open the shutters to get in and unfastened the door; he shewed me a piece of lead on the stairs, about half an hundred weight; Barrenger took the lead up, and put it in this green stuff bag. He told me there was a copper down stairs, which he had removed from one room to another. He said he would take the lead if I would take the copper; I took the copper, and sold it to Mrs. Muckelow at Brentford; she gave me sixpence a pound, it came to twelve shillings; I took the copper in a sack. Barenger sold the lead at Mrs. Muckelow's; I do not know what he received for the lead. Mrs. Muckelow keeps a shop, buys old iron and rags. We went back again to Mr. Commerell's house; the next day we took three trips to the house, and took lead each time. We left a large quantity of lead in the pond, it was taken from the roof of the house, and some from the pump. I have told all I know, and no more than the truth.</p>


               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the clock case - A. It has been taken out of my house; it is mutilated now to the best of knowledge; I positively swear it is my clock case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. to Dowdell. You told me you saw Barrenger and Carr together - A. I did, I saw them coming from Brentford, and going back again; I am a labourer; I live in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ross. I produce three bells; I found them on Mrs. Muckelow's premises. I fitted the bells to Mr. Commerell's premises; they fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have never been with Carr since he and I worked together at Mr. Faggs at Bellfont; I happened to meet him as I was looking after work; I was never with him in the premises in my life; we have never been in a house together.</p>

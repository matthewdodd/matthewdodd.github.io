            . On the 4th of March, about half an hour after seven o'clock, I went out of the shop down below; when I came into the shop again,

             came in and asked me if I had lost any thing; saying. he saw a man hand out two half Cheshire cheeses; I looked, and missed them; he described the man and his dress to me, with a red waistcoat, a woollen cap on, and a sort of jockey cap over it, with a dirty apron on; I described his dress to the watchman, and he took the prisoner up.</p>

            . I was coming along Portland street, it wanted about a quarter of eight in the evening; I saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutor's door, and a boy was at the corner of the shop; the shop has two fronts, being at a corner. I saw the prisoner go into the shop and take out two half cheeses, and give them to the boy; I saw a boy standing at a little distance; I went and told him of it, and desired him to come with me to go after them, instead of that he went off another way; then I went to the shop, the prosecutor came up into it; I told him what I had seen; we went two different ways to see for them, but could not find them; the next day I saw the prisoner in Argyle-buildings; I had described him to the prosecutor, and he to the watchman, who took the prisoner up; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>He called two women, one had known him ten years, and the other eight, who said they never knew any ill by him.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my master's (the prosecutor's) house on the 19th of January, and ordered a spring of pork, and two pound of sausages, to be sent to Broad-street; I went with him and took the spring or pork only then; when we came to Broad-street he took me to the back part of the South-Sea-house; then he took the pork from me and carried it up one pair of stairs, and bid me stay till he brought the tray; he came down and bid me fetch the sausages, and change for half a guinea; I went and fetched them; when I came to the house he met me in the passage, and said he was coming to seek after me; he asked me for the change and the sausages; I gave it him, he sent me up stairs, and said I should see the kitchen up stairs, and the cook would order some more sausages, and give me the half guinea; he said he had turkies a roasting; I went up stairs but found no kitchen there; then I perceived I was bit. He was taken on the Monday following.</p>

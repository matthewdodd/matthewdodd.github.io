                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Jones, a bookseller, No. 65, St. Paul's Churchyard. On the 1st of June, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was standing at the window, and saw the prisoner take a handker<lb></lb>chief</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. I received information from Wil<lb></lb>liams, and about a dozen yards from the Tract Society found the prisoner—I searched him and found two handkerchiefs in his pocket—I asked him if either of them were marked—he said, "No" but one is marked—before Wil<lb></lb>liamssaw the handkerchief, I asked if he knew what colour it was—he said, "Yes, a whitish one"—I was in private clothes, and had watched the prisoner for about half an hour previously, and he changed his sling twice in that time in Cannon-alley.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning, the 13th of April, between six and seven o'clock, I was informed I had been robbed, and that the prisoner had been taken and carried to the round-house; about nine o'clock, the meat and cloth was brought me by the watchman; the cloth is a very particular one which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any meat? - No.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find your house? - The front door was unbolted, and the back door was open, but I believe that had been left open all night.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MARTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; on the 13th of April, about a quarter past three in the morning, I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Buckmaster's door.</p>
               <p>His back door? - No, the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come out at the door? - No, I heard a larch go, and saw him coming from towards the door, with fifty-two pounds of meat tied up in a cloth; he begged for mercy, and said, for God Almighty's sake to let him go!</p>
               <p>John Lawrence, another watchman, who was with the last witness, when he stopped the prisoner, confirmed his evidence; and deposed, that he took the property from the prisoner, that they took him to the round-house, and carried the property the next morning to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming along, I saw something lie up against a pair of gates, I picked it up, I do not know what was it to this minute; the watchman came up and took it from me; what they have said, is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>To Martin. Was there any day-light when you saw the prisoner come out of the house? - It was moon-light; it was beginning to be day-light.</p>
               <p>Was there day-light enough for you to see the man coming out? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>To Laurence. What do you say to that? - There was, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>To Buckmaster. Do you take so little account of your meat that you might lose fifty pounds of it without missing it? - I might have missed it if I had looked after it; I missed a shoulder of mutton when I came down; I had but one left in the evening, that was gone; it was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

I live in Dyer-street, Blackfriars-road—I was at Mr. Batler's—I went to fetch a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and rode with the prisoner on the box—he and another man were talking—I saw the man. riding behind—the prisoner asked me if I could jump off the box on to the pavement, and laid, "You go and ask if there is any luggage"—I went and knocked at the door—the prisoner followed me up—he then went and lifted the other roan off from behind the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and called him by his Christian name—I went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and heard the prisoner walk across the hall with his heavy boots—I then heard the Macintosh rattle—before I could get up to the prisoner again, he bad given the coat to the other man, who went off across the field—the prisoner then said, "Is there any luggage?"—I said, "Whether there is luggage or no you must bring that Macintosh back"—he said, "You must be mistaken"—I said "No, I am not, you took it, and no one else, and gave it to that other man who is gone off."</p>

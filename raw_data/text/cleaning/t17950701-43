               <p>I was employed by Mr. Hughes to watch his ground, in the night of the 30th of May, I happened to see this man; he was wrapping up a parcel of mats; and on my coming up, he ran away; and I told him, if he did not stop I would blow his brains out; and I came up and took him into custody, and took him into St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken in the garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in a place where the mats were placed over the glasses? - No; in a different part of the garden, where there should be no mats. Before my master came home I missed six from one part of the ground, and Mr. Hughes missed six more from another part of the ground, what I knew nothing about; the six that I missed had been on the glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he carried them when you see him bundling them up? - I suppose about eighty yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming that way, and I see three people come out of the garden, and I asked them if I could cross over that way to Tothill fields? they told me I might; and as I was coming along this man called out, who are you? Stop, or I will blow your brains out. He startled me, and followed me, and laid hold of me. As to the mats I know nothing about them. I came up from the country about two months ago.</p>

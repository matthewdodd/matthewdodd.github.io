I have missed several articles previous to my detecting him; the prisoner had lived with me near three months. In consequence of information, on the 7th of February, the officer came to my lodgings; I immediately rung the bell for my servant to come up; he came up; I immediately charged him with having a shirt of mine on him, and a neckcloth; the officer made him undress and the shirt and neckcloth proved to be mine. The officer went up into his room to search his drawers, and there we found a neckcloth and a pair of stockings. Previous to my sending for the officer, in going through Oxford, I found myself reduced so, that I was obliged to go to my brother in Oxford for some things; he lent me six neckcloths; two of which was found in his box.</p>

On the 7th of February I was sent for; I went up stairs into the drawing room; the bell was rung and the servant came up; Mr. Davies accused him with having taking taken away his linen; he seemed very much confused and denied it; I searched him; Mr. Davies said he had a shirt of his on his back; he said he had; he had the shirt and handkerchief taken off, they proved to be Mr. Davies's; I searched the prisoner's drawers, I found a handkerchief with the mark, a great part of of it picked out, and one pair of stockings with the mark picked out.</p>

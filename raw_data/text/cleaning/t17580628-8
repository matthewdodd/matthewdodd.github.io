Last Saturday was se'nnight, a young man came in and said, Mr. Courtney, there is a young lad has taken something out of your shew-glass: I asked him which way he saw him go, he said, he was ran up Shoe-lane. I pursued and found the boy at the bar up a passage belonging to the Globe tavern, I took him into the back part of my shop, and ordered my people to take care of him. I found there were missing a card with twelve pair of sleeve buttons, set with Bristol-stones. While I was gone, the boy found means to convey this card of buttons down a crack about an inch wide into a sink, where by searching we found them. I got a constable, and took him to the Fountain tavern, there he confessed he opened the shew-glass, and took them out. I took him before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280007"></xptr> Mr. Alderman Alexander, there he confessed the same, and begged the alderman would send him to sea.

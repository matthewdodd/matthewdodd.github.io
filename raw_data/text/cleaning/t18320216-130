            . I am a mill-maker. I was in the station-house on a charge of being disorderly - I saw the prosecutor brought in; he sat down, and fell asleep- I saw the prisoner get up from where he was, sit down by the prosecutor, and soon afterwards I heard the sound of a sixpence fall on the floor - I had some suspicion, and pushed the shutter partly open, which threw a light on them, but I did not see any more - soon after day-light the prosecutor said he had lost his money, and his friend said, "You changed a sovereign just before you came in"- I said, "You had better have the gaoler down to search the people who are here;" the prisoner sat there, pretending to be asleep, but when I spoke he got up, and went towards the water-closet; I jumped up, ran to him, and caught his hand over the hole; something fell from it, which sounded like silver - I said, "You rascal, you have robbed the man;" he said, "If I have, I must stand the consequence of it;" the piece of rag was taken up, and the money, which the prosecutor claimed, was found in it - the officer ordered the prisoner to take off his shirt, and three parts of the tail of it was torn off - the piece, the money was in, matched it exactly.</p>

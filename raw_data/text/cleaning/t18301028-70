            . I am an officer. I was on duty and saw a crowd round the door - I saw the prisoner with one hand hold of his hat; the lady had hold of it likewise, and with her other hand she had hold of his collar - I took the hat and him to the watch-house, and found these handkerchiefs in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I had been making freely with my friend, and drinking rather too much, owing to his going into the country; not being used to drink, it took an effect on me, and returning home I went into a shop in Middle-row, Holborn, to purchase a pair of stockings - there was a quantity of handkerchiefs on the counter, and I took some of them up to look at them; I put them on the top of my hat, and they accidentally fell in - my hat was off, and laying on the counter; the prosecutrix, turning round with the stockings that I asked her for, and, seeing the handkerchiefs in my hat, accuses me of taking them with the intent to rob her - at which I was amazed, and gave her my hat with the handkerchiefs in it.</p>

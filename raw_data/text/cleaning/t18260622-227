            . I am a wine-merchant. I was going along Newgate-street on the 16th of May, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and put it into his own pocket; I informed the prosecutor, and kept my eye upon the prisoner, who, I think, observed me, for he dropped the handkerchief, and ran - I saw it picked up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who picked it up? A. I do not know - I was more intent on watching the prisoner.</p>

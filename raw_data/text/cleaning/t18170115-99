The back of his house comes against our warehouse; his windows look into a yard at the back of his house, and our store-room window looks into that yard; it is only a glass casement. On the morning of the 14th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I came to Mr. Wilknson's house, it was just getting day-light. I got in through Mr. Wilkinson's dwelling-house. I was the last in the place the day before; I locked all up at eight o'clock. When I got in, I observed a quantity of papers about, which was not there the night before. I found the papers had been taken from my pocket-book, which I had locked up in the desk the night before, and took the key with me. I missed six 10l. notes, four of which were endorsed; one 40l. note; one 30l. note; and six 1l. notes; the 30l. and 40l. note was my property, the rest belonged to the firm. The whole of the desks, six in all, were broken open. The counting-house was only fastened with a latch. I examined the premises, and found a door that comes out of the lumber-room, which I had bolted the night before, open; the lumber-room is under the same roof as Mr. Wilkinson's dwelling-house. There was nothing to impede the progress of the men from the store-room to the door; after getting through that door, they might go to the counting-house without interruption; they would have to pass a door with a spring or pully before they got to the counting-house. If a person had entered the store-room window and took the direction I have described, he could not pass through any premises, but Mr. Wilkinson's; they are not under the same roof all the way along. The store-room is under Mr. Wilkinson's roof; the manufactory is on the same floor; there is nothing over them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Is the counting-house part of the dwelling-house, or not? - A. It is distinct, it is no part of the dwelling-house. We lost about 150l. It is impossible to say. which way the persons came. I do not know whether Mr. Wilkinson's rent is paid out of the partnership account or not.</p>
               <p>Court. If a person wanted to go to the counting-house after you left it, they must go through the door which you locked? - A. They must.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150043"></xptr>THOMAS WILKINSON, junior. My father lives in the dwelling-house, in Moorfields. The store-room window looks into Harris's, senior, yard, it is on the first-floor; the store-room leads into the workshop, they are both under the same roof. The store-room and workshop are not under the dwelling-house; the lumber-room is part of the dwelling-house, there is a door out of the lumber-room into a passage and into the warehouse, you can go into the counting-house through that door; the lumber-room is under the dwelling-house, but detached from it by a partition and door, which is nailed up; there was no communication through that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go from the lumber-room to the dwelling-house, without going from under the roof? - A. No, you must go under another roof, and come again under the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider the whole continuation of the dwelling to be more than one roof - A. Yes; two roofs; the firm pay for the whole of the premises, and charge my father with the rent of his dwelling-house.</p>

I could not see how they could get in but by the window, I got through it myself, any body could get through it-the bar was bent round; a person could stand on the privy, and get in at this window from the prisoner's, Harris, yard. I found a candle, which had been lit, and a mallet, in the room near the window.</p>

They then went round and came up the street again, and stood a little while at the end of Sash-court, and went down the court. I followed them, they went into Harris, sen.'s house; this was about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock. I first saw them at eleven o'clock-Mitchel was with them.</p>
               <p>SARAH BLACK. On the 12th of December I lived in Sash-court, in Harris, sen.'s house, the other prisoners used to be backward and forward at his house-Lupton is his daughter. I was at work on the 13th of December, I did not see them on that day. I went to bed at a little after nine o'clock. Harris keeps the two pair of stairs front room, my room is on the ground floor; at a little after twelve o'clock I was awoke by a rustling noise, it proceeded from the passage, close to my door. I heard a voice say, "d-n you, Jem, do not run, were are all safe." It was a voice which I knew, but I do not know whether it was a female voice or not; they went by twice, talking to one another, they shut the yard-door, and soon after I heard the rattling of some glass, as if it was breaking; I did not get up, as I had been used to hear noises. A person could get to Wilkinson's window by getting on the top of the privy. Sash-court is no thoroughfare.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know the particular night - A. I heard the words, which made me notice it.</p>

            , the prisoner, Willis, also lived with her; I used to chair for her, I know Pettit, and both the Harris's. On the night of the 13th of December, I was at my father's, I went to the Punch Bowl at half-past eleven o'clock, I went to see Edward Willis, Collis opened the door to me; the prisoners Harris, juu., Lupton, Pettit, and Willis, came out together, I asked Willis if he was going home, he said that he was not, and that I should not go home with him; I walked along Broker-row with them into Wilson-street - they were all together; I then asked Willis for two pair of shoes which he had got of mine, he said I might take them in the morning; I had left them in Mrs. Aliff's room, who lodges in Harris's house. He had never refused my going to Harris's house before. The other prisoners were at home at the time. Lupton said that I should go home with her that night. I went and slept at my father's. I left the prisoner at the corner of Horseshoe-alley, Wilson-street, it is the next court to Sashcourt, not twenty yards from it. As we were standing at the corner of Horse-shoe-alley the watchman came up to us; I went away, and saw no more of them that night. I saw them on the Saturday morning at Harris's house, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to Aliff's room to get my shoes; I saw Lupton the same afternoon in Chiswell-street, she was alone, I met her as I was going to my father's; I told her that I had been to her father's and got my shoes from Aliff's room; I asked her if she was going home, and she said she was going to look for somebody. The prisoner, Willis, came to my father's house on Sunday morning, he told me that Lupton wanted to speak to me; I went with him to Red Lion-market, and found Lupton there, she asked me to go and buy her a second-hand gown-Lupton and Willis went with me, we had some breakfast at a coffee-shop in Barbican; she bought a second-hand gown in Field-lane, and paid for it with two three-shilling pieces, I saw she had got a great deal of money; I then came back to Barbican with her, Willis left us at the coffee-shop, I went home - She said Willis had got the money. On the Sunday afternoon she sent to my father's for me again, and I found her waiting at the top of my father's court for me; she asked me if she might stop at my father's house till nine o'clock, when Willis and Harris would call for her, she waited there, and they called for her at nine o'clock, they had supper-my father was in the room while we were at supper; when he was gone I heard Willis and Harris talking about Wilkinson's robbery, they said they had got 140l. from Mr. Wilkinson's, and if they had had a drag (meaning a cart),<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150044"></xptr>which they had got now, they would have taken the iron chest; they said, they had given 15 guineas for the horse, and 5l. for the cart; I heard them say, that they got into Mr. Wilkinson's house, by the back part of Mr. Harris's house; they said, that they had lost 40l. in changing the notes; they only received 100l. for the 140l., and that they told Pettit, that they got 20l. less than they did, and that they had shared 120l. among Willis and Harris, jun.; I was in the room at supper; they went away together, about eleven o'clock; I saw Lupton one day afterwards at Mrs. Collis's, it was either Monday or Tuesday; I know that Willis and Lupton were very short of money before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was Lupton's chairwoman. I never lived with either of the men; she and Willis cohabited together; they had no money to pay me my wages; on my oath I never cohabited with either of the men; I never quarrelled with Lupton about Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not quarrel with Lupton for taking Willis away with you A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask the man to let you go home with him, when you was living with your father - A. They had said, that I was to go home with them. I never said that I would be revenged on Lupton, for taking my sweet-heart. I heard them talking of the robbery; I did not come here for the reward; I have not seen Johnston, since Lupton lived at New-terrace; I never said that I would be revenged on Harris, if I swore away his life.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have not seen Johnston since the prisoners have been taken up; I have no malice, towards either Lupton or Willis; I do live with a young man; I asked Harris, if I should go home with him, because Lupton had said that I should live with her, and should never leave her. Johnston is a prostitute; I have never been on the town.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. I told Mr. Wilkinson what I had heard about a week after, I did not like to tell him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell of the robbery, when you first heard of it - A. Nobody heard of it but me, Mr. Wilkinson was the first person that I told about it.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coach keeper. I sold a horse and cart for 15l., to Willis, I believe he is the man; It was the Friday before Christmas-day, there was a young man with him; I saw Willis riding it afterwards, and a young woman with him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOUGH. I am a broker, and live in Golden-lane, the prisoner, Willis, took a lodging of me a few days before Christmas-day; Lupton came with him, and remained there; they stopped till Christmas-eve; the prisoner, Harris, used to come and see them. When Willis took the lodging, he said, he had just come from the country, and they were to pay 6s., per week; they staid five days with me; after they left the lodging, I examined my bed, I found it very much broken, and terribly torn, so that any thing might be put into it. When he first came, he had a whip with him, and seemed quite a dasher; I took them without a character.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ARMSTRONG. I am a police officer. I went with Gleed and Turner, to look for the prisoners; I knew them all by sight, and by name, but Pettit. I went to the Punch Bowl, Queen-square, Moorfields, and found the prisoner, Lupton there, we staid a few minutes, and Willis, and Harris, jun., came up; Willis had a whip in his hand; Gleed said, here is Willis, and he, and Turner laid hold of him, and I said, here is Harris; he ran away, I run after him, and told him, that he had better stop, and he did; as soon as I took him, I told him, I took him for Wilkinsons' robbery; I took him to the Punch Bowl; Gleed and Turner had got Willis in the tap-room; in entering to the bar, six or seven men came by me, who I knew to be reputed thieves; the prisoner, Harris said, d-n your eyes, Joseph, I am no thief, leave go, or I will hit away. We found a knife on both of them; I told them, I took them for Wilkinsons' robbery, they immediately said, I am d-d if there is a man in the room; I went out to look for the horse and cart, which was in Moorfields, about one hundred yards off, when I got there, it was gone; I took them to the office; a few days ago, I apprehended Pettit, I had been to his house for him, but he did not come home all night; he came to me, and said, I understand you want me, and I am come to deliver myself up to you, if you have got any thing against me; I told him, that he was concerned in Wilkinsons' robbery, with Harris and Lupton-he said, he knew nothing about it; I told him, that he was at the Punch Bowl with them - He said, he had left them at ten o'clock, and never saw them any more that night.</p>

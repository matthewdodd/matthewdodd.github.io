I caught the watch in my hand as he had hold of the seals. He kept pulling them, and tried to pull the watch from me, but finding I was going to lay hold of him; he ran into the middle of the street - I was close to him; he turned round to join the gang again. I still pursued him, called Stop thief! and he was secured by two witness - I never lost sight of him. We took him down the King's Arms gateway; the gang came round, and I received several blows on my head from them - we shut the gates and secured him. I was afraid to pick up the case as the gang was round - I have never recovered it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in St. John-street. I was coming down Snow-hill, and saw the gang coming from Smithfield - they were running down - several people were robbed. I collared one of them, but he got away. I followed him, and nearly opposite Fleet-market, at the corner of the King's Arms gate I saw the prosecutor - the prisoner was one of the gang. Knight was pursuing him, and calling Stop thief! - his finger was within two inches of him; he ran on the pavement, and I collared him. We were instantly surrounded by the gang, who tried to rescue him, but several people came and assisted us - the gang left. Knight had the watch, and charged the prisoner with stealing it. We took him to the Compter.</p>

I was going up Cow-lane between five and six o'clock in the evening, and was met by a gang of about ten persons - I was robbed of my watch by three of them; they then proceeded towards Holborn, I followed them, and when they got to the bottom of Snow-hill I heard a cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoners running in the middle of the road, and assisted in securing him. He resisted, but when he found people round he surrendered. Knight charged him with the robbery, he denied it.</p>

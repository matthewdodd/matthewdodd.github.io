I lost a watch on the 9th of June, from a mantel-piece in my parlour, adjoining my shop - I had seen the prisoner there twice that day; I afterwards saw him in the Heart of Oak tavern - I asked him for the watch; he took it from his pocket, and endeavoured to pass it to another person or persons in his company - he had been employed by me as a carpenter, and had access to that room; I taxed him with it a day or two after I missed it, and asked if he had not taken it in a lark or joke - he denied it; I asked a man named Finch if he had it, and he said No, he had returned it to Wilks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. What are you? -A. A green-grocer - I have known the prisoner five months; I did treat this as a lark - Finch is no friend of mine; I did not see any fun going on when I found it - I asked Finch, (whose name I did not know at that time,) to show me the watch he received from Wilks, and he said he had returned it to him; I then asked Wilks for it - he denied it, but he took it out, and was handing it to the other - I said if he did not give it up I would get an officer.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Great Tichfield-street, and am shopman to Uriah Macey, a linen-draper. About four o'clock, on the 1st of June, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some lace—I showed her some in the box, and afterwards in another she said there was none to suit her—she went to the door, and asked the price of some prints there—I followed</p>

               <p>her, and saw the corner of a card of lace under her shawl—she went back to the chair she had been sitting in, and sat down—I then took up the corner of her shawl, and accused her of having the card of lace—she denied having it, and then ran out of the shop—I followed her, and she was given in charge of the policeman—this is the lace.</p>

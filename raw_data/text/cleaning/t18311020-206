I am a Policeman, I had information of this robbery in May last, and have been in search of the prisoner ever since - on the 18th, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to No. 16, Suffolk-street, and knocked at the door; the prisoner opened it - he instantly shut the door, and escaped backwards, leaving his hat in the yard; I afterwards heard he was at work in the Borough- I went there; they denied him - I waited till the workmen came out; he was among them - I took him; he said he knew nothing of the robbery - I said, "You worked at Mr. Silver's;" he said, "I believe I did;" I said,"Your wife knows something about them;" he asked me where I got my information, and he said he was sure she knew nothing of it, for she did not know what the charge was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I brought down one and put it in the cart; while I was gone for that one I lost one pair of hind quarters from the cart; I made a hue and cry, if any body had seen them taken out of the cart; a man of the name of Tatum told me Parker saw the prisoner take it out of the cart, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN PARKER. I am servant to Mr. Griffin, a butcher in Little James-street, Bedford row. On the morning of the 4th, a little before nine o'clock, I was in Warwick-lane minding my cart where my master's property was; while I was standing there I saw the prisoner and another man pass by; I saw them go to the other part of Warwick-lane, and the prisoner took a hind quarter of mutton out of the cart; the person who was with him was standing against the post; when he took it of the opposite side of the way, I saw it as plain as I see you where you are, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance off where you. - A. I suppose about fifty yards off. He took it out of the cart, put it on his shoulder, and walked away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man. - A. He went with him; what became of them I know not I told Mr. Tatum of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. I had seen him once, I believe; Ballard came out of the market, he enquired for the property; Tatum told him I saw it taken out of the cart; and by the description I gave him of the person he knew him by name.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him. - A. Not till the Monday following, I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him before the magistrate were you sure he was the man. - A. I was upon my oath then about it; I am perfectly satisfied that he was the man that took the mutton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If that man saw me take away the property that time, why did not he give information and have me taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. So he did.</p>
               <p>Ballard. I have seen the prisoner before; I have heard him called by name, and by the description I knew him; I have seen him in our market before about the carts.</p>

            . On Thursday the 4th of February an information was received at the office that there was a bull bait at Highgate Common; and that some people were going to fighting; we had instructions to go up and try to stop them. On my return back I saw the prisoner, and from having an information of the robbery in the morning I took him in custody; he had been to the bull bating.</p>

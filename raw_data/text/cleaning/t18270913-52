On the 10th of August, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw my watch, chain, and seals hanging on a nail by the fire place in the parlour, behind the shop - I missed them and a spoon about eleven o'clock. I do not know the prisoner. The next day the chain and seal were brought to me by Brown, the officer. I found the watch in pawn a few days afterwards. The house is not mine - I only rent part of it, of Mr. Torrington; I have the shop, parlour, and kitchen: he lives in the house himself, on the second floor - he lets out the first floor; I have a seperate entrance: there are two doors - he enters by the private door; there are two shops in front of the house: nobody has access to my part of the house.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Shoreditch. On the 10th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to pawn this gold seal and chain - she seemed confused, and asked if I could afford to lend 3l. on them - she seemed much confused; I asked what she gave for them - she said nothing; I asked her how she came possessed of them - she said they were her husband's, and they were given to him - that she lived at No. 9, Holywell-lane; I forget what name she gave, though I wrote it down at the time, and sent my shopman there with her; he took her to Worship-street, and returned to me in ten minutes; she had produced a spoon to me. I gave the chain and seal to Brown, the officer. I think I have seen the prisoner before.</p>

Mr. Boards' shopman delivered the prisoner to me, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I went to Boards' house immediately after locking her up, and received a plated table-spoon - and at the office he delivered me the chain and seal.

            . I live in the same house with Mr. Hanson. On the 10th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was coming in by the private door, and met the prisoner in the passage - I have nothing to do with Mr. Hanson's door, but he has a door, which comes out of his parlour into our passage. I live in the two back rooms on the second floor. Mr. Hanson has a door leading from the street into his shop, but he has to cross the passage in which I met the prisoner, to get into his parlour; if he went into his parlour without going into the shop, he must go in at the same door as I do. The prisoner was coming along the passage - I said nothing to her.</p>

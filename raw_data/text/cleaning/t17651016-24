I was coming down the yard on Friday last, about six in the evening, and saw the prisoner come out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176510160023"></xptr> of a warehouse that I have the care of; he had this bag, and what is in it, on his shoulder: (Producing a bag, with the ink-born and pen cases in it): I stept to him, and said, who do you want? he said, The Cambridge; he stept up to the Cambridge warehouse, put the bag down, and went away, without saying a word more. I looked at the bag, and saw J. GOODMAN wrote in large letters on it; I know it was what I had had in my care for three weeks: the prisoner made his way into the street; I followed him, and asked him how he came by that bag? saying, it contained goods left in my care. He said, if that belonged to me, he had left his bag in my warehouse: I said, if he had, we would have a light, and go and rectify it: we got a light and searched, but could find no bag; then he did not say he had left any. I was fully satisfied he had brought none; I asked him his name, which he said was Davenport, that he was a linen-draper, and lived in Goodman's fields: I sent for a constable, who took him to the Poultry-Compter. On Tuesday, he was before my Lord Mayor at the Mansion-house; there he seemed to equivocate, and said he had brought a parcel, and somebody had taken it away, and trick'd him out of it. The bag was opened before my Lord Mayor; the inkhorns were wrapped up in single dozens; there were twenty-eight dozen of them; I had orders to sell them for 12 s. a dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I brought a bag to the warehouse at the Bull Inn, in order to go to Cambridge; I went down the yard, and asked for the Cambridge warehouse; they said it was lower down. I went and put it down in the warehouse, and looked about for the book-keeper: when I could not find him, I went and left the bag. After that, I took this bag by mistake: coming up the middle of the yard, I met this man; he said, who do you want? I said, The Cambridge; said he, there is the Cambridge. I went and said, there is a parcel for you, please to take care of it; very well, said he. When I got to the gate, he came running after me, and said, these things don't belong to you. I went back with him to the warehouse; we looked about, and could not find it: whether any body had taken mine away, or put it any where else, I know not. Mine was a bag of linen and chintz; I bought them of a man that came from India.</p>

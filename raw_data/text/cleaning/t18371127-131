                  </hi>. I am a merchant. About seven o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing of the 24th of November, I was in Hatton-garden—I had a handker<lb></lb>chief—I felt a tug at my pocket, turned and missed my handkerchief—the prisoner was close to me—I took him by the collar, and held him—we went on a few paces—I told him he had my handkerchief—he said he had not—I proceeded a few paces, and a policeman came up and took him—a lad came up and said he saw the prisoner with a handkerchief in his hand, which he threw down; that a girl took it, and ran away with it.</p>

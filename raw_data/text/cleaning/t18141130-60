When I came out of my hammock and dressed myself, I felt for my watch, it was gone. I examined my hammock, I could not find my watch; I afterwards missed my handkerchief and my shirt, my box was broken open. I went into the office and informed the officer, and asked if he had been out of the dock with a bundle. He said no. I immediately went to the south gate, and enquired of the officer of that gate, he said no; and on the north side I saw the officer with the prisoner, and the prisoner with a bundle under his arm. The officer took the bundle from him, and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q, Did he work on board that ship - A. No, I never saw the prisoner before that morning.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER HORTON. I am a constable at the West India Docks. I was stationed at the outhouse of the Export Dock; I received information that person had lost his watch, shirt, and handkerchief; immediately after I saw the prisoner with a bundle. He told me he had some things belonging to the mate of the Phoenix. I asked him for his pass, he could not produce any. I then looked in the bundle, and saw the articles which this person claimed as his own; the watch and seal were concealed in the prisoner's trowsers. The prosecutor and I examined the prisoner, and found the shirt, handkerchief, watch, and seal. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shirt, handkerchief, watch and seal, are mine.</p>

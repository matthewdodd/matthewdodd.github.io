About nine o'clock on the evening of the 5th of December Hannams came into the shop, and asked to look at some stockings; I saw no one with him - I turned to reach a paper of stockings from the shelf, and was informed by a little boy that a piece of staff had been taken from a pile within three feet of the door; my boy ran out, calling Stop thief! Hannams was still in the shop - he had not done any thing, but I told him to leave the shop, as I had no doubt he was an accomplice; I took him to the door, and called for a Policeman, but as no one appeared, I left a friend to mind my door -I went out, and found Birkett; I brought him back, and gave him to a Policeman - Hannams was then gone.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 5th of December I saw a mob, and went up to the prosecutor's door; Birkett was given into my custody for stealing a piece of merino - I took him by the collar; he said, "Let go my collar, I am no thief - take hold of the tail of my coat;" he threw down this merino, and Hannams came and kicked me - another man came up, and struck me on the back of my head; I fell, and lost my hold of Birkett, but I got up and pursued him - I tied his hands; Hannams came up again, but I got my brother-officer to take him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there not a great many people about? A. Yes, I suppose one hundred; no charge was given of Hannams then, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050042"></xptr>before the Magistrate - I have seen the prisoners in company.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

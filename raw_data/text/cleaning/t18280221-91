            . I am porter to Halling and Co. of Cockspur-street; they are silk-mercers and haberdashers. On the 3d of December I had some goods to deliver to different persons, and had one parcel to deliver to Dr. Jenkins in Great Castle-street: it had been delivered to me by a clerk, named Terry - I do not know what was in it; I was looking about for Dr. Jenkins', when the prisoner (who was a stranger) came up to me; I told him who I wanted; he then went and showed me the house - I knocked at the door, and he came and stood by the door; I left the parcel at the house - the young woman said it was all right, and there was a parcel to go back; I said I would call for it as I returned; the prisoner heard that and said "You'd better call for it as you come back, 'tis not worth while to carry it with you;" I called as I came back and it was gone - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I did live at No. 8, Castle-street in the employ of Mr. Clark; Dr. Jenkins lived there - The prisoner came to the door with the porter: the porter said he would call for the things when he came back - which he did: but before that, the prisoner had been, and I gave him the parcel - it contained a Swiss dress, cloth for six shirts, and some Irish linen - it was the property of Mr. Jenkins.</p>

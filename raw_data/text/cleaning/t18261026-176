            . I am a watchman of Humberton-street, Commercial-road. I stopped the prisoner with the watch in her hand, about two hundred yards down the street; she was running; I asked how she came by the watch; she said she had none - I said, "I see it in your hand;" she then said she got it from a friend, and pointed to the Commercial-road; and in going along she said she took it from her husband, who was drunk in Spitalfields. I took her to the watch-house - I saw the prosecutor in the Commercial-road - he claimed it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On the evening of 7th July I was in Arthur-street, about half-past 8 o'clock—I saw the three prisoners in conversation—I followed them over London-bridge to the Surrey side, where they again stopped and conversed—they then returned to the middle of the bridge—Mr. Pickering passed them—Carter went behind him, and took a handker<lb></lb>chief out of his coat pocket—the other two prisoners were walking close behind, screening him—Carter stopped, looked at the handkerchief, and put it into the flap of his trowsers; Hall and Bennett walked by the prosecutor for a few paces; they then turned, and the three prisoners walked together to the Surrey side—I went to the prosecutor, and got his name and address—I then went over the bridge, and met the prisoners again—I continued to watch them till I got the assistance of another officer—Carter went behind another gentleman, and Hall and Bennett still remained close behind him—we went and took them all three—I handed Bennett to the other officer—when I took Carter, he said, "What areyoutaking me for?"—I said, For picking pockets"—he said, "I have not been picking pockets; I have just come from Greenwich, from my sister's; I never saw these men before"—while taking them to the station I saw Bennett throw down this handkerchief—a gentle<lb></lb>man picked it up and gave it to me—I took the prisoners to the station, searched them, and found on Carter a sixpence, on Bennett this other handker<lb></lb>chief, and Hall had this one round his neck.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to the Dun-horse, in the Borough, on the Saturday before Christmas-day, at half past ten, he drank some beer, and said he was distressed for a shilling, and he shewed the quadrant, which was the only thing I saw in his hand; I lent him a shilling upon it, he said, it was his own property; he did not come to redeem it, and I knowing Mr. Guest to be an officer, I delived it to him on the Monday; I never saw the prisoner before, but I am sure he is the man I lent the shilling to, I am clear in it, I was two hours in his company.</p>

               <p>I was rowing up to shore, and I took these things on board, I was going round to the ship, and there came a raft of timber and took the boat away, and I could not find the ship again being dark, and I carried the things home.</p>

               <p>Court to Montgomery. Did you call after this boat? - Yes, it was a still night, and there was no raft; he made complaint before the Justice, that it was cloudy.</p>

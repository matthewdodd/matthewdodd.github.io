                  </hi>. I am a police-constable of Liverpool, and live in Hewit's-buildings, Great Homer-street, Liverpool.—On the 12th of May I apprehended the prisoner in Albion-street, Liverpool—I charged him with robbing his lodging in London—he said I might search, I should find nothing there—I desired him to get up and dress himself—I found a pair of stockings in his shoes, a piece of chamois leather in his pocket, and a glazier's diamond; also this silver watch under his head in the bed—he was in bed—I then went to his mother's, searched his box, and found a pair of braces, which I showed to Mr. Robinson, and he identified them—the prisoner was not there when I found them—he was sleeping about 200 or 300 yards from his mother's house—I have known his mother two or three years—I called the prisoner's attention to the braces being found there—he said they were his own, and afterwards, on the railway, he said Mr. Robinson could not swear to them; did I think anything could be done to him?—I cautioned him not to say anything to me, for whatever he did say would be produced in evidence against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Barnes ironmongers, and live in Orange-street, Gravel-lane, Southwark—I rent the whole house—it is in the parish of St. Saviour's. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 16th of April, and occupied a bed-room on the top floor—on the 8th of May I and my mother went out, leaving the pri<lb></lb>soner at home alone—previous to going out I had asked him if he intended</p>

               <p>to go out—he said he did not know that he was, and we went—my mother returned home first—when I came home the prisoner was gone, and I missed my watch from the top drawer of a chest of drawers, some tea<lb></lb>spoons from a drawer which was left locked, some table-spoons, a mourn<lb></lb>in? ring, a brooch, a red silk shawl, a white silk shawl, some neck-hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, three pocket-handkerchiefs, a linen sheet, some stockings, one sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. odd—part of the things belonged to my mother, Phoebe Robinson—I also missed some waistcoats and a pair of kerseymere trowsers from the drawers, and another pair from a box in the room, with a brown Taglioni coat, a pair of blue braces, a knife, a pair of scissors, and some razors from a drawer in the room the prisoner occupied—the drawer which contained the plate was opened by a knife, which I found by it—the blade was broken in two—I have part of it—the officer found the other part—the property I lost amounts altogether to about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down to Liverpool, and saw the prisoner in custody there—I recognized this piece of leather as the piece which had contained the spoons—I found this other piece of leather, and this paper, which had contained the spoons, on the prisoner's bed, after he was gone—I found the house safe when I came home.</p>

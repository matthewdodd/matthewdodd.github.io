               <p>Q. Did you make use of any threats or promises? - A. No; I did not.</p>

            Was his examination taken in writing? - A. I cannot say; I went to the house in which, he said, his sister lived; and it was then past twelve o'clock; the house was knocked up, and I saw the sister; she produced some duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Vaillant. Q. How long had the prisoner been with you? - A. Very near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before this had you looked over the plate? - A. I never looked over it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot pretend to say but these various articles were taken at different times? - A. They might; it happened that we had had no company for three weeks; and if we had not the four spoons at the corners of the table, I made no enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe a spoon is the largest article you have lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is not worth 40s.? - A. No.</p>

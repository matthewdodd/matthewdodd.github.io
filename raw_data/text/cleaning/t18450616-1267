                  </hi>. I am footman to Mr. Johnson, of Saville-row. On the 30th of May, about half-past eight o'clock, the prisoner came there, and said he came for two volumes of the "Medical Advertiser"—he walked in—I shut the street door after him, and left him in the hall—I went up stairs, and instead of going into the room, I looked over the banisters—I saw him come along the passage, and put his hand up to a coat—I came down, went across the kitchen, and heard the street door shut—I went up the area steps, and saw him going down Saville-row with the coat on his arm—I followed him down the passage—he turned round, and saw me, and threw the coat at me—I took it up, and followed him, calling "Stop thief"—I did not lose sight of him—I saw him stopped—I gave the coat to Bradley—this is it—it is the property of Mr. Henry Hughen Hallett, who was stopping at my master's house.</p>

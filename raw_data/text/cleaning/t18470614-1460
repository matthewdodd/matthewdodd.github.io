                  </hi>. I am the wife of Issac Baigent, who keeps an eating and coffee-house, in East Smithfield, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate—it is his dwelling-house. The prisoner had been lodging in the house six weeks when this happened—I went to bed with my husband on this Saturday night, about a quarter after ten o'clock, leaving the prisoner in a box in the shop—he was tipsy—about half-past two in the morning I was disturbed by the sound of the knife-box—the prisoner used to sleep on the first-floor; I slept above him—I came down stairs, listened, heard a rattling noise, and thought he was helping himself to a little food—there were knives in the knife-box—I went up to bed again, heard the same noise repeated, came down again, and listened a short time; that was about half-past three—I looked into the prisoner's room—the bed had not been occupied—I listened at the top of the stairs, and heard the grating of a key in the cupboard where my husband keeps his money—I called out, and asked who was there—the prisoner answered, "It is me," and said, "I am getting up, are you?"—I said, "No, I am surprised at your making such a noise on a Sunday morning"—it was half-past three o'clock—that was not the usual time to get up on a Sunday morning—I went down three stairs, and saw the prisoner's foot—he had his stocking on, but no boot—I ran up stairs, put on my gown, and went down—I called my husband—he dressed himself, and came down—I was down first—I searched for the prisoner, but could not find him—I went into the yard, and called out—the prisoner spoke from the water-closet in the yard, and said, "Yes, ma'am, I am here," opened the door, came out, and came into the house—I said, "You have stolen my husband's money from the cupboard, I heard the grating of the key in the cupboard"—I do not know what made me think it was gone—he said I might search him, if I liked—I said no, I would leave that for my husband and the police—he sat down on a chair by the fire-place—my</p>

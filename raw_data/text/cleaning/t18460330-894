                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeat H</hi> 8.) On the 20th of Feb. I went with Mr. Carey to the prisoner's house—the prisoner was in the in the shop—I asked if he knew a person named Brown—he said, "No, I do not, that I am aware of"—I said, "I think you do; you had better recollect yourself, for according to my information, you bought candles of him"—he said, "No, I did not, that I am aware of: I have not bought any candles of any person of the name of Brown"—Mr. Carey, the uncle of Brown, was there with me—I turned round to him, and said, "Well, Mr. Carey, you know the information you have received from Brown, it is now for you to judge what step you will take"—Mr. Carey said, "Well then, I certainly shall give him into custody"—at that time I had not seen Mrs. Brown—I judged it was necessary to go and consult with her—the prisoner then said, "Oh! you mean the tall young man?"—I said, "Yes, he is a tall young man"—he said, "He was introduced to me by a man named Flowerday; Mr. Carey, pray don't take any step of that kind, to take me away from my home, and I will let you know everything I know about it, or any goods that I have bought"—I said, "My information is, that you have bought candles at 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound of Brown"—he said, "I have bought a few candles on one or two occasions, but I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound"—I said, "Where is the tobacco you bought?"—he said, "I certainly have bought tobacco on two or three occasions, small quantities, and he had cigars for it, but he always told me it was his own"—I then said, "Where is the jar of capers you bought of him?"—he said, "well, he did bring a small jar of capers, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; I emptied them, and he took the jar away again"—he begged very particularly to be allowed to go and have an interview with Mrs. Brown—he said he would gladly pay double and treble the amount of her loss, if the uncle would not take any step towards him—I desired the uncle, while I remained there with the prisoner, to go and see Mrs. Brown—he went away and returned, but not bringing any decisive answer, I went and saw Mrs. Brown myself, and afterwards took the prisoner—I found some candles in this shop, which he could not satisfactorily account for—I found they resembled two dozen of flat candles which I had, which had been found in the possession of Thomas Brown when I took him—I asked the prisoner where he bought them—he said he did not know, he bought some of one and some of another—I took possession of them, and took the prisoner to the station—he there particularly requested to speak to Mrs. Brown—he was cautioned by the inspector to be cautions what he said, as what he said might be used as evi<lb></lb>dence againt him.</p>

I had a 25l. note in my jacket-pocket, which hung up in the stable; I received the note on the 8th, and missed it on the 21st. Suspicion fell upon the prisoner, and he was taken into custody. I was with the officer when he was taken. I never desired him to change the note for me; he was searched, and 21s. 6d., in silver, was found on him.</p>

About twelve o'clock in the day, in the London-road, I saw the prisoner, and another young man in company with him—they walked close behind a gentleman, and I saw the prisoner draw this handkerchief from under his coat tail—he secreted it in his breast—he perceived that I was about to catch hold of him—he ran away—I ran after him and caught him—he threw the handkerchief away—my brother officer picked it up—when I took the prisoner he asked what I took him for—I told him I would tell him presently—when Smith came up I asked him if he had got the handkerchief—he said he had—the prisoner then said, "So help me G—I never saw a man look so square"—I asked him what he meant—he said he took me for a commercial traveler; he did not think I was a b—<hi rend="italic">cad</hi>, which it appears is a name they have for a policeman in plain clothes—I do not know who the gentleman was that he took the handkerchief from.</p>

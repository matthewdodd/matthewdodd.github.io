I am a footman to Mr. Woodcock: on the 10th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, the cloth was laid for supper, and the things mentioned in the indictment were laid upon it; the bell rang; going up stairs I missed the things off the table; being alarmed, supposing there had been a robbery, we traced the salt out of the window into the garden; the window was open; it was left open when the things were laid for supper; there was a patch close by the window in the inside, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080054"></xptr> we supposed was dropt: on going out next morning, making enquiry, mentioning the black patch at the public house next door, the landlord said, there was a man lived with him who always wore such black patches, and was a man of bad character; that induced us to make enquiry; in a little time we had an account that these things were offered to a broker just by; the broker was sent for, and my master shewed him the fellow of the spoons that were taken away; the prisoner was taken at his mother's, at Standford-hill; he had worked as a <rs id="t17730908-43-deflabel205" type="occupation">plaisterer</rs>

            . I am a broker: the prisoner came to my house on the 11th of August, about a quarter before eight in the morning, at Kings-land, which is about a mile from Mr. Woodcock's; he asked whether I bought any plate; I was just come down stairs; I had been very ill; my wife said I sometimes did, and bid him come in; he pulled out the spoons; I asked what he would have for them; I am not sure whether he asked 12 s. or 15 s. for the four; I said I believed he had stole them; I examined the spoons to see if there was any mark on them; there was only a cypher; I heard that Mr. Woodcock had been robbed; I went to him, and asked if he had any spoons of the same pattern as them he lost; the footman brought a spoon; I could swear to the bowl as soon as I saw it; it is marked exactly the same; I saw other things in the prisoner's pocket, but asked him no farther questions. I never saw the man before, but am sure he is the person. I got up and looked after him; he said he would go to the Jews in Duke's Place; I watched him till he got through the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Why did not you stop me?</p>
               <p>Knight. I was very ill, and being busy, I thought it more proper to mind my business; I did not know where he came from; he said he came out of the country.</p>

               <p>Dixon. I do not know; he told how he got into the window, filled his pocket, and got out again; I said was there any other plate in the room; he said yes, there were some silver handled knives and forks, and a silver bread basket worth about 40 l. or 50 l. I said why did not you take them? how came you not to take them? he said he only took what he could take in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever use to wear any thing on his face?</p>

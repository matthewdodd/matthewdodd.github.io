I am an engraver, of No. 50, Oakley-street, Lambeth, About 29th April, Foster called on me and showed me a foreign bank note, and asked me if it was possible to copy it—I told him it was quite possible—he wanted to know the expense—I asked him if he wanted it on steel or copper—he asked if there would be any difference in the expense—I said that it would depend entirely on the number of copies they might with struck off—he said that he was not sure how many, but he imagined they would require about 8,000—I told him the expense would be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for engraving—he said that it was not for himself, he had other parties to show it to, and he could not give me an answer then, but would call again—he called on 2nd May and showed me another note, that was not like the</p>

White" is like the prisoner's writing—that is my con<lb></lb>scientious belief—the whole body as well as the signature—I mean the filling up—here is one cheque, signed "G. Wilson," that signature I am not as clear about—but the date of the 4th of October is like the prisoner's writing, I believe it to be his—the signature of "Whitaker" to this other I cannot speak to, but the date, "4th October," I believe to be his writing—the other, signed "Henry White," is more like the prisoner's writing than any of the others—I believe it to be his signature, as well as the date—I am certain this letter (looking at one) is the prisoner's handwriting—I should say the whole of it is his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soldier. I have known the prisoner two years—he bore a good character—I remember Saturday the 6th of October last—I saw the prisoner that day at Mr. Godfrey's, at the White Lion, in Drury-lane, about half-past' six o'clock in the evening—he was in my company till twenty minutes after ten—I took out my watch at twenty minutes after ten.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutter, and live at the Wheataheaf, Red<lb></lb>lion-street, Holborn; I have known the prisoner two yean; he was very well spoken of. On Saturday, the 6th of October, I saw him at Mr. Godfrey's, the White Lion, in Drury-lane, and afterwards at another (public-house kept by Perkins—I first saw him at Godfrey's about six or half-past six o'clock, and was with him from that time till about half-past ten o'clock—my brother and two other young men were with us—there were five of us altogether—we were playing at billiards at first, and after<lb></lb>wards at skittles—I have been out of Court while my brother was examined—I did not hear a word of his evidence—we had some porter to drink—we separated at half-past ten o'clock—I went to Drury-lane Theatre with my brother—we were both employed there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any body else besides your brother and you there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two young men named Glenny and Davis—they are not here—I met the prisoner at the White Lion—we played at Milliards there, and then went to the public-house opposite, and played at skittles—it was not an open skittle-ground—it was covered in with a sky-light, and lighted with gas—I played at skittles there—we had porter, and half-and-half to drink—no spirits—I have known the prisoner two or three years—I really do not know what he is—I only knew him as a companion—I understood he was a clerk during the two years—I do not know where—I merely knew him at the-public-house and at the theatre—he was employed there some time ago as a supernumerary, sometimes, to go on in different scenes as a soldier, and so on—I know a person living in Clare-court—I do not know whether it is No. 9—it is the last house in Clare-court, on the left hand from Drury-lane—I did not meet the prisoner there—I know there is a person there of the prisoner's acquaintance—I know the prisoner's father—he is a cutter—I do not know that they are Roman Catholics—I merely knew him as a companion at the public-house—during the time I we known him, I knew nothing disrespectful of him.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GLINDON</hi>. I am a painter and glazier. I have known the prisoner some years—I have seen him write as late as the lat<lb></lb>ter end of July or August, but I have often seen him write for the last six or seven years—I do not believe the "H. Whitaker" to this cheque to be his handwriting, decidedly not—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the cheque signed "G. White</hi> ")—there is not one part of this that is his handwriting—I will not swear to the whole of it, but it is not his handwriting—the letter signed "Lee" is not his hand-writing-so help me God, it is not.</p>

               <p>the time he was away from Laurence and Blenkarne's office, at dinner time, he used to come to an office where I served my time, and assist me in copying letters and sorting when I was pressed—that was at Mr. Power's, No. 8, Cornhill, who is a general merchant—he deals in wine and exe<lb></lb>cutes any commissioon abroad—I swear positively these papers are not the prisoner's handwriting—I cannot swear it is not his handwriting, but it is not the character of the handwriting—I handwriting I know of his—the note I read is not like his handwriting—to the best of my belief, not one of the three I have seen is his handwriting—I will not swear the one signed "Whitaker" is not his handwriting, but it is not his character of handwriting—I cannot say but what a man might disguise his hand—I cannot say whether the signature "Henry Whitaker" is his or not—my handwriting at one time was so like his that I could not tell one from the other—those papers I have seen are not at all like his handwriting—not in the slightest degree like his handwriting—I think I should know his writing, when he was at Laurence and Blenkarne's, if it was shown to me-his hand is not improved since then, because he has worked for me—his hand has fallen off—I cannot say that I could swear to what he wrote when at Lau<lb></lb>rence and Blenkarne's—I might give an opinion on it—his hand is de<lb></lb>cidedly altered since that, but not so as to do away with the resemblance—the character of the hand would be the same, but the handwriting is not—the signatures of the papers which have been shown to me are not like his handwriting in form or character.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>and out of town too, as check clerk and as committee clerk—he was em<lb></lb>ployed by me at the Finsbury election, and previous to that at the East Surrey, Westminster, Marylebone, Lambeth, and several other places—my friends' recommended me—I was no more than himself—I might hare had a department given to me which I superintended, such as directing letters, making out a list of voters, directing circulars to them, and checking those that had polled—he has also been employed by me selling wine for Mr. Power, in the Docks—painting and glazing is my employ in the summer—I was not present at the prisoner's examination at the police-office—he did not send for me—I live at No. 21, Arundel-street, Strand—I have been at home for the last fortnight—I have not been to Birmingham in that time—I never was there in my life.</p>

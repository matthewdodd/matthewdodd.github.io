                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Davies. I have been lately staying at No. 24, Salisbury-street, Strand, and reside at Crickhowel, near Brecon—about a quarter before twelve o'clock on Friday, the 8th of July, I was going down the Strand, near Bedford-street, towards Charing-cross, in company with Mrs. Stevens—I had a purse, with fifteen sovereigns and other money in my pocket—I felt a little pressure at my side, by my right hand pocket I instantly put my hand into my pocket, and said, "I have lost my purse"—the prisoner Brown was close by me, on the side where the purse had been—a great number of persons were round—I did not see any thing of Williams—my pocket was not cut—the person must have put his hand in, and taken it out—I saw my purse at Bow-street—I believe Brown was seized by my female friend, but I was very much agitated—this is my purse; and the money, I believe, is right.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Watling-street, and am a warehouse-man. I was coming up the Strand about twelve o'clock—I observed Mrs. Davies on the pavement, and Brown near her—she had hold of one side of him and Mr. Holder the other—I saw him put his hand behind him and give something to a young man who was behind him—I could not see what it was—I might know that young man again if I saw him, but he is not here—he gave it to Williams, who ran up Bedford-street—I ran after him, he turned up Maiden-lane, and I there caught him—the policeman was walking the same way—I tapped him on the shoulder, and we seized him together—we were taking him back, and he escaped from us, back, to<lb></lb>wards the Strand—he ran about ten yards, and we overtook him again—we took him into the door-keeper's room in the Adelphi Theatre, where a person named Shaw, the policeman and myself searched him, and found the purse in the leg of his trowsers—it slipped down at the bottom on the floor—the money was in it.</p>

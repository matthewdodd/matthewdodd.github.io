            . On the 26th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I and Limbrick were going to Hampstead, and saw the prisoner driving the pigs towards town. Limbrick told me to go and ask him where he got them. I stopped him, and another man who was with him ran off. The prisoner said he was taking them to the pound, as they were straying about the heath; he said he did not know who they belonged to. I told him he was going the wrong way to the pound; he made no answer, and I took him to the watch-house. Next day Phlan saw and claimed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Back Church-lane, in the parish of Whitechapel. About nine o'clock, on the evening of the 19th of March, I was sitting in my parlour, adjoining my shop—the shop door was shut, and bolted at the top—I heard a noise, and ran into the shop—I found the door standing open, and missed the weighing-machine off the counter—I looked out, but saw nobody but a policeman coming by—I gave an alarm—I found part of the machine lying in the gutter, near the door—the machine was brought back in about twenty minutes, and the prisoner was taken to the station-house—it is a half-hatch door; a person could put his hand over, and unbolt it.</p>

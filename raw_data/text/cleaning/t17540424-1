            . I was coming down Fleet-street at that time and saw the prisoner standing at the prosecutor's window; before I got to the door I heard the glass break; I saw the boy run away. I went and told Mr. Weight a boy had broke his window; I ran after the boy, and called out, stop him; the prisoner was stopped near the end of Salisbury-Court. I brought him back and some handkerchiefs which were found dropped near him; he put the handkerchiefs in his bosom when I brought him along.</p>

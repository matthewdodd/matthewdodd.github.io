            . I am shop-boy to the prosecutor. I was there that morning - I saw the prisoner come to the top of the shop, and take a yard measure down - he went to the bottom of the shop, put his hand under the wrapper, took down a piece of silk and put it on the counter - he put the yard measure to the silk, and took the scissors out of his pocket and cut the silk off - he put it into his pocket, rolled the roll up, and put it into its place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. At the door, cleaning the window - there was no one in the shop - he did not conceal this - there was a pile of boxes before him - he did not cut off a random piece - he measured it with the stick - I do not think there was a carpenter at work.</p>

            . I was sent for to take the prisoner- the silk was found in my presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny any felonious intention of appropriating it to my own use - it is the custom of our trade for a shopman to have any goods he may want - it is immaterial whether it is measured by yourself or any one else - I can bring two witnesses who will swear that I showed them a piece of silk on the Thursday before, and on the Monday I ascertained what quantity I wanted - the value of a young man depends on his knowing his business, with regard to leaving such a length of silk as may be of benefit to his employer - I said to one of my witnesses that if I cut three yards off one of the pieces, it would be an injury, as it would leave but eleven yards, which would be an unsaleable length - it is not likely if I had wished to appropriate this to my own use that I should take the measure and cut it off - the carpenter stood close to me when I cut it off, but I have not been able to procure him - he said to me, "Shall I remove, Sir, am I in your way?" - I said"No, not at all" - there were boards on the counter, but they did not conceal me at all - this boy has had an animosity against me for a fortnight before - he cannot deny that on the Wednesday or Thursday before, he was very saucy, and I told him I would box his ears - he continued his impertinence, and I took hold of his ears, but did not hurt him - his father came there that day - I told him, and he desired me to correct him at any time - on the morning this happened, he was very sancy, while he was on the steps - I was obliged to tell him to do the windows over again - he said Mr. Withers, who was my predecessor, never told him to do it, and he would not - I said he was very saucy, and if it were not that I should have to pay for the glass, I would knock him off the steps; and when I went to breakfast he said I had been cutting off silk, and not entered it- it is only spite and malice that has induced this charge by him - all that I have had has been entered, both cash and goods.</p>

            . I am Mrs. Gardner's niece; I help her in her shop. On the 8th of April the prisoner had some stockings and some ribbon for his own use, at a low price, and Mrs. Gardner entered them in the book - I think it was about the same time the prisoner told me he wanted a piece of silk for some bonnets - I told him it would take three yards to make two bonnets, which I understood he wanted - he brought two pieces to me, and said one was fourteen yards long, and he asked if I thought two yards would do for the bonnets, as it would leave twelve yards, which would make a dress - I told him I thought it would require three yards - he said he thought he should have it, but he did not say what quantity - I never entered things- I never knew any one to have things when Mrs. Gardner was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he tell you he had cut off three yards? A. No. He never desired me to enter it to him.</p>

               <p>MRS. GARDNER re-examined. I searched the prisoner's box, about half-past eight o'clock that morning - when I heard of this, I called the boy up - the prisoner asked him how he dared to say such a thing; and put himself in a great passion - I said, "Do not put yourself in a passion; you have no objection to my searching your box?" - he said,"No, nor my person either" - I then sent for the officer.(

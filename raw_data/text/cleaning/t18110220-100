Last Sunday week I was in Whitechapel, about half after ten, I was standing up making water, three women passed by, one woman stepped up, and forced her hand into my pocket; I had three dollars and eighteen pence in my waistcoat pocket, I perceived the money go out that very instant; as she passed the thrust her hand into my pocket. I never spoke to them, nor they to me. I pursued the prisoner, I never just sight of her; the watchman laid hold of her, she was searched, and no dollar was found upon her. No other person but these women took my money, and the prisoner was one of the three that did take it.</p>

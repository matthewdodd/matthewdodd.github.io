            . I live in Philpott-street, Commercial-road. On Saturday night, the 7th of January, I saw the prisoner in Holborn, at a quarter before twelve o'clock; she asked me to go with her to a house; I turned, looked at her and desired her to leave me, which she did, but when I got about one hundred and fifty yards further, she came up again, and requested me to go with her - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160059"></xptr>had my coat on my arm, and an umbrella in my hand; she took hold of my arm; I said, if she did not leave me, I would charge an officer with her - I then went on till I got to St. Andrew's-church; she came to me again, opposite a lamp; I again told her to leave me; she looked angrily at me; I crossed to evade her, but she still kept with me till we came to a little court just beyond <placeName id="t18320216-155-crimeloc876">Farringdon-street</placeName>

            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor, on the 9th of January, to No. 2, Pheasant-court; this money was found on the prisoner, as Mr. Williams has stated; she then said she had robbed him, and was sorry for what she had done - if he would only overlook her fanlt, she would let him have 2l. 10s. the day following - I asked what she had done with the purse; she said I should have that another time; I insisted upon having it then, and she called Mary Austin, and told her to get it, which she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the purse, and know nothing about the money; what I had was given me by a gentleman, for the support of me and my child.</p>

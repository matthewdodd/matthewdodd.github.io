On 22nd Feb., at a quarter-past three in the morning, I was passing Mr. Jackson's house in the Brixton-road, and fancied I heard a noise in the front garden—I listened, and presently heard a sound of footsteps in the garden—I went in and searched the front premises, but did not see anybody—it was quite dark—I turned on my bull's-eye, and observed the side gate leading into the back pre<lb></lb>mises open, and I saw the prisoner standing at the top of the kitchen steps with a dark lantern in his hand lighted—I immediately secured him, and sprung my rattle—I observed these goods lying at his feet—eighteen books, two tea-caddies, a toast-rack, a cruet-stand, several pieces of waistcoat patterns, a caddy spoon, three table holders, and two pairs of shoes—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Sergeant Merritt came to my assistance, and took my lantern and searched the house while I held the prisoner—while he was doing so I asked the prisoner where his companion was—he said he had just gone round to the front to try to open the front window—before Merritt came back I observed the back parlour window, and the shutters over the kitchen steps were open—that was the nearest window to where I found the prisoner—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found a button-hook in his waistcout pocket, and a pair of stockings in his hat(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

On 22nd Feb., at a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning I heard Warel's rattle—I proceeded to his assistance, and saw him in Mr. Jackson's back garden with the prisoner in his custody—this property was by the area steps—I examined the house and found the kitchen door and back parlour window open—Mr. Jackson came down, and I examined and found the whole of the cupboards and table drawers had been turned out, and the contents turned on the floor—all the property seemed disturbed, ready to be carried off—I assisted in searching the prisoner and observed him throw something away—I afterwards found this duplicate in the garden for a pair of hose pledged in the name of Easton.</p>

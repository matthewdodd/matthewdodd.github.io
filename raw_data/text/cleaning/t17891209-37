            . The 19th of November the window was broke; I was in a little back room joining the shop, and I heard the window crack; as near as I can guess it was eight; it was quite dark; I heard the shop window break; and there was a light in the shop, and I saw something like a person's arm drawing out; and the window was broke, and the shelf all clear facing the square of glass; it was cleared of the shoes that stood before the square of glass; they were red morocco shoes; I cannot say how many pair were lost, but on Saturday two pair were brought into our shop to sell with my husband's writing in them, they were brought by a woman that is in court: the shoes are here: I am sure those shoes were mine; my husband's hand writing was on the bottom and the price they were to be sold at: we had not sold any of that sort for some time back, as red morocco shoes are not so much worn in winter; but these came back tacked together as they are now.</p>

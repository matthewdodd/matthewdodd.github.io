               <p>Q. What was the reason of your going into that house? - A. Knowing them to be suspected characters, I went in to watch; after I was got into the house, I observed

               <p>Q. Did you know John Croson before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you tell that Jury that you knew them to be suspected characters? - A. I did not say so; I said, from the information I received.</p>
               <p>Q. Attend, Sir, and recollect there is such a thing as a prosecution for perjury; upon your oath, did you not swear that Jury, that knowing them to be suspected characters, you watched them? - A. I said, from the information I had of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't your know that they were indicted, and charged with breaking open this house in the night time? - A. I should suppose it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not bound over to prosecute for burglary? - A. I know I was bound over.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there is a reward of 40l. for each of these persons, if they are convicted? - A. I have heard as much, but I don't know it.</p>

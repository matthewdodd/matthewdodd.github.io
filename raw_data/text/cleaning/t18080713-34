            . I am a widow woman. On Friday, five weeks ago. I was on the Hampstead road, I was walking from London to Hampstead; I had a bundle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner - A. I saw him in <placeName id="t18080713-34-crimeloc213">Camden town</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at that public house - A. Yes, he was sitting on the table in the tap room; he asked me whether I was going to Hampstead; I told him I was going; and immediately he followed me after I went out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it - A. Half past nine o'clock; he asked me whether he should carry the bundle for me, I told him no; he pushed me by the arm off the curb into the horse road, and took the bundle from me, he snatched it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he pushed you - did you resist him - A. I resisted his taking the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, he asked you if he should carry the bundle - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he pushed you - did not you push him away - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so before the magistrate - A. No; he pushed me and snatched the bundle out of my hand and ran away; I did not make any noise, because he had a large hammer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this - A. It was between Camden town and Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing in going on to Hampstead - A. No; I met nobody but one gentleman, he was going in a single horse chaise, he took me home to Hampstead; every thing in the bundle belonged to me but the shirt and the handkerchief, and the shirt and the handkerchief were in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again - A. Five weeks afterwards I saw him in Hampstead town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light night or a dark night - A. It was a darkish night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was that man, the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon seeing him cause him to be taken up - A. I saw him on the Saturday at the Coach and Horses, Hampstead, drinking a pint of beer; on Thursday I gave information; I saw him on the Monday again; he was taken up on the Monday morning about ten o'clock.</p>

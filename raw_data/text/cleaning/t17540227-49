On the 5th of Dec. he lay at my house, and went out on the 6th, between eight and nine in the morning; he desired he might lie there till he went to sea, saying he was soon to go. On the 6th of Dec. I missed eight guineas, one half guinea, seven shillings and sixpence in money, and two gold rings, from out of a drawer in the chamber he lay in. Having heard the Prisoner had bought a large pair of silver buckles, I took him up, and asked him how he came to use me so? he answered, he was very sorry for what he had done, and said, he hoped I would make things easy, and his father would make up all things with me. He confessed every thing, how he took the money and rings; he was searched, and only three halfpence found upon him.</p>

            . On Thursday the 6th of Dec. about nine in the morning, I saw the Prisoner cheapening a pair of large silver buckles at Mr. Bond's shop, in Whitechapel parish; after that the same day I heard Mr. Hall had been robbed; then I told Mr. Hall where I had seen the Prisoner buying a large pair of silver buckles; said he, he had no money over-night, for I lent him some. We went to the silversmith's shop, and found he had laid out about two guineas there; I took the Prisoner up on Tower-Hill; I heard him say when I charged him with this affair, he knew what he had done, and hoped I would make things easy. I took him to Mr. Hall's, and charged an officer with him, and he was taken before the justice, there he confessed every thing.</p>

            . I am constable, I was sent for to Mr. Hall's house and took charge of the Prisoner. I asked him, how he came to do this thing ? he said, he was sorry for it, and hoped Mr. Hall would make things easy with him. He said, he had bought a hat, wig, coat, waistcoat, breeches, and buckles with the money he had taken, and had them on.</p>

               <p>I lay at my Prosecutor's house on the 5th of Dec. last, and went away in the morning to my aunt's: she asked me, if I intended to go abroad? I said, yes: she gave me six guineas to buy myself cloaths; she gave me one gold ring, and one I had before; she is dead. I changed away the rings where I bought the buckles; they told me I was to go to gaol, and I did not know what to do, so I owned it.</p>

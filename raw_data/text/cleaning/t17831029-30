             to put some wine down in the cellar, and I saw a man looking over the bannisters, as I stood at the cellar door. My mistress was in the shop. I came up, and he asked me if Mr. Thompson lived there: I said, Mr. Thompson; no: I asked him what business he had there: I saw the salt-spoon lay on the carpet, through the crack of the door in the dining-room, with some salt spilt, which made me answer him so. He then ran by me, and ran out. I then saw the prisoner at the bar in the dining-room, towards the beaufet. When the prisoner came out of the door, I caught hold of his waistcoat, and cried, Stop thief! He turned round, and damned me for a bitch: what did I mean by that? and he hit me three times on the head with a stick. I was obliged to let him go, and he went out; and Mr. Reeves came up, and followed him: he did not come up in time to stop him in about twenty minutes he brought him back.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house besides your mistress, and you, and Reeves? - There was one Mrs. Elton in the next room. The door was shut. She was laid down.</p>
               <p>What is her Christian name? - I believe Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>How did these people come in? - I am sure I shut the door about five minutes before, and they must lift up the latch.</p>
               <p>Might not different people come in and go out from that time? - No.</p>
               <p>The door was not locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the man that was brought back the same man that you saw in the dining-room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing and seeing his face? - I followed him, and saw him after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him in the room, so as to know him again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I have part of the business with Mrs. Smithers, a hatter and hosier. I was down stairs, taking in some wine. I heard the maid cry Thieves! Thieves! We are robbed! I did not come up immediately; then she called again, and I ran up: I ran with other people into Castle-yard. We have chambers in Staple's-inn, over our shop, which is at Holborn-bars. I turned round, and the prisoner turned round, and asked me what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Was he running, when you first saw him? - I did not see: I laid hold of him by the collar; says I, You villain, you have robbed me.</p>
               <p>How came you to think he was the man? - Because I had heard such kind of things; that when they have robbed, they will ask such questions; so I put my hand in his pocket, and found a cream-jug, a pair of salts, a table-spoon, and one salt-glass.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>These things are her property. I have nothing to do with the house-keeping. The table-spoon is marked with R. M. S. in a cypher. There are half a dozen of them. They always stand in the beaufet. I took him back with the things. He had nothing to say.</p>

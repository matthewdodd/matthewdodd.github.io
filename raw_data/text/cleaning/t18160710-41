            . On Saturday, the 25th, I missed some linen, between four and half past five o'clock, from the house-keeper's room; that faces the street, there is an area before it, and it is on the basement floor; there are steps down to the area; the gate of the area is never locked in the day time. I left the house-keeper's room at four o'clock, and the window was shut down; the door was not locked. I then went into the kitchen, and retured at half past five; when I returned again the window was open, and the iron bar was wrenched; it was an upright bar; there was a broom in the room within side the window, on the ironing-board; the handle of it was lodged on the ledge of the window; I knew the broom; it had been in the outer cellar for sweeping the coals up. All the family were in the house at this time; there were two men servants and two maid servants, besides myself. My young mistress was in the house; I am certain Miss Winter was at home, because I immediately went up stairs, and told her; she had not been out all the afternoon; I had not seen her in the house during that time from four to half past five; I had seen her about four o'clock, when I came out of the house-keeper's room; she was not ill, and there was nothing to prevent her from going out. Persons of the family might go into the house-keeper's room while I was in the kitchen, without my knowing it. This bar was wrenched from the screws which fastened it to the wood; the bars were so close together that the broom would not have gone between them. I missed all the articles named in the indictment; they had been placed in such a situation that a person with the broom might reach them out at the window. I saw some of them again; I saw the two gowns on the Monday following, at Marlborough-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen draper, and live at No. 26, Judd-street. On the 3rd of Oct., between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was going home—I was about fifteen yards from my door, and saw three men standing in front of my door—one of them took up a chair, with about 300 yards of gingham on it, and went to the other side of the way—I followed on the same side that I was on, and he was met about seventy yards off by another person—I crossed, and asked what they were going to do with it—they dropped it and ran off—I followed the prisoner, and he was stopped by the officer—I cannot swear whether he was the one who took the goods or the one who met the other—the goods were thrown down by the thief or the man he met.</p>

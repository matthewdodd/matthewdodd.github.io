I told him I thought he did not want to buy; he turned from the counter, to go to the door, and I followed him; as he was on the step of the door, I observed his hand in his pocket, as if pushing something in his pocket; I took hold of his arm and I said, my lad have you got something there, he replied yes, and produced one of my shawls out of his pocket; I took him back into the shop, and sent for a constable, when the constable came, he took him out of the shop door, before he thought to search him, and he brought him in again; on searching him, he found two more callico shawls in his pocket; I saw them taken out by the constable; ther first shawl has the private mark of our shop upon it Y, and a stroke, and then an R; the other two shawls had not that mark on them, but we have the corresponding patterns, which were on the wrapper, which was on the counter at that time; I did not see the prisoner near the wrapper at any time; we cannot tell whether we missed any of these things; but one that was taken out of his pocket, was the only one we had of the pattern.</p>

               <p>I was the constable that was sent for, I examined the prisoner, and found two shawls in his left hand pocket; I have had them in my possession ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Harvey. How many servants might be in the shop besides yourself? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion at the time? - Not till I saw him going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the servant that is in the shop here? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is 9 s. what you gave for these shawls? - It is rather under what I gave for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not above a week in town, I came from America, I asked for an handkerchief of about 2 s. 6 d. and he desired me to wait, at last he shewed me one for 4 s. 6 d. and I told him I would give him 2 s. 6 d. I was coming out and I found a bundle just at the door, I thought it was the two womens that went out before me, I picked it up, and put it in my pocket, and this gentleman called me back, and sent for a constable, I was looking out for a vessel to go home to my people; I belong to the Triumph of Cork.</p>

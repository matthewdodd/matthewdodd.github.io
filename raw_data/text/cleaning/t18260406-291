            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Watch! and I went out of my box - a gentleman, who was going away, said he saw the prisoner put her hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I took her to the watch-house, and found on her thirteen shillings, six sixpences, and half-a-crown - she said she had 1l. 11s. 6d., which her husband gave her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the money in my pocket - it was my own - the watch-house-keeper's wife told the prosecutor not to come in in such an indecent condition.</p>

            . No; there is not a word of truth in it - the prisoner was rather drunk but knew what she was about.</p>
               <p>JURY to THOMAS ASHTON. Q. Do you always carry your money in your waistcoat pocket? A. I had a hole in my trousers pocket - I had a sixpence more in my pocket- she took it all at one time.</p>

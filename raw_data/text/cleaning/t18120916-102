            , Union-row, in the city of London. On the 8th of June the prisoner brought two pieces of dimity. I bought them of him. I gave him ten-pence a yard for them. I afterwards sold them to a person at High Wickham. On the 15th of June, Armstrong and Norbury called at our house. I produced to Armstrong the dimity that I had bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were acquainted, for the first time, that the dimities had been stolen - A. Yes: and in consequence of directions I stopped the prisoner on the 15th of July; he came with a piece of calico, as a sample of twelve or thirteen pieces more. I desired the prisoner to bring the remainder by three o'clock. He came about half past three, and I gave him into Armstrong's custody. He told him that the two pieces I had bought of him were stolen, and I gave the two pieces of dimity into Armstrong's possession. I am sure that the two pieces of dimity I gave to Armstrong were the pieces I bought of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the delivery of the pieces, how long after did the prisoner come in - A. About three quarters of an hour. I told the prisoner that they were the two pieces that he had sold to Mr. Stevens; they were stolen. I asked him, how he came by them. The pieces were then laying on a drawer. He said, he had bought them of a man of the name of O'Hara. I asked him, if he had any bill of them. He said, no; and if he knew where to find O'Hara. He said, no. I then told him, as the things were stolen we must take him to Worship-street office. I took him there, and the two pieces. I took the thirteen pieces I have now in court. I produce the two pieces of dimity.</p>
               <p>- NORBURY. I can swear to one of the pieces of dimity, having my mark on it, and the other to the best of my belief. I am sure one of the pieces of dimity I sold to go to Mr. Emson. It is worth about three pounds.</p>

He said, sit down. I gave him the bill. The amount was three shillings and sixpence. This is the bill. He took a pipe and some porter. He asked me to take a pipe. I remained with him until eleven o'clock. He was not out of my sight five minutes.</p>

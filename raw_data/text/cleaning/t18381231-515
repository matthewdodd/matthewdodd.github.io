                  </hi>. I live on my means, at Eltham. On Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 6th of June, the last day of Greenwich fair, I was returning from Woolwich to my residence at Eltham—I had occasion to go down Well hall-lane—it wanted about twenty-five minutes to eleven o'clock when I was near the farm-house there—I met two soldiers in red coats, dressed as the prisoner is—they separated so as to oblige me to go between them—the one on my right hand wished me good night, and the other struck me with some weapon, which at that time I did not see—I was stunned by the blow, and fell—when I came to myself I found two men over me, one holding his hand over my mouth, and putting sand into it occasionally, and the other rifling my trowsers pocket—I had a purse in my pocket con<lb></lb>taining four half-sovereigns, and at least six sovereigns—there was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in my pocket—when I came to myself the one who was rifling my pocket had not got my money out—he got it out afterwards, and as soon as they had emptied the pocket containing the money, they scam<lb></lb>pered off towards Woolwich—I had a very severe wound in my head, which bled profusely at the time—I had about a mile to walk home from the spot—I heard a clock strike eleven more than a quarter of an hour after this violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine. I went off furlough to Woolwich, on the 23rd of July last, and soon after that I saw the prisoner in the Duchess of Wellington public-house—we had four pots of beer, each paid for two—he said, during the time he was drinking, if he had known I had been going on furlough so soon, he would have given me a sovereign to go on furlough with—I asked how he could give me a sovereign, for he had no more pay than me—he said, "Have you heard tell of the robbery that was committed at Eltham, on the 6th of June"—I said I had heard some<lb></lb>thing about it—he said, "Mind what I am going to tell you, and don't let it go any further"—I agreed that it should go no further than me—he told me that Perceval and he were walking in the Eltham-road, on the 6th of June, and they met a man, and the prisoner said he up with his fist, and gave him a b—good hit on the head—that they picked seven sove<lb></lb>reigns and some odd silver out of his pockets, and made the best of their way to the Black Boy, at Greenwich, and staid there till very early next morning; and the prisoner, Perceval, and two more marines, went to Lon<lb></lb>don, to sport with the money—that is all he said—I kept this secret till very lately, when there was some inquiry made about my being ill-treated, for giving information about something else, and then I made this disclo<lb></lb>sure—I have not had any quarrel with the prisoner—I do not belong to the same mess with him—I did once, but did not at the time of the rob<lb></lb>bery—when he paid for the porter at the Duchess of Wellington, I saw him take a little bag out of his pocket; and when he took the money out he said, "This is some of the money I had of him; it is not half spent yet;"—he treated me with two pots of ale, after he paid for the two pots of porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Justices at Woolwich. I re<lb></lb>member a marine named Perceval being in custody on this charge some time before the 15th of June last—another marine named Norton was a witness against him—the prisoner came forward as a witness on behalf of Perceval—he was sworn, and I took down his evidence, in the presence of the Justices—I produce the deposition which he then made—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Thomas Baker sworn, says—I belong to the 28th Company of Royal Marines—on Wednesday, the 6th of June, I met Perceval, opposite the dock-yard gate, in Woolwich, about half-past nine o'clock—he and I went together on the Lower-road to Greenwich—we went to the Black Boy at first, and there we remained all night—no one but Perceval and I went in—we met some comrades there—I am quite certain I did not leave the barracks with Perceval at six o'clock—I am sure Best did not go into the Black Boy with us—I am sure Perceval and I did not go half-way up the fair, or in it at all—on Thursday we went to London—we walked—I had half-a-crown—I don't know what Perceval had." This deposition was taken on the 15th of June, when Perceval was in custody—he was after<lb></lb>wards discharged—on the 14th of December the prisoner was himself brought before the Justice on this charge—the Magistrate then directed the depo<lb></lb>sition which he had previously made, and which I have just read, to be read over to him, and I made a note upon ft of what the prisoner then said, which is, "The said Thomas Baker declares, that he does not recollect what he then stated"—I should state that the latter part of the depo<lb></lb>sition just read were answers to questions put by the Magistrates, in con<lb></lb>sequence of Perceval's previous statement—and the last four or five</p>

               <p>questions were put by the Magistrate, to contradict Perceval—on the 14th of December, when the prisoner was charged with this offence, he was asked what he had to say, and I took down from his mouth what he said—this is the statement he made—(<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at it)—after it was taken down I read it over to him, and he put his mark to it—he was cautioned by the Magis<lb></lb>trate, as well as by myself not to say a single word to criminate himself nothing was said to him in the way of promise—there were two or three Justices present—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Thomas Baker says—I was going on Eltham-road, on Greenwich Fair night, to meet a young woman, and I went to the side of the road to ease myself, and during the time I was easing my<lb></lb>self a man passed along the road—he appeared as if he had a bag on his back—he did not speak to me nor I to him—I went on the road, and when I came down by the side of the road, I saw something lay by the side of the road, which I walked up to—I could see it was some marines, with waist belts on—one of the men I directly knew at the time I stepped up, and he <hi rend="italic">throwed</hi> his head to me to go back—I did not go back, and weat down on my hands and knees, and looked in on the men—and I say another man right over the man's hips, and I saw it was Norton, and the other man I did not know—I got up and went, and Norton came and ran after me, after I had got some distance, and offered me some money, which I took, and I asked him what it was for, and I told him it was not his money, and that I should have nothing at all to do with it—he took it, and asked me what I was afraid of, and he gave me some silver, and said it was some money his father and mother had given him, to buy some things with—on the Lower-road of Greenwich I met Perceval, and him and me went to Greenwich together—we met Hunt, Jones, and a woman there, and there we stopped, till the policeman came and turned us out—I looked at that gentleman—(pointing to the prosecutor)—Norton told me the other man died at the hospital."</p>

I saw them talking together. They passed me a second time. I saw Wells and Morgan feel several gentlemen's pockets. They at last made a stand behind a gentleman - Morgan and Wells were close to his pocket, and Fowler stood close behind them, and sprend his coat out to cover them. The gentleman had a little girl with him, and lifted her up to see His Majesty pass on his carriage, driving out. Wells then took hold of the skirt of the gentleman's coat, and held it while Morgan

             the handkerchief out - Fowler was covering them all the time. Morgan put the handkerchief into his breast - I seized him, and took it from him. I attempted to take Wells, but he stooped down and slipped under me. I took Fowler, and held one in each hand. I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder, shewed him the handkerchief, and said I was going to take them to Queen-square; he turned round. I called on the people to take Wells; they refused. There were about fifteen regular pickpockets about. A man laid hold of Wells, and Ball came up and secured him. They were all secured without getting out of my sight. My hat was knocked off, and I was hustled. I never saw the gentleman again. W. Kerr, was marked on the handkerchief; but I do not know him, nor who he is.</p>

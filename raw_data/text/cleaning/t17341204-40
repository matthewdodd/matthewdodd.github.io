The Prisoner and two more Men went into the Prosecutor's Shop, and called for a Quartern; one of them held his Hat before the Till, while the Prisoner put a Whale-bone with Bird-lime at the End of it into the Till, and drew out a Shilling; he did so a second and third time; but perceiving then that the Prosecutor's Servant took notice of him, he threw down his Whale-bone, and said it would not do. The other two ran away; but he was taken, and a Pot of Bird-lime, and 2 Shillings limed together were found in his Pockets. In his Defence, he said he was going with these two Men to catch Birds, and they had the Whale-bone and Bird-lime for that Purpose. <rs id="t17341204-40-verdict208" type="verdictDescription">

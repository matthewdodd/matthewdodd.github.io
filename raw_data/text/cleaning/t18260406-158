On the 3d of April I heard a knock at the door - I went, and saw the prisoner, who asked for Mr. Parr; I said he was not at home, but he would not be more than ten or fifteen minutes; he walked in, and sat down, but soon afterwards rang the bell, and said he had to call in the neighbourhood at seven o'clock, and he would return at eight; he went away, and I missed the two spoons, which I had seen within an hour before. I went to the door, and saw him running in White Conduit-street - he was taken shortly afterwards.</p>

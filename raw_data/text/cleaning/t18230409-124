            . I am a constable, and deal in earthenware. I live next door to Barker. On the 28th of February, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was called into my shop, and observed the prisoner and another boy passing over my area rails from Mr. Barker's shop. One of them had the oil-cloth under his arm - they were in company with each other. I went out and turned to my left - saw nobody; turned again, and by that time they had got to Foley-place. I am quite certain of the prisoner - I saw them again in Foley-place. The man who had it was waiting to see if he was followed, and seeing me threw it down and ran off. I threw it into a public-house, and pursued him, but he got off. As I returned I met Barker, and saw the prisoner before him. I secured him; he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

            . I am footman to Dr. Bartlett; I was in Towers's shop - I saw the prisoner and another go up to Mr. Baker's shop and take the oil cloth; the companion carried it away. I told Towers, who pursued; I am sure of him.</p>

I came to town, from Cambridgeshire, on the 24th of November, to look for work - I had nine sovereigns, and 14s. 6 1/2d., in a bag, in my breeches pocket - I had my smock-frock on - I got to London at a quarter-past four o'clock, and went to the Swan public-house, Whitechapel, had two pints of beer, and some bread and cheese - I could not get a bed there under 1s., which I thought too much - I came out and asked a fish-woman in the street, where I could get a cheap lodging; the prisoner was just by, and said she could inform me where I could get one for 4d. a-night - I went with her to <placeName id="t18271206-158-crimeloc839">George-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know any body in London? A. No - I was never in town in my life before - I had left home on the Wednesday night, and walked all the way - I was two days walking - I was quite sober, I am certain - I am married; my wife is in the country, with my brother - I brought the money, as I might want it; the prisoner was not to have slept with me, I swear - I had not spoken to any other women - I had no pork sausages, or any thing after I left the Swan - I had never seen her before; it was about seven o'clock; it was moonlight, and the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who do you work for in Cambridgeshire? A. My brother, who has about forty acres of land, and a farm.</p>

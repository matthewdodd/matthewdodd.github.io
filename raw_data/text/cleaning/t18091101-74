            . On the 24th of October, in the evening, from information I received from the prisoner King, when he was brought to the office, I then went and searched Johnson's father's place in Leather-lane. His father told me the most likely place to find him would be in Fox-court. I went there, and after a little while a woman went to fetch me Coleman. I asked Coleman where Johnson was, he told me he saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010044"></xptr>awhile before near Chick-lane. On my way to Chick-lane I met Johnson; Coleman said, that is your man. I took Johnson into custody and searched him, and found upon him near a shillingsworth of halfpence. I took Johnson and Coleman to the Royal Oak, and then I went to Griffiths; he lives in Black Boy alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they both go by the name of Griffiths - A. So far as I know: I fancy they both lived together. It is a dark alley, and the woman was sitting at the window. When I asked Johnson which was the house, Johnson told me that I should find the man with her. I run up stairs, and they were at supper together. I asked her where the lamp was that the lad had sold her. I asked Johnson who was the person, he pointed out the woman; she denied any knowledge of him, she had not bought any thing of him. At that time the man also denied any knowledge of him. After searching the room, I sent the last witness for a large candle. Opposite to the prisoner Griffiths's house there is a large yard that, I believe a slaughter-man keeps, and a number of sheep were there. There is only a small paling parts the house, and the yard and a low paling parts the yard from the alley. On my searching there, I found the lamp I now produce, and this taper-stand; it was opposite the window where this woman sat in this yard. I suppose the lamp falling on the sheep's back broke the fall, because only part of the foot was broken off.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cole. Look at that wax taper-stand - A. I will take upon me to swear that this is Mr. Fontaine's, it is of the value of 2 s. 4 d. The glass lamp has no mark; I must decline swearing to it; we lost such a one; I believe it is his. At six o'clock there were two in the window, I missed one, it is worth 6 d.</p>
               <p>King's Defence. I was coming past the window on Tuesday; Johnson was standing at the stationer's window, next door. I picked the candlestick up; he said, make haste, follow me. When I got to the corner of Middle-row I lost him. The shopman laid hold of me</p>
               <p>Coleman was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>Griffiths and Buckthorpe left their defence to their counsel; called six witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

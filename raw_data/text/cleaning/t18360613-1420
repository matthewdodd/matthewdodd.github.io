                  </hi>. I live in Reeve's-news, South Audley-street, and am a journeyman saddler. About half-past ten o'clock, on the 23rd of May, I was walking in George-street, Edgware-road—the prisoner came up to me, and attempted to take my watch out of my pocket—I pushed her off and was passing no—she forced her company—I passed on, and after I got a little way I missed my pocket-handkerchief—I returned, and found it in her possession, and gave her in charge of the police—this is it—it has a hole in the border—I had no communication with her, not for half a minute—she spoke to me, and I pushed her off.</p>

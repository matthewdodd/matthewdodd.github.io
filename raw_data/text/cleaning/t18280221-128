I produce these articles, which I got at No. 20, Union-court, Holborn; the prisoner and her mother were there; I found the articles in a bag, behind the bedstead; I charged the prisoner with taking them, and, a few minutes before I locked her up, she requested me to beg the prosecutrix not to lock her up, and to be as lenient as possible.</p>

            . I live where the prosecutrix does. On the 15th of January last, I was going home, and the prisoner walked with me up the New-road; I saw a bit of gown hanging out of her muff, but I did not know she was leaving the prosecutrix; when I went home I stated what I had seen, and these articles were missed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I left the prosecutrix was, because she used me so ill; she is nothing more than myself, a common prostitute; and when I have not been able to walk, she has driven me out in the pouring rain, and took every farthing I got. I wished to leave her, and to return to my mother, and reform my life.</p>

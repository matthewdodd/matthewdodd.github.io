On the 27th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, two waggons stood at our door; one of them was unloading - I was informed that a sack had been taken out of the second waggon - I found the prisoner at the watch-house, with the sack of oats which had been taken out of the waggon. I knew it to be my master's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SALES. I drove the waggon to Mr. Reynolds's door, about five o'clock in the evening - A few minutes after I found the tail of the waggon untied, and a sack taken out - I saw the prisoner at the watch-house with it - I knew the sack.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. On the 27th of November I was standing at the corner of Charterhouse-lane, in St. John-street, with Forbes. The prisoner ran across the road with the sack of oats on his shoulder, about twelve yards from Mr. Reynolds's; he came from that way. I followed him towards the square, and stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030044"></xptr>him - I asked him what he had got? he said it was a sack of oats which he bought from Mr. Williams, of St. John-street. I said I knew no such person - He could not tell me whethere it was a shop or a private house-there is no such person.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORBES. I was with Thompson. He has spoken correctly.</p>

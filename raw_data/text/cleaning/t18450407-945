On the 7th of Jan., about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in company with Withers, and met the two prisoners together in Upper-street, Islington—we followed, and lost sight of them for about five minutes—we were then standing in the Liverpool-road, and saw Brummell coming towards us, on the same side as we were—directly he saw me he started back a pace or two—I then saw Madden close behind him—Bnrannell tried to hide him—as they crossed the road I saw Madden had something under his arm—I pursued them—Brummell saw I was running after him, and turned to the left-Madden turned, saw me coming, and dropped something which he bad under his arm—I did not stop to pick it up, but as I ran by it I saw it appeared to be a doak—I still kept after him—I could not see which house he went into, he escaped at that time, and was not taken till the 23rd of March—directly he was taken I went to Brummell's house, and told him Madden was taken for stealing the cloak—he said, "You might have taken me before if you liked; I saw you on Friday; I thought it had blown over by this time."</p>

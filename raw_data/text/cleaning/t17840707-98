               <p>Then do not tell us? - My master sent me out of an errand one day, and Percival was in the street and he met me, he said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>What did Percival say to you about breaking the house? - I heard the other young man say to Percival, he lives at the gentleman's house where they meant to come and get in; then they both said to me will you say any thing if we get into your master's house; they said no more when Percival was with them, they said they would give me some money if I would not say any thing, I was in bed when they got in, I did not hear them nor see them.</p>
               <p>You knew before that they intended to come? - From what they said to me, but I did not let them in, nor hear what time they came in, there was a cellar window, they asked me if that window was fastened, I told them it was not, I left no other place open for them.</p>
               <p>Was the door of the cellar stairs fastened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the watch and the other things? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Where were you to see them to get the money for holding your tongue? - The young man said he would come to the house.</p>

               <p>Did not he tell you that if you would but confess no harm should be done to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say a word about Percival? - No, I did not know their names, I did not think it meant any harm because the young man is a monstrous laughing young man.</p>
               <p>So they said it publickly in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to say nothing to your master when you went home? - I had no thoughts of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. He certainly stands in the light of an acceslary before the fact? - I had no acquaintance with them in my life, but they often used the house.</p>

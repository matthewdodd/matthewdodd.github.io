On Sunday morning, the 23d of April, I met the prisoner, a little before ten o'clock, near Whitechapel; I had been out with a friend; I talked about going home with the prisoner - she said she would take me to a comfortable place - she was quite a stranger - I went with her - I undressed myself, and laid my clothes on the floor - she took me to a house, No. 54, <placeName id="t18260511-69-crimeloc424">Wentworth-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. When I met him he was quite intoxicated, and he had three glasses of brandy with me. Witness. I had nothing to drink with her; there was another female there at first, when the prisoner said she would take me to a comfortable place.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw a parcel of people together; I heard a man had been robbed in Wentworth-street; I took the prisoner, and had great difficulty to get her to the watch-house; I found two half-sovereigns upon her, and 2s. 3 1/2d. in copper money - she refused to let me look into her hand I believe the prosecutor was as sober as I am.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR re-examined. I got my trousers again - she took my clothes and laid them on the floor outside the door; I saw her drop the trousers as she went down stairs.</p>

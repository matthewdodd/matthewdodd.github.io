               <p>Court. Had you any marks in your books? - These books were not marked, but the singularity of the binding renders them beyond a doubt, I can swear to them, that word Olivet has been lettered under the first lettering piece, owing to a mistake that was made.</p>
               <p>Have you any mark in your books that Mr. Rushton might know them to be yours? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the set? - About four guineas I marked them in my catalogue.</p>

               <p>Did he say how he came by it? - He did not say, he said he was in distress and wanted money, and it was all he had, he was decent, and I did not imagine it was stole, it is valued at two shillings, soon after he came again and brought the first volume of Cicero, he said, he had some more at home, I told him, I could not buy them, unless I saw the whole to know whether it was compleat, for it was a book I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100107"></xptr> acquainted with, I had never seen the book before; he then left the first volume on the counter, and said he would go and fetch the rest, they were in the possession of a young man. In the mean time Mr. Hayes, the prosecutor came in, I told him, and he waited in my back room: when the prisoner Birmingham returned, the prisoner Johnson came with him; Mr. Hayes immediately went out and fetched a constable, whilst I kept them.</p>
               <p>Did they say, when they were there, how they came by them? - No, they did not; Mr. Hayes's friend was in the shop with me, they said they came honestly by them, that they bought them of a man in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Did they both say so? - Johnson particularly said so before the constable came.</p>
               <p>Are you particular in that, that Johnson said they had bought them in Wapping? - He said so in the shop.</p>
               <p>In the shop when they were stopped and apprehended, did Johnson say he knew nothing about the matter, and had nothing to do with it? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Johnson. I bought them in Wapping, and gave eight shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Court to Rushton. Did not you entertain some suspicion when you saw such a man as this bring you some Latin books, how could he come by Latin books? - I did after he was gone, I rather began to think he had stole them, and when he came back again I did not intend to buy them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hayes called on me on the 29th in the morning, I went round with him to the Pawn-brokers, and we called at Rushton's; he informed us as you have heard, and we waited till the two prisoners came in, I then went into the shop, Mr. Hayes went for an officer; I looked at the books, and asked Johnson what he expected for the books; Johnson said, half a guinea; I observed they were Latin, I said, did he read Latin; he said, no, he could not read Latin; I then said they were not compleat, there were other volumes of the work, and it was extraordinary he should have books he could not read, I asked him where he got them, he said, he bought them of a man in Wapping the night before, he said he did not know who he was, he believed he was a smuggler, he bought them in the street; this was merely for the purpose of amusing them till Mr. Hayes returned with an officer, I then expressed my suspicions, that they were not honestly come by, he said he gave eight shillings for them, then Mr. Hayes, came in, and they were taken before the justice. I believe Birmingham was the person who brought the books, but I do not recollect he said a word about them; Johnson was the man that said he had bought them, and described the manner of them before the justice; Johnson said, a man offered him the books in Wapping, and that Birmingham told him they were valuable, and persuaded him to buy them, that he might get something by them; they were there examined apart: Birmingham said they bought them at Wapping, they disagreed in the time, one said they were up at Holborn with them at six o'clock, and the other at ten, they described their lodgings very differently, one said they lay together in the same bed, and the other, that they lodged in the same street in separate rooms.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hayes. What is the value of these books? - To me they are of much more value than to another; I have valued them at thirty shillings, I thought I could not do less.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Wapping, and I met a man accidentally, he asked me to buy these books, he asked me eight shillings, and I gave him eight shillings, I then came home to bed, I sent Birmingham the next morning to see if he could sell them; my sister maintains me at present.</p>

               <p>I carried the books for this man, I thought to dispose of them, Johnson told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100108"></xptr> me he would pay me for my trouble; the first shop I came to, I said, she did not belong to me; I sold the first for eighteen pence, and gave this man the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you sell them for? - For this man, and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Johnson called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

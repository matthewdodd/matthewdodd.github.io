                  </hi>. I live at Austin-street, Blackheath. On the 24th of May, about ten o'clock in the evening, or soon after, I was at New Cross—the prisoner came up to me and asked me whether I was going to Greenwich—I said, "Yes"—he said he was going there—on the way he said he ought to be in barracks by ten o'clock, but as he was over time and had a relation in Greenwich, he should sleep there—when we got to New-cross I was turn<lb></lb>ing down into Deptford—he pulled me out of the path, and said, "That is not your road to Greenwich"—he pressed me against a wall and took my watch, which was in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—he tore the pocket out altogether, took the watch, and ran away down a turning—I kept him in sight till we came to the bottom of the lane, where there is an elbow, and there I lost sight of him—I have seen the watch since—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not go into any public-house with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines. On the 24th of May, about half-past eleven at night, I was in High-street, Deptford—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what the prosecutor said, I spoke to a policeman, and went with him to the Prince Regent public-house, and saw him take the prisoner—when he came out three or four yards, he put his right hand into his pocket, pulled out a watch, and threw it behind him—I took it up and gave it the policeman—this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the policeman present when he threw it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was charged with robbery before he threw the watch away—I was on duty at Deptford at that time—I have seen the prisoner about the barracks for about four years and a half.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) In consequence of information, I went; to the Prince Regent public-house, saw the prisoner there, and told him I wanted him—we went out together—I had hold of his left hand—I saw his hand in his pocket—he pulled it out, and I heard something gingle in the channel, and Wood picked up the watch—the prisoner then said, "I know nothing about the watch"—he was not quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

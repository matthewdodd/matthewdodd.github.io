                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Charles-place, Union-street, Lambeth; lama shoemaker. The prisoner lodged with my father three weeks—on the night of 2nd Jan. the prisoner slept in the same bed with me—I awoke in the morning, and found him over me, stabbing me with a short shoemaker's knife about the body—that awoke me—I straggled with him to try to get the knife from him—after that he stabbed me again; I cannot say how many times, six or seven times after I got up—I subsequently found cuts on my person—the wounds were afterwards examined by a surgeon—this one on my left wrist has done me great injury—I have not been able to work since—this was a very serious wound under my left ear, and this was a serious one in my right ear—much blood came from them—I got thirteen or fourteen wounds alto<lb></lb>gether—he stabbed me six or seven times before I got off the bed—he held me down with one hand and stabbed me with the other, and after I got out of bed he stabbed me six or seven times more—I ran down stairs, and when I came down my father was there in his shirt—I said, "Father, he will murder me"—I made my way to the door—the prisoner was up stairs when I opened the door, and he got a light and followed me, with a light in one hand and a knife in the other—I had had no quarrel or words with him—the assistant to Mr. Wagstaff, the surgeon, attended to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness. On the morning of 3rd Jan. my wife awoke me—I got up and saw my son on the step at the bottom of the stairs, covered with blood—I saw the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowing my son with a knife in his hand, and a candle—my son said, "Father, father, he has been murdering me!"—I went, met the prisoner, and stopped him—I said, "What have you been doing"—he said, "Your son annoyed me ever since I have been in the place"—I said, "Why did not you tell me?"—he went out, I followed, and gave him into custody—I saw my son's wounds; I fetched a doctor.</p>

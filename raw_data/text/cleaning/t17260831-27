             thus depos'd. I was got drunk, and was going home to Cats Hole in St. Catherines. In my Wastecoat Pocket I had got a pound of Hair in a Bladder, and a Pocket Book, a Pair of Gloves, and a Handkerchief in the other Pocket; and so coming under Aldgate, I saw the Prisoner Isabel Lucky before me, and I gave her a Tap upon the Shoulder, and ask'd her where she was going, and she said a little farther, and so she walked sometimes before me, and sometimes behind, till she came to <placeName id="t17260831-27-crimeloc133">Goodman's-Yard</placeName>

Well, says she, what will you give me now. Why indeed my Dear, says I again, I have got no Money at present, but if you'll oblige me so and so, I'll make ye Amends the next Time I see ye, for I live but a little Way off. Truly, says she, I can do nothing without ready Money, for I can't afford to trust. - Indeed my Dear you must for this once. - Will you be as good as your Word then? - Yes indeed I will Child. - Well then if I must, I must, and so, Sir, I laid her upon the Ground, for she was not afraid of daubing her Cloths, because she was then in as dirty a Pickle as she is in now. But however as foul as she was, I can't deny but that I did commit that filthy Sin upon her, and just in the Heat of Action, she cry'd out, The Watch, the Watch is a coming, get away and shift for your self. So I got off, and turn'd my Back upon her, and put up my Breeches, but the Watch not coming, I went to the Porch and felt for her there, but she was gone; then I felt in my Pockets, and found that all was lost. Well, says I, to my self, The Bitch had robb'd me, she has taken away every Thing that I had about me; my very Hair and Bladder and all, and I am an undone Man! So having no body to make my Apology to, I e'en walk'd home in that Condition. When she was taken, she said that she did not take the Things out of my Pocket, but found them in the Porch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Messrs. Thomas Webster Harby and James Harby, rope-makers, in Bromley-lane. They have a great quantity of tar-barrels about their premises—I counted them at six o'clock on Wednesday afternoon—there were then thirty-two; and next morning, when the constable came, there were but twenty-six—I know the prisoners by seeing them about Poplar.</p>

On Thursday, the 5th of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the three prisoners at the bottom of Grundy-street, Poplar, loading tar-barrels into a truck—they were about three or four hundred yards from the prosecutor's premises, across two gardens—Hatch and Kerr were about putting up the last barrel when I saw them—Brisley was holding the handle of the truck—I had two other constables with me—we watched them down Dock-wall, and, consi<lb></lb>dering they were going to the premises of Mr. Turner, a purchaser of tar<lb></lb>barrels, at the Orchard-house, we went another way, through the East India Docks, and came upon them about thirty yards from Mr. Turner's premises—I took Hatch, and brought him to the station-house—I asked where he got the tar-barrels—he said he had bought them of a carman the night previous—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you ever see him before?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Whereabouts did you see him?"—he said, "In the Commercial-road; I had been to town that afternoon, to deliver some coals in St. Mary-Axe, and I saw a wagon, in East India-road, as I was coming home, with tar<lb></lb>barrels in it; I asked the carman whether he would sell them; after some few words he said he would; I offered him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; when I got op<lb></lb>posite the George the Fourth public-house, Kerr came up; he paid his part, and we had the tar-barrels, and took them to this place where you saw us loading them, and there left them till the morning, when you saw us"—I took Hatch and Brisley's shoes off, and went to the place where I had seen them loading them, and, in the garden of a man named Barrett, found some slight traces where persons had been walking—I then went into Mrs. Douthie's garden, which joins the prosecutor's premises, and which had been recently dug up for the purpose of sowing seed—pieces of the fence were broken off, and all the way up the fence were foot-marks which corresponded with those shoes—Hatch's shoes are very remarkable, they have no heel, and flow over the side—one of Brisley's has no heel, and the other only a bit of one, which could be discerned in the foot<lb></lb>marks—the tracks went close up to the fence where the tar-barrels were taken from—this was on Thursday morning, the 5th—after tracing them up to the fence, I went into the prosecutor's premises, and saw the foreman and Rogers—Rogers afterwards saw the barrels at the stationhouse, and identified one which he had taken the mark of the night previous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor. Holmes came to me on the 5th of March, while I was at breakfast, and in consequence of what he said I looked, and missed some barrels—I missed one which I had taken the head off from the day before—we always break the heads out as clean as possible, not to waste any tar, but this head was so fast in that two little bits remained at each side, in consequence of which a little tar had drained off, and there was the mark of the tar—I went to the station-house, and saw six barrels in a truck, one of which was the one with the two little ragged bits, which I had taken particular notice of the night before, and when that barrel was turned out it happened to be the very one of which Rogers had taken the copy of the mark—I saw the officers compare the shoes—it was a soft loamy soil, very fine, and without any stones in it—there had been a slight frost over night, which made the ground crisp at the top, and the impressions of the shoes were almost as perfect as if they had been taken in wax—one shoe in particular, with only half a heel, I never saw a more perfect one—and there were the prints of the tar-barrel hoops, as they were rolled along the ground from our premises to the place where they were loaded—there was also some dirt at the place where they were thrown over the fence, and there was a sort of tressel close by the place, which would make it convenient to get them over—I have known Brisley fifteen months—he bore an honest cha<lb></lb>racter—he supplied me with coals.</p>

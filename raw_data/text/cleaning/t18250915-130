He followed me down Russell-street, and asked me to have something to drink - he called for a quartern of rum; we went on further, and he called for another quartern; we then went to the house - he paid 1 s. for the room, and then gave me the snuff-box, and said he wanted to get home, but he would call the next evening, and give me something else; he walked down stairs with us, and came to Hart-street. I said the box was of no value to me - he then gave charge of me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New North-street, Red Lion-square. About three or four o'clock on the 9th of November, I was Uodgate-hill, standing with a friend, looking at the procession, and just as the Lord Mayor's carriage passed, the prisoner, who had been standing by the side of my friend for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, all on a sudden brushed by, when the crowd turned after the carriage, and at the moment I lost my pins—I had a fall-down stock, and two pins attached to each other, with a gold chain—one had a diamond in it—was in the fall-down part of the stock—the prisoner put his hand underneath my chain, so that I could not see him do it, but it was snatched by somebody—It was not fastened round my neck—by taking hold of the chain, he could draw out both pins.</p>

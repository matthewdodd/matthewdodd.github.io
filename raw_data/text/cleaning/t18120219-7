The Black Horse, is in Aldersgate-street. As soon as ever we went in the house, I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out the notes; I said Harry, I will not be worse than my word, I promised you two one pound notes, and as such I will give them to you, he then called for something to drink, and I laid my head upon the table, we had something to drink; after that we came out in the street, and we were a good while in the street together, till we got just by the end of Long-lane, there I stopped, by the end of <placeName id="t18120219-7-crimeloc41">Long-lane</placeName>

            . I perceived Mr. M'Donald laying upon the corner of Long-lane, and I awaked him. The prisoner came up, and said, is this you M'Donald, he said yes; the prisoner said I will never leave you until I see you safe home, stop while I go and fetch a coach to take him home; he was gone about two minutes, and returned back again, and laid hold of his two thighs to lift him up, he put his left hand into his right-hand pocket, and pulled out some papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did this - A. The prisoner, and turned about and went up the street, and left me there with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of M'Donald - A. I got him down upon the White Bear Bench, in Aldersgate street, and there he went asleep, I saw him about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted that you saw M'Donald home when you saw him so drunk - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What inducement had you to wake him - A. I saw him lay there, and as I came up, the prisoner came up immediately, and said, M'Donald I will never leave you until I take you home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you there ten minutes or more; as you found Mr. M'Donald so you left him - A. I did not think that Feast came there to rob him; I thought he was coming as a friend to assist him; I thought that as Mr. Feast had taken the money he would return it the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When for the first time was it that you transferred this friendly act of Mr. Feast into a robbery - A. I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket and take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. M'Donald was very drunk - A. He was sensible, he could speak if anybody spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it - A. Between four and five o'clock; I am positive it was before five; I do not think it was soon enough for a man to travel to Esdaile's and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. You found M'Donald as drunk as a man could be - A. He was in liquor. I never saw a man much worse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long were you at the corner of Long-lane - A. I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell any thing that happened to you while you were there - A. I cannot particularly, I could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what became of your notes - A. No, I could not. I did not find it out till I went to put my hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. M'Donald gave me two notes, and the next morning I found the twenty pound note instead of a one pound; I went to Esdaile's to get change for the note, thinking to give M'Donald nineteen pounds out of it; and I should have given it to the son had not he bore a very loose character, and I thought he would not return it to his father.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

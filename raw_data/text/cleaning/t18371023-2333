                  </hi>. I live servant with Mr. John Bartie of Gloucester-place. About half-past eight o'clock in the morning of the 22nd of Oc<lb></lb>tober, I heard the key of the clock fall off the chimney-piece in the hall where the clock is kept—I was in the kitchen—I ran up stairs, and saw the key and the clock were gone—I ran out, and saw the prisoner Brown at the top of Gloucester-place, and Pace was running in the field—I had seen them together about twenty minutes before, loitering about I pursued, and called, "Stop thief"—they neither of them had the clock then—I saw them taken into custody—they had jumped over the paling to get the clock—the prisoners were taken in about half an hour—the clock was taken up in the road that they ran—I am sure I saw them before, and when I saw them taken I was sure they were the same—there were four of them in all—a man with two children, who was crossing the field, picked up the clock—the one that had it must have thrown it into a ditch—I saw a man with a basket running before me, but he is not here—I lost I sight of him—this is my master's clock—there was some dirt on it I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay-cutter, and live in Kentish Town. I know the prosecutor's house—on the day in question, I saw four persons come over the field out of Maiden-lane—(I was getting some water out of a pond when they passed me, about seven o'clock)—about half-past eight I heard the cry of Stop thief—they had kept lurking about the same place—I can only swear to Brown, whom I caught before the young woman came up—I asked him what he had been doing—he said he had been doing nothing—I said, I shall hold you till such time as I see "—I held him, and the servant passed, but during the time I was holding him, he offered me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to let him go—I told him I should not do any such thing—I held him till the servant and the mistress passed with the clock—they said they did not intend to do any thing with him—I let him go, and then the po<lb></lb>liceman came and asked what was the matter, and he took him again.</p>

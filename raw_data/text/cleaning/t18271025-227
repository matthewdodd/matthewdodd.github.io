               <p>JOHN RODDAM. On the 24th of October I met the prisoner on Cock-hill, Ratcliff-highway, and went home with her; I was quite tired, and could not get on board my ship; I gave her 2s. for a bed, and went to bed with her in her room: I put my watch under the pillow; and when I had been there some time, I awoke, and missed it; I got up, and alarmed the house; the prisoner answered me from up stairs, in the dark - I asked her for a light; she came down in the dark, and wanted to persuade me I had not lost a watch; I called a watchman, who found it on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not with another woman? A. No, I was with nobody but her; there was another woman in the house, whom I took for the mistress.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the cry of Watch! I went to the spot with my fellow-watchman, and the prosecutor said he had lost his watch; I questioned the prisoner - she said she knew nothing about it; I said I must take her to the watch-house, and she said she would go with me: she went up stairs - I darkened my lantern and followed her, and saw her take the watch from her bosom - I then caught hold of her arm; she then said she would give it me, if I would not take her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Cannon-street. On the morning of the 23rd of January I was in Long-lane, Smithfield, about half-past ten o'clock, and met two very suspicious characters, who attracted my atten<lb></lb>tion by dodging me and looking me in the face—they almost ran against me, and at the same time I felt a slight twitch at my pocket—I turned round quickly, and saw my handkerchief in the hands of the prisoner, who appeared in the act of passing it to his companion, but it seems he did not—there were two of them behind, and two before me—I col<lb></lb>lared him, and took him into the shop of Mr. Lucas, a druggist, in Al<lb></lb>dersgate-street, I sent for an officer, who searched him, and said nothing could be done with him, but he would lock him up—I was not satisfied, and said he should go before a magistrate—I remained about half a minute in Mr. Lucas's shop, when Bennett brought the handker<lb></lb>chief in in his hand—I am sure the handkerchief I saw in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand was mine—I could not swear that from the view I had of it, but he had one in his hand, which appeared to be mine, in<lb></lb>stantly after I felt the twitch at my pocket—I had used it not half a minute before.</p>

I followed the prisoner after he was taken into custody, and observed between his thighs part of a silk handkerchief—there was a hole in his trowsers behind, and this hand<lb></lb>kerchief was hanging out of it—I took it from his trowsers, and took it back to the prosecutor, who identified it.</p>

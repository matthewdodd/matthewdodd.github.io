Upon the 5th of November last I received an information from Mr. Nobbs, that a box was directed to town to Mr. Massey, that he had reason to believe it was lodged at his mother's house. I went with him to Mr. Fielding, and took out a warrant to search the mother's lodgings, which I did with Mr. Holland. I was down in another room with the sister of the prisoner

            . At the time Mr. Holland found the money, I was called up, and Mr. Holland shewed me the money. I asked the Girl whose property that money was; she told me it was her mother's. I expostulated with her yery much, and told her the circumstance of the five-guinea piece. Mr. Holland searched farther, and found a 60 l. note and the twenty-five-guinea note; then she confessed these were a part of the things taken out of her brother's box, and that it was taken out by her mother's direction, and put into her box. Here is a letter; I am not positive whether I took it out of her box or out of her pocket; it is a letter from

               <p>Directed to Mrs. Seagood, Well and Bucket court facing St. Luke's church, in Old-street.</p>
               <p>I took the daughter into custody, and directed Mr. Gee to stay till the mother came home, and bring her to Mr. Fielding, which was done; when the mother came, she denied knowing any thing about the spoons and rings, and seemed in a great agony of mind, and desired she might be hanged with her son, or words to that purpose; she was in a great consternation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard about the spoons and ring at that time ?</p>
               <p>G. Holland. We did not know whether they were in that house or not, but as the other things were found, it was reasonable to suppose these were concealed somewhere; the mother, as I said before, denied the knowledge of the rings, and it came out from the daughter, she was in another room; they were examined separate. When Mary was sent for to be examined, she said, they were in the lodging of her mother. I did not go the second time to search.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holland. Did you hear the mother declare at any time, of her knowing any thing in relation to these goods?</p>
               <p>G. Holland. When before Mr. Fielding, she said her daughter took them out of her son's box by her command.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take out?</p>
               <p>G. Holland. The plate, the cash, and the notes.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper to the carrier these goods came up by, the Rose and Crown in St. John's street. On the 30th of October, there came up a sack and a pair of boots, directed for Robert, or Mr. Massey, I cannot say which, there came two or three women for the goods, and asked for them in the name of Seagood.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the persons?</p>
               <p>R. Murrall. I cannot be sure. I told them there were none; they came again in the evening, and not asking for them in the name they were directed, I would not let them have them. I sent them in the morning as directed; they were directed to Mr. Massey at Mr. Seagood's. I sent them to Seagood's in Old-street, and I had two shillings brought me back for the carriage; that is all I know.</p>

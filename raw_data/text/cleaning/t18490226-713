                  </hi> I am a furniture-dealer, and live in Westminster-bridge-road. In March last year I was a customer of Messrs. Woods', of Watling. street—I produce an invoice of four square carpets, which were brought to my house from them on 30th March—they did not suit me; they were the wrong colours—I produce a delivery-order which I got when I delivered them up the next day, I think to Albert, it was to Messrs. Woods' man, who came for them—they were four square carpets in separate pieces—after that I saw no more of them.</p>

                  </hi> I come now out of Newgate—I was formerly carman to Messrs. Woods', of Watling-street—I was convicted in Oct. last for robbing them, and sentenced to be transported—Albert was a porter in their employ-. I know William Burt, he kept a shop in Elm-street—I do not know that he had any other place—he sold carpet-cuttings, and bags and cushions—he worked for Messrs. Caldecott, in Great Russell-street—I have seen him it Messrs. Woods, once or twice—he knew Albert—I do not know whether he had seen him at Messrs. Woods' warehouse. On 30th March, 1848, I took some carpets to Mr. Beagle's, this is the entry of them in this book—it was made by a lad who made the invoice—on the following day, the 31st, I brought away from Mr. Beagle's, four square carpets—Albert was present, he was in the cart at the time they were received in the cart—we drove to Elm-street, where I gave the carpets out to Albert—I then drove to the bot<lb></lb>torn of Mount Pleasant, and stopped at a public-house—I do not know whether the measure of the carpets had been taken before they were given to Albert—I waited at the public-house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—Albert and William Burt then came—we had some conversation, and had something to drink, and William Burt told us to call up on Sunday morning—Albert and I called on the Sunday morning—we saw Mrs. Burt, and re<lb></lb>ceived from her 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all we were to get for the carpets—I do not recollect whether her husband was present at the time—I am not certain whether Mrs. Burt paid the money to Albert or to me—I had 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Albert the other 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had some conversation with Albert about how he should manage the carpets at the warehouse—he said he should take a sheet down into the cellar, and put four carpets of the same size in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor, and live in Laura-place, Clapton, in the parish of St. John, at Hackney. On Saturday night, the 26th of Aug., I went to bed about twelve o'clock—before I did so I went down stairs, to see that the house was secured—I was called up next morning about half-past seven o'clock—in consequence of what my servant told me, I went down stairs, and examined the basement floor—I noticed an inner door, at the foot of the stairs, communicating with a passage—the street-door is at one end of the passage, and the door leading into the garden at the other end—I had bolted that inner door, top and bottom, when I went to bed the night before, and placed an iron bar across the centre—that door was lined with iron—the lower panel of that door was bored in eighteen places, as if with a centre-bit, and the iron bar lying on the ground—that door communicates with a win<lb></lb>dow and door at the end of the passage—I found a square of glass cut out of that window, and the door open—that was the door leading to the garden—I cannot say how that door had been fastened the night before—I did not ob<lb></lb>serve it—that door had become considerably warped at the bottom by heat—it stuck, so that if hastily opened or forced, it would shake the bolts, and make a considerable noise—on the lower panel of the door I saw large black marks or daubs, and also on the door-posts at the side of that panel—it ap<lb></lb>peared to me as if a sooty knee had been pressed against the bottom panel, for the purpose of gently opening the door without making a noise—these marks were on the inside of the door—it appeared to me that that was the mode by which the parties had got out—I afterwards went into the garden, and on the border found some of my dishes and basins, and this iron bar, which belongs to the larder window, was on the gravel walk—I went to the larder, and saw that the wire-work by which the window is protected was torn away—that wire-work faces the garden—I found this bar was torn away, the removal of which would enable persons to get into the house by means of the larder—the window is about twenty-seven inches long, and twenty-one high, and communicates with the kitchen, and the kitchen with the house gene<lb></lb>rally—it is all under one roof—I missed an electrotyped silver teapot from the kitchen cupboard, and a plated toast-rack, also some pewter spoons, and a few kitchen utensils—this is the teapot and toast-rack—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had seen and used them on the Saturday morning—they were then perfect, but are now broken—I went up stairs, and missed from the dining-room mantel-piece a gold watch and two silver snuff-boxes—the watch had been on a pe<lb></lb>destal, beneath a glass case, which I found by the side of the pedestal in the morning—I went into the drawing-room, and found it in disorder, but missed nothing from there—I went into my breakfast room, and found my desks lying topsyturvy on the ground—they had been removed, but I missed nothing from there—I afterwards discovered the footsteps of apparently two persons on the border, in the back garden—I could see the marks of shoes in one impression, and the other appeared to be made with a foot without a shoe—they were rather slight, and close against the wall—it was not distinct enough to enable me to say whether the person had stockings on or not—I gave information to the police—the value of the property I lost was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>house—they were going towards town, in a direction from the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house, walking very quickly—Messenger was carrying his left-arm close to his side—I thought there was something wrong, as I saw him not work both his arms as he walked, and I pursued them—I met a brother constable, communicated my suspicions to him, and he went in pursuit of the prisoners, while I took another direction, to intercept them—when I got into London-fields, I found Clifton in custody of Bingo and Brennan—I went on in pursuit of Messenger, but did not find him—when I saw them together, I noticed that Messenger had no shoes on, and was dressed as a sweep, with sooty clothes—I afterwards examined the prosecutor's garden, and on the border, underneath the wall, I observed the foot-marks of two persons, one with and the other without shoes—I only saw one impression without a shoe, and that was the left foot—some pieces of brick had been recently taken down off the wall, as though some persons had been getting over.</p>

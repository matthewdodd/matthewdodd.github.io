There were the prisoner and another girl sitting. I went out to make water, and they followed me. They had seen me change a guinea in the house. I put my change in my waistcoat pocket. They began to hussel me up, and make love to me, and cuddle me about; in the mean time the girl at the bar picked my money out of my pocket. I saw her as she was taking it away, and felt her hand in my pocket. She got it out. I grappled about her, to see if I could find it. She gave it to the other girl, and she put it in her mouth; but I took and squeezed most of it out again. I got a guinea and nine shillings in silver again. I brought the prisoner into the public-house, and got a constable and secured her.</p>

               <p>Lang. I had a guinea and a half, and nine shillings in silver, in a silk purse. I saw the other girl take it out of the purse, and put it into her mouth. This was a good creditable house I had been in.</p>

            . I was the constable. In searching the prisoner, I found a silver watch concealed in her stocking, near her shoe; it was going, and near the time about eight o'clock. She said a man gave it her for lying with her.</p>

               <p>We went into that house to have a pint of beer, and there came three men in. This man forced his discourse to a little girl that sat by me. He went out, and she followed him. She asked me to go with her. He lay with her. I stood about ten yards distant. After that he said he was robbed by that girl, and he squeezed the money out of her mouth. I never set eyes on the money.</p>

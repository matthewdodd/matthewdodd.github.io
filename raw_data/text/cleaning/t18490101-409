Last Thursday afternoon, I was in a public-house in Charles-street, Hatton-garden—the prisoner came in with a bag on his shoulder—he placed it on a form, and called for a glass of something to drink—I said, "Martin, ia that you?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What have you got in the bag?"—he said, I could look if I liked—I looked, and found it was books—I said, "I thought you might have turned tea-dealer"—he said, no, he worked for Mr. Wilson, of Liquorpond-street, and he was sent with the bag to 20, Hatton-garden, and that I could go along with him, if I liked—I went, and just before we got there, he said he was getting an honest living then, and he hoped I should not go in with him as the parties might think he had been in trouble before—he went into Mr. Rowland's, 20, Hatton-garden—he came out in half a minute without the bag—I said, "You have left it"—he said, "Yes, it ia all right"—I said, I was not satisfied, he must come back to the shop—he refused—I took him back—the foreman said he knew nothing about it, but the prisoner said, "It must belong to you, I found it at the door"—I took him to the station, and on the way he said, be supposed I should be the means of giving him a new year's gift, and that he was the last of the gang—the public-house may be 300 or 400 yards from 20, Hatton-garden.</p>

            . I called at the manufactory about twenty minutes after nine on Sunday evening, the 31st of July. We have two entrances to our manufactory, one a carriage entrance, the other a private entrance for the men to enter the workshop, about two yards from each other. The moment I put the key into the lock of the door where the workmen enter. I heard a great noise; I did not go in; I enquired who was within two or three times, and receiving no answer I called out for assistance. In a short time two men came up; one informed me he was an officer; he begged me not to open the door until he got farther assistance, conceiving they were desperate characters within. He went for assistance; the other remained with me. A few minutes after he was gone two men rushed out of the carriage entrance. We pursued them. The prisoner Godden I secured in Fore-street, about one hundred yards from the manufactory; we lodged him in the Compter; and on our returning we met the prisoner Williams custody; he was taken in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know they are the same men you saw come out of the manufactory - A. I do not; I have every reason to believe they are. I lost sight of Godden, for a moment; he was walking when I stopped him she was pointed out to me by every one that knew him. When I stopped him all the things in the indictment were missing. The property was found on the staircase, ready to be taken away. It consisted of a portable desk: that was mine; it contained brass work and and wire, my father's property. I believe the prisoners to be the persons.</p>

            . I was coming down London Wall; I heard Mr. Rolfe call for assistance; I assisted him.

Godden I kept sight of I was close behind him when he turned out. I ran by the side of him in Fore-street. I never lost sight of him. I pointed him out to Mr. Rolfe; he took him into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday night, the 31st of July, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock; I heard the cry of watch. I immediately ran to the spot where the voice came from; young Mr. Rolfe said there was somebody in his premises. I went immediately to get another officer. As I was returning with the officer there was a cry of stop thief. The prisoner Williams was running towards Moorfields. I got sight of him just as he turned round Moorgate. Williams is the man I pursued. A man after him on horseback. I am sure Williams is the man I was pursuing. Another man stopped him in Moorfields; I came up just as he was stopped. When I got up, he said do not hurt me, I wish I had not taken to this way. I took him to the watchhouse, and searched him; he had only a few halfpence about him. I took him to the Compter, and returned back with Mr. Rolfe to search the warehouse. When we opened the door, there were a great many things tied up in different bundles. This chisel was laying against the bundles; here are two skeleton keys that laid close to the bundles. This key opens the warehouse door; this opens another, and here is a handkerchief; he had no handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140018"></xptr>round his neck when I stopped him; this handkerchief contained some doe skins.</p>
               <p>Godden's Defence. I was at home at half past five in the evening; I had occasion to go towards the Tower. On my return home I came through the Church-yard, and up Fore-street, in my way home to Golden lane.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. On my going round London Wall, I heard the cry of stop thief; I followed the thief; he made his escape; he kept crying out stop thief. Some gentleman stopped me: he said, he must take me back, and see, he had no doubt I was the man.</p>

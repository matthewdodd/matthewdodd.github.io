                  </hi>. I lodge in Silver-street, in the house of Mr. Pollard, but he does not live in the house—there are three lodgers—I occupy the two parlours on the ground-floor. On the 4th of November I left my room about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning, and locked the door—I returned about eleven or a little after, and found my room-door open—the street-door is always open—I saw the prisoner in my room standing against my drawers—he had a black bag in his hand, which he was filling out of the drawers—he moved away from the drawers and went round the table—I took him by the collar and said, "What do you want here, you vil<lb></lb>lain?"—he directly said, "D—your eyes, you b—, what do you want here?"—I said, "I will let you know"—he directly hit me on the side of my head and knocked me down—I got up, took him by the front of his shirt, it tore, and he got away—I turned round and caught him by the tall of his coat—he pulled me nearly to the door—the tail gave way in my hand, and he got away from me—I followed him out at the door, and hallooed out, "Murder, stop thief"—I went on to the Green, but was exhausted and could not halloo any more—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bag away by the Three Kings public-house, in the Close, and he was taken—I am sure he is the man I had seen in my room—he was taken to the station-house—the bag was opened there, and contained the articles stated—I had had them to mangle for Mr. Bridges.</p>

I was in Silver-street, Clerkenwell, on the 4th of November, and saw the prosecutrix running after the prisoner—I ran after him myself, and saw him throw down this bag—I afterwards saw him stopped by a man, and as he was being taken towards the station-house I saw him throw away three keys.</p>

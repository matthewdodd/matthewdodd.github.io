               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner? - A. When he took the silver from me, I ran after him a little while, and then I was afraid to go further after him; I am sure the prisoner is the person who took it from me.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pocketbook-maker, and live at No. 44, Jewin-street. I was at work when I heard a cry of, stop thief! I did not think of going down, for I knew it was a boy's voice, till I heard him cry out, murder! then I ran down stairs, and turned to where the voice was. I saw the prisoner turn into the Crescent; I met him at the other end of the Crescent, as he was coming out, and the boy after him; the boy cried out, that man has robbed me; I made way for them; the prisoner came out first, and just as he came out there was a light, that I could see a bag in his left hand; I pursued the prisoner, and got hold of his coat just as he got to the top of Jewin-street, and the flap of his coat came off in my hand, which made me stagger. A gentleman was crossing the road; they met each other, and the gentleman and the prisoner both fell down; I did not lose sight of the prisoner. After they both got up, I met my father's man, and told him to lay hold of the prisoner, because I had only my slippers on; I walked behind them till the prisoner was taken to the Bull's Head public-house in the Crescent, Jewin-street, Mr. Atkins was sent for and a constable; when Mr. Atkins came, the prisoner was taken to the Compter. When I laid hold of the flaps of his coat, he threw the bag of silver from his left hand; a woman picked it up I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dark at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him throw the silver away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop and pick it up, silver is worth while picking up? - A. I thought it was best to pursue him.</p>

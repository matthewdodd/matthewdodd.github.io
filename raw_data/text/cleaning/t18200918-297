The Queen's carriage came up; there was a very heavy pressure from the crowd; two females were before me, who cried for assistance; while my hands were up endeavouring to protect them, I felt something at my pocket, put my hands down and missed my pocket-book, which was safe a moment before; the prisoner was close to me; I instantly seized him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You scoundrel, you have taken my pocket-book!" two men immediately seized him and asked me to let him go, but I held him. I found they were officers and I gave him up to them; one of them immediately pulled my pocket-book from his breeches.</p>

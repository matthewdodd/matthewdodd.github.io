               <p>When had you seen it last before? - The same morning; I left it about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any-body in it? - No, nobody; I returned to it again at about half past nine o'clock; as I was going in at the gates, I found two boards pulled off from the paling that goes round the garden, that was not done when I left it; I opened the gate and went in, and there were some long stakes laid across the gateway, I knew they were not there when I left it; I went into the house and struck a light.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - Yes; I looked about and saw there was a hole broke out, from the stable into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How large was the hole? - I cannot say, but it was large enough for me to go in and out, but not quite so easy as I could wish to do; after I perceived that, I was terribly frightened, for I did not know but there might be somebody in the house at that time; I went up stairs, and found my master's things all thrown about the floor in the dining-room, the drawers and scrutoire broke open, two knives, and a screw-driver which was broke, on the ground, all the cupboards up stairs were open; I went back immediately, and told my mistress of it; she desired me to return again as quick as I could; I went and took a man to stay all night with me, and that is all I know about the matter.</p>

               <p>Did he come with the woman before? - Yes, he stopped in the passage while she came to me; I paid her no more than half a guinea.</p>

            's, No. 7, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>What is Bragg? - A receiver; I was sitting there with Vandebus and Everard, and they told me they had done the house facing the Jews-harp-house, in Marybone-fields, and had got a great coat, and a pair of boots, which I saw in their possession, from that-house; Vandebus bought the coat and boots of Everard for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with them relative to this robbery? - No, only they told me that, and that it was done of a Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Vernon's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Vernon's house opposite the Jew's-harp-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of doing a house? - The meaning of it I suppose is the robbery.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you at what o'clock in the afternoon? - Yes, between four and five,</p>
               <p>Was any body in the house? - Nobody that I know of; they did not tell me whether there was or not.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing else? - Yes, I went with Gregory and Mrs. Vandebus, to Mrs. Lynus's; he went in, and I staid at the door; Gregory came out, and shewed me half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Vandebus go into the house? - No not when I was with her, she and I sat withoutside the door of the next house.</p>
               <p>What did she come for? - To get the money to carry to her son.</p>
               <p>Where was her son? - In trouble.</p>
               <p>How in trouble? - In gaol; he had been in gaol about a week.</p>
               <p>What had the son to do with this habit? - Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know from her or from any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120072"></xptr>body else, where this habit came from? - Gregory said it came from the house opposite the Jews-harp-house.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you when it came from there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did she go with you? - Because she was to have the money to carry to her son.</p>

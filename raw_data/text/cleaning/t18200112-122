On the 9th of December, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I put these things, with the breakfast things, in the housekeeper's room, in front of the house - the area gate was left open. A painter, who works opposite, came down and asked me if I had lost any thing? I then went into the room, and missed the cream jug and spoon. He said the persons went down the mews by the side of the house. I went after them, and found the three prisoners together in the New Road. I said,</p>
               <p>"Young men, you are wanted at No. 19, York-street, where you have just come from." They said they did not know where it was. I said I would shew them. Butler instantly ran away - the other two said they would go back with me. They turned down North-place and ran away. I called Stop thief, and pursued - a gentleman came up, and Bailey was taken. I had him brought back to the house; he at first denied it, but afterwards said he had not got the property, but Bridges had it, and that he lived in Gee's-court, Oxford-street - I gave him in charge. I am sure all the three prisoners were together. About half-past six o'clock that evening Marrebow brought the property home to us.</p>

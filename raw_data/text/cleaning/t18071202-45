            . I live in Winfield-street; I get my living in the street, selling things in a barrow and on my head; at four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 24th of November, I was looking out of the window; I saw the dray coming along, it stopped there; I saw the prisoner with something in his hand at the lock, at the money box of the dray, it looked bright as a knife; he was trying to get the lock of the till; the till was of the of side of the dray; the drayman came along, the prisoner went away; the dray stopped again, the prisoner went to the lock again, and got it off; after he got it off, he chucked it into a waste bit of ground, that was fenced in; he came back to the till, and took a brown bag from the till, he held the bag in one hand, and the weight of it on the top of the other; after he got the bag out, he walked by the dray till he came to the fore-horses head with the bag, and then crossed the road; then after that he crossed the road again, right facing the turning where he lived; and after that the brewer came out and the woman of the chandler's shop, and I said that was the man that took the bag out of the till; I said to him that George Slashem, has took the money out of the till; the brewer went to look after him, it occasioned a mob about the dray; the brewer went and collared him; he said you have got my money; he made answer, me you b - r, got your money, if you do not let me go, I will knock you backward; he gave him a blow on his breast and knocked him backwards; the brewer immediately he got up he was going to collar him again; I persuaded him not to touch him any more, least be should get a mischief done him; he said he would do him a mischief if he touched him again; the prisoner had a knife drawn in his hand. The next day I went to the chandler's-shop where the brewer stopped with his dray, I saw two officers; I told them if they went over to that ground, they would find the pad lock, where he had chucked it over; accordingly they did find it there, where he had chucked it over.</p>

On Tuesday the 24th of November, this young man came to my house, and said he had been robbed; he seemed to be crying; I went with him to Winfield-street and made some enquiries; I was informed who had robbed him; I went in search of him different times that evening; I could not find him; I was informed the next morning that he was in the Compter; I applied to the lord mayor; they had him there, for what I cannot particularly say; the lord mayor asked me if I had a witness that see him do the robbery; I replied no; he was remanded till I could bring a witness; I brought the witness; this witness told me where the lock was thrown over, I went and found it. I produce it.</p>

On the 7th of December I told her she should go; when she was gone I missed a sheet and three pairs of shoes from a box in the room she lodged in - these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEE. Q. How do you get your living? A. By shoe-binding; I have one other female lodger; I never lent her things to pawn; I met her in the Old Bailey after this, and I said, "Oh, Ellen, how could you rob me so?" she said, "I never did;" I said, "Give me the ticket;" she said she would pay me, and I promised to forgive her; I have had no quarrel with her since; we went to a public-house and had a pint of beer, which I paid for, because it was so cold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to take her up? A. She did not come at six o'clock, which she had promised.</p>

               <p>SARAH WELCH. The prisoner came into my room, and said if I would let her stop there and have her breakfast she would give me these shoes to pawn; she said she had bought them at a shop on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the public-house? A. No, I am on good terms with the prisoner - I did not say if she would give me money I would not appear here; it is not a fair question to ask whether I was ever here -I was tried here about fifteen years ago, and acquitted.</p>

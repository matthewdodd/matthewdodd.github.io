               <p>CHARLES LEAKE. I live at Witney, in Oxfordshire. On the 8th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was walking up <placeName id="t18270712-233-crimeloc1274">Holborn-hill</placeName>

In the course of a minute or two a gentleman passed me, and said, "I think you have lost your handkerchief;" I felt, and it was gone. Immediately after the patrol came up, and said, "I have got your handkerchief, and the person who took it." I saw him with Mansfield, in custody.</p>

            . On the 8th of June I was going down Holborn-hill with a gentleman, and saw the two prisoners following the prosecutor - Mansfield made an attempt at the bottom of the hill, but the gentleman took his handkerchief out, and used it. I then went on the opposite side of the hill, and saw them go up to the prosecutor with another person - the other two covered Mansfield while he took the handkerchief out of the pocket, and ran down the hill with it - I pursued, and took him with it in his hand; and as we were taking him to the compter I saw Peaugh, and secured him. I knew them both before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PEAUGH. Q. Will you swear I was with the other boy? A. Yes, you were.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MANSFIELD'S Defence. I stood at the end of Field-lane; two boys passed me, and dropped this handkerchief - I took it up, and the man took me.</p>
               <p>PEAUGH'S Defence. In going up Skinner-street a man came and took me.</p>

            , being engaged in the East-India service, went into the shop of Mr. Hounsom, for some patterns of ginghams and calices, and knowing Mrs. Newland, I made use of her name, in hopes of being used better: when we went into the shop we saw nobody but Price and another man; Price came up to me; I informed him I came from Mrs. Newland, of Clapham, and wanted some patterns of gingham for jackets and tsowsers; he made answer, they had no ginghams in the house; in the mean time Mr. Hounsom came into the shop; Price informed him who I came from, and what I wanted; Mr. Hounsom said, he would get some patterns, and send them in a Penny-post latter to Clapham; I said, they were not to go there, but I would call for them; he said, he would get them ready by four in the afternoon; I told him, I would call for them about that time; I went to the India-house, and called for the patterns about the time appointed, and saw the same two men in the shop; Price informed us the patterns were ready, and desired us to walk into the counting-house, which we did; Price went up stairs, and came down and delivered the patterns, with Mr. Hounsom's compliments; Williams asked Price for a sheet of paper, and the loan of a pen and ink; accordingly the paper was produced, and we were desired to walk into the counting-house, which we did, and Williams proceeded with writing his letter; Price was in and out several times while we were in the counting-house, and we were not there above ten minutes; I am positive, the cambrick was not taken while we were there; nor could be taken without his seeing it; and it was not missed till the Tuesday following; can Mr. Hounsom swear, that between the 11th and 16th, that Williams was not in the shop or counting-house, or with any other person besides me? or that he had not been there by himself? or can Price, when he is out about his master's business, can he say who has been in the shop? can a man, by seeing a person only once, swear that Williams, who was there with me, was not there at any time after? my Lord, may this impress your Lordship's mind, and the minds of the merciful Jury; we parted that evening, and I went on my way to the Haymarket: on the Monday afternoon Williams called upon me, at my lodgings, by Merlins'-cave, and begged of me to let him leave the piece of cambrick; he said, that he was going to take it to his uncle at Copenhagen-house; he left my apartment, and I have never seen him since; on Friday, Price, and the constable, Allen, came to me at the Merlin's-cave, I came to the door with them, and Allen said, I had better go to my apartments; he said, he had a search warrant to search them; I said, he was welcome to search any apartment I held; they found this piece of cambrick on the table, and Price took and put it in his pocket; they searched my trunk and chamber, and found nothing more; they told me I must go with them to Guildhall, because Price was going to take it to his master to see if he could swear to it; I told them I had no objection; as we were going along, in Cold-bath-fields, he took the piece of cambrick out of his pocket, and I put a mark upon it; that I might know it again; is it to be supposed, gentlemen, that if I had known the cambrick to be stolen, I should have been so ready to have my apartments searched, and having it marked, unless I was in hopes of being able to find Williams? that I shall leave to the determination of a Jury, where mercy will always prevail, and reason is always studied. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, after I had put the mark upon the cambrick, Price then left us and went to his master's alone with the cambrick in his possession, while the constable (Allen) and myself proceeded towards Bow-street, instead of Guildhall; that my friends were all disappointed when they went to Guildhall and found me not there; I might have had friends to have bailed me out; if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060012"></xptr>they had not so disappointed me at Bow-street; I gave every information in my power, that the constable might have found Williams, if he had not heard that the cambrick was found; Williams could have heard it was found, and has never been heard of since; I told the Magistrate the way in which I came by it; my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Hounsom could then find a private mark; Mr. Hounsom then said, that if I would tell him where the cambrick was, he would not hurt me; I told him I did not know, but if Williams was found, there would be a likelihood of obtaining it; that I was an entire stranger to it; and that if he had taken it from the counting-house, it must have been taken at some other time, I was a stranger to it; I was fully committed for trial; then Mr. Hounsom told me he was obliged to prosecute me; but he would do any thing in his power for me; and if I wanted any thing, if I would write to him, I should have it; I received a letter from him, in which he promised me 5s. a week, and desired me to send my wife for it any time after twelve o'clock, which he did; he desired her to call every Monday; he allowed it me for two weeks running; and one Thursday Mr. Hounsom visited me in prison; I asked him if he had heard of Williams; he said, no; he would make him suffer if he could find him; I asked him what I was to do upon my trial; says he, if you take my advice, which is that of a friend, when you are arraigned, plead guilty, that will save a great deal of trouble, and I will intercede for you; I told him I could not do that, for I should be injuring myself, but I would consider of it; he left me; on the Monday I sent to him for the gratuity which he had been so kind as to allow me; he stopped it from that time; and the only reason I could give for it was, that I would not plead guilty when I was arraigned. My Lord, and Gentlemen, I hope what I have said may have some pressure upon your minds, in favour of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar, one young in life; and, Gentlemen, the heavy losses and expences that have attended me, and my losing my former friends, and throwing disgrace upon my character, have turned their backs upon me, that I have been unable to employ counsel; I trust to your Lordship, where mercy abounds, and to that Jury, where mercy is ever shewn to an unfortunate prisoner.</p>

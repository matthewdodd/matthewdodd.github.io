               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he dealt with you? Perhaps two or three months? A. I never heard of his having three shops - he never mentioned the name of Chesney to me; I knew he was doing business in Regent's-park barracks; he had a bakehouse there once - he never told me Chesney had told him Duff belonged to the 17th Light Dragoons - I never heard Chesney's name; I attend the Corn-market once or twice a week, but never saw the prisoner; since his apprehension, I have heard that he was carrying on business in Blackman-street; I saw him three or four times after the bill became due, and lost sight of him some time before quarter-day.</p>

            . I am beadle of Aldgate ward. On the 10th of December I received the prisoner in charge from Mr. Brook, who charged him with uttering a forged bill; he said, "Mr. Brook, you need not give charge of me - if you will step on one side, I will make it all right;" Brook said he should do no such thing, and told me to do my duty; the prisoner said it was very hard and very strange of Mr. Brook; that he had an opportunity of seeing him several times on the Corn-market, and on one occasion he met him in the New-road, and he nodded his head to Mr. Brook, who nodded to him again; I found twenty or thirty cards on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say "I am surprised at this - I thought the bill had been paid?" A. He did not, nor did he say, "I must pay the bill, because I know I am liable to it."</p>

            . I am chief clerk to the Magistrates of Marylebone-office. I produce a book, in which I took notes of the examination of the prisoner; I took down what fell from his mouth; neither threat nor promise were made to him - he said, "I am in the habit of dealing with Mr. Brook; the bill came into my hands through Mr. Chesney, of Carnaby-market - he took it of Duff; Chesney said,'You may rely on its being good' - I gave him 10l. and the residue of the bill; he did not endorse it - I did not request him to do so; I paid it to Mr. Brook - I have repeatedly seen Mr. Brook since;" this was on the 11th of December - On that day week he was again examined, and said, "I unfortunately did not get the man Chesney to endorse the bill - the man that paid me the bill."</p>

            . I have been a Sheriff's officer - I am out of any thing now: I have ceased to be a Sheriff's officer for two years. I sold bread for the prisoner at No. 166, Drury-lane till the end of October, or the beginning of November, 1830; I knew a man named Chesney - he lived up by Carnaby-market, and was selling bread for the prisoner in the same way as I was, between St. Giles' church and Tottenham-court-road; he died in the Marshalsea prison six months ago - I know this bill of exchange; I have seen it in the hands of Chesney - he brought it to me to discount it for him about the month of June, 1830, I think, but I cannot be sure; we were very intimate at the time - he was at my shop almost every day; he told me if I would get it discounted for him, that it was drawn by an officer in the army, accepted by an agent, and made payable at a banker's; I told him when he called on me a second time I could not do any thing with it - his answer was, that he could get Mr. Darby to do it, but he owned him 15l., and he was afraid Darby would stop the 15l. out of the bill; this bill is exactly in the same state as when shown to me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you a Sheriff's officer, or a follower? A. I was an officer's man two years ago; before that I was an officer - I had some business of my own, and took it to what officer I liked: I have had a sufficiency to maintain me for the last twenty years - I have ceased to be an officer five years - I may go to Serjeant's Inn three or four times in a Term; I never hired sham bail; I have hired persons to put in bail above, when I was an officer - they had half a crown each.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this bill was in the same state when you saw it in Chesney's hands? A. Yes; I was examined before the Magistrate - I have not said that Carew's name was on it then; I was looking at the body of the bill - I do not know whether Carew's name was on it or not when I saw it in Chesney's hands; I might tell the Magistrate that that name was not there when I saw it - I do not know that it was not there; I swore at the officer that it was not, and it was not - I paid the prisoner so much out of every loaf; I sold on my own account - I kept the shop; I had a halfpenny out of every quartern loaf, and sold two hundred a day, perhaps; a man named Williams lived in the house; Chesney sold in the same way, as far as I knew - there was no name over either shop - Chesney was about a twelve months at the shop, and left about October, 1830; I sold for the prisoner till the beginning of November - I saw Chesney about three weeks before his death; he lived up by Carnaby-market, and he lived there when he was selling for the prisoner, and before the prisoner left off business - I should suppose the prisoner knew where to find him; I did not hear the bill was forget till the prisoner was apprehended - I have not seem Chesney with the prisoner since 1830; he could be found at any time before he died - I know he was in the Marshaleoa a long time before he died; I did not know Duff - Chesney told me he was in the army - I have not been arrested for the last ten years- I saw the prisoner in Wheeler-street once or twice in 1830; Chesney lived in Carnaby-market till he was taken to the Marchalsea, but he was out in the country, and he told me he had been hopping; I swear I sold bread on commission for the prisoner in October, 1830 - I do not think he left his shop in Regent's-park before the 29th of September - I think I sold bread for him after that.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you sold bread for him in October? A. I am pretty sure I did; I remember his disposing of his business in Edward-street - his wife was out of her mind at that time, and went into the country to her friends; I saw the prisoner in the Corn-market early in 1831 - he used to call on me when he came to town; I had no reason to suppose he was keeping out of the way -I did not know

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner go to in the country? A.

            . I am a cheesemonger and live in Portpool-lane, but did live at No. 31, St. Mary-street, Hampstead-road, when the prisoner became a lodger of mine, which was in the middle of October, 1830 - I had known him a very little time before; he brought in some furniture, and was there about six weeks; he took his family into the country, but always boarded with me when he came to town - his family were with him just when they came in; he was there in July following, once or twice a week (July 1831) - Mary-street is near Regent's-park.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are sure it was in October,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030087"></xptr>1830? A. Yes, quite; about the middle I think, but am not positive - I cannot swear he did not come before the 30th of September; Mary-street is about seven minutes' walk from Regent's-park - he remained six weeks before he took his furniture away, and he came backwards and forwards till July - I do not think he was away four days together from October till July; after his furniture was gone he slept next door, and boarded with me - he carried on no business in town; he was backwards and forwards in the country on business - when he went into the country he did not come home for two or three days; he never told me he had received a forged bill from a man named Chesney - his family went into Suffolk; they were about six weeks in my house, but his wife was not with them, till the day he took her to the country - he has four children; I went to St. Pancras parish for a strait-waistcoat for his wife in October, 1830.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not come to you before the 30th of October? A. Not to my knowledge. I once saw his wife and she was almost delirious; that was about the middle of October - I do not know Carew; I knew the prisoner when he lived in Edward-street - he came to my house from there; his brother married my wife's sister - I never heard him talk of Chesney, nor of Duff; I do not believe he was ever away seven days together, for if he went away, he left word that if any body wanted him he should be in town in three days - I cannot swear he did not come to me before the 29th of September; he brought his goods to my house about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you reason to believe he was avoiding or shunning any body? A. None in the least - I went round the neighbourhood with him to collect debts.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever see Chesney in his company? A.

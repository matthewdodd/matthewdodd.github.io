On Thursday last, about twelve o'clock, as I was at work, I observed the prisoner at my glass case in the street. Having lost things out of it several times, I ordered my boy to go out into the street and watch her, and I went on the other side the shop, and saw her fingers several times in the glass case; she lifted the case up at the corner several times. I saw a silver chain drawn out, and saw her grabble it with her fingers. I went to a constable over the way; he advised me to take her up, which I did, after she was got into Bartholomew-Close. We brought her to an alehouse, and my maid and the maid there searched her, but found nothing upon her. There were two other girls with her; but whether they belonged to her, or she delivered the things to them, I know not. I missed four silver chains which were in the case not an hour before, and some seals.</p>

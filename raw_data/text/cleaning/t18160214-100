            . I am a broker and salesman; I know the prisoner at the bar; I received from him a duplicate of a clock, about a fortnight before last Christmas. I afterwards went after the clock to the pawnbrokers, in Charlotte-street, Rathbone-place; it was Mr. Daubrise's; I got a clock there, and afterwards I pawned the same clock at the same place; I gave the duplicate to the pawnbroker when I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140063"></xptr>deemed it. Afterwards when I pawned it again, I gave the duplicate to the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner had been in my employ two or three years I look at this clock. It was mine, It was in my own room. I had bought it for my private use, but had not used it. I did not miss it until I had received some information. I got it from Daubrise's. I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of the clock, and he said, he was sorry to say he did. I then asked him where he had pledged it, but he would not acknowledge. I had a subsequent conversation with him, in which he acknowledged having given the duplicate of the clock to Cohen, and getting it back again, and where he pledged it. I also lost a picture. It was of some value; I should not like to have parted with it under 100l.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper. I was at the top of St. Andrew's-hill, and saw the prisoner in company with another person, step up behind the prosecutor, and take the handkerchief from his pocket; I immediately raised a cry of Stop thief! and told the prosecutor of it - I pursued the prisoner, and saw him throw the handkerchief from him; he got out of my sight - I saw him in custody in about ten minutes, and was quite positive that he was the same person; his companion got away - there was no attempt to take him; I am positive I saw him take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket - it was picked up by somebody, and given to me; I gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Highgate. I was sent for to the Woodman public-house, at Highgate, on Thursday the 2nd of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner—the landlord told me he had been calling for liquor, and had been throwing a great quantity of money about in front of the bar—the prisoner was very much in liquor—I searched him, and found these two canvass bags on him—in one bag was twenty-three sovereigns and eight half-sovereigns, and in the other was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I did not find a£5 note—I found 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on him, and about 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver loose in his pocket, and a half-sovereign—in searching him I found a coach-ticket, which has on it, "Mr. M'Quillan, out to Liverpool, by Star coach, paid 2 and on the back, "From the Angel Inn, Islington"—I asked the landlord if he could lodge him—he said no, and I took him to the Wrestlers, and got him a bed for the night—I went to him next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, and asked him how he came into possession of so much money, and was <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> it about in that careless sort of way—he then told me the money was all right enough; I need not be afraid of him, it was money he had worked hard for—I said, "Well, I am not at all disposed to believe what you say; I shall not give up the money till I take you before a Magis trate"—he then told me he had lent his brother 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two years ago, that his brother had paid him, and he was then on the road to Ireland"—he said his brother was James M'Quillan, a baker, No. 122, East-street, Lambeth-walk—I took him before the Magistrate that morning, and went to the Angel booking-office, and then to the prosecutor, who came before the Magistrate—he gave his evidence, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

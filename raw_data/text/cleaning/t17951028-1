             with the sack on his back; it was not a whole sack of flour, there was about a bushel in the sack, worth about fourteen shillings; I see him bring it out on the 15th of September, about one o'clock in the morning; he brought it out of my bakehouse; I caught him with it in Bridewell walk; I see him bring it up the steps out of the bakehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you let him go before you took him? - No further than I could cotch him; and when I laid hold of him he dropped the sack off his back.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from your door when he dropped it off his back? - It might be about fifty yards; that was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when you laid hold of him? - Yes, I called him a bad fellow, and told him I thought he would not have done the like; not only that, but I told him I thought it was not the first time; the answer that he made was, he hoped that I would let him go; and begged that, I would. I called out which I for a considerable time before the watchman came up; the patrol came up first, and I gave him in charge of the patrol; and afterwards the watchman came up, and I lifted the flour on the watchman's back, and he carried it to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has kept the flour ever since? - I have in the sack. The sack belongs to the miller; but I have the papers when the flour was delivered in to me from the factor. I had two parcels, and I know the sack was delivered into my bakehouse in one of the parcels, by the papers, but I cannot say in which load. The sack is here, and the flour is in the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the sack in your bakehouse - I see it that day before I went out. It has the same mark as on the paper, T. S.</p>
               <p>Q. Now all this, I understand, to have been proved against one of the prisoners, Skowin; what have you to say against the other,

               <p>Q. Then all that you can say is, that Davis was in the bakehouse at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that these sacks were marked by the miller's mark, that miller serves a great many other bakers, as well as you? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body concerned with you in your business? - Nobody in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. You usually work at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there is nothing uncommon in a man's being in a bakehouse at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280004"></xptr>night; his business calls him there? - It does.</p>

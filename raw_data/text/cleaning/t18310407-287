            . I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 29th of March I stopped the prisoner in Maiden-lane, Islington, at half-past nine o'clock - I saw her before I stopped her, in company with a young man, who had this bundle under his arm; he gave it to the prisoner, and they separated - she came on, and he staid in the road; they had not seen me or Harris, who was with me - the prisoner then came on, and as soon as she got sight of me, she dropped the bundle; the young man ran across the fields - this is the bundle, it contains the articles stated; they were wet when I took them.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was with King, and took up the bundle - the prisoner said she knew nothing of it, and that she was one hundred yards from it, but she was not more than five yards from it - she said she knew nothing of the young man; but the next morning she said she was in company with him, and had some conversation with him about some money for some shoes - he goes by the name of Daddy Lee - that was the name she expressed.</p>

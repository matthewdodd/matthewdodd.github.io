               <p>On Tuesday the 14th instant, a man came in for an ounce of tobacco, he asked for Oroonoko, I said, we had none, then he asked for Virginia and herb, for he could not smoke all Virginia; then two more men rattled at the door, and came in while I was weighing the ounce of tobacco, and three more came in, and there were three bags of tobacco on the counter, and they took one; I called for assistance up stairs, and four of them run out of the shop, I pursued up Fenchurch-street, and was returning by the corner of Philpot-lane, when I met the prisoner with a bag of tobacco upon his shoulders, he was out of sight about five minutes; he attempted to get away from me, he threw the tobacco upon my head, and got away from me, I cried stop thief! and he was stopped again in Philpot-lane, he got away again, and was taken on Dice key; I know he is the same man by his clothes, and his face, there was a lamp and a silversmith's shop open, with a strong light, I put the tobacco at Mr. Stevenson's, a fruiterer, in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. How long did you lose sight of the person that you suppose to be the prisoner? - I cannot tell; I suppose about ten minutes in the whole.</p>

Currie's; and to one of the firm he made the same statement he had made to me at the public-house—I then took him to the station-house, and found on him a key that opened a box which was pointed out to me by Mr. Shelton, at his coffee-house, in Sparrow-corner, Minories—I went there in consequence of inquiries, not from any information I received from the prisoner—I found these papers in the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found a register-ticket on Nicholson.</p>

                  </hi> I reside at Stonehouse, near Plymouth, and keep an account at Messrs. Currie's, Cornhill, and have done so thirty years. The prisoner was in my employment till the end of Aug., 1846, as footman, for about nine months—he always passed by the name of Powell—I discharged him—some little time previous to that I was at Cheltenham, and there missed some checks from my check-book—I charged the prisoner with having signed a check of mine, and discharged him after arriving at Stonehouse—I wrote to my bankers, and told them that I had missed checks from my book, and in consequence of this I changed the colour of my check-book—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one of the papers found in the prisoner's box</hi>) this is part of a check upon Messrs. Harris and Co., the Nevy Bank, at Plymouth, where I also have an account—the part that has my signature has been tore off—this is a cancelled check—I signed my checks on that bank in the same way as my checks on Currie's—this is not my writing <hi rend="italic">looking at the forged check</hi>)—it was not written by my authority or knowledge—the signature is something like mine, but the beginning is not—I never saw the prisoner write—I am not a ship-owner at present—I know nothing of Nicholson—(<hi rend="italic">The check being read was dated Feb.</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1848, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed John Ingle.

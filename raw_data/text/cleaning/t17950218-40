            How old are you? - Fifteen. I am a shop lad to Mr. Levick. On the 17th of January, Saturday night, between the hours of five and six, as I was putting up the bars of the shutters, two boys came and enquired the way to Houndsditch; I perceived the prisoner at the bar going into the shop; I immediately left off conversing with these two boys, and was going into the shop to see what the prisoner wanted, and as I was going into the shop the prisoner was coming out with a piece of callimanco in his hand, which I believe to have laid on the counter; as I was going to collar him he enquired of me whether it was paper; I immediately seized him, and the moment I seized him he threw the piece of callimanco down into the shop, and he tried to get away very much, he dragged me into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the callimanco? - Yes, the constable kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get away? - No, he did not get away, I had him committed.</p>

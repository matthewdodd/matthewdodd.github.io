                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live at 13, Crown-court, Whitechapel. I know the prisoner—he is a gun-maker by trade, and lives at 4, Boar's Head-court, Petticoat-lane—on 19th Feb. I was working for him there—I knew the deceased, his wife—I saw her go out that morning, between ten and eleven o'clock—her husband was then at home—she did not tell him what she went out for—they had bad a quarrel that morning—she did not come home till about half-past five—the prisoner was then at home—she stopped down the court, and told the people to call him a child-killer—when she came to the room, be asked her where she had been to—she said she had been to her mother's—he said, "Well, if you have been there, let us be comfortable, and have a comfortable tea, and I will give you a drop of wine if you will be comfortable with me"—she said, "Well, go and fetch it," and he went with a stone bottle—he came back with some wine in it, and a sweetbread—the deceased poured some of the wine out into a cup, and drank it—the prisoner was frying the sweetbread in a pan on the fire, and had a knife in his hand; and while he was doing it she told him she had been up to the Court to get a warrant against him, and he said, "You b——r, you want to swear my life away," and he stuck the knife in her, somewhere between the breast and the shoulder—she cried out that he had stabbed her, went down-stairs screaming, "He has stabbed me!" and ran into White<lb></lb>chapel—I went after her—a gentleman came up, and she was taken to a doctor's shop two doors from the corner of Petticoat-lane—after she had been to the doctor's, the street-keeper took charge of her—I then returned with Sergeant Barnes to my master's house, and found the prisoner there as I had left him, sitting on the opposite side of the fireplace to where his wife had been sitting, finishing his tea—she was sitting down at the time she was struck—I pointed out the prisoner to Barnes, and he took him into custody—he then had the knife in his hand, cutting some bread—it was the same knife he had had while frying the sweetbread—Barnes afterwards came back, and took the knife—I had seen the deceased in the morning, sharpening the knife on an earthenware pan, and she said she was going to cut her throat—that was after they had been quarrelling—the prisoner said, "Do it," and then he took the knife away from her—the prisoner was sober when he used the knife—I have lived between three and four years with the prisoner—the deceased was a sober woman—her name was Charlotte Lovee—I saw her body at the Inquest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital. On 19th Feb., at seven o'clock in the evening, the deceased was brought there—she was in a state of partial collapse, and was bleeding from a punctured wound on the right side of the neck, about an inch below the jaw—she was very much exhausted—it was such a wound as might have been produced by a stab from this knife—it was about three-quarters of an inch long, and about three inches deep—she lived till the 27th—when she was first brought in it did not appear a mortal wound, on account of the slight bleeding—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of her body, and the cause of death was inflamma<lb></lb>tion caused by the wound—the wound completely transfixed the larynx, or gullet—it did not pass through the carotid artery, but so close to it that it was to be seen pulsating—there was an extensive abscess on the opposite side of the wound, which was the result of the inflammation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk at Worship-street police-court. I remember Mr. Hammill, the Magistrate, going to the London Hospital on 20th Feb., and seeing the deceased, Charlotte Lovee, there—there was an examination taken—nothing had been before said by the deceased as to her expectation of recovery—the prisoner was present—the statement was the result of questions by the Magistrate—I took it down from her lips as she gave the answers in the presence of the Magistrate—it was then read over in the prisoner's presence, and she then put her mark to it.</p>

               <p>met him coming down the court with another man; I told him I had been to Arbour-square, and had seen Mr. M'Kenzie, to get a warrant for him; he said, 'If you want a warrant I will give you getting a warrant.' I afterwards went to a public-house, and had a pint of fourpenny ale with my husband, and we both went home together, and I got tea ready, and he went and bought a sweetbread and some wine, and I was frying it at the fire, and just as I was about to pour out a cup of tea he said to me again, 'Where have you been?' and I said, 'Why, Lovee, I will tell you the truth; you had beaten me so in the morning, that I really did go to the police-court for a warrant.' He said, 'Oh, you did go to the police-court, did you?' I said, 'Yes,' and I saw something go to the right side of my neck; I felt no pain, but blood immediately flowed from my neck; and as he was taking away his hand from my neck I saw the little white<lb></lb>handled knife in his hand, and I said, 'Oh, he has stabbed me!' and I ran into Mrs. Salmon's, and then to the doctor's, and then two respectable men brought me here in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.

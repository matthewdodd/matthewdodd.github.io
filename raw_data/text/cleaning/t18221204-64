            . I live in Northampton-place, Kent-road. On the 22d of November, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the South side of London Bridge, going home - my handkerchief was safe in my outside pocket on Fish-street-hill. I did not miss it till I saw it in the possession of Forrester, who held the prisoner by the collar. He said he did not take it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw Mr. Gelder on <placeName id="t18221204-64-crimeloc349">London Bridge</placeName>

The prisoner and another person were following him - I watched them for five or ten minutes. Mr. Gelder stopped once or twice on the bridge, and they stopped also at a little distance from him, and when he came near the Surry side, where it was being repaired - there was a railing up and the passage is narrow. I was on the opposite side, and saw the flap of Mr. Gelder's coat drop - I could not observe whether it was the prisoner or the other who took the handkerchief, as a carraige passed. A small piece of the handkerchief was out before - seeing it was gone, I crossed and saw the prisoner tucking something into his trowsers, (I have seen him about before) - I took hold of him; he was attempting to get it out of his trowsers, but I seized him, and took him to Mr. Gelder, and took the handkerchief out of his trowsers.</p>

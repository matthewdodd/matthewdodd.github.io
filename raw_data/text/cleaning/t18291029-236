               <p>JOSEPH CASSELL. I am a headborough of Bethnal-green. One Wednesday night I met the watchman, and went with him and the inspector to Ann-street - the door of this house was fastened; it is not inhabited - we got through another house and into that; we looked into a cupboard in a corner, and saw a hole in the cicling; we got into the hole but found nothing - the watchman found the prisoner on the roof.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIERCY. I am a watchman. I went to the house, and got through the hole on the roof; I saw the prisoner dragging his legs from the ceiling to get on the roof - I went and took him, and found this knife laying by his side in the gutter - the lead had been cut and turned up for three or four feet; I charged the prisoner with it - he said there was no one there then, but the other had made his escape out of a window - and I heard a window thrown up at the back of the premises; the prisoner said he got up there to lodge - there was nothing on him but a small penknife.</p>

On the 11th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I was walking on the footpath, and saw the prisoner snatch a pair of corderoy trousers from Mr. Sheath's door-post - he put them under his arm, and ran away as far as Water-lane; I then lost sight of him - I saw him again on the following day, before Mr. Mores, the Magistrate; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you tell what they were, it being so late? A.There is a lamp over the door.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL SHEATH. I keep the shop. On the 12th of March this little girl came and told me something - I looked and missed a pair of corderoy trousers, which had been safe ten minutes before, hanging at my door; I saw the prisoner the same night, and gave charge of him.</p>

            . Water-lane is about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop, in a straight line - Gaines could see him all the way; it leads down to the bridge - he was seen to come back from the lane to the Three Tuns, which is one door from the prosecutor's, and there he was taken; I found a few halfpence on him.</p>

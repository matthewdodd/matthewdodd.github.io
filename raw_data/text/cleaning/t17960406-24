               <p>Q. Whose coats were they? - A. Two livery coats belonging to Sir John Leicester, and the other a regimental coat belonging to me; we go out of the servant's-hall into the cellar; I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never employed him about the house? - A. No; he had a pick-lock key taken out of his left hand pocket, it is in Court.</p>

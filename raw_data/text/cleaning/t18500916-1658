On 20th May I had a horse and cart—they were the property of my husband then—the prisoner was in his service, and went out every morning with milk—he went out that morning with the horse and cart, but I did not see him go—he returned, and at eight o'clock I saw him ride out of the yard with the pony, and the saddle and bridle—he did not come back, and I sent for the police—about a month afterwards I went to Mr. Evans, at Royston, I there saw the horse and saddle and bridle, which the prisoner had taken away—the horse was worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shoe-maker; I was down at the sign of the Horse and Groom, having a pint of beer with some particular customers of mine, by and by I heard a terrible outcry in the street, crying stop thief! I immediately ran out of the tap room, and the prisoner was just run by, and ran into Black Horse yard, that leads into Tottenham-court-road; immediately I pursued him, I took him just coming into the Black Horse yard and brought him back to Mrs. Warren's; I was not the first that laid hold of him, but I was close to the heels of the gentleman that took him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street does Mrs. Warren live? - In Steven-street, No. 13, it is in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the copper? - It was brought into the baker's shop. When I saw him he had dropped the copper; I saw nothing of the copper till I came back with the prisoner to Mrs. Warren's, I did not know what was meant by the outcry before I came then the person that was the taking of him said, Gilpin, I will have nothing to do with him, you may take him to yourself, and I immediately sent for the watchman; Mrs. Warren said, that was the man that stole the copper, and said it was her own copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150145"></xptr>Q. Did you go and see where it was taken from? - Yes, it was down in the kitchen, about ten or a dozen stairs, there were some of the lime broke off just about the edge where the copper was fixed.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA WHITEMAN sworn. I am a constable; I was the constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and the copper was brought there, the last witness brought the copper.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. Did you send it by the lab witness? - The witness took it himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Whiteman. Have you kept it from that time to this? - No, I put a mark on it, and they have had it for their own usesince.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. How came it here? - Mr. Warren brought it here, two or three nights ago, and it has been over the way at the baker's ever since; I expected the trial to come on before now.</p>
               <p>Whiteman. This is the copper, here is the mark I put on it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warren. There is the mark I put on it, it is a scratch with a penknife, this is the one that I see the prisoner throw down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more than a child unborn about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. Do you know this man at all? - He is quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Gunner. Are you sure that is the man that was in the passage? - I am.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man that took hold of me first, from that day to this. My friends were here about an hour ago, and I thought I should not be tried to night. I have worked hard for my living ever since I have been able.</p>

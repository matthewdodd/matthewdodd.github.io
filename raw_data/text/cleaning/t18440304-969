                  </hi>. I am the wife of Dennis Connor, a labourer, in George-street, Ratcliff. On the 2nd of Jan. I met the prisoner, and took her to my place out of charity—I gave her lodging for nothing—next day she left, and I missed my cloak, shawl, and other things—on the 27th of Feb. my husband sent for me, and I found her in a public-house—she wished to be very kind to me, but I gave her in charge—she pulled my handkerchief out of her pocket—I said, "That is mine, I will not touch it, but it is not hemmed, and there is a tear at the corner"—and it was so—this is it—when I first met her she had a man with her, who she said was her husband—I asked them to my house—she sent for a pot of beer—the man went, and left her—I did not</p>

I took the prisoner—Mrs. Connor stated the things that she had lost—the prisoner said, "I know nothing about them"—when Mrs. Connor described the things, the prisoner said, "Would not you like to know where they are?"—Mrs. Connor said "Yes"—the prisoner said, "Then you never shall"—while we were waiting she took this handkerchief from her pocket—Mrs. Connor said it was hers, that it was not hemmed, and there was a tear in the corner—I examined it, and found it as she described.</p>

On the Tues<lb></lb>day we met her again, and the captain said to me, "Do you know this person?" I said, "Yes, that is the person whose house we were at;" he crossed over to her and asked her to drink; we went home and had ever so home and had ever so much to drink; the captain left me there; she and I had more drink; her husband came home and found us both tipsy; he beat her, but seeing me there he said he would forgive her; the next morning I said I must go and meet the cap<lb></lb>tain, as he was to give me some money; Mrs. Connor called a witness who saw me go out, and saw that I had nothing; when I came back I could not find Mrs. Connor's place; I then got into trouble and could not go; I had used this handkerchief to wipe her face when her husband beat her; it is not a hand<lb></lb>kerchief, it is a piece of cloth; there are plenty like this if I could have them here; when she said she should like to have her property, I said, "You shall never have it of me;" that was all I said.</p>

On the 14th of August, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I fell in with the prisoner—I asked her if she knew of a lodging-house, and she took me to No. 10, Church-street—lam mar<lb></lb>ried, but I could not get in at my lodgings—the prisoner went to bed with me—I gave her a shilling, and paid for the bed—I undressed and went to bed—I had a shilling, two sixpences, and two or three halfpence in my trowsers' pocket—I had a waistcoat, and that I put on the box—I did not go to sleep—I was not in bed above three quarters of an hour when the prisoner got up—she put on her gown and shawl, went to my pocket, took my money, and my waistcoat as well—I saw her just going out of the door and called to her, but she went off—I saw her on the Sunday evening following in Broad-street—I accused her of robbing me—she said she knew nothing of me, and had not been in the house—the waistcoat pro<lb></lb>duced is mine.</p>

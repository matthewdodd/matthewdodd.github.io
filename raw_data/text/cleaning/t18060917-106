               <p>Q. Did he ask to purchase any children's shoes. - A. No, after he offered me the six shillings he went out; I looked at the chair where the shoes hung, I found they were gone, I called him back, he being just inside of the step; I said you have got a pair of shoes, he said he had got none of my shoes; I told him to deliver them up or else I would charge a constable with him, I searched his coat and waistcoat, I could not find them; I said though I cannot find them about your clothes I am sure you have got them, I have lost a great many before, and I know you are the person that took them; while the constable was gone for, my wife saw him take off his hat, and the shoes fell out of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife say any thing. - A. Yes, she said he took them out of his hat; I heard them fall, I picked them up myself; I saw Tringham the constable, I called him in, and I said take charge of this man.</p>
               <p>SARAH SMITH sworn. Q. When this man was brought back to your husband's shop what did you see done. - A. After my husband had searched him I saw him take off his hat, and throw them down by his side; I called out to my husband directly, and told him I saw it.</p>
               <p>- TRINGHAM sworn. I produce the shoes; there were more shoes at the back of the shop, he asked to look at them; the prisoner took a pair in his hand and hustled them, and said now, d - n you, which are the shoes. These are the shoes Mr. Smith gave me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are both pair my shoes, made by my men.</p>

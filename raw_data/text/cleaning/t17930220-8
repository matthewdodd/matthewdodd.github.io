On Saturday the 26th of January, Mrs. Jellico and I were in the counting house adjoining the shop, between three and four in the afternoon; and I saw the prisoner come into the shop; I supposed him to be a customer, desired Mrs. Jellico to go out at door and see what he wanted; when she went forward I heard a violent screaming, I went into the shop but lost sight of Mrs. Jellico; I went to the door and see her run down <placeName id="t17930220-8-crimeloc47">London Wall</placeName>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to George Henry Schacht, a skin merchant in George-street, Mansion-house. Between Saturday 27th, and Monday 29th of November last, his warehouse was broken open, and a large quan<lb></lb>tity of skins stolen—there were 155 bundles of ermine skins lost—they were tied in bundles—there were 25 bunt as of dressed, worth from 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per timber of 40 skins, and the rest were raw, worth from 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per timber—there are only three other houses in London which import skins of that sort, I have been fifteen years with Mr. Schacht, and eight years with another merchant—in June last I had information from Ellis and Everington—I went to their shop in St. Paul's Church-yard—I was there shown six and a half timbers of ermine skins—I have no hesitation in laying they were part of those stolen from Mr. Schacht, from their qua<lb></lb>lity—part of them had been in the warehouse nearly three years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Ellis and Ever<lb></lb>ington, of St. Paul's Church-yard. On Saturday, the 18th of June, a per<lb></lb>son named Bull came to our house (he had been in our employ from eight to ten years before), he produced 4 dressed and 4 undressed skins as a sample, and asked if we bought such things—he said he had about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. timber of them—he wanted 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the dressed and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the undressed—I said I must see the bulk—he said he would show me timber dressed, and asked if I would purchase them first, he would show me the others afterwards—having heard of Mr. Scratch's robbery, I made a communica<lb></lb>tion to them, and an appointment was made for Bull to come again, which he did in half an hour, accompanied by the prisoner—they brought these 6) timber of ermine skins—Bull introduced the prisoner to me as the owner of the skins—he told me he was a Sir John Winning ton, who bad made a purchase of them—in consequence of something which had passed between me and Mr. Charles, I went on to buy these timbers for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this invoice was made out—the prisoner wrote it—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> asked for some reference to be given, and a Mr. Bartholomew, of New Inn, was given—the prisoner</p>

               <p>and Bull then went away. On Monday the 20th, the prisoner brought a timber of undressed skins—he said that was a sample of 31 timbers, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned as the price—I told him I could not buy them unless I saw the whole of them—he went to fetch them immediately—he returned without them, and said he was too late, he could not see the party and be could not bring them that day—an appointment was made that he was to bring them on the 24th of June—in the mean time I received a letter from Bull—after the receipt of it I went to a public-house—I found no one there.—On the 24th of June the prisoner brought 30 timbers of un<lb></lb>dressed—22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was bargained for as the price of the whole of them—I made him that offer and he accepted it—I proceeded to count the skim, and while they were being counted I sent to Mr. Schacht's place, and Mr. Charles came to the place—he stated in the prisoner's hearing that he be<lb></lb>lieved they were his property and that they were stolen from their pre<lb></lb>mises—the prisoner said they were his property and he would not give account of them—he was then taken into custody—Messrs. Ellis and Everington use these skins in their business—about three persons in London import these skins.</p>

             worth. I came to the Turk's-head at Stainers on the 21st of September, there was the prisoner drinking a pint of beer; I put my horse into the stable; there was an ass, a sack, and a bag, in which were some dead geese; I brought them into the house, and asked who owned them; the prisoner said they were his; I asked him how he came by them; he said he bought them for a shilling a-piece; I asked him where; he said at Hounds, near the place, where we found afterwards, they were lost from; I took them out of the sack and bag that they should not spoil by lying together; there were nineteen of them, their throats were all cut; I laid them on some faggots, then we brought them and the prisoner back to Justice Bulstrode.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you first meet with the prisoner?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220016"></xptr>Bedsworth. That was about eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. By what did you know the geese?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I knew them as soon as I saw them; I had marked them on the foot (he produced a leg, and shewed the mark to the Jury)</p>

            . I was in my cart near the turnpike, the prisoner was coming with his ass; I got down out of the cart, and asked him what he had to sell, and clapped my hand upon the sack, and found they were geese; the prisoner said they were all sold; then I went on about my business to Staines; there I got the headborough, and took the prisoner up at the Turk's-head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I shall clear myself as well as I can: on the Saturday before I was apprehended, I set out from the Turk's-head with intention to come to London, to pay a little money that I owed to Mr. Conner, at the Bull's-head in Kent street; coming to Brentford I met some acquaintance, and got in liquor, they persuaded me to go to Staines; coming thro' Hounslow some boys play'd the rogue with my ass; they cut the crupper, saddle and bridle, and used me ill; I was advised to make the best of my way to Staines, by people that came and took my part; when I came upon the heath, I lay down to sleep, and awaked about four in the morning; there came a man up to me and said, My cock, will you buy some geese; I said, where are they; he said they are not far off; I said, how came you by them here at this time of the morning; he said he drove them from Wiltshire, and they grew so tired he was obliged to kill them, and as you have an ass you are capable of carrying them; he took me to a ditch, there they all lay: I thought I could lose no great matter by them, so I gave him 19 s. for the nineteen geese: I cry about hair skins, rabbit skins, old rags, and old flint glass.</p>

            . I am a publican. On the 24th of December, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I was at Acton with Mr. Bailey - it was dark, and foggy; I heard somebody coming on. We stopped opposite the Red Lion, and two men came opposite us, one had a bag on his back - the prisoner had a basket. I crossed over to them, and asked the man what was in the bag, as I saw it was something alive; he said they were hares. I asked him where he got them? he said out of the country. I put my hand into the prisoner's basket, found feathers, and asked him if he had got pheasants? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a few fowls." I asked him if he got them from the same place? he said Yes. I collared the other man, and told him he must go with us, to see what he had got. I had not got ten yards when the prisoner passed me on the road, in Bailey's custody. He got from him, and ran by me. I gave the other man to Bailey and collared him. The other man then got from Bailey. I kept hold of the prisoner, took him to my house, searched him, and found a flint, a gimlet, and three or four pieces of raw beef in his waistcoat pocket. I asked him if that was to stop the dogs from barking? - he made no answer. I found nine hens and a cock, dead, and a small liver, in his basket. There were seven live rabbits in the other man's bag.</p>

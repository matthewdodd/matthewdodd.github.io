He then went out again. I carried a pot of porter, and 2 s. 2 d. 1/2 as he ordered; there was the prisoner at the door; he took the beer and change out of my hand, and said he was going in there, and bid me go back for another pot. I asked the shoemaker if the beer was to come there? he said no, he knew nothing of it. While I was talking to him, the prisoner was running away with the beer and money; then I went directly after him; he ran round the corner, and I after him, calling, Stop thief: Mr. Rogers stopped him. The prisoner put the beer down at the corner of the street; as we were coming back with the prisoner, there I saw it. The prisoner confess'd he bit his hand against a post, and knocked the money out of his hand.</p>

Said I, what has this man done? the boy said he had ran away with a pot of beer, and change for half a crown: I asked the boy where he lived? he said, at the Cock and Wool-pack. I said, perhaps the man has thrown the money away at the corner of Finch-lane; we found the pot under a boxmaker's window, about half full of beer. We took him to the shoemaker's shop: the shoemaker said, the prisoner was the man that had the full pot of beer. Then we carried him to Mrs. Pocock; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070027"></xptr> searched, but no money found upon him; presently he confessed he had taken the change, and pot of beer. I asked him how he could do such a pitiful trick? his answer was, I am necessitated; I have taken 27 guineas since I came from sea, which is about three weeks ago, and have not a farthing left.</p>

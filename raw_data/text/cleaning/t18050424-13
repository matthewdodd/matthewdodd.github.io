            , jun. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner was in your employ; were you present when the prisoner's box was opened and the cheese found? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that cheese? - A. It has our mark; I took the officer down into the warehouse, to shew him the mark of the same dairy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold any cheese of the same dairy with that mark on it? - A. None but what was shipped in the country to Kent and different parts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How many persons do you keep serving in your shop? - A. Only my partners, myself, and Gardner.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether your partners had sold it to the prisoner you cannot tell us; it is single Gloucester? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of cheese of the same dairy had you left? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been ill just at this time? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He had made no application to you for any cheese? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he board in the family? - A. Yes; he had the same cheese and the same joint of meat as the family had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no private mark on that cheese? - A. It is marked with our factor's mark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240015"></xptr>which we can prove; it is marked with W. S. No. 2.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That other people may have as well as you? - A. There are no other people have cheese with our initials; our factor's name is Groom.</p>
               <p>Jury. I can vouch that Groom does not mark any other person's cheese with W. S.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been, for several winters past, troubled with a bad cough; on the 26th of February last I complained to my young master, Thomas, of the cheese that I eat; it was strong old Cheshire cheese; it made my cough much worse; I used to eat cheese twice a day, and on that day he cut that cheese, and gave me that which is now produced, and said, put it by, let nobody see it, and you can have a slice when you please.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>

On the 14th of December I was carrying a parcel for him, which contained a silk skirt, to Bridge-street, Westminster; a young man took it from me, and ran across the road with it he was about the prisoner's size, and was dressed like him: I cannot swear to his person - I believed at the time it was him.</p>



               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you see me snatch it from you? A. I could not swear it was you; it was a foggy night, I could not see above two or three yards.</p>

            . I was at the corner of Carlton-street, about half-past seven o'clock that evening, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I could not see any body running - it was very foggy; the prisoner made for the street where I stood, and I made a snatch at the parcel - he darted into the road, and I after him; I scuffled with him, and knocked his hat off - he was secured by another person; he owned it was his hat. and wished me to give it up - I am certain the person who acknowleged the hat had this parcel, which was thrown down.</p>

I had been to Mr. Currey, a hatter, for a situation - he was suited; I was returning, and saw the witness standing by a lamp-post - a man rushed by, and I thought he had taken off my hat; I ran after him, and I believe he dropped the parcel - a man in livery made a grasp at him, but missed him; he then took me and said, "I thought I would have one;" I said"It was not me" - I had dropped my hat, and then a man came and put my hat on.</p>

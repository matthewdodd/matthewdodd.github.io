On the 17th of April, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, a pawnbroker came to our station-house - I went with him to his shop in Long-acre; I found the prisoner Bell at the shop, who had gone there to pawn this watch - I took him, and in going along, he said a person outside had given it him to pawn for 6l.; my brother officer, who is not here, went out to look for that person - I did not take Worman.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre. I have a watch, which was offered in pawn by Bell one Saturday in April; he asked 6l. 6s. for it, and said if I pushed in the how it would play a tune - I did so, and found it repeated; I then thought he had not come honestly by it - I recollected there had been a bill sent round to stop such a watch; and sent for an officer - in the mean time I pretended to write him a duplicate, and asked what name he would have it put in - he said he would go outside and see; he went out, and I went to see he did not run away - he came in again, and told me to put it in the name of Worman; I had to go round the counter to look at him - he might have communicated with some person and I not see him.</p>

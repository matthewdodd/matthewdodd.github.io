                  </hi>. I am a wagoner in the employ of Messrs. Kenworthy. On the 1st of April I received from Mattinson a parcel to take to Messrs. Howitt's in Holborn—I placed it between two bags of wool, and a heavy woollen blanket was placed over it to keep the water off—I am certain it could not have got out itself—when I got to Holborn the blanket was turned back and the parcel gone—that could not have happened accidentally—I received the parcel at the bottom of Love-lane—I went up Alderman<lb></lb>bury, and turned into Cateaton-street, and up Milk-street into Cheapside.</p>

                  </hi>. About eight o'clock at night on the 1st of April I was in Gutter-lane, and saw the prisoner Taylor carrying this bundle under his arm—there were two persons with him that I knew—they might have been about a quarter of a yard from him—not more—I followed him into St. Ann's-lane, near the post-office—James was one of the other persons with him—when I got into St. Ann's-lane I collared Taylor, and he dropped the cloth, struck me right and left as bard as he could, and tried to get away—I called for assistance, and Rawlinson came—he picked up the par<lb></lb>cel—I was obliged to take Taylor in a coach—I have got the invoice that was under the string of the parcel. On Friday morning the 7th, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw James in Watling-street, in company with two others—I spoke to a man of the name of Jay—I saw that James was watch<lb></lb>ing me, and I followed him—he ran into St. Paul's churchyard—I over<lb></lb>took him just by the school—as he went under the piazza he drew this life-preserver, and flourished it about at me, which prevented my getting at him—I ultimately got him into custody by calling out.</p>

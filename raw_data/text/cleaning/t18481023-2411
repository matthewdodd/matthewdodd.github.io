                  </hi>. I live in Swan-yard, Shoreditch, and am a constable of the Eastern Counties Railway. I was at the arrival terminus on Saturday evening, the 7th Oct.—the Colchester train arrived at half-past nine o'clock, a little later than it was due—it was a long train, and there were a great many passengers—I stationed myself opposite the luggage-van, and while the luggage was being taken out, and put on the platform, I saw the prisoner—he looked about the luggage, and I saw him lay hold of a trunk and pull it on one side, and he desired the porter Rees to take it to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and be quick about it—he took it, and the prisoner walked about one pace in front of him—a gentleman went to the porter, and requested to know what he was about to do with his trunk—the porter said he was going to take it to <hi rend="italic">a cab</hi> for the gentleman in front of him—the prisoner was near enough to hear what was said, and he made a rush into the crowd of passengers—I followed him,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230169"></xptr>
               <p>and so did the gentleman the trunk belonged to—the prisoner said it was not him that ordered the porter to take the trunk.</p>

I was near the platform when the Colchester train came in—I was desired by the pri<lb></lb>soner to take this box to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and to be quick—the gentleman came and spoke to me, I told him I was carrying it for the prisoner, and the prisoner ran into the mob—I came back again to the platform—there was no other trunk of this size without an owner—the prisoner told us at the station that he came from Hertford—I told him that train came from Colchester, and then he said he came from Colchester.</p>

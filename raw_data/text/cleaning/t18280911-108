               <p>GEORGE BRIGNALL. I live in Upper Thames-street - my daughter Emma is eighteen months old.

I had been down the steps of Blackfriars'-bridge with her; I saw the prisoner and another down there, and came away, leaving them there, and when I got into Earl-street, a how came flying before me - I picked it up, and wondered where it came from; another man in a brown coat said "You may have it if you like;" I said "Very well;" I walked on a step or two, and the other one said it was worth 1d.; I said it was, and just as he said the word, the prisoner came round the side of me, and took the necklace off the child's neck; I looked round and saw the shade of it - he turned round, and ran across the road; I hallooed Stop thief! and ran after him - I am quite certain he is the boy who took it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down the street, and ran across the road, they called Stop thief! I turned up a court and was taken.</p>

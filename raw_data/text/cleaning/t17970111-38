               <p>Q. That I apprehend was on a Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner on that day? A. I was going out to dinner with a friend, and he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what subject, and what did he communicate to you? - A. He asked me if I would go in the city with him to cash some notes, and I asked him what notes they were, and he said they were Bank-notes, and very good notes; accordingly I turned round to the lady I was going out with, and said, I would wait upon her on Friday, and I sent my servant for a coach; Mr. Nathan went in the coach with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went together in the coach? - A. Yes; I would not wish to walk in a dirty day.</p>

               <p>Q. Which of these houses did you go to first? A. To Sir James Esdaile's; I know that house very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Doubtless; then you drove to the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go in with you? - A. No; he was not dressed well enough to go with me that day.</p>
               <p>Q. He staid in the coach then? - A. No; he got out and paid the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get out? - A. At the Mansion-house; we both got out, and I told him to stop at the Bank, and I would call for him; I went to Sir

            's myself; I know Sir James very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to call for him after you had got the notes cashed? - A. I got the notes cashed, and then I called for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner; with what appointment? - A. I told him if he stopped at the Bank, I would call for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present your bills at Esdaile's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get cash? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get value for them? - A. I got a ten pound Bank of England note, five guineas and an half in gold, and I returned them sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. From Esdaile's, where did you go to? - A. To Downe's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you go alone to Downe's? - A. He was just by Downe's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did you go to Downe's alone, or did you see him first? - A. I saw him as I went along, just opposite Downe's, by the side of the Bank, in Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get value for your note there? - A. Yes, five guineas, immediately; and then when I came out, I saw Mr. Nathan, and I said, you are not dressed as well as me; you have no powder in your hair, nor nothing, and I wish to get a coach and go home as soon as possible, and we got a coach in Cateaton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more business? - A. No; merely for the ride, he went to my house and took coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him the value you had got for your bills? - A. I tendered him down the money, and he wished to have cash.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you these notes at your house, before you went? - A. Yes; and I did not examine them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you offer him, when you got got home, the ten-pound note? - A. Yes; and he said, he would rather have cash; and I sent my servant to my banker's to get cash, and I gave him twenty guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. And pray who may be your banker, Madam? - A. Mr. Pybus.</p>
               <p>Q. This was upon the 23d; after your servant brought you cash from your banker's, did you pay that to Mr. Nathan? - A. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of it? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. After coffee was over, you parted, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110058"></xptr>Q. When did you see Mr. Nathan next? - A. On the Saturday following; I was going into the city upon some business to my executor's.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you parted upon that day, did Mr. Nathan make you any acknowledgement-I don't mean in the shape of money, you know? - A. I had no notion of it; he owes me a great deal of money; stoppage is no payment, you know; he owes me at this moment about eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, at that time, he made you, in any shape, any little present for the trouble you had taken? - A. No; I should not have thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next? - A. The Saturday following, at my own house; I was just going to my executor's, Mr. Green, and he said, as it was his sabbath, he wished I would change a bill for 19l. 13s. 6d. upon Smith and Company; he gave me two other notes, which he did not desire me to change, but said, they would be due upon the Monday; I went to Mr. Smith's, and Mr. Smith called me into the parlour, and they stopped me, and I gave them my address; I had several notes upon snow and others of my own in my pocket; I was very much surprized, and they did not chuse to tell me what it was; I thought it might be a forgery; I immediately went to Mr. Green, and shewed him those other two notes; they were to be due on Monday; I asked Mr. Green if they were good notes, and he sent his servant to change them, and they were stopped likewise.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who is Mr. Green?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The executor to her late husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Then an examination took place, and you stated this? - A. Yes, undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know upon whom the other notes were drawn? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Had you any adventure in the lottery, or any share of any ticket at the time you went to Mr. Green's? - A. Yes; I received a sixteenth in the Irish lottery from Mr. Nathan, about eight or nine shillings value; I had given him one about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive that sixteenth from him? - A. Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have a care Mrs. Hickes-upon your oath, when did you receive that sixteenth - was it after you had been to Sir

            's? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive it? - A. At my own house, before my own servants; you don't suppose it was for my going into the city, I hope.</p>
               <p>Q. No; I would not insult you so much? - A. I hope not.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the sixteenth if you were to see it again? - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other sixteenth in your house, at the time the officers went there? - A. I had no other from nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes; it was locked up in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure you had no other sixteenth but that you had received of Mr. Nathan at the time the officers were at your house? - A. I had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. From any other person, or upon any other account whatever? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You yourself found the misfortune of having all these bills traced to your possession, and that you were under the necessity of accounting for them, did not you? - A. I did not find it any misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find it any misfortune? - A. I knew very well I was innocent of them.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you at once told the plain truth of whom you had them, and every thing relating to it? - A. Yes; I thought it was a forgery, and therefore I was intimated.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, of course, you found it the best way to toll the truth? - A. Mr. Conant begged of me to do so, and I did tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, then, who did you say you had them from? - A. Mr. Nathan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The very first time you were asked about it? - A. The very first time I was upon my oath at Mr. Conant's, I told him the same that I have told this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether the first time you were questioned by Mr. Conant about it, you told him the truth? - A. I told that gentleman I was intimidated, and therefore perhaps the former part of my story has varied from the last.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you sure it did? - A. The last part of my story I was upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when you were questioned about it by Mr. Conant, and had to account for them, did you not say you had all these from a Mrs. Smith? - A. I was intimidated.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you or did you not say so? - A. I did first, that was before I was sworn; and Mr. Conant told me, that if I told the truth, the first part of the story should be void.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you describe that Mrs. Smith to be? - A. A lady that came to my house upon business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Conant whereabouts it was likely to find this lady, to bring her to justice? - A. I certainly varied in my story; for I thought, as I was a lone woman, and every thing, and thinking there was something of a forgery about it, I was very much intimidated, and did not know what to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110059"></xptr>Q. What account did you give of Mrs. Smith? - A. You certainly know, or else you would not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't give me an answer, I will apply to my Lord to commit you? - A. Mr. Conant told me, all that I said first should be void.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell Mr. Conant where she was to be found? - A. Somewhere in Charlotte-street, I told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was this acquaintance of your's then to be a lady of easy virtue? - A. I was so intimidated I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe her as a lady of easy virtue, likely to be met with at the theatres, the park, and public places, yes, or no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire that an officer should go with you to those several places, to enable you to find out this person, and bring her to justice? - A. I wish to come to the right of the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire that an officer might attend you to go to the theatres, and the park, and places of public resort, to find this Mrs. Smith? - A. You know, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I know nothing of it, or the Jury; you must tell us, that we may know? - A. Mr. Conant said, that all that should be void; he said it should never be repeated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did an officer attend you, now, in consequence of this description of your's, to the park, and the theatres, and from place to place, to endeavour to find this Mrs. Smith? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. That officer was Lawrence, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep Lawrence upon this pretty game of hide and seek, was he not a week with you, now, trying to find out this Mrs. Smith? - A. He came on Sunday afternoon, and he came on Monday, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to any places to endeavour to find out this lady? - A. I went into the theatre myself, he stopped at the door while I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay to look and find out this Mrs. Smith? - A. May-be half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You employed yourself in looking about to see if she was there, I suppose? - A. I was intimidated, knowing I was a woman, and nobody to protect me; I thought it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, search for this Mrs. Smith at the play-house? - A. If that Gentleman wishes me to tell you, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. To be sure you must, yes or no.</p>
               <p>A. Certainly, I looked in at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you or not, search about for this Mrs. Smith at the play-house while you were there? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why don't you answer the question? - A. I told him I could not find Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you search for this Mrs. Smith? - A I knew there could be no Mrs. Smith in existence, I went from box to box; I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up? - A. On Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was on Monday; was not your fright over? - A. No; it has lasted ever since; I would not have had it happen for a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You are apprehensive that if you don't clear yourself of this charge you will come to some harm by it? - A. I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you apprehend you shall be prosecutod if you don't clear yourself by your evidence? - A. I clear myself as far as possible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do attend to the question, and if you understand it, answer it directly; do you not conceive, that unless you clear yourself, by the evidence you now give, you will be prosecuted? - A. No; I will clear myself, and I don't think of being prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I will be content with that answer, and will not press it any further. - This, I dare say, is the first time you were ever in trouble, and therefore you were taken suddenly; you never were in trouble before? - A. Every body is in trouble by times.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what I mean, and you will not come to it. Supposing, for instance, a person should be taken up and carried to goal? - A. I was taken up for buying a gown that was stole, and I had you for my Counsellor, you know, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. All the world may have that. - Whether, before this happened, you had been taken up on any criminal charge? - A. I was never in custody before the gown, and then I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You are no dealer in wax, are you? - A. Yes, Sir, you know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were called upon to account for some wax of Mr. Barrett's, that got into your possession? - A. You know every thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you not called upon to account for some wax of Mr. Barrett's, that got into your possession? - A. It was not in my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say, that Mr. Barrett's wax was not in your possession? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you fell it? - A. No; I had some wax from his servants; you know how the affair was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not charged with having wax of Mr. Barrett's; were you not forgiven by Mr. Barrett upon condition of revealing all you knew about the wax you had of his servants? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110060"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I mean to say this: that Mr. Barrett desired me to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which condition he forbore to prosecute you? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. My husband desired me to tell Mr. Barrett the whole truth of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not twice before the Magistrates at Union-hall as an accomplice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards tried for receiving a gown, knowing it to have been stolen? - A. Yes; and honourably acquitted before Mr. Maiwaring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Give me leave to ask you a few questions. - It is not from any credit you have done yourself, you have made a very pretty figure to be sure; I collect from this Gentleman's examination, that you had stated, that a Mrs. Smith had delivered you the bills. Were you, at that time, upon oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever at any time, upon oath, give any other account than you have given in answer to my questions to night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that you received them from Nathan, and not from a person of the name of Smith? - A. It is the whole truth, I received them from Nathan, and nobody else.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Russell. Q. Did you, in November last, keep a lottery-office, in Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at your office, fell shares in the Irish-lottery? - A. Yes; on the 23d of November, I sold a quarter and a sixteenth, in the Irish-lottery to Nathan, the number of one was 37,979.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the sixteenth, or the quarter? - A. They were both of the same ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the prisoner pay you for that quarter and sixteenth? - A. With a Bank-note of 10l. (the note shown to him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the Bank-note which he paid you? - A. Yes, and there is my memorandum upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship recollects this was proved by the Banker's clerk, at Stokesley, to be contained in this letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnull. I was apprehensive it might be a lost note from the appearance of it, and I sent a person to the Bank about it; he staid till he came back; and I am positive he is the person, the tickets are registered in Mr. Nathan's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make that register in consequence of directions given you by the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the register? - A. Mr. Nathan, No. 106, Swallow-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any reason upon earth to doubt that that was his true description, and residence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this man comes openly to your shop with a ten pound Bank-note, parchases a part of commodities you deal in, and desires you expressly to put down his name and abode, whenever you chuse to send after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, probably. you would not have known where to find him, if he had not so done? - A. Very likely not.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent from your house to the Bank, supposing it to be a lost note-did he stay like an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A ten pound Bank-note may go all round London in two days? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold a quarter and a sixteenth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The sixteenth has no particular number about it, to denote one sixteenth of the same ticket from another? - A. Of that individual ticket, there were twelve sixteenths.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark by which you can ascertain the very individual sixteenth that you sold to him? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. The object of your register is, to give notice to the fortunate holders, if it is drawn a prize? - A. Yes.</p>

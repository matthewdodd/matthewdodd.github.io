            , and he said he did. I told him I had a very serious charge against him, for robbing her ladyship; he made no answer. I took him out of the coach, and searched his pockets; he had nothing in them. I then took him to Mary-le-bone watch-house; he wished to see Mr. Williams, who afterwards saw him at the watch-house. I found in his shoe, between the inner and outer sole, three duplicates; I asked him if he had any more; he said he had had more, but they were destroyed; that one Daniel M'Carthy had got some more; he gave me his address, at No. 7, Dudley-court, near St. Giles's Church. I went, and left word for him to bring them; and when I returned, I found him in custody at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found him in her Ladyship's neighbourhood - A. About half a mile from her house; he made no resistance. I left word at M'Carthy's house, that Darby wanted to see him at the watch-house, and he was to bring the papers which he had with him. He pulled his shoes off himself.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. I have hawked fruit about the town; and occasionally, within the last year, have sold fruit at her Ladyship's house; I dealt with the prisoner for it. During the time I was going backwards and forwards to the house, the prisoner employed me, eight or nine times, to pawn plate; he was indebted to me for fruit, and gave me the plate to pawn to raise money to pay me. I pawned it at Sampson's. I offered him the duplicates, but he desired me to take care of them; I delivered some of the tickets to him (looking at the three found on the prisoner); these are not any of them. I may have given him one or two, the rest were taken from me at the watch-house. I pawned the last property in December.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were often at the house - A. Yes; the fruit was sold for her Ladyship. I never applied for payment to any one but Darby, as he always dealt with me. I have seen her Ladyship and Mr. Williams occasionally, but understood from Darby that he was the confidential servant. My first bill might be 3 l. or 4 l.; they might take 1 s. or 3 s. worth a day. I kept a shop in Castle-street part of the time. When I pawned the plate, I kept the money, as it was to pay me; when there was more than my bill, I delivered him the balance; I understood from him that her Ladyship wished it to be pawned. The last I pawned was for five guineas; at that time there was 6 l. 16 s. 5 d. due to me. I delivered the bills to Darby. I may have pawned to the amount of 18 l. or 19 l. in all. I served fruit regularly every day, for eighteen months, till her Ladyship went to Windsor; they sometimes took 6 s. worth at a time. I returned him 2 l. in December, and 10 s. or 15 s. at other times. I always went down the area, to the prisoner's room; I do not know where the plate was kept; I may have seen some in his room; I pawned the property as he gave it me - in the evening.</p>

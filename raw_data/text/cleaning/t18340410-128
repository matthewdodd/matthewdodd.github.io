            . I am inspector of the watch of Cripplegate Without. I was called that night about half-past ten o'clock- I found the box of the lock of the prosecutor's room broken off - this is part of it - they stated that the prisoner lodged in an adjoining room, and I thought him a very likely person to have done it - I forced his room door open, and found this plate, this piece of soap, this bit of carpet, and some bread and butter - I put a lock on the prisoner's door, and a notice that if any one wanted to go in, they might apply to me - I heard no more of it, but when the prisoner was in custody I gave the landlord possession of the room.</p>

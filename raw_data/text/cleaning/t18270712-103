On the 26th of June I was moving, and employed the prisoner to move a box, containing linen and other things - it was not locked, but corded; she had seen me put the things into it. I soon afterwards saw a shawl concealed inside her gown - it was my grand-daughter's, and had been in the box. I afterwards saw her intoxicated - I went to the box, and missed the linen and shoes.</p>

I found five duplicates on her, which do not relate to this property; I asked if she had any more - she said No, but I found two in her bosom, which relate to the property; she was nearly drunk, but McKell was quite sober.</p>

               <p>Did it appear to be fresh ripped? - Yes; for I was in the gutter the day before, and the lead was all safe then.</p>

               <p>How much is lead worth a pound? - About sixteen shillings per hundred weight; I saw nothing of the prisoner after, till he was caught for another crime, about three weeks ago; then, Mr. Key sent for me, to go and see whether it was the same person, when he was in custody; I am sure he was the same person; he had a short knife in his hand when I saw him at work.</p>

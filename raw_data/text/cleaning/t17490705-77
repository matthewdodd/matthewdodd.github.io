On last Friday was se'nnight, as I was going home about a quarter after eleven, I was stop'd near my own house by three men, who bid me stand; I asked them what they wanted; directly one of them struck me on the temple, and the other two began to beat me about the head; however I got from them and run to my own house; I knock'd, and call'd out thieves and watch! upon that Mr. Townsend, my next door neighbour, flung up his window to see what was the matter; and other people coming by, being alarm'd by my crying out, they were pursued, and the prisoner was taken in Mincing-lane and brought to the watch-house: I declar'd upon first sight he was one of them, and I believe I should know the other two.</p>

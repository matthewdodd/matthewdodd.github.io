I was coming home from Work about Ten o'Clock at Night, on the 19th of August, and the Prisoner asked me to give her a Pint of Beer; I told her I would spend my three Halfpence with her, and she carried me to a private House, a Ginhouse in <placeName id="t17390906-51-crimeloc225">Love-Court, in George-Alley</placeName>

We had two Quarterns of Gin, and I staid with her about Half an Hour. I had my Watch at a Quarter past Ten, and miss'd it before she went down Stairs. We had been pretty near together, and I felt her pluck something out of my Pocket, but I could not tell what it was: As soon as I miss'd it, I ran down Stairs after the Prisoner, and met a Woman upon the Stairs, and she blew the Candle out, to prevent my following her; but I pursu'd her, and found her out; and took her last Friday, but she would confess nothing, and I have never seen my Watch since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not promise to give me a Shilling?</p>
               <p>Woodall. No: I promis'd her nothing, but she made bold to pay herself well, - for she got my Watch, and that's the Truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if there was not another Woman in Company with us.</p>
               <p>Woodall. There was another Woman who brought the Liquor, but she only staid to drink two Glasses of Gin.</p>

            . When this Woman was put in the Compter, I happen'd to be there myself, and I ask'd her, what she was brought in for? She told me, - for picking a Cull's Pocket of a Loge, (a Watch) three Weeks ago, which I have sold for - Money, said she.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Woman is a nasty drunken Creature, and knows nothing of the Matter: 'Twas the other Woman that was in the Room with us, who took the Watch. The Man shook Hands with me when I left him, and he bid me Good-night. <rs id="t17390906-51-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">

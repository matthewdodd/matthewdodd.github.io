               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Holliday: I called up the boy, who lived with me as a servant about two years and a half; on my taxing him with it, he pulled out a key, which opened the lock; I asked him what he had done with all the money he had taken; he said it was up stairs; I went up, and found two guineas, eight shillings, and some copper, which he confessed was part of what he took out of Mr. Holliday's desk.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any thing said to him? - I said, tell the truth; the only way for you to find mercy is to tell the truth; he said he was tempted to do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then we must not hear what he said after that.</p>
               <p>Silverlock. I do not know the guineas.</p>
               <p>Deposed to by Mr. Holliday. I did not make any marks on the gold any further than taking down the dates.</p>
               <p>Court. That is rather vague.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holliday. It is rather vague; I do not wish to press it: one of those guineas corresponded with the date I took down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say; I was persuaded to do it by an old man; he said there was no harm in it, and I thought no harm: I have no witnesses but my master.</p>

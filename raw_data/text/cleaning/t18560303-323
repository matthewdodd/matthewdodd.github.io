                  </hi>. I am a warder in Millbank prison; I was so in Jan. last. The prisoner was a convict, confined there as a prisoner—he was one of the penal class, undergoing hard labour—on the morning of 12th Jan. it was my duty to escort him, with some other prisoners, to the treadwheel, at half past 9 o'clock—there were fifteen prisoners going at that time—they marched in single file—the prisoner was in the rear, about the last man—I and other warders walked by the side of the file, as an escort to accompany the men—I was in the rear of the whole file—Underwood, the principal warder, followed us, to close the gates between the different wards—after we had marched about half a dozen paces, the prisoner turned round, and struck me a violent blow on the back part of the head—I could not see the instrument that he made use of—I saw it afterwards—it was an iron ring, attached to some hammock nettles—it cut my head very much, and caused the blood to flow, and rendered me almost insensible, so that I scarcely knew what I was doing—I remained standing upright—as soon as I came to my recollection, I saw him in contact with warder Beer—they were struggling with each other—at the time he struck me he was the last man of the file—I will not be positive whether he had changed his place or not, but he was the last man when we marched off—he was secured in the pas<lb></lb>sage, with the assistance of some of the other prisoners—he was very violent—four other prisoners assisted in securing him—I had not spoken one word to him that morning, nor had he to me—in the previous week I had made two reports against him, once on the Monday, and once on the Thursday—on the Monday it was for making use of threatening language towards me, saying he would do something for me if I did not mind what I was doing—I was then in the act of searching him, which was my duty, as he was going to his cell—the second report, on the Thursday, was for making use of insubordinate language when working at the treadmill—he said he wished that he could break the treadmill, he would do the best he could towards it, and said that the governing directors were trying to punish the penal class prisoners as much as lay in their power, and that they might as well shut them up and <hi rend="italic">clam</hi> them to death, as keep them in the way they were doing—he has been in Millbank about three months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the warders in Millbank Prison. On 12th Jan. I accompanied the penal class, who were going to work at the treadmill—I was the third officer from the front, the prisoner was in the rear of me when he marched off—as we were going towards the treadmill, my attention was drawn to a noise in the rear—I turned round, and saw the prisoner striking violently at warder Mills with a hammock ring, at<lb></lb>tached to some hammock nettles—he held the rope part in his hand, and had a piece round his wrist—I did not see where he struck Mills, I saw him striking at him violently several times—I left the other fourteen pri<lb></lb>soners, and rushed to Mills's assistance, and the prisoner immediately com<lb></lb>menced an attack upon me—he struck at me several times, and once struck me on the left side of the head—I closed with him and threw him, and caught hold of the ring in my hand, and he held the rope—he kicked me several times across the thighs—I found that I could not succeed in taking the ring from him myself, and I called on the other prisoners to assist—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a hammock ring, there are two to each hammock, one at each end, by which the hammock is suspended—I afterwards went to the prisoner's cell, and found a ring and cord missing from it.</p>

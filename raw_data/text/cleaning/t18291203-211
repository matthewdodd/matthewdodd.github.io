On the 1st of December the watchman came, and asked if I had lost any cheese -I said No; but on looking round I missed it from about half way in the shop; I had seen it half an hour before -I found it at the watch-house; this is it - I can swear to it by a piece I had cut out of the side, and it has my father's name on it; it is dirty, because it was thrown down.</p>

            . I was on duty, between nine and half-past nine o'clock last Tuesday evening - I saw the prisoner and another man - the prisoner had this coat, and something rolled in it; I followed him close, and said "What have you got there, friend?" he made no answer, but ran away- this was in the Back-road, St. George's in the East, where the prosecutor's shop is; I pursued, but I fell over some dirt - I got up, and sprang my rattle; I still pursued - I came up to him and said, "What have you got?" he said, "Nothing but this;" and gave me this coat - he said, "I was running after the thief;" he had dropped the cheese, but I did not see it drop - his hat fell off, and there was some hay in it.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WOODROW. I was going up the Back-road, and followed the prisoner; I saw him drop this cheese out of the coat, at the corner of Clark-street - I took it up, then threw it down, and followed him; I stopped him - Shields and another man took him; I had not lost sight of him after he had dropped the cheese - he only ran about thirty yards.</p>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950416-33-defend363 t17950416-33-deflabel186"></join> for about eighteen or nineteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave your service? - About a month since; he did not leave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160066"></xptr>my service; I was determined to discharge him, and I gave him notice to get another place, that I meant to discharge him; I ordered him to go with a letter to his Grace the Duke of Portland; I had been out and got wet, and went to change my coat, and I called for him, he had my keys, and I went to my wardrobe to get another coat to put on, and to my very great astonishment I found there was none there to change; at last I found a coat which I had made an excursion in last summer; very much surprised at this deficiency in my clothes, I had a closet opened, to see if there were any clothes there. The next day I ordered him to quit my service, and to give an account of all my clothes to my butler.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine into the state of your clothes? - No, I did not. I told him to give up the state of my linen and clothes to my butler, and when that is all right come to me and I will pay you your wages. When the account came to be looked into, I found a great deficiency of my linen and other articles; the man went away, and none of my servants could tell where he lodged. I sent my butler to the magistrates, at Marlborough-street, to apply for a search warrant, and the constable, who, I suppose, is here, went with the search warrant, and he came to me and brought one of my shirts with my mark on it; when he came to me, I went with him to this man's lodgings, and there I found a considerable quantity of my clothes, which, I suppose, are here to be produced, because the constable had charge of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These things, most probably, if they were taken at all they must be taken at different times? - It is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. This man had lived with you eighteen or nineteen months, during that time he had been in the capacity of a valet. Had it, in the course of that time, been your custom to make presents to him of cast off clothes, or any thing of that sort? - It is impossible for me to recollect any thing of that sort. I have no doubt but I did make him some presents; I do not charge my memory with any.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have made him presents of some of the same sort of things that were in this indictment; black silk waistcoats for instance? - I propably might.</p>
               <p>Q. Kerseymere waistcoats? - I certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me leave to ask you whether during the time the prisoner lived with you, he had not the opportunity of making away with a Pocket book, with some bank notes in it of your's? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you a pocket book, which had either by you been mislaid or dropped which contained bank notes? - During one time he lived with me I did leave my pocket book my in breeches pocket, but what sum of money was in it I cannot tell; when I got up in the morning I said, Francy, did you see my pocket book? Yes, says he, I did, there it is, and returned it; it certainly contained property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. If you mean to inquire from this, whether I had the least suspicion of his dishonesty, I would tell you, no; that I had great confidence in him.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are one of the constables of Marlborough Street? - Yes, 135.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a search warrant at any time to the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; I went to No. 132, Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodged there? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he lodged there? - Because I asked him to go to his apartments; and he went there with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute your search warrant there? - Yes. The first I found I desired him to open the box; and he opened it very freely; and I told him there was a chest of drawers I must open.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160067"></xptr>He said he had not got the key; I said I must break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you break it open? - No, he gave me the key after that. I found this shirt there marked as the butler had described the property to me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Can you speak to the mark on your linen? - Yes: this is one out of twenty eight new shirts; which I had a short time before, eight of which are missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that you never gave away any of these? - Perfectly sure I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. To Kennedy. What else did you find? - Fifteen pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. I am given to understand that the prisoner at the bar had given him a good many silk stockings either by you or Mrs Church. - I know he has taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Be kind enough to answer my question? - I know it is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Kennedy. Have you any kerseymere waistcoats? - Three Kerseymere waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are certainly my property; and I certainly never gave them to that man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You never had any quarrel with this man? - Never in the world. I found him a good natured man, but I thought him an unthinking man, because I could not keep him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you did not think of parting with him for dishonesty? - I did not in the least.</p>

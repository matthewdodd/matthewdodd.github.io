Miller was in my service for about three months; I missed cigars, tobacco, and various other things on the 5th of March - I went for an officer; Avis came - we brought down Miller's box; we found some tobacco - in the bottom of it - I then accused her of it, but she strongly denied of it - I asked her if she had not that morning taken a lot of cigars out of the till, and some tobacco; she then acknowledged without any promise or threat, that she had had the cigars and tobacco in her box that morning -I had missed out of one till about four dozen of the best cigars, and various kinds of tobacco; Miller then said she had given them to Swearingem - I had seen a woman about the place, but could not exactly say that she was the person; I had seen Archer at the window, but not in the shop - Miller then said the cigars had been taken to Archer's house at Lambeth; Avis and another officer went there with me - Archer was out, but his wife and Swearingem were there; the women said they had never received any thing from Miller, and Swearingem went to run up stairs. but Avis caught her and pulled her down on the stairs - I found these tumblers and wine-glasses on the mantel-piece, and said I would swear they were mine; Archer came in while we were there - he said Miller had bought the glasses in Regent-street for 7s., and brought them there as a present; about two dozen cigars and a quarter of a pound of tobacco was found up stairs - I would not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What did Miller say she had taken the tobacco and cigars for? A. For Archer to smoke - that he had been out of employ for some time; Archer and Swearingem admitted they had received cigars from her; Archer said so as soon as he came in - I pay for Miller's sleeping with Mr. Hancock's servant next door; she told me it was her box; I think it was unlocked - the shop I occupy is under the same roof, but it is partitioned off; there is no private way from my house to the public-house - there is a door which leads to the bottom of their staircase; these glasses are my own- I have a great many cigars sometimes; I had a young lad, my wife's brother, in my shop - it was not very easy to miss a few cigars, but when I went to bed I put them away, and the next morning I went to my till, and about four dozen of the best cigars, which we sell at 4d. a piece, were missing; this was before my brother-in-law was up.</p>

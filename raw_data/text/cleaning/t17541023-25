               <p>Robson. He was never out of my sight only the time he ran into a house, and up stairs, and he fell out of a window directly, and was there taken.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at the bar put his left hand into the right hand pocket of the prosecutor, about 3 in the afternoon last Sunday; I saw him also pull out a handkerchief. I was having my shoes cleaned just by them. The gentleman turned about; I said, Sir, that fellow has picked your pocket; I said sue him; said he, will you insist me? Away ran the prisoner up into an alley; I followed him; he ran into a house, and we through the house; there lay the prisoner all alongside; I thought he had been dead; he tumbled out of a window; there we took him.</p>
               <p>Question from the Prisoner. Were there not 5 or 6 young lads running by at the time you lost your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw none but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cape. There was another with the prisoner; he went on the other side the prosecutor; he ran off; they seemed to be companions.</p>

             sworn. - On Friday the 6th of this month, about nine o'clock, I was going round <placeName id="t17990911-40-crimeloc208">Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>AUGUSTUS RONI sworn. - I am the son of a merchant: On Friday, the last day of the fair, I was walking with a friend in the fair, and in a little time we happened to be in a very great croud; I perceived that the man at the bar was facing me, and squeezing me very hard in the croud.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. A Frenchman; I felt at the same instant a very great rubbing against my waistcoat, which made me, as soon as I came out of the croud, put my hand directly in my pocket, and I perceived that it had been picked, and I immediately told my friend of it; I met with some constables, related how it was, and begged of them to watch the man; I saw Lawrence take the man up, I pointed him out; and then we all went into a public-house, my friend, myself, the constable, and the prisoner; I then said to the constable, if this is the man that has robbed me, you will find a little red purse, containing a half-guinea, a shilling, and a sixpence, the prisoner was present; Lawrence then searched him, and found in his pocket a leather purse, and opened it directly, but no money was found in it; then he searched in another pocket and found some money; among the money was half-a-guinea, a shilling, and a sixpence, and there were two or three shillings besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark about the half-guinea, or the shilling, or the sixpence, by which you can particularly speak to it? - A.Not any; the purse I am as positive of as I am that I now stand here, but there being no particular mark to it I cannot swear to it; at the same time, I have every reason to believe, and have not the smallest doubt in my own mind, that it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the same man that pressed you so much? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been in this country? - A.This voyage, three months.</p>
               <p>Q.How many times have you have been in England. - A. Only twice.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you have been in England, you have seen purses of the same sort? - A. I have, in the shops.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, there is no mark at all upon this purse by which you are able to identify it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was not found in the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And none of the money had any mark by which you could speak to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that squeezed you was parted from you for five minutes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is possible that, in the course of that five minutes, any body might have given him that purse? - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you carry your purse? - A.In my waistcoat-pocket.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk in a mercantile house: I was in the fair with Mr. Roni, he told me he had been robbed; and in about five minutes after my friend said to me, that is the man that robbed me; we watched the prisoner several times afterwards to see his actions, for a few minutes we separated for that purpose; he was walking backwards and forwards till we saw Lawrence, and then he was taken; there was a leather case found upon him, and as soon as it was produced my friend said it was his case; then he was taken to another house, where the City Marshals were sitting.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lawrence.) Where was it you found the money? - A. In the breeches-pocket; I cannot recollect whether the purse was taken from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110078"></xptr>breeches or the waistcoat-pocket, I rather think it was the waistcoat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Roni.) You have sworn to the person of the prisoner; was it pretty light? - A. Yes; I know him by his size, his face, and his clothes; I am sure the prisoner is the man that squeezed me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

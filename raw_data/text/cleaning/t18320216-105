            . I am a master carman. I was going down Swan-street; I met the cart, with the boy in it, and about the middle of the street I saw the bale; the prisoner and two others were there - the prisoner had his hand on it - I did not see how they got it out of the cart; it was in the road when I first saw it - they pitched it up against the side of a house; one said, "Where is Joe?" the prisoner said, "D-n Joe! give me a tip up with it;" he did not get it up, because a boy came up and said "That it is not all right;" the prisoner then had his hand on the bale - he was near enough to hear what the boy said; the boy said they had taken it out of the cart - when they heard this, the prisoner and the two others ran away; I ran, but they were too light-heeled for me - I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody; he is one of the persons who had his hand on the bale - in the run I lost sight of his face, but not of his back.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see him before? A. Not to my knowledge; I first saw them throwing it out of the road into the foot-path - the cart was then about ten yards from the bale; it was going on at a full trot - the boy who was in the cart is not here; the prisoner ran about two-thirds of Swan-street - I never lost sight of him; it was about ten minutes past six o'clock, and nearly dark.</p>

            . I heard an alarm of Stop thief! I pursued - coming down Swan-street I saw several persons in the road, and the bale of goods against the wall; I came up to Mr. Light, and knowing him, I said, "What is the matter?" the prisoner was not three yards from him- I said to Mr. Light, "I don't think all is right," and immediately after I heard a boy say No; previous to that I heard some one say, "Give me a lift up" - the boy then said, "I saw them take it out of a cart;" I saw the prisoner with his hand upon it - he was not three yards from me, and must have heard what I heard; he and the two others looked towards the bottom of Swan-street, and seeing the opening they ran off - I am sure the prisoner is the person; I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge; there were two other persons with the hale, and three in the road.</p>

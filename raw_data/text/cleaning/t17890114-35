On Monday, the 22d of December, about two in the afternoon - there were two pieces of linen put out in the morning - a gentleman, about two, came and enquired if there were not two pieces put at the door; he was answered, yes: he said he would shew which way the person that took them went. There was then a piece missing; they were joining to the window, on the ground. We pursued and took the prisoner, running into Wardour-street out of Noel-street, with the linen on his shoulder: it was Mr. Starey's linen; it was the piece that was missed; we took it from him, and secured him.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. In consequence of information, on Saturday 22d of June, I went to a house in <placeName id="t18330817-8-crimeloc40">Devonshire-court, Nicholl-street, St. Matthew, Green</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did Creber go into the room with you at first? A. He did; I observed none of these things in any part of the room, except the cupboards - they could not be seen by a person going in casually; they were concealed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know the prisoners? A. Yes; I have had them in custody before for the same offence, and I believe they lived together in the room - I have no reason to suppose them married; they go by different names; I have seen them going in and out there.</p>

            . I am a Thames police-surveyor. I accompanied the other officers to the prisoners lodging - I entered the room immediately after them - I cut the bed-tick open, seeing a hole in the middle of it - I cut it larger, and turned the whole contents of the bed out, and found a bag with forty-three counterfeit shillings in it - I gave them to Mr. Mitchell; and I found six counterfeit half crowns, in a piece of white paper, in the tick - Chamberlaine said to Hill, "This will lag us Sal," (that means transport) she made no remark to that - he said he had been there two months, and that he did not take the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went in after the other officers? A. Yes; rather.</p>

            . I am inspector of the police. - I accompanied James Fogg to the house; Thomas Fogg and Creber got there before us; we followed them in directly - I entered the room on the ground-floor, and then both the prisoners were standing up, off the bed - I saw them secured; there was a conversation as to whom the room belonged to - Hill said she hired the room, and paid for it- I found in the cupboard on the right-hand side two bags of plaister of Paris, and I saw Fogg find the mould - he handed it up to me; I produce it - James Fogg handed the couterfeit coin to me from the bed; I produce that - I believe this to be the same - but after the former trial I mixed some other counterfeit coin with them; but I believe these to be the same - I know what I found were counterfeit - there were two bands in the bag of plaister of Paris; they were pieces of old hats - I have destroyed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you had ascertained the coin to be counterfeit, was that from Mr. Field's evidence? A. No; from my own knowledge - it is so soft a metal; it is different from silver or any other coin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the man say anything about the room? A. Yes; he said he only came there occasionally to see Hill.</p>

The house No. 1, Devonshire-court belongs to me, and was let to the two prisoners, by my wife - the rent has been paid to me, several times, by Hill - I only know who took it, from what my wife has told me - I have seen the male prisoner there several times - I have seen both of them there - my house is right opposite, and I believed them to be living there as man and wife - I have seen them going backwards and forward repeatedly - my wife is confined to her bed - there are five rooms in the house; they only occupied one, the rent was paid every evening - it was 6 1/2d. a-day- the room was taken by the week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The male prisoner never paid you any rent? A. Never; I have seen them go in and out, both separately and together - I saw one as much as the other.</p>

            . I am inspector of coin to the mint - I have been in the habit of seeing counterfeit coin for many years - this is a plaister of Paris mould - having on one half of it, the observe side of a shilling impressed, and on the other, the reverse side - this mould would stamp the impression of a shilling in all respects, and it appears to have been used for that purpose; I have a shilling in my hand which I believe to have been cast in this mould, it corresponds in all respects with it - here is a piece of metal which is called a get, which appears to have been made in this mould, it fits the channel; all the shillings produced are counterfeit, several of them have not been cast in the mould - here are only two which I can be positive have been cast in this mould - the half-crowns are all counterfeit; they are all the same kind of metal - the metal can be easily fused in a tobacco pipe, and poured into the mould - a small band of hat might be used to confine the plaister.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You spoke of finding a mould in one cupboard, and one in another? A. No; I only found it in the right hand cupboard - the mould in the white paper is the same mould as I mentioned before.</p>

               <p>Chamberlaine's Defence. One thing I have to say, that is, the landlord is wrong to what he said the first time - he said at first he had seen me frequently there, but could not say that I lived there.</p>
               <p>HENRY HACKER re-examined. I said they lived there as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Chamberlaine. Very probably the things found there were left by characters who lived in the room before me, which I could bring witnesses to prove; I did not live with Ann Hill - I only came now and then to her - I happened to come on Friday, I was playing at skittles in Brick-lane, I got intoxicated, I went to her, and remained there till about eight o'clock at night, then went to a wine-house, and returned home about one o'clock in the morning; I went to her, and was there until I was taken - Fogg said, the door was fast, it was only on the latch - it was not fastened - the lock hung by one nail - the door was falling to pieces - the pannels were not thicker than half a crown.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOGG re-examined. The door was fast, I tried it, and burst it open - I don't think there was any lock to it - I think it was bolted - I did not look at it when I got in; I put my shoulder against it, and knocked it all to pieces - I saw that there was a latch to it, and that was fast; I will not swear there was a bolt.</p>
               <p>Hill's Defence. We had not lived together, not for eight months.</p>
               <p>HENRY HACKER re-examined. I let the room to them furnished - there were two doors on one cupboard, and none on the other; the cupboards were cleaned out, when they came - there was a lock on the cupboard which had a door to it.</p>

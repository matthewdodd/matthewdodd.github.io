            . The 24th of April last, about six o'clock at night the prisoner and another woman came to my shop in Bishopsgate Street, and the Prisoner asked what I would give for this necklace. I asked her how she came by it. She said she bought it of one Messenger, a constable in Artillery Lane, and gave him 28 s. for it; and she said, she wanted to sell it to sit her husband out to sea. I bid her 19 s. she went away, but came back and took my money. A man came to my shop to enquire after such a thing, that was taken off a child's neck of three years old. In about a quarter of an hour I saw the Prisoner buying a cheesecake, she was with another woman, and the two children wanted a cheesecake. Said I, Mistress, do you love cheesecakes? You must come back to my shop (the other run away.) She asked me what I detained her for. I asked her how she could be such a base woman as to take the necklace off the child's neck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Messenger sa id, he did not sell her the necklace.</p>

               <p>MARH BUSH. I am servant to Mr. Maylin, of Wigmore-street - Miss Bristow lodged there some time. On the 24th of November the prisoner came for her box - he said he had come for a box for the lady who had just left, to take to the Bull, Leadenhall-street; I gave him the box, which I know was full, because it was very heavy; I do not know what was in it - the prisoner said it was of no consequence about its being tied up, as he could put it on his head; I helped it on his head - he said the lady was waiting for him in Cavendish-square.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROGERS. I am a Police-officer. I went with Miss Bristow to Sundford-street, Lisson-grove; I found the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing about a box he had to take to Leadenhall-street - he said No; I asked him again, and then he said he gave it to a man in the street, while he went to look for the lady, and when he came back, the box and the man were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She did not say where I was to take it - I left it with a man while I looked for her, and it was gone.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 7th of January, at three o'clock in the morning, I saw two bags let out of the first-floor window of Mr. Chaffin's house - I saw nobody near to receive them; two inspectors came up at the time - I informed them of it; we watched, but saw nobody come for them: the inspectors got the keys, searched the premises, and found the prisoner on the stairs - nobody lived in the house; nobody else could be found in the house: I cannot say how he entered; the house had not been broken open: I secured the bags - they contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. About three o'clock in the morning I saw Singleton, who gave me information; I left him at the back of the premises which all the property came out of, and went and secured the front of the premises - I went to Mr. Thatcher's, in Fleet-street, where I knew Mr. Chaffin kept his keys; I got them, and searched the premises, but could find nobody - I then searched the empty house at the back, but found nobody there; they could get from the empty house on to the roof of the premises - we then went back to Mr. Chaffin's, searched again, and found the prisoner in a room adjoining that from which the bags were let down - Huckle asked what he did there: he said he had not broken in: Huckle gave him to me - he said, "Don't pull me about, I will go quietly with Johnson;" the premises were not broken - I think he must have slipped in before they were shut up; the bags had been let out of the window down into the back yard.</p>
               <p>JOHN HUCKLE. I am an inspector of the watch. -Johnson's evidence is correct; I heard the sound of glass in the room, pushed the door open, and took hold of the prisoner; I said, "What do you do here?" he said he did not break in.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

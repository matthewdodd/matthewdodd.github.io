                  </hi> I am the son of William Ellis, a potato-dealer, who lives in London-road. The prisoner Smith was in his service—last Monday morning at six o'clock I was in the kitchen—I looked through the win<lb></lb>dow, and saw Smith in the yard with a lighted candle in his hand—he went into the potato warehouse, and returned without a light—he went out of a gate leading into York-street, and returned in about five minutes with a lighted candle—he then went to the bottom of the yard, where there is another gate leading into York-street—he then returned with a person who, from his dress and size, I thought to be Howes—they both went into the back warehouse; and the other man presently came out with what ap<lb></lb>peared to me to be a full sack of potatoes on his back—I could not see that man's face—Smith remained in the warehouse—I went up-stairs and told my father—I then came down, and distinctly saw Howes come out of the warehouse with a second sack—Smith then came out of the warehouse, and went about his ordinary business in the stable—I went out of the front door, and looked into York-street, but saw nothing there—I then walked to Moreton-street, where I saw a pony and cart—there was no one with it—I watched, and saw a man lead the pony and cart to our premises—it stop<lb></lb>ped at the back gate, and I heard something heavy put into the cart—the pony and cart then went on and stopped at the Rockingham Arms, at the corner of the Kent-road—the man went into the house—I went and looked at the cart, and saw the potatoes in it—the man then came out of the house—I saw it was the prisoner Roots—he went on with the cart—I followed him to Lock's-fields, Walworth, where I saw a policeman—I told him; and we followed the cart on to Clarence-buildings, where it stopped; and Roots took the potatoes into his own house—I went in and saw the pota<lb></lb>toes in the two sacks, which had my father's name on them—we lost two sacks that morning—I came home and give information, and the other prisoners were taken.</p>

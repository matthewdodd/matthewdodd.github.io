            . I am a waiter at the Rose and Crown. I was in the room with the prosecutrix, and saw the prisoner and a boy bring the trunk out of the parlour to take to the coach which she was going in - he put it on his shoulder and went out; I did not see him again till the 2nd of June, when he was in Bowling-alley - I fetched an officer, and asked what he had done with the trunk; he said he had made away with it, for he was in great distress at the time, and desired me not to expose him before the company; he had been at the Rose and Crown about three weeks.</p>

            . I lived at the Black Horse. I was in the tap, and saw the prosecutor take a glass of gin at the bar - he then went into the tap-room to have a pint of ale - he gave me a shilling, and I brought him 9d. - he put his purse down to take the change, and the prisoner put her arm over the purse, and took it into her apron - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150042"></xptr>could see she was taking the money out of it under the table, she put it into her pocket - she then put the empty purse into a basket - I told some persons what I had seen, and my mistress told me to tell my master - I told him - he came into the tap-room, and said to the prisoner, "If you do not give the man his money, I will send for the policeman" - she said she had no money but her own.</p>

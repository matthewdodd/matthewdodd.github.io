            . I am a tailor. I was at the Boot about half-past eight o'clock with the prosecutor -I saw the prisoner and upwards of thirty more in another part of the ground; they came up to our part and took a pot of ale from us - the prosecutor said it was not right - we then had a pot of porter come in, and they took that; I was knocked down by some of the party, and when I got up I saw the prisoner and Mr. Grubb in contact - I saw the prisoner drawing out the watch by the black ribbon from the pocket; I said they had been robbing him - one of them knocked me down again and said,"What is that to you?" there was then a great rush out; I said to a coachman, "Shut the door, we will let no more out till we get an officer;" the prisoner then went and sat down as if nothing had happened - the watch has not been found.</p>

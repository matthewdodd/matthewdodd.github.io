I cannot say which of them took the property; it happened just under a gas-lamp, at the corner of Perkins'-rents; he was taken in five minutes, about fifty yards from the spot. I had a black eye for a fortnight, and my thigh was very much bruised, where they had kicked me. I cannot say whether I was ill-used before or after I was robbed.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer's labourer, and had been supping with Mann. I live in Great Peter-street; we were going home together, and by the Duke's-head, there was a party, with bells; we attempted to pass them, on our way home. I was struck on the nose, and both my eyes were nearly closed - I got away as well as I could, and cannot say whether the prisoner was there.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prosecutor came to me; he appeared sober, and was bleeding at the nose and mouth; he said he had been knocked down by the bell-ringers, and had his pocket picked; he said the party were up the street. There were six bell-ringers: the prisoner was not one of them, but was standing by them, with a bottle in his hand - I found him with them, about sixty yards off - I held my lantern up to his face, and Mann immediately pointed him out - I said,</p>
               <p>"You are given in charge for ill-using this young man;" he said he had done nothing to him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HAYS. I was constable of the night. I searched the prisoner, and found only 1 1/2 d. upon him.</p>

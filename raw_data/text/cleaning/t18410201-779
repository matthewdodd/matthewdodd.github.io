                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, New-street, in the parish of Lambeth. On the 25th of January I left home, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with my wife—I left the front parlour-window quite secure, with a spring latch to it—I have a lodger, named Green—she was at home when I left, in the front-room first floor—I returned a little after eight, and found the parlour window broken, and the latch undone—I missed the images off the mantel-piece, and other articles stated, from the room.</p>

On the 25th of January I left the house, about half-past four o'clock, with my cousin, leaving nobody in the house—I shut the street-door, and am quite sure it was fastened—I returned between nine and half-past, after Mr. Martinelli, and missed three gold rings, four sovereigns, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, a small-box, a dress, two shawls, a pencil-case, and two handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jones, of No. 64, New-street, Kennington Cross. On the night of the 25th of January, I was coming home about ten minutes before seven o'clock, and saw three young men near Mr. Martinelli's house, whispering together—I passed them, and spoke to Churchill, who returned with me, and then I saw the same three young men come out of Martinelli's house—Churchill ran after the prisoner, who was one of them, and took him—two of the three had bun<lb></lb>dles, the other had not—the prisoner had a bundle—I went, and called a policeman—I pointed out the direction in which the young men had run, and he picked up a bundle down a street at the corner of Martinelli's house.</p>

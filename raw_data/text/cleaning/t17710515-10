               <p>- Scoffield. On Monday the 29th of last month, I returned from the other end of the town. The apprentice, Price, told me he had seen the prisoner through a hole I had cut (having suspected him) take some silver polishings from two of the boxes in the shop. I made this report to Mr. Carter; he ordered me to detain the prisoner; at night he returned. I kept him later than usual; he went away about nine. I sent Price for him; he hesitated to return, but did come. I asked him what he had in his pockets; he said, nothing: I bid him empty them. He took out several indifferent things, and turned out one pocket that had nothing in it: I bid him turn out the other; he kept his hand in it five minutes; I believe at last he took out these brushes (producing them.) I asked him how he came by them in his pocket; he said he did not know. Then I asked him if he had nothing else; then he pulled out some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150020"></xptr> polishings (producing them ) these rags have the polishings in them: we burn the rags, and the silver is tried and valued: the apprentices take it up every Saturday night, and lock it up; it fetches about fifteen shillings a pound. He first pleaded ignorance; at last he said he was drunk, and confessed he did it.</p>

            . * My master often cautioned me to watch the prisoner. The clerk made a hole in the wainscot; when all the men were gone, but the prisoner, I saw him come to the window and look out; then he went up to the polishing box. I could not perceive what he did; he fumbled there; then he went to the place where he generally sits, and put his hand into his pocket; then he came back again and went up to the other box, which I saw his hand in. I thought I saw it through his fingers as he went along; then he went to the same place were he used to sit, and put his hand in his pocket.</p>

            . I live in King street, Bloomsbury. I am a washer; we melt polishings and cleanse silver out of the dust, for gold and silversmiths. I have bought of the prisoner aprons and fronts of coats and waistcoats, which is their perquisites. I was once between a master and his man, and valued his apron and waistcoat, which the master paid him for.</p>
               <p>Q. What price do you give?</p>
               <p>Tabois. It is all an uncertainty, according as we thought it might be filled with silver, three, four or five shillings. I never bought any polishing of him.</p>

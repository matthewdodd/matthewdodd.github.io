               <p>I am a jeweller and silversmith, in the Strand, near Temple-bar. I know the prisoner at the bar, by coming to my shop the 10th of December last; I believe, it might be between the hours of three and four in the afternoon; he called at my shop to sell a piece of gold, which I have here in my hand; it weighs one ounce, six penny weights, and twelve grains, I imagine, it is worth about three pounds an ounce, from the trial that I made of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. The prisoner says he does not understand rightly, he is a German.</p>

               <p>Essex. I examined the gold, and it appeared to me from the state in which it was, that he was a workman to somebody that worked in the gold line; I enquired how the gold came in that state, he observed, that he was a spring maker; I understanding that he means, that he was a watch spring maker, I asked him, if he was a secret spring maker for watches? he said, he was, and these were drillings; I then observed, that it was impossible for these to come from drillings, such an immese quantity as he produced to me; he then appeared very much confused, and desired the gold again; I told him, I could not comply to his request, till he gave me proper information how he came by it; I was certain he had told me a falfity; he then observed, that it was watch cases, that he had melted down; I observed, I must take charge of him, and the gold too, till such times as I had better information; he then forced his way out; an apprentice of mine stood at the door to intercept his running out; he got out; a hue and cry took place, and he was taken in the street, and brought back to my house by strangers, I suppose, in the space of a quarter of an hour, there was such a number of people, I was obliged to shut up my shop; I then took him back into the shop, and requested of him to let me know, whom he lived with, that he had thrown a great deal of guilt upon his conduct, and that he must go with me to Bow-street; I asked him his name, and where he lived? he then observed, that his name was

I put him into the hands of a constable, and sent for Mr. Delauney; and Mr. Delauney, and we, went to Bow-street, together, and the Justice desired that I would go with Mr. Delauney, and search the prisoner's lodgings. I believe, it is in the house of Mr. Atkinson, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150004"></xptr>carpenter. I went to this house with Bathol the constable, and Mr. Delauney; we enquired, if Mr. Wolfel lived there, and was informed he did; we searched the lodgings; we found a quantity of gold, which will be produced to you; it was in my custody till we went before the Grand Jury, when I gave it up to the custody of the constable, sealed; the constable brings it here.</p>

               <p>This is the same gold received from Mr. Essex.</p>
               <p>Essex. In looking round the room I saw some charcoal, it struck me forcibly, that there must be some crucible, or something to melt it in. I found a crucible, in which gold had been melted, and in a large chest I found some gold, melted in the same state as that he offered at first for sale. I found all the rest of the parcels that are stated in the indictment; I took them to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed. There were a variety of parcels found, but the whole I gave to the constable sealed up, at the Grand Jury; some melted down, some in pieces, such as workmen use; the round pieces melted down, except that one he offered for sale, were in the chest; a pair of earrings were found amongst some soul clothes in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say, that he lodged in that house of Mr. Atkinson's? - He told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what apartment? - He said, it was on a ground floor, a small little room on the back of the shop; there is a shop in the front for hardware and toys; he seemed very much alarmed for his wife, as he called, a woman whom we found in the room, and his family; she came forward as his wife at Bow-street; the prisoner told us, that his wife was there, and had the key; we found the person there of the name of Sufanask Beazley. After we had examined the other places, I observed a large box, and she gave us the key to open it, and in that box, I found these parcels of gold, the lump, and some other small parcels; this little box was also in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever collect from the prisoner, to whom all this belonged? - He never mentioned any thing, but at Bow-street, that I heard; he there observed, that he brought it from Germany.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at all before you went to his apartment, that you should find any thing there? - I did not, I was only to go to his wife, to inform her where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way in which he acquainted you where he lodged? - I requested to know where he lived, that I might inform those about him of the situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know at all, to whom this property belonged? - Not to my knowledge, Mr. Delauney has sworn to some of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, only whether Mr. Delauney can swear to it.</p>

             and Giles Loyer, are my partners. I live at No. 7, Crown-street, Soho; we are working goldsmiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, and your two partners dwell in that house? - No, we do not all of us; the expence of the house is paid for jointly, but one of the partners lives out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, he worked with us, eight months and three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any of your property, your gold? - Yes, I missed gold at several times. I was sent for to Mr. Essex's, I went there, and he shewed me some gold, it was a little lump.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - Yes, I could not swear to it. After that, I went to Bow-street. I went with the constable and Mr. Essex, to search his lodgings, by the desire of Mr. Bond.</p>





               <p>Q. Did you see any thing, that you can swear to? - Yes, there are particulars here I can swear to; I can swear to the flat pieces, they are worth about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to them? - By the different carats being marked on the pieces of gold, we make use of twelve carats, eighteen carats, and twenty carats; and for fear the workmen should take wrong gold to use for different works, it was my custom to write the number of carats on the pieces of gold; these are so marked, they are scratched with a file, I marked them on both sides, because, being in a hurry, the men might know at once what gold to employ; some of these pieces are here, five are marked eighteen and others twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing for people in your line of business to do the same way? - I do not know, it is my way.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at these figures do you mean to swear to your figures? - I do, I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that these figures are your hand writing? - I do, I mean to say also that there are some other pieces that I believe are mine, but I am not so positive as the others; the ear-rings are of a pattern that I had in my house, and the prisoner had such to make, but I cannot swear to them; I often missed the gold, and complained several times that I did not know how the gold was going off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made the mark on the gold myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Delauney. Are you positive that you made these marks on the gold? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have come from Germany about three years, I brought the things from there, I have no witness because the time was so short I could not get them over from Germany.</p>

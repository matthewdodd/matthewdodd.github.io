My servant not returning, I went there and found him in great distress, and found he had been defrauded. I am servant to the prosecutor. I was sent with nineteen pair of silk stockings; the prisoner received me in the dining room. I delivered him the stockings; he said he would go and shew them to his master in the next room: I was rather dubieus about trusting him; but being in the same house, I thought they were safe, so I let him have them to shew his master. The prisoner did not return again, so, after waiting some time, I opened the door where I thought to find the prisoner and his master; there was nobody there: upon enquiry I found he had no interest there; he only lay there that night, in a lodging taken for his master. The prisoner was taken that night; eighteen pair of the stockings were found on him.</p>

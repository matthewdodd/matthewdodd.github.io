               <p>Q. Did you miss any goods? - A. No; there were three young men in the shop, besides, all the time; there was a report that a woman was taken up with linen-drapery goods upon her, and I went to the watch-house from curiosity; that was about three quarters of an hour after she had left the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the same woman? - A. Yes; there I saw two remnants of print, three cotton shawls, and the print I had sold her; the remnants of print were of a different pattern from what I had sold her; she had one remnant that I had not sold her, of six yards, and another of eight yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose property were they? - A. Mr.

The prisoner was my apprentice—on the 20th of August, in the evening, when I returned from London I found the prisoner in cus<lb></lb>tody—I afterwards saw these three pieces of cloth—I heard that it was gone and then I missed it—this is it—it is my property.</p>

On the 20th of August, I was in the prisoner's bed-room between three and four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—the prisoner came down from the workshop into that room, which was very unusual—he saw me and he quitted the room very shortly after—I waited till he was gone, and looked into his box—it was without a key—I found in it a piece of cloth tied in a handkerchief—I took it into the cutting-room to one of our young men, and gave it to him—he went down and found in the prisoner's box another piece of cloth.</p>

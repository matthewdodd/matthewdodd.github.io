Early on the morning of the 14th of March, I had three lockers broke open between the hours of two and three o'clock in the morning, I had three lockers broke open, and out of one of these lockers were eight hens and two cocks roosted, and they were took away from that place, it was over the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the stable in an enclosed yard? - No, no further than there is a little gate sometimes open and sometimes shut; no proper bars to the gate. I see those ten fowls there on the 13th; in the evening they were all safe, they were at two o'clock; likewise a coal-shed locker broke open, and they took a hand saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your coal-shed close to the stable? - No; my coal-shed leads into the kitchen, they never attempted the door that goes into the kitchen; the other room that lets for two shillings a week, they broke open that, thinking the fowls were there, that was joining the stable. They were common locks, one was broke and split in two.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night preceding, were all the locks fast? - They were all three of them; they were all forced, the nails were drawn out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you lay this to the prisoner at the bar? - I only know by the witnesses.</p>

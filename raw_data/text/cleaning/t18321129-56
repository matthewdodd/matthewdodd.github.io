On the 23rd of June I remember seeing a cart coming for the goods, between four and five o'clock; I was in the warehouse, and saw the person who came for the goods in the warehouse, but do not know him; I saw him remove two cases and a truss - one case was about four feet long and three high, and the other a smaller one - the truss was packed in canvas; they were to be sent to Dent and Co., at Worcester, from the Rose-inn, Farringdon-street; Robinson drove the cart - I only saw his back; the cases and truss were taken out of the warehouse and put into the cart - the prisoner Pedley generally called at our warehouse on Saturday morning, to know if there were any goods to go to Carron-wharf; and he would take goods to pitch as he passed by other wharfs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You only saw the back of the driver? A. No; I do not swear it was Robinson - I saw him in the same dress at the office; he wore a dark drab jacket.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long did you look at him? A. Only as I came down stairs; there was a cart there at the time; I saw Robinson when he was in custody - the Magistrate told him to turn round: I said, as far as I could tell from his back, he was the man; he was dressed the same as the man was.</p>

            . In June last I was in the employ of Mr. Thomas Elston, an owner of town-carts. On Saturday, the 23rd of June, I was out with one of the carts; coming through Dowgate-hill, between four and five o'clock, and I was hired by John Ellis, who took me to the corner of Friday-street - I was dressed as I am now; I went to the first house on the right-hand side of Cheapside - when I got there, Ellis put three packages into the cart, which he brought out of the warehouse; I did not go into the warehouse - I remained in the cart; the packages were two deal cases, and a small truss - one case was rather bigger than the other, the truss was covered with a kind of sackcloth; I did not see any body belonging to the warehouse - Ellis got into the cart, and by his direction, I turned round to the left, towards St. Paul's, and when I got twenty or thirty yards, he told me to turn round, and go back down Cheapside - Pedley and Wall were at a distance; they did not join the cart at all, till I got where I was desired to go by Ellis - I was ordered to go to Castle-alley, and they joined me there; I was ordered to go to Smith's, in Castle-alley, by Ellis - I had seen Pedley before; they joined the cart at Smith's, and each took a parcel out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Pedley when you first saw him after Ellis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290030"></xptr>hired you? A. Pedley and Wall were both twenty or thirty yards from Ellis, walking on up Dowgate-hill, towards Cheapside, they passed by after I got to the warehouse, while the goods were loading into the cart; I had got about ten or twenty yards down Cheapside before I saw them again; they were following the cart down, going in the same direction as the cart, and about twenty yards from it; after seeing them then, I did not see them any more till I got to Castle-alley, which is in Whitechapel, near Wentworth-street - there is no thoroughfare in the alley for carts - it leads strait into Whitechapel; my cart drew up Castle-alley - Pedley and Wall were there by the time I got there, they were at the end of the court, ready to take the goods out when I drew up; they were up the alley - they each took a package, and went up the court with it; I did not see what house they went into - I was not there above ten minutes; Ellis paid me 10s. for the cart, in the evening, in Church-lane, Whitechapel, in the street; nobody was present when he paid me - I was afterwards apprehended, in consequence of this, by Lee, and made this statement to him after I was taken; I afterwards went with Lee to Castle-alley, and pointed out the place where the cart stood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a turning to the left in Castle-alley leading to Castle-place? A. At the bottom there is - there are five or six houses in Castle-place; I believe Castle-street is to the right - I never saw Smith at all; the cart stopped very near the bottom of Castle-alley - the horse's head stood towards Whitechapel; the cart stood at the turning that the goods went up - they were taken up the turning to the left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come into Castle-alley out of Whitechapel? A. No, there is no thoroughfare there; I got into it by the brewhouse - I might be there ten minutes; I am positive I was not longer - I got into the cart, and delivered the goods to them; the cart stood still in the same place till I drove away - I am positive I did not back into any premises, if any body has said so, it is not true; master has four carts, three large and one smaller - the large ones may be eight feet wide; the one I drive was No. 152,884.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. The first time you saw Pedley he was walking up Dowgate-hill? A. Yes, with Wall, and they passed as I was loading the cart; I saw them in Cheapside, and saw no more of them till I got to Castle-alley - I there delivered the goods to Ellis, Pedley, and Wall.</p>

            . I am married - my husband is abroad; I live now at No. 44, Russel-street, Mile-end-road. In June last I lived at No. 8, Castle-place, Whitechapel - I know the prisoner Smith; I was in his house about ten weeks, to take care of his children, three years ago - he then lived at No. 2, Castle-place; I went to live in Castle-place about a week or fortnight after last Christmas -Smith was not then living at No. 2, for he had had two rooms made at his shed, or warehouse, in Castle-alley; that was where his business was carried on - I cannot say what his business was, further than it was receiving stolen goods - while I lived with him he was receiving stolen property; the warehouse in Castle-alley, and his house, in all in the same place - it is not a stone's throw; we have to turn round from one to the other; the alley goes up towards Whitechapel; the warehouse is in Castle-alley. On Saturday, the 23rd of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a town cart driven down round Castle-alley, by the witness Robinson - the cart was backed into Smith's premises; I saw it back into Smith's premises - I saw it drive down - I could not see any thing taken from the cart, as it was backed into the premises -I saw two packing-cases, and a truss in it: the truss was covered with canvas; I saw the cart go away empty in about twenty minutes, and in about an hour and three-quarters I saw another cart, a brown cart - Smith, the prisoner, came out of his premises with it; it had the name of Dunn on it, with the same packing-cases apparently as had just before gone in in the town-cart, but not the truss - Smith was in the cart; nobody else - it was a light brown cart, with a seat in it, made more like a chaise-cart.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You lived at Smith's, as a servant at the time the cart came? A. No, I lived at Mrs. Morris', No. 3, Castle-place; that is in the same line of buildings as Smith lived in - I know his premises, and the way into his back yard, and the gateway into it - I saw the town cart back into his premises, through the gates, into the back yard - I saw Robinson drive the cart round the corner of Castle-alley, and he backed it into the yard - the gates were closed; I could not see any thing taken out of the cart; Robinson, the horse and cart, were all inclosed inside the gates, which were closed - I saw that; I saw nobody but him with the cart, neither taking it in nor out - it came out empty; I saw nobody else go into the yard; he backed it in, and somebody closed the gates inside - I could not see who was inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been looking into the yard before the cart came? A. No; I was standing close to my own place when the cart passed - there was nobody in it but Robinson; I saw nobody else pass; I know Mr. Allum, at No. 4, Castle-alley - I never lived with him - Mr. Morris has been a master-hackneyman, but now drives a cab; his wife lives with him - after leaving Smith's, I went to a house in Brathwaite's-buildings, Finsbury; Smith was a receiver of stolen goods when I lived with him - that was the reason I left, so many bad characters came backwards and forwards - I discovered it about six weeks after I went to live with him, but waited there till I could suit myself with a house; my husband lived with me at that time - he is now in America; he went last May - I never asked Smith for money after I left him; I know

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended Robinson on the 21st of September - he did not at first make a statement of the share he had in the transaction, but did afterwards - I took Pedley the same day (before I took Robinson), and told him it was for taking some goods from a warehouse in Friday-street; he said he knew nothing about it, and asked me when - I told him about June; he said it was very hard he should be taken, it was not him, for he was in confinement at the time - he did not say where; he said he had been tried and acquitted; I asked him what he had been - he said he had been a porter at the Carron wharf; I afterwards took Robinson - he went with me to Castle-alley: I pointed out where the cart stood - the prisoner Smith was in custody at the time, taken for another affair; I searched the premises, and found a tinplate there, with the name of William Dunn on it - I gave it to an officer here last Session; Smith's premises have a side door, which goes up a passage to his house, and then there are two folding gates leading to a shed; you can enter either by a side door or the gates - his premises go to the corner of the wall; I have been to the prosecutors' premises - they are the first house on the right-hand side from Cheapside.</p>

             (Police-constable H 150.) I received a plate from Lee, but have left it at home; I have been to Smith's, shed two or three times since this transction - I noticed a van there and two chaises on the 12th of September, as near as I can recollect; I apprehended Smith on the 12th or 13th of September, at the Three Crowns, Castle-street, and told him it was on suspicion of receiving stolen property - he said he knew nothing at all of it; I watched his premises for twenty-one days before he was taken, and noticed several well known thieves going there- I saw Mr. Dunn's cart go there several times; it is a brown cart - I should call it a common stage cart.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. That was when she quarrelled with him? A.

               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell us the dimensions of the cart? A. I should think it is about five feet without the wheels, and six or seven feet, including the wheels.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Could you not back a cart that width, through a gateway eight feet two inches? A. No, the street is not wide enough to turn it; there is no footway on either side - I do not recollect any curb on either side; I did not go down to the bottom of the street - there is no curb by Smith's gate; the gates were open when I tried to back the cart - the gateway is up the street; I went inside his shed, and saw a four wheeled van there - I should not think that is longer than our cart, not shafts and all; it is a longer van, but they are very narrow compared to a town cart.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you get out of the alley with your cart? A. I backed it out all the way, because I could not turn it; Mr. Elston sent me to try it, by Smith's desire - Smith was with me, and saw me do it; I have been a carman eight or nine years, but only worked for Elston a few weeks.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I did not turn the cart round; it was not so high up as the gate - I backed into Castle-place, and turned round.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Elston's employ. He had four carts in June, three large and one small; three are of the same size - I never measured them; Robinson used to drive one of the large ones; he always drove the same cart.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you in Elston's employ now? A. No - he is in health, and attends to his business.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMSON. Pedley was taken up on a charge of robbing me, on the 1st of July; I was robbed on the 30th of June.</p>

             re-examined. I pointed the gateway out to the officer; I did not see where the goods were carried into; my cart was within ten yards of the gateway - I remained by my horse.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the persons took the parcels<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290033"></xptr>out do you mean to say they took them to Smith's premises? A. I could did not tell where they took them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the men pass the gateway? A. No, nor did they go to it: there was no door between the cart and gateway; the men went out of my sight up the alley; they did not go to the gateway - they did not go towards the gateway; they went up the alley, away from it - I never saw Smith.</p>

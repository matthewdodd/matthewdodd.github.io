The prisoner came there about six o'clock in the evening of the 16th of January, and asked to look at some shoes, but none of them suited her; I was trying some shoes on her, and she appeared to put her hand to a glass-case which was near her- I looked up, and saw a pair of shoes under her shawl; I looked at them - she then took them from under her shawl, and seemed to be looking at them - she then put them down, and went out. Mr. Packer shewed me this pair of shoes the same evening, which I knew to be my employer's - I had not sold them.</p>

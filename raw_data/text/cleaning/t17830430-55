               <p>I must introduce a little story; about the 13th of March last, a genteel dressed looking man knocked at my door, and enquired for lodgings, I had a bill for my first floor on my window, I live in <placeName id="t17830430-55-crimeloc307">Beaufort-buildings Strand</placeName>

               <p>Court. Is that the sword that he dropped in the scuffle? - This is the sword, it has hung in my parlour seven weeks; I am sure of the man, though his dress is changed, his hair and face are the same, but he had on then a scarlet coat.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge the charge laid against me, it is the first time I ever was arraigned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300112"></xptr> at this bar, and I submit myself to the mercy of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What are you? - I have been brought up to the sea.</p>
               <p>What was you? - In the India service, and I have been in the navy, I was midshipman in an Indiaman and in a man of was both, I was in the Worcester Indiaman, and was pressed into the King's service; I happened to fall into the company of this man, and being in want of money I took the sword; my character was never before impeached.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was the King's ship? - The Blenhelm.</p>

We were shearing from May till the end of June; the wool was put into a loft by the side of a barn. I missed some several times; one Wood had been employed by the bailiff; he lived with one Pinto - the prisoner lodged in the same house. I missed wool in July, and put some on a hurdle on Wednesday morning, the 16th, between ten and eleven o'clock, and missed it on the 17th about six in the morning - there was a fleece among it with particular marks on it - that was gone; and in consequence of information I went to Chaplin's house; he shewed me some wool, which was part of what I had laid on the hurdle; the loft was locked up; and I found somebody had pushed the board-up to get to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. The board required to be moved to get to it - Q. Yes; it was pushed in. The prisoner was not in my master's employ - but I knew him. Wood was taken, but has escaped.</p>

            . I live at Cheshunt, about seven miles from the prosecutor's, and am a dealer in wool. On the 17th of July last, about six o'clock in the morning, I bought about 141 lbs. of wool from Wood, for 5 l. 13 s. - the prisoner was with him - they brought it on a horse and cart with the name of Bushby on it. I paid 
               <persName id="t18230910-230-person2101">Wood</persName>
             the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. All you know is that the prisoner was with the person who sold it you - A. Yes; I never paid the prisoner for any - he helped to unload it - Wood made the bargain. Wood had often brought wool before; Lane only came twice with him, and appeared to be his servant.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. I apprehended Lane, on the Monday, at Pinto's, where Wood lodged - I found about a pound of wool, in a bag in the closet, in Lane's room, and found a bed tick doubled up, under the bed, and some little pieces of wool inside it, as if it had contained wool. Lane's wife and children lived in the same room. Wood is quite a little boy, about fourteen years old, and very little for his age.</p>

            . Wood was quite a lad - nobody could take him for a man; he might appear sixteen or eighteen years old. I know the fleece by the tie up, and ochre. Wood had left us at the time it was stolen; he had left us for four months; but came backwards and forwards at times.</p>

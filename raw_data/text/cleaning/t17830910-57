               <p>I am a watchman belonging to St. George's, I was coming off my watch about a quarter after five, and the last witness was standing, and he said there had been some house-breaking, and we pursued the man into Charles-court, one of them got into a house in that court, and he shut the door against me, and presently the prisoner came with a bed on his back down the court, he came from towards Albemarle-street, I ran away from the door where the other was, to assist in taking this Harpur, and he was secured, we then went to the house where the other went in.</p>
               <p>(The bed and coverlid produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is that bed and coverlid worth? - I do not know, the Justice put them down what they were worth, if I was going to buy them, I would give two pounds for them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was hired to carry this bed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, as to the burglary, this was no dwelling house at that time, that is one reason why it is not capable of having a burglary committed in it; another reason is, this woman says she had not seen the house for a week before, therefore she cannot say any thing to the security of the house the night before, therefore there do not seem to concur any of those ingredients which constitute a burglary. - The next question is as to the stealing, and here the value may be material; you hear this man does not stretch it higher than forty shillings, which is the utmost verge that the law goes to, and perhaps that would be too much for you to go to.</p>

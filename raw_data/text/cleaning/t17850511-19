               <p>Court. Was this shoving arising from the great croud and concourse of people, or on purpose? - It appeared to me to be on purpose.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing like a blow struck, before the watch was taken? - Not before the watch was taken, I do not remember there was any violent blow, only pushing and hustling from one to another.</p>
               <p>What it that kind of hustling that arises from a croud; or did any particular person appear to be pushing you? - I cannot say that I took any particular notice of what any one man did more than another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief-clerk at Bow-street police-office. On 10th Jan. Mr. Sellers was brought there, before Mr. Henry, the Magi<lb></lb>strate, in charge of Grant—there was no name on the charge-sheet at first, and I asked him his name—he said, "l am a clergyman; am I obliged to give it;" the Magistrate said, "You are obliged to give it," and he then gave his name "Rev. Henry Charles Sellers, curate at Send, near Guildford"—the prisoner was then sworn and examined as a witness—I took his statement down, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Samuel Cooper, on his oath, saith as follows: I am a private in the second battalion Scotch Fusilier Guards. I was posted as sentry last night, 9th Jan., at the Duchess of Kent's door, in Palace-yard, about half-past ten. I observed the defendant coming towards me, smoking a cigar. He went towards the Milkhouse-gate, leading to the Park, and through one gate and returned immediately by another, and walked by the side of the wall of the Duke of Sutherland's house. He crossed over towards me, and said to me, 'It is a wet night.' I said it was. At this time I was standing under the portico of the Duchess of Kent's house, and he was still smoking. He asked me who I was keeping guard over. I replied, 'The Duchess of Kent.' He said, 'Did you say the Duchess of?' substituting another word. I said, 'No, Sir; the Duchess of Kent.' He immediately caught hold of my private parts as he said those words; and I at the same time seised him by the collar, and took him to the guard-room, where I left him in charge of the sergeant of the guard. At the time he laid hold of me by the private parts he did not say a word to me. On my way with him to the guard-room he said, 'I have done nothing to you.' I said, 'You have, Sir.' I think he was perfectly sober at the time. I had my great-coat on, and the defendant put his hand under it when he seized me by the private parts. I have been twelve years in the regiment, and in the same batallion.'")—Mr. Sellers was called on to find bail to answer the charge at the Sessions, himself in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two sureties of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Mr. Sellers make any statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I took it down in writing—he was duly cautioned—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—'I asked him the question who he was keeping guard over, and when he answered, I repeated the same words that he did. Such a thought as he alleges against me never entered my head. I am completely at the mercy of the man. I utterly deny the charge. I had a cigar in my mouth. I remained some time under the shelter of the portico. I was going as far as Pimlico, but it rained fast, and I stood for shelter under the portico. I stayed there sometime, and then I spoke to the man, and he seized me. I am a clergyman, and curate of Send, near Guildford.'")—I have got the charge-sheet here—when it was brought to me I fancy there was no name on it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I may be mistaken in that—I find here, in my own handwriting, "Send, near Guildford, a clergy<lb></lb>man"—it is my impression that there was no name, because the name of "Henry Sadler" is in another handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">The charge-sheet being read, the name of "Henry Sadler, Send, near Guildford, clergyman" appeared as the party charged with indecently assaulting the complainant while on duty in the Stable-yard, in the parish of St. James's.

                  </hi>. I reside at Send, near Guildford. I am curate of that parish, and have been so nine months—before that I was curate at Sibble Headingham, near Halstead in Essex, for three years—I am of the University of Cambridge—I have been married a year and a half—I came to London, from Send, on 9th Jan., in consequence of a communication which I received from Sibble Headingham, where my wife was staying with her sister, being in delicate health—I arrived in London by the train, which arrives at Waterloo-station at half-past six o'clock; but I think it was rather late—I proceeded to the Bell and Crown, Holborn, and engaged a bed-room there for the night—I bad a carpet-bag with me, which I left there—I then went as far as Oxford-street, and made a call at a shop there—I then went to a tavern in Rupert-street, Coventry-street, to get some dinner—I should think it was between nine and ten when I had finished my dinner—I then went down as far as the Treasury—I have a friend, named Middleton, residing at Upper Eaton-street, Grosvenor-place—it was my intention to visit him—from the Treasury I returned, and went along Pall-mall to St. James's, along the path that leads under the portico of the Duchess of Kent's house—as I passed under the portico I saw there was a soldier there—I went through the iron gates into the Park, and then returned, because I fancied the rain increased—I came back to the same portico, and remained under it—the soldier was there still—whether I said to him, "It is a wet night," or he first addressed me, I am not positive; but I said before that I addressed him, saying, "It is a wet night"—my doubt is, whether I addressed him saying that, or whether I assented to what he said—he said, "It is," or words to that effect—I then asked him who he was keeping guard over, and he said, "The Duchess of Kent;" and I repeated the words after him, "Oh, the Duchess of Kent"—on my oath I did not, in the slightest degree, alter the pro<lb></lb>nunciation of that word; I did not think it—he seized me by the collar, and used words that I do not exactly recollect, to the purport of my having indecently touched or assaulted him—on my oath I had not touched him, or attempted to do so—he proceeded to take me to the guard-room—I believe we passed another sentry at his post, but I did not notice—we found a lot of soldiers in the guard-room—the prisoner asked for the sergeant, and said, "I charge this man with indecently assaulting me"—I denied it, and asked to see the officer of the guard—I was told it was a police-case, I could not see the officer—a policeman was sent for, and I was given into his custody—while I was in the guard-house 1 did not hear the prisoner charge me with having made use of any indecent expression—I was then taken to the station-house—the prisoner went with me, and made a charge against me—I was asked ray name—I said, "Am I obliged to give it?" or something to that effect—they said, "You are not obliged to give it now, but you will have to give it in the morning, at the Court"—I then refused to give it—this</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the night of 9th Jan. I was on duty at Sir Henry Wheatley's door, which is between the sentinel at the Duchess of Kent's door and the guard-house—about twenty or twenty-five minutes past ten I saw the prisoner pass by where I was posted, close to me, with the gentleman—he had hold of his collar with his left hand, and had his gun in his right—I cannot say whether the bayonet was fixed or not—a man is supposed to have it fixed when he is sentinel—supposing a sentinel wants assistance, it is his duty to call to the next sentinel, and if he is too far off to hear him there are plenty of people passing by—I was near enough to hear him if he had called—if I had heard him call I should have called to the next sentinel, who was at the guard-house door—a sentinel is not allowed, under any circumstances, to leave his post—I left my post that night at about ten minutes to twelve—I then went to the guard-house—the prisoner was there, and said he was very sorry he had had anything to do with taking the gen<lb></lb>tleman in charge, but the old b—did not offer to <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> up with anything, or be would have let him go; he said it was a pity but what he had been on the Colour-post, or some other post, where there had not been so many people about, when he would have had all the b—lot he had got, money, rings, watch and all—he said it was a beautiful little gold watch, about the size of a half-crown—I said to him, "A watch is a very dangerous thing to have anything to do with"—he said, "Oh, I would have put that out of sight for three or four days; I would have swallowed it"—he stated that the gentleman had refused to give his name when he got to the station, but he gave it after a time, and he said what he saw taken from him—that he would not give it up, but it was taken from him by force—he said he saw some notes, gold, silver, a half-mourning ring, and a watch—that was all I heard him say—I was tired and went and laid down.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the Fusileers, in the same battalion as the prisoner—I remember a conversation on the subject of this charge in the barrack a day or two after the 9th Jan.—there were several soldiers pre<lb></lb>sent beside the prisoner—the prisoner stated that he was on sentry at the Duchess of Kent's, about ten o'clock, and a gentleman came up to him at his post, and remarked that it was a wet evening, and inquired whom he was gentry over? to which he replied, "The Duchess of Kent," and the gentleman replied," Oh! the Duchess of—," that the gentleman then put his hand under his, the prisoner's, great coat, on his private parts, on which he took him into custody, and took him to the guard-room—he then described the property that was taken from the gentleman at the police-station—he said there were notes, gold, and silver; I cannot recollect the amount, and that there was also a gold watch, and he said if he bad been on the Colours a b-----y end to him, but he should have had the whole lot, gold watch and all—there is a post called the Colours in the yard of the grand entrance of St. James's Palace—it is in what is called "Colour-court"—it is a more private place than where he was on sentry.</p>

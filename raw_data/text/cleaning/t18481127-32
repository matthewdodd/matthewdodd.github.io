                  </hi>. In Oct. last, I was barman at Mr. Potter's, the White Horse, High-street, Shoreditch. I usually go by the name of George—I had known the prisoner by sight, for about three months before 25th Oct. last—I have seen him at our house several times—on 25th Oct., I noticed him leaning against the counter there at nearly three o'clock—he was in one of the boxes with which the bar is fitted up—there was a man with him in the same box—they were there when I came down from dinner, and about five minutes after that the prisoner spoke to me, and said, "George I want you, I have something to show you"—he said that gently—I asked him what it was, and he said it was a note—I did not see anything in his hand at the time—I asked him what it was about, if he could not read it—he said it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and if I would come outside he would show it me—I said, "I could not come out I had my business to attend to"—he then spoke to the man with him, and I afterwards explained to Mr. Potter who was in the bar what had happened—I then spoke to the prisoner again, and I asked him to give me the note, and I would take it into the yard and look at it—he gave me three notes, and said, "There is three of them"—I took them into the yard to look at them, and called Mr. Potter—I gave them into his hands, and he took the numbers of them—I called them out to him one at a time—he then gave them back to me, and I put them into my pocket—I returned to to the bar again—the prisoner was there, and the man with him—I asked the prisoner what he wanted for the notes—he said I could have the three for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him where he got them—the man was with him at the time, and they both answered at one time, and said, "I found them opposite Bishopsgate Church"—I told the prisoner that I did not want them:—the other man went out directly after—I asked the prisoner where he was gone to, and he said he was just gone outside—he came in again in about five minutes—he went out again in two or three minutes—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner where he was gone, and he said he was gone to get some dinner at the cook-shop—I said, "Is he not come back yet?"—he said, "No, I will go and fetch him if you like"—I said he had better not go, perhaps he would be back again—I said, "I wished him to come back again before I gave him the notes"—the notes were quite new, clean, and folded up when the prisoner handed them to me—they were much cleaner then they are now—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—about ten minutes after the other man went out the second time, the policeman Taylor came in, and asked me in the prisoner's presence, if I was the young man that bad had any notes offered me—I said, "Yes"—I had the three notes in my possession at the time—Taylor asked the prisoner if he was the man that bad offered the notes—he said, "Yes," and he took him into custody, and we all three went to the station—on our way there we met police-sergeant Eves, to whom I gave the notes—they had not been out of my sight since the prisoner gave them me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse, Shoreditch. On 25th Oct., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner standing close to the counter, leaning over, as though he wanted to speak to some one—there was one man behind him, and another drinking a glass of ale at the side—thinking they were waiting to be served, I directed Ritches to serve them—he said that they had been served—he came to me shortly after, and I asked what the man wanted, and he said he had some notes that he wanted to show him—the prisoner could not hear that—Ritches came to me with a newspaper in his hand that the men should not think that he came to speak to me about the notes—I directed him to get the notes to take the numbers, and see if they were correct—he got them and showed them to me in the yard; they were perfectly new—I took the numbers and dates of them—these three produced are them—I am in the habit of taking a great many notes, and I knew that these were not genuine by the paper—in consequence of that I told Ritches to hold conversation with him privately, and not pay any attention to other customers till I went for a con<lb></lb>stable—I told him to keep the notes—I then went into the street, and observed five other persons going in and out into the bos adjoining where the prisoner was, and two or three others going into the other box, and listening over the partition to hear what passed between Ritches and the prisoner—they appeared to watch to see what we determined to do—I was waiting for a constable I had sent for—Taylor came, and I communicated the circum<lb></lb>stances to him, and pointed out the other persons to him, but he did not seem to take so much interest in the matter as I considered he would have done—I afterwards directed him to take the prisoner into custody—the other man came out of the door as I was speaking to Taylor.</p>

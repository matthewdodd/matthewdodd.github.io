On the 25th of July, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I was in Tothill-street, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and put it in his left breast—there was another man with him—the prisoner said "hush" to him—he got away—I followed the prisoner, lost sight of him for a few minutes, caught sight of him again, and am sure he is the same person—I took particular notice of him—there was a lamp—I swear to him.</p>

When my house was on fire, the prisoner came to assist me in moving my goods. The fire was in the morning, and about seven in the evening on the same day, a pawnbroker came to me, and asked me if I had lost any silver spoons; I said, yes. I went with him to his house, where he had stopped two spoons, but not the man. He said he knew him very well, and that his name was Dallaway. I said I knew him too.

            . I am servant to Mr. Keyte, a pawn broker, the prisoner brought these two spoons (produced in Court and deposed to) to our shop the morning that he fire happened and said he was sent with then by Mr. Brown, and wanted half-a-guinea up them. I had heard there had been a fire at Hungersord, so I asked him if he had been at it. He said, Yes. I said, I hoped he had not taken them; he said, No, he had not. I stopped them, and sent for Mr. Brown. He came, owned the spoons, and took them away. A little time after he came back with the prisoner, and there were four more found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you deliver these spoons to the prisoner to take care of them for you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not, nor to pawn neither.</p>

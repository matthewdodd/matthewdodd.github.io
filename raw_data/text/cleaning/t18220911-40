            . On the evening of the 29th of August, about nine o'clock, I was returning to my house in the Commercial Road, with Mr. Taylor and my family, my watch was in my fob, and my coat was buttoned over it. About three minutes before the robbery, the prisoner looked me full in the face and passed me, and opposite <placeName id="t18220911-40-crimeloc219">Philpot-street</placeName>

I pursued, and Captain Taylor called Stop thief! he was stopped before I lost sight of him - he had no hat on. The property was found. I said I would give 5 l. 5 s. for them, and the man who stopped him went with others in search, and found them.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was crossing Stepney-fields, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running into the fields, and others pursuing him; he was the first - I secured him. Mr. Ellem came up in a moment, and said that was the man who had robbed him. He was taken to the watch-house. I went with a lanthorn in search of the property - we found it in a field where he had run.</p>

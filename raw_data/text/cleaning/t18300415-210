            . The prisoner lodged at a house of mine, and I let this property to her as part of the furniture - she came on the 22nd of February, and went away on the 1st of March; she gave me no notice, but remained out all night - she returned on the Tuesday evening; I then went up stairs - as I was going into the room, shew as coming out with this counterpane tied up in a handkerchief; I asked if she had got any rent for me - she said she had not; I went into the room, put down the bedstead, and missed two sheets, two blankets, and a pillow; I asked what was become of them - she said if I would go with her to her mistress, at Portland-town, she would get her to be answerable for their return - I went, but she refused; I have never had them.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COOK. I took up the prisoner - she said if the prosecutor would give her time, she would replace the goods; she owned she had taken them, and sold them at a rag-shop, but could not tell where unless she went to the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been absent from home between the 14th and the 20th. - A. Yes; to put my furniture in. On the 20th, about six or seven o'clock in the evening I entered the room, I found the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have your room door locked. - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the padlock been forced or picked. - A. The door was not forced, I found they were both locked; when I come I cannot say, whether he got in at the door or at the window, it was in the front garret.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window fastened. - A. The window had no fastening at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your things again. - A. The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know nothing of your own knowledge, that this man took them. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DONALDSON sworn. Q. You are a constable of St. Martin's in the Fields, did you apprehend the prisoner. - A. I went with a search warrant to No. 45, Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives there - A. Mr. Genou; the prisoner's mother is the house keeper.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Is that the house that you had the room in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I searched the prisoner's bed room as I supposed; I found nothing in that room, I then went down to the landlady, Mrs. Genou, to enquire where her son worked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner. - A. Yes, I told him that I wanted him to go home with me to be present when I searched his bed room; in the shop where I took him, I asked him if he had any keys, with that he pulled out these keys, he said these are all the keys I have; he went home to his bed room with me; I searched his person, I found these two duplicates, one of a table spoon, and six tea spoons; the other duplicates is two sheets, and two table cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any thing by these duplicates. - A. Yes, the prosecutrix, as soon as I got the duplicates, she was very much alarmed indeed; the pawnbroker has got the spoons and all the property. I then told the prosecutrix to bring me the padlock; I tried these keys, they would not open it; I said to the prisoner where is the key you opened the padlock with, he said I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I deny it.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I am quite sure that he said that, my brother officer is here that heard the same; this other key is the key of the bed room door, and this key will open the room where the prosecutrix's things are; it opens the front, and the back garret, this key was in the back garret door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. Can you solmnly swear that I told you that I had lost the key that opened the padlock. - A. You did, you told me that you had lost the key, that I swear to.</p>

I had two guns and two gun-cases at my door on the 19th of January; I missed them about one o'clock; I inquired about them, and about two o'clock I found them at the Hand and Flower public-house, between Kensington and Hammersmith, and knew them to be mine - I saw the prisoner coming from the Hand and Flower, and I took him into custody. I had seen him and another about my house a little before I missed them.</p>

            . My husband keeps the Hand and Flower. On the day in question I went into my tap-room, saw the guns there, and took them into the bar; I saw the prisoner going into the back premises - I followed him, and said, "Are you one of the prisoners? there is a cry of thieves about;" he said, "I brought the guns into the house, but the other gave me 6d. to bring them:" another person, a head and shoulders taller than himself, came in with him. I gave the same guns which they brought to the prosecutor; I believe the prisoner got out of our back premises, and got over into the road.</p>

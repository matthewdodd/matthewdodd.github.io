               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>M. Elliot. No, but I saw him in London since; I met him as I happened to go through Clement's-inn and stopped him, and asked him how he did, and if he was not the person that I saw with handcuffs on at Chatham. *</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you kept up an acquaintance since you saw him in London?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you meet him in London?</p>
               <p>M. Elliot. He was standing at his father's door, and asked me to come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been come from Chatham?</p>
               <p>M. Elliot. About a year and a half, or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come to when you came to London?</p>
               <p>M. Elliot. I went to Epping first; I staid there about three or four months; the first place after that was at Capt. Wood's.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I don't remember the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it early in the morning?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. It was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days might you stay at Chatham after this?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Never a day at all; I came up to London and sold my things as I came along.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find it out that it was this young man?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because he was coming thro' Lumber-court, and I took notice of him by the cast of his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. That was half a year ago; I was in the court and knew him directly; there was a woman along with him, it was the prisoner at the bar; it was she subpoened me, that is Mr. Davis did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever had any conversation with the prisoner about this affair before you was subpoened?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. No, not till I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know where to find you out?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because I knew them, and I said, this is the young man that was handcuffed at Chatham; I am certain that was all that passed between me and him till I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was two years ago last April?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. Because that was the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business at Chatham?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I sell laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know you was at Chatham at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I can't swear to the week nor to the month, but I know it was two years ago last April.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not September?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I am not very certain whether it was April or September.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether it was summer or winter?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I am sure it was in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it summer or winter?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. It was April that comes after the month of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Lumber-court?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. It is by the Seven Dials in West-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man that had the handcuffs on say any thing to you about April?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. No, but I knew it was April.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined at Guildhall?</p>
               <p>A. Hughes. I never was at no hall in my life.</p>

            . I saw young Davis at Chatham in the dock-yard, there was a crowd; I had been drinking a pint of beer at the Globe alehouse with Mrs. Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. It is about two years ago; I went out of curiosity to see what was the matter; I saw him with handcuffs on him, upon my oath I did, in the dock-yard; I saw no more; I endeavoured to get out of the croud as soon as I could; Mrs. Hughes brought me into the country with laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I live in Smart's-buildings in Holbourn; I used to go with her with laces and garters.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you gone down there?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. I believe it was in May or April, I don't know which; I know it was in the beginning of summer.</p>
               <p>Q. What month is the present?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. It is October I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Hughes in the dock-yard with you at the time?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that young man before?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. Mrs. Hughes was drinking a pint of beer at the Black Dog in St. Giles's; she came to me and said, do you remember the young fellow you saw at Chatham that was handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she mention this to you?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. This was yesterday morning; said she, should you know him again; I sai d, yes, for he had a cast in his eye; she brings him down, I said indeed that is the young fellow; I said, Sir, did I ever see you at Chatham; said he, if you are a person that saw me at Chatham, I am glad to see you, and he made me drink out of his pint pot; then he took me to another house, and made me take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190035"></xptr> a shilling and this paper, and said no more to me; I was to appear in regard to seeing him handcuffed; he asked me no particulars at all, only to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mrs. Hughes and you been at Chatham before you saw this young man?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. Not many days, perhaps three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had seen him did you make for London?</p>
               <p>S. Minet. We made our way for London that day, to the best of my knowledge; I can't recollect the particulars of every thing.</p>

            . I heard what the prisoner swore, she swore the man was handcuffed in Mr. Hanway's house at Chatham, and they were separated and put in a hole, Davis in a top hole, and she could not see him after that; and when they went to the Justice's house, she could not tell whether the handcuffs were on him as he was going along or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her talking about a rope being upon him?</p>
               <p>Reading. I cannot charge my memory with that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Fletcher. Did you observe Davis's hands to be bloody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fletcher. They were not bloody; I used him with as great good manners as I could any gentleman; there was not a word mentioned of handcuffs; I treated him with all the lenity a person in his circumstances could be treated with.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Wildash. Did you observe his hands to be bloody?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wildash. His hands were not bloody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain about his hands being hurt by handcuffs?</p>
               <p>Mr. Wildash. There is not a word of it true, I never heard a word of handcuffs till upon that trial at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fletcher No, I live out of the town; it is not at all in the way to my house from the dock-yard to go by the Salt-water Bath; to go by Salt-water Bath is no more in the way than from here Westminster is in the way to Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this young man was ever carried the Salt-water Bath way to your house?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fletcher. No, he was not, he was carried from my house to Brompton.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pank. After the examination at Mr. Fletcher's house, where was the prisoner carried to?</p>
               <p>Pank. He was carried to Brompton.</p>

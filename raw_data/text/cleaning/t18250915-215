             by sight, that is all. On the 20th of April a barge of slates, called duchesses, arrived at my wharf - they were mine - I told the prisoner to send two loads of them to the Penitentiary, but had not directed him to dispose of any others to any person, and certainly not to Haskins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you allow the prisoner to sell any slates for you? A. At one time I allowed him to sell a sort called waste, but no others; there was a pass-book kept, in which he furnished me with an account of what he sold; he always had a desire to sell slates, but I forbid him; he had paid me money for some which he had sold, perhaps two days before he was taken: there never was a meeting for the purpose of settling this business, and there was never a balance of 30 l. due to me from him - I have an entry in my book, on the 23d of June, when he paid me some money. He lived in a house of mine on the wharf - I lived at a distance; if a person came to give orders they made inquiries of him; he generally settled with me on a Saturday evening, for the slates he sold - there were some deficiencies, but I did not think it worth while to discharge him for them, being an old servant.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he at any time after, no authority from you to sell valuable slates, by the cart load? A. No never - there is no entry of a cart load of slates sold by him in his book - there is no entry of two cart loads sold to Haskins. I did not find it out till July - this little book is the prisoner's wife's writing - he cannot write himself. I have had no meeting with him or his wife, in which it was stated that if 30 l. was paid, the business should be settled.</p>

The prisoner gave me orders, at six o'clock next morning, to load the cart with two loads of slates, which I was to carry to the Vauxhall-road, about a quarter of a mile beyond the Penitentiary - he said I should meet Mr. Haskins there, and that the slates were for him. I met him, and he told me to put the slates down by the side of Mr. Westmacott's wall, near the iron foundry. I took them at two separate times, in Mr. Struthers' cart. Haskins gave me 5 s. a load for taking them - I do not generally receive so much; I never gave my master information about it till I had been examined. I had told the prisoner I thought matters were not going on right, and it would be found out: he said it will make no odds to you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not been in custody some days before you said any thing about it to your master? A. Yes; I was in custody for the slates taken in April.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 30th of June, and was present at the examination before the Magistrate. I heard a paper read to the prisoner - he cannot write, nor read writing himself -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150082"></xptr>it was signed by Mr. Wyat. When I took the prisoner, I told him I wanted him about some slates; as we were going down Millbank-row, I thought he would have fainted. I said "Fear, what is the matter?" he said "I feel I have done wrong about the slates, and if I had hearkened to my wife I should not have done it." When he was before the Magistrate, what he said was taken down, and read over to him; but I do not recollect what he said. I apprehended Haskins and Brandon or the 30th of June. I took them before the Magistrate, and they were examined at night; they promised to be there the next day, but they got away, and I could not find them since.</p>
               <p>MR. STRUTHERS re-examined. Q. After the prisoner had been apprehended, did he say any thing to you? A. Yes; I asked Webb, in his presence, if he did not take two loads of Duchesses out of the yard; he said he did. I then asked Fear if that was true; he said it was, and he was very sorry he had done wrong.</p>

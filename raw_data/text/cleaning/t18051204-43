               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time you went in the dairy on that day? - A. About seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you also in the bakehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what state you left the things in the bakehouse? - A. The copper was in the same place as usual, it was set, and the lead work was round it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was the copper set? - A. In brick-work; it was a copper for scalding milk; it held four pails.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went there in the morning, did you find the copper there? - A. When I went there in the morning the dairy door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you locked the dairy door on the night before? - A. I generally go in at the bakehouse door, I am sure I locked the bake-house door. I put the key in my pocket. and when I went there in the morning I found the bakehouse door locked. I missed some butter from the dairy, and when I came into the bakehouse I missed the copper; the place was pulled down where the copper was fixed, and some of the lead was taken off. On the same morning I saw the copper brought back again by some of the men that took them, and it was put in the same place that it was taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same copper? - A. I believe it to be the same copper, it fitted the place exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead, did you see that fitted? - A. It was fitted on, and it corresponded with the remaining lead.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon hearing the cart, what did you and Tyler do? - A. We got over a gate into Mr. Briggs's field, a field adjoining the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing then of the persons in that cart? - A. Yes, they made up towards the gate that we got over; I heard one say to the other let us put in here.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do next after you heard that? - A. They made away for the next gate; we heard them open the gate and put the cart in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you suppose that was? - A. It might be about a quarter past twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see or hear next? - A. We staid there in that same place till the clock struck two.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole of that time did the cart remain still in the adjoining field to that where you was? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. As soon as they came into the field did you follow them close? - A. I followed them close to the cart, and saw them both lay their loading down.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the nearest to these men of all the party? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your seeing them lay the loading down, did you halloo out to your comrades? - A. Yes, directly, they came up directly both ways and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the cart when you took them both? - A. One of the men in our company, and one of the men that belonged to the cart, harnessed the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners the two men you took into custody? - A. Yes, they were never out of my sight; they harnessed the horse while the other held up the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel about to look for the parcels? - A. Yes, I and William Tyler groped about, and we could not find them at first.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not say that you saw them carrying off anything; how was they carrying their load? - A. They had it on their shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, though it was dark, you could perceive that they had a load on their shoulders? - A. I could perceive it when they got over the gate. I saw them both lay their loads down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. While they were putting the horse in the cart, did you and Tyler grope about to find anything? - A. We found a bundle of hay, which I see one of the men put down, which was one of the two loads that I saw put down.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not at that time find the other? - A. We could not then find the other it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then take away the two prisoners to Acton, and the horse and the cart? - A. Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and your comrades and the prisoner, in the way? - A. We got some way on; one of the prisoners wanted to know what we wanted with them; whether we wanted to kill them.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you return again? - A. We got back in about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the first cart, how far distant were you from the first cart? - A. We met it in the road; we were obliged to go out of the way to let the wheels of the cart pass.</p>
               <p>Q. You met the cart the second time? - A. No; we waited for it coming along the road; it was the same cart; we got then out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that the cart that you met and the cart that returned were the same cart? - A. That I cannot say; we met a cart with two men; one leading the horse, and the other walking behind the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the field how far was this cart from you? - A. About an 100 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these men intoxicated at all? - A. They did not appear so.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I was called up by the last witness; we prepared ourselves with fire arms, and went into Mr. Briggs's field; there was nothing but an empty basket in the cart; it was quite a dark and misty night; we separated into three parts, I continued with Tyler; I assisted in taking them; we secured them in the public house; I returned with Higgins back again to the field; we found a copper just on the spot where we had taken the cart from.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the copper afterwards? - A. We picked up a copper and a hatchet, and a little bag; we took them all to the Anchor. I saw the copper taken to Mrs. Harvey's, it fitted exactly as though it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pieces of lead that remained, and these pieces fitted? - A. Yes, it just matched one with the other.</p>

               <p>Price's Defence. We went down to Uxbridge with some fish, and met with a man that we knew. We drank with him at the George, and got intoxicated in liquor. We lost our way in the dark; I was leading the horse, and being dark we put the cart and horse in this field and went and laid down to sleep, and when we returned to the field these men secured us, and told us we must go with them. I brought the bundle of hay from the house where we had been drinking, and where we laid down to sleep. They went out about seven o'clock and brought this copper into the public-house. I never saw the copper before in my life.</p>
               <p>White's Defence. I have nothing further to say than we had been to Uxbridge; we missed our way and overset the cart, it being dark and foggy, we put the cart into the field.</p>

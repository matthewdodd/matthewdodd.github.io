                  </hi>. I live in Warwick-place, Peckham, and am the owner of the houses, Nos. 2 and 3 Copper's-row, Crutched-friars; they have been unoccupied a considerable time. On Saturday, the 24th of September, I went to No. 2, and attempted to get in with the usual key that I have always been accustomed to use in opening the door—I put the key into the lower lock, and found it in a very different state to what I had left it in a few before when I came out' I had double-clocked the door—when I put the key in I found it on the single lock—I pushed against the door, and made a considerable noise—I conclude the holt at the top of the door was fastened inside—I immediately suspected some person were inside the house—I requested my eldest son, who was with me, to go to his house, which was nearly opposite, to got the keys of No. 3, to get over the back premises, and see what was going on—the went, and returned in a minutes or two, as he was approaching with the keys—I saw White come out of No. 3, and as he was passing the down the loser stop of the door, I took hold of him by the arm—he was going up the street, towards Trinity-square—I said, "My good Sir, what have you been about in this house?"—he said, "Nothing, I have not been in the house at all, I was only passing"—I said, "You must stop till I have better proof of that," and just at that moment four or five person gathered round the door—one of them said, "There is another man come out of the other house"—that turned out to be Poole—I immediately turned round and took hold of him—he said, "What are you going to do with me?"—I said, "You have been in that house, I must know what you have been about"—he said, "I have been passing down the street"—I said, "that is impossible"—on that a young woman came over, and said, "Mr. Hill, I saw that man come out of the house the day before yesterday, with a large copper on his shoulder, containing a considerable quantity of lend"—I then sent for an officer and gave them in charge—he took them to the station-house—I then opened the door, which I could not do before, with the same keys—I went into the back kitchen of No.2, and saw it in a deplorable state—I found the brick-work, which contained the copper, broken the cop<lb></lb>per gone, and the lead-work in the sink was loosened all round, ready to be moved—a pump was also removed and a large pipe, which supplied the cistern with water, turned up to remove, and lead—I then went to the station-house, and they searched the prisoner—I went back to the house—the officers soon followed—we examined, and found the box staple of the lock of No. 2 broken—we went into the kitchen, and found things as I have represented—we went up stairs, and found a brass lamp taken from</p>

               <p>the stair-case, and two boxes, taken from a room up stairs, with locks, and several other things—we then came down, and went on the leads of the back kitchen, and there saw some marks of footsteps on a high cistern going over to No. 3—we went in there, and found two panes of glass broken in the back door, over the lock—it appears they could not makes an entrance in that way, but forced the door, and the box staple of the door was also broken—we went on the leads of that house, and saw similar im<lb></lb>pressions of feet on the other side—nothing was taken from No.3—we found a crew-driver in the passage—the lead pipe and copper had been fixed to the building and the lead covered the copper.</p>

                  </hi> My father applied to me to get the keys of No.3, and as I got to the steps, I saw White come out of the door of the house—I laid hold of him, turned round to my father, and said, "Here is a man coming out of the house"—he came to me, and assisted me in holding him—I asked what business he had there—he said "Nothing"—I said, "You must be doing something there, which you ought not to do; you cannot deny coming out of the house, because the door is open"—he had one leg on the steps and the other in the house at the time—when my father came to my assistance, we both turned round nearly at the some time, and I saw Pool coming down the last step of No.2—I did not see him in the house—I left the two prisoners in my father's care, and went for the beadle.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Lincoln and Kelk came to the office on Tuesday, the 14th of November, and I went to Mr. Lincoln's house; I saw Pink, took him into the ware-room, and found some razors on him, which he said Kelk gave him - I called Kelk, and said to him, "Pink says you have been stealing some articles;" he then admitted stealing the razors from Exeter'Change, but said to Pink, "You know you told me to do it, and you stole several hats from Mr. Bowler, and left them at the coal-shed, for James, at Jarratt's, and two ruffs also;" Pink said, "I know I did, and you stole a hat from Mr. Lowe;" he also admitted that he took another hat from Mr. Bowler's to his father, who pawned it for 7s. I took them to the office, and went to Brewer-street, where Pink said his father lived, and told him Pink said he had pawned a hat - he then gave me the duplicate of it. In consequence of what Mr. Lincoln said I went to Mr. Jarratt's, a hatter, in Piccadilly; Orgar, his <rs id="t18261207-86-deflabel507" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did he state any thing about a price for them? A. He said something about 26s. or 28s., but I think he said he had not paid it - he said he had sold one hat to a Jew.</p>

            . I am Pink's father, and am a shoemaker. He brought home this hat three weeks or a month ago, and said it was a present made to him from one of Mr. Bowler's men - I questioned him strictly about it, but he still said so - I pawned it for 7s. at the corner of Crown-court - I did not ask the name of the person who gave it him, as I never knew him dishonest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What connexion had he with Mr. Bowler? A. I believe he went there to carry hats - he never brought any thing before - I pawned it a day or two afterwards - I did not know where Bowler lived - my son said he lived over the water - I did not go there to inquire about it; it would not fit either him or me- I saw the name of Daniels of Bristol in it, after my son was gone, but suspected nothing.</p>

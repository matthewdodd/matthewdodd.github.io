             met me just at the end of the passage, at the foot of the stairs, and cried out watch; she said they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110053"></xptr> were used ill by a man that was in the room, and begged of me to come to their assistance.</p>

               <p>Court. Are you sure she said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Repeat her words as near as you can? - Watch! watch! says she, we are ill used by a man in the room, come to our assistance.</p>
               <p>When you came into the room, what did the man charge them with? - He charged them with robbing him, and using him in that situation that he was in.</p>
               <p>What situation did you find him in? - He was in a very shocking situation; he was almost torn to pieces, and there was blood all round his lips.</p>
               <p>Was there any mark of being bit? - No, there did not appear any sign of biting, the blood came from round his mouth, whether it came out of his mouth, or whether he was scratched in the mouth I cannot say; I did not see any wound in his face; they said to me that he wanted to use them ill, and wanted to have to say to them. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, the other woman made her escape.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what money he had lost? - Yes, he said it was four shillings.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you of anything else he had lost? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know whose house this was? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How came you to say that night that you had lost four shillings? - I was not sensible of what I had lost, but I recollected that I had three shillings and some half-pence, which I could swear to; there might be more, by what I had spent in the course of the evening, I think there must be that in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Who gave the instructions for the indictment? - The witness which I have here, going from the place with me, said the prisoners told him whose house it was, but I did not hear them.</p>
               <p>Court to watchman. Did you hear the prisoner say whose house it was? - I did, but I did not take notice; the prisoner told, at the Justice's whose house it was.</p>
               <p>Is there anybody here that was present at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>What Justice was it? - Justice Walker.</p>

               <p>On Saturday night was a week I was standing at my own door, and this man came up to me, he was very solid and sober, seemingly to me, it was about two o'clock, he asked me to drink, I said I did not want anything to drink; and at the watch-house the man said I robbed him of four shillings and six-pence, on Monday he said I knocked him down upon the bed; this young woman was stopped coming to bring me my bed-gown at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to watchman. Did you observe whether this woman had her clothes torn? - M'Cabe had; I asked the man how she came to have her clothes torn, and he said it was because she wanted to run away after they had got his money.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It is perhaps not necessary now to state the particular place where the robbery was committed, but wherever the party drawing the indictment, does charge the place, the proof must correspond with it; and here there is no evidence whose dwelling-house this robbery was committed in.</p>

               <p>Had you delivered your key to any body while you was absent? - No, I came back before my wife, I was at work just by, and I heard a noise, and I came to the back door, and there was the prisoner in the back room, I found him in the bed-room below stairs, I found nobody else.</p>
               <p>What was he doing? - He was taking the things out of my drawers.</p>
               <p>Had he in fact taken any thing out of the drawers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What? - Some children's shirts and shifts.</p>
               <p>Where were they laying? - Some he had put in his bag, and some were laying in a chair; I asked him what business he had or what he wanted there, and he turned and said I will shoot you, and he put his hand into his pocket; I drew from him and he pushed by me, and I immediately followed him till I took him in the street he got out.</p>
               <p>How far from your house had he got before you took him? - Nearly half a mile.</p>
               <p>How came you to let him go so far? - I did not care to go too near him for fear he should shoot me, but more people came up then I mustered up courage, he ran and before I took him he threw something away, I followed him as close as I could within fifteen or twenty yards, he was not out of my sight in the course of my running.</p>
               <p>Did you observe him throw something away? - Yes I did observe him throw something away, but what it was I could not tell; after I took him I went to the place where he threw something away, and there we found a pistol; when I took him he had one of my silver spoons in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else? - Nothing else of my property; he had a box of gun-powder of his own.</p>
               <p>What became of the bag you saw in the house? - It was left behind.</p>
               <p>Who did the bag belong to? - To him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190012"></xptr>It did not belong to you? - No.</p>

               <p>How many? - I did not count any of them, some things of mine were found in the bag and some were found in the chair.</p>
               <p>After you had taken him did you examine the doors to see how he got in? - He broke open the back door, and took off the two bolts, the two bolts were laying down by the door on the inside.</p>
               <p>Where does that back door open to? - Into a garden, I came to the back door.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - I was down in the field at work near to the house, and I heard a noise, and it gave me a suspicion that somebody had broke in.</p>

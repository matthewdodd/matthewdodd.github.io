            . I came from Sutton Colefield, five weeks ago, and was lodging in Silver-street, Falcon-square - I live on my property. On the 14th of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming from Drury-lane, theatre; as I came through Templebar I met Thompson - she came and laid hold of me; she asked me to go with her just up <placeName id="t18321018-196-crimeloc1103">Shire-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Were you sober? A. Quite - I only had two glasses of gin; the landlady and they drank it among them; I was not alone with Thompson more than five or six minutes before Brown came up; I gave Brown nothing - I was not left alone with her - she did not ask me for money for going with her; she might fall in the struggle - I used no blows to any of them, nor did I knock them down.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Shire-lane, Middlesex, and on passing the door I heard a noise, and somebody said, "If you don't let me alone I will call the Police;" I remained close to the door - the prosecutor came out, and showed me his coat; the inside pocket was quite torn out: I apprehended the prisoners in the house - they said they knew nothing about it; I found 3s. on Thompson, but nothing on Brown.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. He did not find a halfpenny on me, nor did I attempt to go into the room at all; I went up with the landlady when we heard the scuffle between him and Brown.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. The prosecutor told me his pocket had been torn out at the theatre, and asked me to sew it up.</p>

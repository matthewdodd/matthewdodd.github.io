On the 16th of October, I left these articles at the door of my house, in a basket - I think at twelve o'clock in the evening; the next morning, at a quarter-past six, I heard a voice, saying"There is a thief in the yard;" I opened my window, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230098"></xptr>there was no one there - but the basket had been moved to the upper end of the yard.</p>

On the 16th of October, I was getting up at six o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner take the basket of linen from one end of the yard to the other; he had got a ladder, and got over the wall; I went down stairs into the street, expecting to see him - instead of coming into the street, he went down a mews; I am sure I saw him taking the basket towards the ladder.</p>

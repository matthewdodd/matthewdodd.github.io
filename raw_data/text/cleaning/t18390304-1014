On the 7th of feb<lb></lb>ruary I went to the house of Mr. George Waite, the prosecutor, who was then alive—I found, concealed in a room there, the prisoner's son, who was convicted last session—I had received information on the 22nd of No<lb></lb>vember that this watch had been stolen, but the prisoner and his son had then absented themselves from home—we looked after them, and found them about six weeks after—this is the watch—I received it of the pro<lb></lb>secutor after the former trial, and have had it in my possession ever since—the prosecutor is since dead—I was present before the Magistrate when he was examined on oath upon this charge against the father and son ori<lb></lb>ginally—I saw the deceased George Waite make this mark to the deposi<lb></lb>tion—the prisoner and his son were present—they had the opportunity of seeing and hearing every thing—I know that George Waite was sworn—I know Mr. Broughton's handwriting—this is it to this deposition—the pri<lb></lb>soner had every opportunity of cross-examining the witness—this was read over to Mr. Waite—he was asked if it was true, and he said yes—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The information of George Waite, the 12th of January, 1839. I lodge at No. 29, Weymouth-terrace, Hackney-road, and am a gentleman. I have known the prisoners for some time past, and have occupied a part-merits in their house for the last seven or eight months, and the wife of the prisoner George Walker attended upon me. On Wednesday, the 21st of November last, about seven o'clock, the prisoner William Walker came up into my room with part of a blind—he stopped in the room about half an hour, and then, as I thought, went out; shortly after, I went to bed, locking my room-door—I placed my gold watch, with chain and key attached, on the table. In the morning, when I got up, I found that my watch and appendages had been stolen, and my room door was unlocked—I went down stairs, and discovered that the prisoners were both out. In a few days afterwards, in consequence of information I received, I went to a small trunk, which I always kept locked in my bed-room—I found it had been broken open, and several articles of plate had been stolen therefrom—I do not know when these things were stolen, as I had not been to the trunk for some time past—the prisoners absconded on the 22nd of November, and I saw nothing of them till the 5th of this month, when they both came home—I sent for the policeman, and gave the prisoner, George Walker, into custody, and on the following Monday, the 7th, the other prisoner, William Walker, was appre<lb></lb>hended—the elder prisoner admitted to me that he had pawned my watch,</p>

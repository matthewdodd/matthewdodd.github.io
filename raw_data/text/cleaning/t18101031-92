On the 21st of September, having suspicion of the prisoner Glynn, I arose early in the morning to watch him, I saw him go into the stable, he soon afterwards brought out a bag with something in it, put it upon a cart that was loaded with potatoes ready to come to town; he then went into the stable, brought a truss of hay out and put it on, also he went into the stable again, brought something under his arm, which turned out to be part of a truss of hay, it was covered with his great coat, he put that on also, he then put his horses into the cart; I then came down stairs and saw the prisoner go on with the cart; I followed the cart to the public house called the Coach and Horses, about thirty yards from my house, he stopped there and was joined by the prisoner Moore. They then proceeded up the road to the King Alfred public-house, the prisoner took the truss of hay and put it to Moore to receive it; Moore turned up the gateway of the King Alfred public-house, I pursued him and took Moore with the hay pitched down before him; I followed my cart and apprehended Glynn opposite of the watchhouse, I delivered him in the care of the constable; upon searching the cart I found this bag, the one I saw him put into the cart in my premises, it contains pease and beans; the peas are a foreign production, the beans I do not mean to swear to, the peas being of various sorts would not do for any other purpose than hogs; I bought twenty quarters, upon comparing them with the bulk I can swear to them, there are Prussian blues among them. I did not lose sight of the hay from the time it was taken from my house, untill I saw it delivered to Moore.</p>

             in the Mint, he said, you might have had him before for I informed you he was in the Mint, he says, I shall not swear to him; I asked him why? he said, because I had not sent him any money while he was in trouble; I told him I never did, nor never would, because it might bias the mind to say what was wrong; he informed me that Clark, one of the witnesses that was against Waine, had given him two guineas.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>In the first place Mr. Blackiter that is now come to swear against me, has been an officer in every office almost round London, and discharged, through misconduct, from every office that he has been in; and now at this present time he lives with a common shoplifter.</p>
               <p>Blackiter, I never was discharged from an office in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Percival that was taken and was brought to trial, was not the Percival that did the robbery; the words that they insinuated and drew from me, were words that I was not on my oath, neither was I before a Justice, they were only my words; I never kept any thing back from justice, I brought every thing to justice as far as lay in my power; there is no account from the prosecutor that that was the man, nor any further contradiction except my own words; them two, Harper and Blackiter, I was obliged to keep in with that I might not be turned in amongst the other prisoners; what I might have told them in liquor I cannot say. There are two Percivals. Clarke, who met us coming out of the house of Mr. Robinson's, says, it was that other Percival; he was the chief witness on Waine's trial, and is not brought forth; I thought they would have called him.</p>

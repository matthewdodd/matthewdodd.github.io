               <p>Jury. Will you be so good as to shew the mark. - A. It is usual when we cut out a pattern to cut it out of a fag; the gingham was bought in a very large lot. At the moment the gentleman brought it in I recognised the gingham.</p>

               <p>Q. What was remarkable in her dress. - A. She had on a kind of a fawn coloured bonnet, and she had it on when she was brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to her face. - A. I cannot swear to her face, I know her from her dress, she had on a dark green gown with a check apron, and a fawn coloured bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith was not in your shop at all. - A. No, she was not till she was brought there.</p>

               <p>Q. The little girl went out of the shop, the woman went partially out, when the little girl went out was the gingham laying on the counter. - A. I did not see it the second time that Bolton came in, she was not nigh that part of the counter by three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to take notice of Crawley's gown being of that size. - A. Because I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take any more notice than you usually do to customers that come in the shop. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this boy you were talking of. - A. The boy that lives with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the shop when they came in. - A. I cannot say whether he was in the shop or not.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Had you any opportunity of seeing the girl's face, so as to know her again when she came in the first time. - A. I had, she came up to the counter, I saw her and took notice of her then, and I went down to the bottom of the shop; I had an opportunity to know that she was the girl that came in the shop to buy the gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such an opportunity of observing the features of her face so as to know her again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your apprentice said though he stood by he did not know her face. - A. He ought to know her.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know that he ought, if he could not see I do not know that you could see. - A. I positively swear that she is the girl.</p>
               <p>A. You may swear that she is the girl because she was brought back; I want to know whether upon your oath, you can say that you had sufficient observation of her features before she was brought back; to be sure that is the girl. - A. Yes.</p>




               <p>Mr. Walford. How far off were you standing in the shop when they came in first. - A. Nearer than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had seen them half an hour afterwards in the street, should you have been able to recollect the girl. - A. I could have sworn that she had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any reason to suppose they had stole the gingham, before they were brought back. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q, You saw nothing in their conduct that gave you any suspicion. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them go into Mr. Harrison's. - A. Yes, I stopped at the door and just looked in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry the gingham to Mr. Harrison's. - A. He did, I saw him take it in, it was exactly that pattern, I can swear to the pattern and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near enough to be able to swear to the pattern. - A. Yes, I just saw the man shew Mr. 
               <persName id="t18070114-22-person378">Harrison</persName>
             the print, and I went about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith, the prisoner, and the girl, in Mr. Harrison's shop, at the time you saw the man give Mr. 
               <persName id="t18070114-22-person379">Harrison</persName>
             the print. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw a man trying to catch a woman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman's face. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not nearly dark, it was in the dusk of the evening. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to swear positively to her face, but you believe that to be the woman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The little girl you did not see her face. - A. Yes, I saw her face.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot swear to positively. - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. When Smith was going back she walked very deliberately, as if nothing had happened to her. - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the man called out to somebody to stop her, and when he was running after the girl, the woman made light of it and walked back. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when she found that the man was coming after her with the girl, what did she say. - A. She said something like, they may catch me; I cannot say the exact words.</p>
               <p>Court. This woman dropped this piece of gingham from behind her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same woman that dropped it, that went into Mr. Harrison's shop. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore without speaking to her face, you can say that the woman that dropped the gingham, was the woman that went into Mr. Harrison's shop. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman in company with the girl and Smith. - A. Not in company with them, there were several people passing by.</p>

            . You are an officer, of the police office, Hatton Garden. - A. Yes; I went and fetched the prisoners, Crawley and Smith, from the prosecutor's house; the girl Crawley, said that Bolton called upon Smith at her home, and requested her to go along with her, and she would buy Smith's child a frock, that they came from over the water, to the end of Fleet market; they went up Holborn Hill, and they went into several shops.</p>
               <p>Q. She said nothing about what passed in Mr. Harrison's shop. - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had been examined by the magistrate, did she give any account of what passed at Mr. Harrison's shop. - A. No, she went down for a further examination, and then she would not say any thing at all. Bolton came in the office and said that she heard of it, and she flew to the prisoner Smith, and said what she had brought her sister to.</p>
               <p>Crawley's Defence. Sir, I never picked up any of the halfpence at all.</p>
               <p>Bolton was not put on her defence.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Smith called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

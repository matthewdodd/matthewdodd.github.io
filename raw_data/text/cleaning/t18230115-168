            . I live at Camden-town. On the 26th of December, the prisoner brought me a leg of mutton, which came to five shillings; I paid him two half crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I understood it was for a Christmas-box - Witness. After paying him for the mutton, he asked me for a Christmas-box, and I gave him a shilling. I might have put all the money into his hand at once, but I told him the shilling was for him.</p>
               <p>MRS. SUMMERS. The prisoner never came home after taking this mutton; he was apprehended next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master owes me a fortnight's wages - Witness. I wanted to pay him his money, he said he wished me to keep it till Sunday. His wages were ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Written. I am charged with this, in consequence of master forgetting to cross the books, but I am totally innocent. I went out, and was asked to drink by several customers, and did not return till ten o'clock at night, and being told master was going to send me to prison I left.</p>

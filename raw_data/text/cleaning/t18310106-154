            . I am a Police-constable. Mr. Bulstrode lives in Paddington-street. On the 15th of December I saw the prisoner in the morning, in Phoenix-street -I asked how he came to be out so soon; he said his parents had been ill-using him - I took him to the watch-house, and in the morning I sent for his parents; I heard his father say to him, "Where have you been? you have been out ever since Monday - Limbrick has been looking for you;" I then heard something about some linen that Mr. Bulstrode had lost; I went there, and found they had lost some - I went back to the station, and some person had brought part of the property and this basket; another parcel I found at a marine-store shop - the servant came and identified the property.</p>

            . I keep a marine-store-shop in Fitzroy-place. On the 13th or 14th of December the prisoner came and brought me some dirty linen - he asked if I bought old clothes; I said sometimes - he said he had some dirty linen to sell, which he brought from his mother, who lived round the corner, close at hand; I asked what he wanted for it - he said 4s.: I gave him 2s. for it - there were two shifts, two pairs of stockings, three pairs of socks, three children's night-gowns, two children's shifts, and four children's night-caps - I suppose it would cost 1s. 3d. or 1s. 6d. to wash them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of November between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I overtook the prisoner at the bottom of the Minories, near Tower Hill; he had a bag which seemed very weighty. I asked him what he had got; he said, you know; I told him, it was impossible for me to know, till I had examined it; what do you call it? he said, provisions. I insisted upon seeing what it was; he rather refused, and struggled to get away; I took him into a shop and examined it; I found it to be white lead and Prussian blue, together. I took him out, and asked him what employment he was in; he told me a bricklayer's labourer to Mr. Teanby, a bricklayer in Old-street road. I took him to the watchhouse, and asked him where he was going with it; I think he said to Green Bank, Wapping; he knew the house, but not the person, to whom it was to go to; I asked him who he had it of, that he could not tell me; he told me he would give me a guinea to let him go; I told him that I would not do, but if he would tell me where his home was I would go there. I went to Golden-lane, where he told me; and the next day I went to Mr. Yallop's and Grace. I searched the prisoner, I found a little colour box at his breast, inside of his waistcoat; and the next morning, in the watchhouse where he was confined, I found a vermillion bag. There is forty pound of white lead, and two pound of Prussian blue, I have kept the property ever since.</p>

            . I live in Ratcliffe Highway, and am a linen draper. On the 24th, in the evening, at about seven o'clock, I understood that there were some suspicious characters about the door of my shop; I walked to the door, and saw three men standing; they went away, seeing I observed them. I then put on my hat, and followed them. When they got to Mr. Davis's shop, the smallest of the three, went in, and brought out a piece of cloth, and gave it to the prisoner; they were all in the same party. The prisoner put it under his great coat. I went across the street, and laid hold of him; another person had hold of his coat. He slipped out of his coat; but I had a hold of him by the breast; I held him fast. I do not know what became of the cloth; I never saw it since.</p>

            . I was standing at my door on the evening of the 24th, and I saw the three men standing at Davis's shop. Presently I saw the prisoner give a signal, and immediately the boy, or the smallest, went in, and brought out the cloth, and gave it to the prisoner. I went over, and seized him; he nearly got away from me, by slipping his coat, but Mr. Harvey had him by the waistcoat.</p>

            . I live in Catherine-wheel alley, Whitechapel: the prisoner, and the next witness, Mr. Alvares, came to my shop together, on the 18th of October, about 6 or 7 in the evening. Alvares brought the watch; I took it of him. He said he had known the prisoner some time, and was very sure it was the prisoner's watch; upon which I lent him the money, 27 s. upon it. The prisoner said, that his father was dead in the country, and it was his watch, and he had left it him; and that was the last thing he had of his father's, and he hoped to have it again soon. I believe this is the same watch; I have delivered it some time to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I am the officer that took the prisoner out of bed on the 29th of October in the morning (he lodged with Mr. Tuck, within about 50 yards of where the watch was taken from) on the account of another watch. I asked him whether he had been guilty of any other fact? he said, yes, he had stole a young man's watch that worked at Mr. Sambrook's, and had pawned it at Mr. Peacock's. I asked him what he had done with the money? he said, he had but very little of it; that Mr. Aaron Alvares went with him to pawn it, and coming back Alvares took him into a bawdy-house: that Alvares spent a guinea of it in ale and cakes, and gave him but 4 shillings and a penny, and that Alvares had all the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Alvares. When we came into Goodman's-fields, the prisoner would go into a house there: the first thing he did, he called for a bottle of wine. I said, as you intend to buy some cloaths to your back, you had better save your money. He was surrounded by five or six women, and went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070018"></xptr> stairs with one of them. I said, young lad, don't make yourself a fool; you will not have a farthing left to go into the country with. He began to call for wine: the reckoning soon came to 10 s. he put down a guinea on the table; after that I saw he was in liquor. He got out into the street, and pull'd off his cloaths to fight some man in the next room. I went from him to go home: he would not go, nor take the money; so I took it. I went after that to look for him, and met him with a girl in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you take?</p>
               <p>Alvares. I put a quarter guinea and 4 s. and 6 d. in my pocket. The people wanted him to stay all night. I said, don't make a fool of yourself. He would stay all night. I said, come to me in Abel's Buildings for your money: I met him there, at the corner of the buildings, and delivered him his money.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a sworn broker?</p>
               <p>Alvares. I am, on the Royal Exchange - No, I am not; my father was; I acted under him, when he was living.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I went to pawn the watch, Alvares said he knew it to be my own. After coming out, going along White-lion-street, at the sign of the Rose (I never was in the house before in my life), he went in, and call'd for a bottle of wine. All the while we were there he spent my money. He gave me 4 shillings and a penny; that was all I had out of the guinea.</p>

            . I have lived servant with Mr. Alvares about 8 months.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He is a 'change broker. He sent me to a public house, the White Lyon, for a pot of beer, for supper; while that was drawing, I sat down by the prisoner at the bar: the prisoner said to me, he had got a watch in his pocket, and he would pawn or sell it, if I would go and lie with him all night. I told him, I was no such person. He said he would give me the money, whate'er it came to, either by pawning or selling. I happened to stay till Mr. Alvares came for me; I told Mr. Alvares what he said. He told Mr. Alvares he would sell or pawn it to get some cloaths. They went out together, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q Where was Mr. Alvares when you went out for the pot of beer?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He was at home.</p>

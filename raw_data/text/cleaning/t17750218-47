            . I am a watchman. About half after eleven o'clock, on the 23d of January as I was walking backwards and forwards at my stand, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Davis's shop, a man ran by me as fast as he could, wit h a black bundle under his arm: another fellow ran full against me. I saw that he had hats under his arm: he gave me a fall into the kennel upon my right knee, and threw the hats behind him. I picked them up. Mr. Davis was sought for. I and the constable went to search Leg Court. Coming by the Star and Garter, the next door but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180046"></xptr> one to my box, the two prisoners came out, each with a pot of beer in his hand: we followed them into Leg Court; at a particular house in the court. The constable bid me get before them into the middle of the court. I did, and lifted up my lanthorn, and said, this is the man I had the hats from; that was Stanton; I had a sufficient sight of him when he ran by me, and knew him again. As to the other, I am not positive about him. I took him by the collar, and struggled with him for a minute and a half.</p>

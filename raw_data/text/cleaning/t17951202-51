               <p>I keep a public-house, in Newgate-market: On Wednesday the 11th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another man, brought this box into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which it was that brought it in? - A. No, I was making liquor in the bar; I saw them in the tap-room; they called for a pot of beer; the box was standing before the prisoner, and when I went in he put it under the table, and sat down by the side of it, as if it was to be hid; then there came in a third man and called for a glass of gin; he sat down in the tap-room by himself, in another box; then Mr. Peppercorn came in, and said, he suspected they had got some stolen property; that he had got a constable, and should take charge of them when they came out; the constable came in; the man that came with the prisoner was gone to fetch a coach; the third man came up and drank with the prisoner; then the second man came in and told the prisoner he had done as he desired him; he said, very well, then we will go; he got up and paid me for the porter, and the constable immediately took charge of the box and the prisoner, and the man that came in third, but he was discharged at Guildhall; the man that went for the coach said, he was going to the waggon-office, in Newgate-street, with it, and that he brought it from the Six-Cann's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020077"></xptr>in Holborn; the constable said, that is enough, if you came from that house, for I know it to be a bad house, and I am convinced it is stolen, and he took him into custody; when the coach came we discharged it.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: On Wednesday the 11th of November, in consequence of an information I received from Mr. Peppercorn, I went to the Blue-posts; after standing at the door sometime, I went and had a pint of beer; while I was drinking it the prisoner got up to go away, and dragged this box out from under the table; I immediately told him I did not think it was honestly come by, and I should know the particulars before I let it go there; I then took the prisoner and a man who had been drinking with him, who was in another box, but not being in company with him, he was discharged; the other man came in while I was there, but he did not interfere in any thing; and I could not cleverly d in him; I have had the box in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into this public-house and called for some beer; a man asked me to take care of this box; I staid there till I could not stay any longer, and I thought I would give it into the care of the landlord; I took it from under the table to give it to him, and the constable took me, before I had taken it two yards from under the table.</p>

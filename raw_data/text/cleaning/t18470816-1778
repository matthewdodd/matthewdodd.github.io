On Tuesday, the 20th of July, I was coming with three other officers, in plain clothes, in a steam-boat, to London-bridge—we arrived a little before nine o'clock at night—there were several other boats at the pier—I and the others proceeded to land—I observed the three prisoners coming from the pier, on board a Chelsea boat, in fact, they were on board, crossing from one boat to another—I saw a female going just before the prisoners, close to them—the prisoners were close to<lb></lb>gether—I did not know them before—I saw M'Donald put his hand into the female's pocket, and drop his hand down as if he was passing something to the other prisoners, who were close to him—I went and laid hold of M'Donald's hand, and found nothing there—Wardle came up and took him by the collar—I felt him, and took Everitt—I looked round, and saw Arthur hold his hand out, with a purse in it—he dropped it, and a man employed on the pier picked it up—I did not see it shown to any female—I took Everitt—he did not go quietly—while we were going to Garlic-hill station, M'Donald commenced a scuffle—Everitt then looked round, and he com<lb></lb>menced a scuffle—he struck me several blows, and we came to the ground.</p>

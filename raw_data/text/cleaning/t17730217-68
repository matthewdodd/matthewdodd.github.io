I received my wages, amounting to 29 s. last Saturday was a week; the prisoner was in the house at the time, and having an intention to leave my place, I asked him to go with me to see another place; which he did: he asked me to lend him two-pence to get some bread and cheese; I had no halfpence, so I lent him six-pence; we lay together at my master's house; when I waked the next morning he was putting on his clothes by my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Jones. Under the bolster; he had been under the bed, and in the bed searching for something; he said he had lost his knee buckle; I asked him where he was going so early; he said to the washer-woman for his shirt; when he was gone, I searched my pocket and missed my money. I am sure I had it when I went to bed. I ran down stairs to stop him, but he was gone. I awaked the maids and my master, and told them I had been robbed; a gentleman that was in the house saw him over the water, and had him stopped the same day; he had got a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and a new pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any money about him?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, two or three shillings; I cannot tell whether that was any part of my money; I found in my pocket in the morning a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper, instead of a guinea and half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge in the same room besides you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the room locked?</p>
               <p>Jones. No.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of his money; I did not take it; I went that morning to my washer-woman's for a shirt; I had a half guinea the night before; he lent me 2 d. that I might not change my half guinea; I went to Lambeth to see an acquaintance; I went into a public house for a pint<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177302170062"></xptr> of beer, and this gentleman took me up: he searched me; he found 2 s. and 8 d. upon me; he said if I would make up part of the money he would let me go free.

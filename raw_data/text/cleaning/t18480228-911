                  </hi> I am the wife of Edward Burrows, of 36, King's-road, East Chelsea, a silversmith and jeweller. About four o'clock, on Saturday afternoon I left my shop in charge of my little girl, and went to attend to the other children—my husband was out—about a quarter of an hour before I went out of the shop, I had seen the brooches in a glass-case on the counter—as soon as I left the shop, a boy came in, and made some</p>

               <p>inquiry, and almost immediately after I saw the prisoner go from the shop door—my little girl told me something at the same time, in consequence of which I followed the prisoner, and took him—he said he had nothing belong<lb></lb>ging to me; he would strike me unless I let him go—I held, and gave him into custody—I went to the glass-case, and missed three brooches, worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have not since been found.</p>

                  </hi> I am nine years old, and an daughter of the last wit<lb></lb>ness. On Saturday afternoon I was left in the shop—a boy came in, and asked if we wanted an errand-boy—as soon as he was gone out, the prisoner came in—I am quite sure of him—he asked me to let him look at a watch in the window—I said I would call my mother, and while I went round to call her, he opened the glass-case, took something out, and put it into his pocket—he then said, "Never mind, do not call your mother;" and went away—my mother, who was at the side door, ran after him and caught him—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the boy speak to the prisoner.</p>

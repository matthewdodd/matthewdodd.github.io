On the evening of the 2nd of November, about six o'clock, I locked them up - about six o'clock the next morning I found the sty had been broken open, and they were all gone; I saw them afterwards at Brentford market, which is about seven miles from Sunbury - I think it was about ten or eleven o'clock; there was no person with them - I had seen the prisoner on the Sunday at Sunbury; the pigs were lost on Monday night, or early on Tuesday morning.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHITE. I was at Brentford market, and saw the prisoner there - I helped him to put eight pigs into the pen; they remained there till a man came - he offered him three of them for 15s., the man thought he had not come by them honestly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the weight of the pigs? A.Some of them, I suppose, was seven stones - he dealt with them as if they were his own.</p>
               <p>MR. ESPANIZE. Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He said he could show the man he brought them from, and the gentleman and he went away together - after a little while the witness came and owned them; he and I went and caught the prisoner - he said, "You can't hurt me, as you have got your pigs;" he said nothing else.</p>

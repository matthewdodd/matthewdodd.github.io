               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him - A. Seventeen months - he boarded with my father. In the February following I discovered that he had another wife, went to Ramsgate, and made enquiry about it; I then returned, and lived with him from the 10th of June till the 8th of August, when his wife came and demanded him, and 5 l. which he had promised her as a bribe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not part by mutual consent, and he was to allow 10 s. 6 d. a week - A. No; when I returned to live with him in June, a paper was drawn up for him to allow it to me, but I never asked him for it. I only asked him to buy the baby clothes. I left him when his wife demanded him, but before I did not know whether I was his lawful wife or no. He told me his wife had another husband, and that he was not lawfully married.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you say about a bribe - A. When his wife demanded him, he said he had promised her 5 l. not to answer any questions I put to her at Greenwich. When I refused to live with him, he removed close by my father's, and then right opposite, so that he could see into my room.</p>

I married this woman. went into the country for eight or ten days, and on returning she had made off with my property. I demanded her; they went and found out the woman - she told them she was married, and had another husband. On the 8th of December she came to me, and wanted me to let her lay in at her father's, and to allow him so much a week. I said if she came back to me I would do all I could.</p>

I was not present at the marriage, but Asquith lived with him, and went by his name - they lived together in the town about two months, and then parted. I was not present at the marriage, but I was there in the afternoon, wished Mrs. Richards joy, and she thanked me. I took her by the hand, and saw the ring on her finger; I remember Mr. Richards got tipsy, and her mother threw a loaf at his head. She lived with her father-in-law,

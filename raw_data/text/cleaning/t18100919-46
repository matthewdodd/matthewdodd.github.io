               <p>Q. Were you in possession of a quantity of cochineal, and where was it deposited - A. At Mr. Thompson's in Clement's-lane; I had bought it of Mr. Thompson, it remained there upon my credit.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 16th of August had you sold it to any body - A. To Mr. Bennet, of Plumber's-row, Commercial-road. On the 15th I sold it, and on the 16th I was to deliver it to him. On the 16th about a quarter past nine in the morning, I went down to St. Magnus's church to hire a <rs id="t18100919-46-deflabel254" type="occupation">porter</rs>

I am certain the prisoner is the man; he went with me to St. Clement's-lane, Mr. Thompson delivered to me fifty-six pounds of cochineal, the value of it is on hundred pounds sixteen shillings. I then went out of Mr. Thompson's with the prisoner, intending to accompany him; I told him to go to Mr. Bennet's, number 12, Plumber's-row, Commercial-road. I wrote a direction on paper with a pencil, as I should not walk close with him, but keep him in sight. I saw him in Fenchurch-street, by Aldgate pump; there I was stopped by some friends; I was talking with them on some business; when I looked round for the porter, I missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue with them - A. Not more than a quarter of an hour. I went directly to Plumber's-row, the goods had not been delivered; I went as fast as I could to Saint Magnus's church, to find the man that he was talking to, and what regiment he belonged to; he was in a soldier's dress. In consequence of information I received there, I obtained a warrant, and went to his house, he resided in a back street near Bunhill-row: we found him there, I knew him immediately, although he had changed his dress and was clean shaved and had his hair cut. I asked him whether he did not recollect me, and whether he did not carry a load for me; he denied it. I have never been able to find the cochineal since.</p>

               <p>JOHN SANKEY PUGH. I am a constable. On the night of the 16th of August I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in New-court. Moor-lane, I found the prisoner at home, Mr. Connop charged him with taking the cochineal, he said he knew nothing of it; Mr. Connop said, he was certain he was the man. Bailey was present, he said, he could swear he was the man which the prosecutor hired. I searched the prisoner's pocket, I found a two pound note, I asked him how he came by it, he said, he had it of his serjeant, he belonged to the London Militia. I searched the woman, on her I found six or seven dollars, three or four half-crowns, and some shillings. I asked her how she came by that silver, she hesitated, he said, you bitch, you took it for your work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates on them - A. No; there were some things that lay as if they were just taken out of pledge; he said, he had taken them out with his own money.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 4th of July, about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, I was passing through West-street, Smithfield, and was seized by a party of men, of which the prisoners are two—they came up, seized me, pinioned my arms, and the prisoner Sampson then took my watch from my fob, while Kemp held my right arm, pinioning me—I got my arm loose, and took hold of the seal and chain of the watch, which was in his hand—Kemp seized my arm again, and Sampson pulled the chain and seals through my hand—I was struck in the mouth by one of the party, which made it bleed—I could not swear to the person who struck me—it was done at the same time—there were six or seven people about me—they thronged close on me—they then ran away, taking my watch with them—I lost a silk handkerchief from my pocket, which was safe when I en<lb></lb>tered the street—I missed it directly the policeman came up to me—I have not found my watch.</p>

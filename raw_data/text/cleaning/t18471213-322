                  </hi> I have been an assistant grocer, and live at 75, St. Andrew-road, New Kent-road—I lived upon funded property, left me by my aunt—in the early part of Nov. I was without money, having been out of a situation since March—I knew the prisoner four years or more previous to his being in the Post-office—I did not know his name—I knew him first at Clapham; he was then a gardener—be only knew my Christian name—on Wednesday evening, 10th Nov., after eight o'clock, I met him in the General Post-office, when he left off duty—I went according to his appointment—he had told me that as I was in bad circumstances, if he had a few shillings to lend me he would do so—I made an appointment to meet him next day at the George and Gate, Gracechurch-street—he did not come—I afterwards met him at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street, not by appointment, but I knew he would be there, and went at a little before five, and met him—he then told me the reason he did not keep his appointment in the morning was on account of illness, that he had borrowed the money of a man in the Post-office; he did not say his name—he pulled his purse out and showed me the note—he said he had not been able to get it changed—he did not give it into my hands then—I did not see it open then—it was very dirty—it was a country note—he did not say what note it was, or the amount—he was then going to the Post-office to go on duty, and said when he got there he should plead illness, get off duty very early, and return to me at the George and Gate as soon as he could—I went there, but he did not come—next day, about a quarter to three, I met him accidentally, very near the George and Gate, and asked him why he failed in keeping his appointment the night before, and the reason he deceiver me so—he said he could not get off duty as he anticipated, and directly he did he proceeded home, he was so unwell—I afterwards went with him into the street—he asked me which way I was going, and asked me to walk with him—we went to the Flowerpot, in Bishopsgate-street—he then said, "I have not been able to get change for this note, as it is a country note"—he pulled out a green silk purse and pro<lb></lb>duced the note—I opened it, according to his wish—it was a Wisbeach and Lincolnshire Band-note—I have no doubt of this being it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from its general appearance, and it is very dirty, and the writing and all corre<lb></lb>sponds—it appears to be the same—I did not observe anything on the back of it—I had it in my hands, and gave it into the prisoner's hands, and he gave it me back, and told me to take the purse and note and get it changed for him—it was a green silk purse, with steel beads and slides—I said the bank</p>

               <p>where it was payable was the best place to go; and he asked me to go for him to the bank and get charge—I told him it was payable at Barclay's—I had looked at it, and read it—I was to get nothing but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he had promised to lend me—he said he would lend me the money when he got charge for it—he told me he had got the note from a servant in the post-office, and he had to return one-half of the and keep 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he was to pay interest—he did not go for the charge himself, as he said he had never been to a bank to get change, and if I understood it better did I mind going for him—I went to Barclay's with the note in one band and the purse in the other; on the way I met a po<lb></lb>liceman named Lewis, who I know well, in Gracechurch-street—I spoke to him, showed him the note, and afterwards went to Barclay's, and presented it to the first person on the right, a gentleman in spectacles—he gave me a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note for it, which I changed with Mr. Nutt, the landlord of the George and Gate, for nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns to the best of my recollection—about ten minutes past three I went to the four Swans, where the prisoner was to wait till I came back with the change—I found him there, put the gold into the purse and gave it him—I told him I had got a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note at Barclay's, and had changed it at Mr. Nutt's—he seemed perfectly satisfied, and said, "On considering it over in my mind I can spare you half a sovereign, and you must return it me as soon as you get into a situation—I stopped with him till five o'clock, till the mail cart came for him—I gave him all the money, and he returned me half a sovereign—that was on Friday, 12th—on that day week I saw Peak, the officer, told him something; and on the same day, between five and six o'clock, I was brought before the prisoner in the presence of Peak and Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, and one or two others—I stated the whole of the particular of my meeting him, and hid giving me the note; on the Friday previous, about the middle of the day, not recollecting the exact time; the prisoner directly said, "You know better then that, it was three o'clock"—it was about three o'clock—when asked if he knew me, he said, "I know him very well, but I do not know his name."</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 581.) I have known Clatherow two or three months—about 11th or 12th, Nov. about the middle of the day, I saw him in Gracechurch-street—he showed me a Wisbeach and Lincolnshire bank-note—I do not recollect the amount—I believe this to be it—it was payable at Barclay's—it was dirty, and had a piece of paper bigger then the note itself fastened on the back as if he had been divided—I directed him to Barclay's, and he went in that direction—in about ten minutes I saw him in Gracechurch-steet again—I was on duty there—he spoke to me—he had something in his hand which appeared like a Bank of England note—I did not look at it—it was folded.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk at Barclay's bank, Lombard-street—Gurney's, the Wisbeach and Lincolnshire bank draw on us—it is my duty to take the numbers of their notes in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of that bank, No. 3606, entered by me on the 13th Nov., as having been paid on the 12th—I have several entries of notes of that bank on the same day—I have no entry of a note of Gurney's, No.6306—I enter the numbers from the notes themselves.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk in Barclay's bank—I collect from the cashiers the country notes paid during the day, and make memorandums of then in my book—among the country notes I received on 12th Nov. from Mr. Mitchell, I have an entry of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of the Wishbeach and Lin<lb></lb>colnshire bank—it was a single note—the cashier had others when I collected them; but I entered every note distinctly—if Mr. Mitchell receive a parcel of country notes at the counter, he give them twist at the corner and hands them to me—I received this from him as a note cashed singly—the parties that pay the notes make an indorsement on the outside note if more then one—the figure "10" is eadorsed on this, and "M," meaning "Mitchell"—that is how Mr. Mitchell is in the habit of marking the notes—my entry is "a Wisbeach note, 10," under the head of Mr. Mitchell's notes—I do not take the numbers; in the course of business the note would be handed to Mr. Hunt to enter on the following morning.</p>

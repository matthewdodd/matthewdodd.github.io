               <p>sixteen or seventeen years old, were in the shop—the man who is not here engaged the lad's attention—the boy said, "This gentleman wants to look at a fancy article"—Rolls asked to look at some silver pencil-cases—showed them some—Rolls took up two or three, put them down again, and turned abruptly to the other side of the counter, where there were various goods—he did not look at anything, but the other man said, "What is the price of this black brooch?"—it was under a case—I took the silver pencil-cases away—the third man took the lad outside the shop—I thought Rolls was going out with them—the instant they went I missed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns, from a little round ivory box in the till, which contained 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had put a sovereign and a half-sovereign into it, which I had taken of a customer just before they came into the shop—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in the till; I lost none of that—Rolls bought a pocket-book, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—no one had come in before I missed the money.</p>

            . On the 14th of October the prisoner brought two fur tippets to my shop for sale; I asked how he came by them - he said he had them to sell, and that he, manufactured them; I asked where he lived - he said in White Horse-court, Cow-cross; I took the tippets, and went to the place - he kept dodging me about for some time; at last we went to the house, and saw two or three women; I asked if he lived there - they said Yes; I asked his trade - they said he was a working smith, and they did not know of his having the tippets; they were astonished on seeing them - he was going to snatch at them, and he did get them from me; people came round, and said I wanted to make a property of him - he then went away into Cow-cross; a friend of mine came up - we went after him, and found him in Cow-cross with the tippets; I took them from him - he followed me through Sharp's-alley to West-street, and there made a stop; a mob gathered - an officer came up, and took him.</p>

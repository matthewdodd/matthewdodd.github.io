                  </hi>. I live at No. 28, St. Paul's-street, New North-road. On 24th Jan. I and my mother left the house about half past 4 o'clock—I shut up the house, and left no one inside—I returned between half past 12 and 1 o'clock—found the house had been broken open—the parlour door had been broken, and a piece of the panel forced out—the police were in charge—the back door was bolted top and bottom—the house might have been entered by a skeleton key—I found the things were dis<lb></lb>turbed up stairs and down, but nothing was taken but four shirt collars—these are two of the collars I lost, they have the mark of the maker on them.</p>

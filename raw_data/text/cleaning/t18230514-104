            . I am employed at the Theatre, and saw the prisoner go out - a person called out, Stop him! he had not passed me then. I got from my seat, pursued, and never lost sight of him - I put out my foot; he ran against me, and fell. I saw him throw something away, which glittered. I am certain of him - a boy picked up the watch.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. I saw the prisoner run out at the pit door - there was a cry of Stop thief! I followed. I lost sight of him when he ran round a carriage - I saw him thrown down, and saw a watch thrown from towards his hand; I think he threw it down. I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Dunch. I live in Bedford-place, Catherine-street. I cannot say he is the man, as he is dressed differently now. I followed him to Bow-street.</p>

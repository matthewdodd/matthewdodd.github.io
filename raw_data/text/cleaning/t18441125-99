                  </hi>. I live in Burton<lb></lb>crescent. I have some houses at 16, Ladbrook<lb></lb>terrace, Notting<lb></lb>hill—one of them was vacant about the 13th of Aug.—it had been let furnished, and some furniture was still remaining in it—amongst other things there was a bedstead, a bed, pillows, and other things, and some door<lb></lb>plates—the door<lb></lb>plates did not form the subject of any agreement between me and the prisoner—on the 16th or 17th of Aug. the prisoner called on me, and said he came to speak about that house—he said he was a private individual, keeping horses, and living in some credit at Four Posts, near Southampton—he gave me a reference to a Mr. Golding—I went to him—I saw the prisoner again 'the day afterwards, I and agreed to take him as a tenant—he came to my house to sign this I agreement, which is stamped—he took the house for three years—I after<lb></lb>wards met him at the house—there was a wagon at the door removing some furniture from the house—he said, "Those cheffioneers fit the recesses very well,"and he seemed to wish them to remain—there was an inventory drawn out by himself in pencil, of the articles which were left there—this is the inventory—it contains a bedstead, a loo<lb></lb>table, and a variety of other things—with the exception of the bed and pillows, a price was named for all the things, and he stipulated to pay for them—the bed and pillows were to be left; and when his wife came to London, if she wished to have then, he was to enter into a negotiation with me about them—nothing was said about the door<lb></lb>plates—I put the prisoner in possession of the house on the 21st of Aug., and he was to pay for those things on the 5th of Sept.—I went to Ramsgate, and while there I received a letter, and came to town on the 3rd or 4th of Sept.—I went to the house, and found everything had been taken away but one chair.</p>

            . I was secretary to the Potosi La Paz, and Peruvian Mining Association, which was established in London. I have not belonged to it this four years - the object of the Association was to work mines in Peru; the capital was divided into shares, which were bought and sold in the money-market - this paper (looking at it) is a genuine share; there were printed receipts for the scrip, but this is the instrument on which divedends would be payable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q.You have neither Charter nor Act of Parliament to authorize your proceedings? A. No; the Association may consist of one thousand persons or two thousand for what I know; the office is in Great Winchester-street - the Association is governed by twelve directors, self-elected, and the money was paid to the bankers on account of the directors; the amount collected was 60,000l., as near as I can recollect - I do not think it was 100,000l.; I should say between 70,000l. and 80,000l. - the sums were subscribed in 1825; no dividend has been paid - there is no money remaining at the bankers', that I am aware of; there are deeds - I do not know where they are, as I am not now connected with the Association; I believe the shares are still circulating on the Stock Exchange - the mines are at Potosi, I understand; there was no deed of Association.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it ever given out that there was a Charter or Act of Parliament establishing the Company? A. Never; great expence was incurred in sending out vessels - the money was entirely spent in the necessary expences of the Company; share-holders would certainly not be benefitted by fictitious shares in the market.</p>

            . I am a member of the Stock Exchange- I believe the defendant is also a member; I have known him transacting business there for five or six years - I knew him transact business in the shares of public companies; I have bought and sold shares in the Potosi La Paz and Peruvian Mining Association - they were the subject of bargain and sale in the market in May last. On the 7th of May I received from the defendant fourteen parchment instruments, constituting fifty shares in that Association - four represented ten shares, and ten one each; I gave 10s. per share for them, and paid him a cheque drawn on Sir

            , for 1l. 10s., and four sovereigns and another cheque of Jones, Loyd, and Co., my own bankers, for 19l. 10s.; here is is one of the parchment instruments I received - it is No. 3126; here is a figure of 10 on it, which I think is my own writing - it forms no part of the instrument; I have also written on it, "Hayley, for Costello."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? A. It is not carried on at my expence - I do not know at whose expence it is done; I have heard that it is at the expence of Mr. Measam: time bargains have been done with these shares, but not on the Stock Exchange now - they were some time back; that is buying and selling a given number of shares to be taken at a stipulated future day - I am not aware of more being agreed for than can be delivered, because many bargains are almost immediately closed again, and the differences are paid; this may be called partly gambling.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day you agreed with Mr. Hayley for these shares, were you not obliged to wait some time till he could get them from other persons? A. I waited some time for him to produce them, but not long enough to constitute a time bargain - I should think any thing beyond a day would be a time bargain, but if they are delivered the day the bargain is made, I think it is a ready money transaction - time bargains are sales made for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300131"></xptr>an account day; I agreed with a Mr. Costello for the shares - he referred me to Hayley, who was to produce a portion of them; they were delivered about four o'clock on the day I agreed for them - I swear that positively; it was a regular money transaction; I stated this at the Mansion-house - what I said was taken down; my deposition was read over to me, but all I said was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has Mr. Measam any fabricated shares in his possession? A. I have not seen any - this transaction was not a time bargain; the money was paid the same day; when I received the shares I received them as bona fide shares - I produced the cheque on Messrs. Jones and Loyd, which I paid him.</p>

            . I am a letter-press and copperplate printer, and live in the New-cut, Lambeth. I have known the defendant about two years; when I first knew him he gave the name of Smith. In March last, when I came home one day, I found him at my house - my young man had taken an order from him, and entered it in the name of Spicer and Co. - the prisoner then ordered me to engrave a plate like a copy which he had got - (looking at a share) it was as near like this as the engraver could do it; he said the former plate was lost, that Mr. Ellis, the engraver, had offended the gentlemen, and there would be a great many other things to be done - I was to engrave this as quick as I could; it had the name of Ellis, as the engraver, and was dated 1827 - I said it was copper-plate; he said Yes, but the plate was lost, and I was to do another; I got one engraved - a proof was thrown off, which I showed to him on paper at my house; he ordered one hundred to be engraved on parchment - I gave the plate, the whole hundred engravings, and the original they were copied from, all over to the defendant - I was paid 7l. for my trouble; I gave a receipt for the money, in the name of Spicer and Co., and delivered it to the defendant, as my young man entered the work to be done in that name - he made not the least objection to the receipt being in that name - (looking at nineteen impressions) I have no doubt these are all impressed from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you been a speculator in these shares at all? A. No; I never saw Mr. Measam till about May, nor did my wife, to my knowledge - I was taken into custody about these plates; it was then I saw Mr. Measam - I was in custody four or five days till I could find the defendant; I was not in prison, but in a lock-up house at night, and went out with the officer in the day-time to find him - I was never in prison in my life; I was at the office about disposing of indecent prints, and paid the 20l. penalty for it - one of my apprentices was a witness against me; I have not been in trouble about any thing else - I go to Ascot races; you may have seen me there - I kept a "une deux cinq table;" I never said Mr. Measam employed me to engrave these shares -Barker, who superintends my business when I am out, was present when the defendant came; I did not say, at Unionhall, that nobody was present - he had spoken to Barber, but when I came in and took the business Barber left, and was at a little distance in the office when I took the order.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? No, the office is divided - there are two rooms, the press and composing-rooms; he left me with Mr. Hayley - he might have heard our conversation if he had paid attention to it; I do not know whether he did; he might have heard part of it - my wife was at home - she works in the business, and saw the defendant; I believe she was in the kitchen - she was about the premises; I cannot say whether she was in the office or not, but she saw him - she was backwards and forwards; he was dressed in a very dark olive or black surtout coat, and wore glasses - I do not know any thing about Mr. Measam.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think I prosecuted you about the papers? A. Yes; I never saw Measam till he took me into custody in May; I never did any work for him - all the while I was in custody I was about with the officer, by direction of the Magistrate, looking for the defendant, and my wife went about at different periods; the defendant pointed out Ellis' name to me on the engraving.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain the defendant is the man? A. Certainly - he did not tell me where he lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first know the defendant by the name of Hayley? A. The day he was taken he gave that name - Mr. Measam called him Hayley when he took him; I never knew him by that name before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK BARBER. I am journeyman to Mr. Peel. I first saw the defendant in March last - he came to the office to have a plate engraved for the Potosi Association; Mr. Peel was not at home when he came in- he showed me a copy on parchment, similar to this(looking at one); I declined giving him an estimate of the price till Mr. Peel came in, as I did not know the price of engraving - I asked if he would leave his name; he gave me Spicer and Co.; our office is in the back premises below, and as I was shewing him up stairs, I met master - the conversation between them was not exactly in my hearing, for the office where we work has a deal of bustle in it; I did not bear what passed - I saw him leave in about ten minutes; as far as I can recollect, he wore a frock coat, and wore glasses - I saw him again four or five days after, when he came to our house to see a proof of the plate; I was not present when it was shown to him, nor did he say any thing to me about it - I know the engraving had been done then; I saw him again on the Saturday in the same week, when he came to fetch them away - I think it was the same day as he saw the proof; he took away the impressions, which were on parchment, the plate, and the copy it was engraved from - I did not see him pay any thing, and did not see him again till he was apprehended; I am quite sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300132"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Can you give us the day of the week that he first came? A. No - I know it was Saturday that he saw the proof, as there was a chimney on fire opposite; I cannot say which house - I have no other reason - it was about four or five o'clock; I have lived with Peel about nine months - I did not notice the colour of the defendant's glasses; he had a dark coat, inclining to brown - I know his features, but did not examine him all over; I cannot say what cravat he wore - there were two more men at work in the office, about four yards from master, but you cannot hear while the press is going what persons in the counting-house are talking of, unless you chose to be inquisitive and listen; I cannot say how long these men had been in master's employ, nor recollect their names - they merely came to work a job off; there is a small partition to the counting-house, but still they might see the defendant - he did not pass them to go out; I did not ask the defendant where he lived, but it was asked, because I was desired to put down Stangate - I have the book here: I asked Mr. Peel if he had left his address - he said Stangate; master said he had told him where he lived - if he has said he did not ask him, he must have said an untruth to me, or to the gentleman who asked him, if he did: Mrs. Peel was going backwards and forwards in the office - I cannot say how near she was to him; she passed him, I believe - as far as I can recollect this was in the morning; it might be ten o'clock, or it might be three - the order was given and executed in March, but I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the two men in the office at press or composing? A.They were at press that day; it makes a great noise, and engages their attention - the counting-house is separated by a partition: the men were not in our constant employ - I saw the defendant at Unionhall, and had a doubt of him till I heard him speak, on account of his not having spectacles, but had not the least doubt then, and have none now.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Peel. I saw the defendant at our house in March last, several times in in that month, and I had seen him about two years ago - he then left us the name of Smith; we then lived further up, in the same street - he came to have some printing done; I did not see him again till last March, and recognized him as the person I had seen - he came to know if my husband could engrave a plate for him, and brought a proof with him; Mr. Peel not being at home, he asked Barber if Mr. Peel could engrave a plate like that copy; he told him Yes - I saw the copy he produced; it was like this and printed on parchment - Mr. Peel met him as he was going out, in the passage; I afterwards saw him when he came to see a proof of the plate - I told him it was not ready then, and he was to come on Saturday; I know that he came on Saturday, and waited a quarter of an hour till Mr. Peel came in - I sent our lad for the proof; I took the proof from the lad who brought it, and Mr. Peel came in - I gave it to him, and he showed it to the defendant; I saw him when he came the same night and took them away - I put them up in the kitchen, and just as Mr. Peel came to the door the defendant came in and had them; my husband was taken to Union-hall on this charge, and detained six days - while he was detained I went out, by direction of the Magistrate, with Pople, the officer, to find the defendant; I went to the 'Change, and several places - I at last stationed myself on Londonbridge, and while there the defendant passed; I pointed him out to Pople, and said I was confident in my mind he was the man, but I would not swear to him till I saw him full in the face - I went up, and spoke to him; directly he saw me he put his handkerchief up to his face - I asked if his name was Thompson, or Thomas - I hardly know which, I was in such a state of agitation; it was the first name that came to my mind - he told me that was not his name; I said my name was Peel, and asked if he did not know me - he said No, he did not, he had no knowledge of me whatever; I said I was confident he did know me, for Mr. Peel had done some work for him - he said No, he did not know me, but when he first saw me he thought me very much like a servant that lived with him; I left him, and went to speak to Pople - I told him I had not had a sufficient view of his countenance, but we would watch him, see where he went to, and Mr. Peel should come and see him; we followed him up Gracechurch-street - he went up and down several courts, and when he got to the corner of Bishopsgate-street he looked round to see if I was following him; he had looked round several times before, and not wishing him to see me I went into a shop; when I came out both him and Pople were gone- I saw him before the Magistrate the same afternoon; I am confident he is the person, for I answered the door every time to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You answered the door the first time, and all? A. Yes - I think it was three times; it was not to me he spoke about the engraving - he asked me if Mr. Peel was at home; I asked him down to Barber - I cannot tell the date on which he first came; I rather think it was the beginning of March, and I think between three and four o'clock - we had dined; Barber dines with us - I think we had dined, but I do not recollect such a trifling circumstance; as near as I can recollect we had dined - I am confident he did not come so early as one o'clock; the apprentice was in the office, and so was I part of the time - I cannot say how long I staid; there was nobody else in the lower office -Barber was at work; I do not remember whether the presses were going - I paid no attention to the conversation between my husband and the defendant; I was in the office in which the presses were - my husband and Hayley were in a small place, a sort of counting-house; it is not a regular counting-house, but only some boards placed across - it is one room; I do not think any body else was at work in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call the defendant Thomas? A. I had asked the officer what I should do to see his face, but he kept his handkerchief up over his nose and mouth all the time - I do not think any body was at work at the presses when he was there, but I am in and out so many times I do not take notice; sometimes we are busy. and take extra men - my husband was once taken to Unionhall through a person informing against him; his apprentice's indentures were cancelled - I was never taken up; - yes, I was, at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that an officer took you into custody, or were you desired by any writing to go to Union-hall? A. I never was taken up by an officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300133"></xptr>any where; a man had come into the house after this trouble of Mr. Peel's, and insulted me - he struck me, and I slapped his face, because he used improper language to me; that was the subject I went there about - I was never in custody; one of our presses makes a great noise when it is at work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You speak of the office and counting-house - they are parted off by a board? A. Yes, as high as my shoulder - a piece is cut out, so that you can see who comes into the office; the defendant and Peel were in the counting-house, and I even with them, but not in the counting-house - it is too small to hold three; I cannot say whether Barber was in the counting-house any part of the time.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. In May last Peel was in my custody, with liberty to go out with me to look for a person supposed to have uttered a forged instrument - Mrs. Peel also accompanied me at times; Peel had described the person to me - I was on London-bridge with Mrs. Peel, when the defendant came in sight; Mrs. Peel was standing some distance from me; she ran to me, and said, "There, I think, is the man; there he goes;" I accompanied her, and followed him to about the centre of the bridge, about a hundred yards, and then she spoke to him - I did not hear what she said; he had a handkerchief holding up to his mouth, and when she spoke to him he kept it a little way off, but still kept it before his face; after she had done talking to him I followed him with her - she requested me not to lose sight of him; he went up Fish-street-hill, through White Hart-court, and several other little courts, in and out, till he came to the Cross Keys coach-yard, and into Gracechurch-street; I had him in sight the whole time - he did not call at any place, but kept looking back; he went quite out of the way - it was a bye way to get round; he looked back several times, and I suspected he saw Mrs. Peel - after he got across Cornhill into Bishopsgate-street he got a little way down, then crossed over the way - Mrs. Peel passed me, and got into a gateway; I saw the defendant go into a hosier's or draper's shop, and come out again at the same door in an instant - I saw no more of Mrs. Peel; I followed the prisoner into the Stock Exchange - the turnings he took were quite out of his way; having nobody to assist me, I went for Peel, brought him over with me, went into a court at the back of the Stock Exchange, and there Peel identified the defendant as the man - he was in the court among other persons, not alone; he said he was the man the moment that he saw him, without any doubt whatever- I took him into custody, and told him I wanted him for forgery - he said he did not understand or know any thing about it; I got into a coach with Peel, him, and two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had Peel been in your custody? A. Four or five days.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Had he been employed in that time looking for the defendant? A.Day and night.</p>

            . I am an agent, and deal occasionally in Mine shares; I have done a great deal in the Potosi shares. I know the defendant; he has dealt very extensively in such shares - I have got into my possession seventeen forged shares, which are here, and more than that; friends whom I have bought for have a great many more - I never saw Peel till he was in Pople's custody; I never ordered him to engrave a plate for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are the prosecutor of this indictment? A.Certainly; I have never been a member of the Stock Exchange, but have a clerkship in the house, and am privileged to be a member if I like; nothing has been produced from the mines - the money received by the directors has not been accounted for; I consider the shares worth something till that is done- I am not a proprietor; I am not connected with the Puno Mining Association.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your name on this? (handing him a paper.) A. Yes, I can account for that; Puno is in South America- my name is put here by desire of the jobbers; the dealers wished me to sign them, that they might know a good from a bad one.</p>

            . I am a jobber, and dealer in foreign shares; I live in Bevis-marks. I have known the defendant two or three years - he sold me forty Potosi shares, shortly before the 7th of May; they were to be delivered to me on the 7th of May, and on the 7th of May he bought seventy of me; I have the memorandum, which I took out of the jobbing book; I had to deliver him thirty to balance - I did not deliver them, but told him to take twenty of Mr. Knight, and ten of Mr. Old; he paid Mr. Old for them, I believe; and I had to pay the difference, which was very considerable.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the prisoner always been a dealer in mining and speculating shares? A. Yes, very largely - I dare say he has dealt to the amount of thousands of pounds; I have dealt with him for some hundreds - mine was a time bargain; I did not deliver shares to him, but referred him to gentlemen in the market - I believe he had them; I paid him the difference in money - I do not consider it gambling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell the number of any one share that passed from you to Hayley? A. No; many hundred shares pass through our hands in a day - I cannot take the numbers.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live at No. 64, Goswell-street. On the 7th of May, by direction of Jacobs, I delivered to the defendant two Potosi shares, each being for ten shares; I cannot say in what year they were dated.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this share? A. We never endorse them - my name is on this; it is not my writing - persons sometimes write on the back the name of the person they buy of; I cannot say whether I sold him this share - I sold him several tens; on the 7th of May some notice was taken about some shares being understood to be had, and I think Hayley applied to me about it; but I know nothing of any bad shares - I gave them as I took them; I said I passed them on in the way I took them, and would not take any back - I never suspected him.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is "Knight for Jacobs" on this his hand-writing? A. I do not know his writing - we keep books, but never let each other see them.</p>

            . I am a stock-jobber, and live in New North-road. I have known Hayley about three years- (referring to a book) on the 7th of May, I believe, I de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300134"></xptr>livered him ten Potosi shares, for a person named Jacobs; I cannot say how many tickets they were in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Will you show me the entry? A.You must look at Friday, the 29th of April - the entry is,"

            Jacobs, 10-15 for next week," which was the 7th of May; they were sold for the following Saturday -
               <persName id="t18310630-291-person2102">D. P. </persName>
            means double Potosi - 10-15s., ten shares at 15s.; there is no other entry to show it was for the 7th of May- next week means the last day of the next week.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.How long have you been on bad terms? A. I have not spoken to him for nearly two years; I do not know where my wife lives - I pay the parish 3s. 6d. a week for her, and I have my six children at home to maintain; I think I heard Peel examined in a Court of Justice on the 30th of June, 1830 - I did not contradict what he swore.</p>

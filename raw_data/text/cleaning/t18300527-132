On Sunday morning, the 16th of May, Beark was going out, and I saw a small paper drop from him - I asked what it was; he said Nothing: I said, "Let me look," and I found two knives in it - I asked where he got them, but he made no answer; I called an officer, but could not make him hear - I then went back, and Beark said, "I will tell you the truth - Webb set me on to do it, and we have robbed you a great deal;" I had not made him any promise; I got the Police-officer, and he said the same to him - he said he had robbed me of pen-knives, pocket-knives, and scissars, which he had taken from the show-glass - I believe all this property to be mine, but some of the ivory I cannot swear to, as it has been worked upon - these handles were brought to me by his mother, who said he told her he had bought them of Mr. Marsden.</p>

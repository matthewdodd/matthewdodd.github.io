                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-street, Soho, and am a shoemaker. On the 17th of Feb. I spent the afternoon at a public-house—I saw all the three prisoners there—I left the house for a particular purpose, and went to a wart—it was then nearly dark, between half-past five and six o'clock—while there I was struck at the back of my neck, and I fell on my knees—the pri<lb></lb>soner Williams had passed me about a second before I received the blow—he was not above a yard from me—he came back when I was down, pushed me on my chest, and pushed me down on my back; and when I was on my back, he took my ribbon and watch out of my waistcoat pocket, snapped it off, and broke it—I did not see either of the other prisoners at that time, but about a second afterwards they were close to my person—Wood seized me round the waist and held me, and the two men ran across through the court together—Wood did not go back with me to the public-house—she went part off the way with me, and came into the public-house afterwards—I have not found my watch—I am quite sure it was in my pocket—I was not quite sober, but I was sober enough to know what took place.</p>

On Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., the prosecutor came to my house about one o'clock—he drank several half-pints of wine—I served him with five and the young man with one—I went away at three o'clock, he was there then—I came back about six o'clock, he was there then—Wood had been drinking with him—she was nearly as tipsy as he was—I saw Williams and Ryan there about six o'clock—Wood and the prosecutor had been away somewhere—they returned, and Wood made an observation that some man with one arm had got the watch—(the prisoner Williams has only one arm)—Wood said it was done in some court in Wild-street—Williams was not there at that time—Wood said if the prosecutor came home with her she had got the ticket of his watch, and he should have it for a sovereign—she exhibited a ticket, and I looked at it—it was the ticket of a whittle, not of a watch.</p>

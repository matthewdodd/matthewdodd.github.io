                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Clark, and live in Earl-street, Finsbury. The prisoner charred for us on Wednesday, the 11th of May, and was there on the Saturday before—we kept our money in a drawer, in the front room, on the second floor—I counted it three times on Wednesday—it was all safe at seven o'clock—there were twelve sovereigns looked in a drawer, in a small box—I sent the prisoner for some beer at about half-past eight o'clock, and gave her a shilling to pay for it, which, I took out of the drawer, but at the opposite corner—I left my keys in the drawer—she immediately went out for the beer—before that I had seen her come down stairs—she had no business up-stairs—that was after I had seen the twelve sovereigns—about ten o'clock I went to the drawer again, and missed one sovereign—I informed my husband and spoke to the prisoner about it—I have know her five or six years—she made use of very awful expressions, and said she had never been near the drawer—there was nobody else in the room but me and my husband that could take it—I went for the police<lb></lb>man, and a women found the sovereign on her at the station-house—we had charged her with taking it, and she denied it, and said several times that all she had in the world was three halfpence.</p>

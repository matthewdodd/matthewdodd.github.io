            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. - I met the prisoner and another man in Stacey-street, St. Giles's, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of December, about half a mile from Meux's brewhouse; the prisoner had this cock underneath his jacket; I followed him to the shop of a plumber, named Conniss, in Long-acre - while he was at the door I took him by the collar, and knocked at the door; Conniss came down - I asked if he knew the prisoner - he said he had seen him. but he was not in his employ. I then asked if he knew this cock - he said No. The prisoner then said he got it from a house at the west end of the town. I took him into custody.</p>

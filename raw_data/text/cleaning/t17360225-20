At the Queen's Head in Ratcliff Hamlet, in White-horse-street, the Prisoner and I lay together; there was 3 of us in all; I lay in the middle. The Buttons were on my Cloaths when I went to Bed, and the Buckles in my Breeches; when I waked in the Morning. the Prisoner was gone and all the Buttons cut off my Cloaths. I had laid my Cloaths on a Chair close to that side of the Bed on which he lay. When he was before the Justice he said he went away from us in the Morning before we were up, because he had no Money to pay his Reckoning: But when his Mittimus was made, and he was going to Prison, he said if I would discharge him, he would work his Finger-nails off to make me amends.</p>

            . The Prosecutor's Buttons were on his Cloaths, when we went to Bed. In the Morning the Prisoner was gone and the Prosecutor's Buttons were cut off his Cloaths. I can't say the Prisoner committed the Fact, but I can safely say, I did not meddle with them. There was no one in the House but the Land-lord and his Wife, and us 3 who lay in one Bed.</p>

            . I am the Landlord; I saw the Buttons on the Prosecutor's Frock when he went to Bed: In the Morning between 4 and 5 my Wife heard some body go down Stairs, and call'd three Times who's there; but no one answer'd. About 5 I went to work and found the Door open; I call'd up my Wife, Love says I, I don't like this; the Door is open: There was only ourselves and these 3 Men in the House.</p>

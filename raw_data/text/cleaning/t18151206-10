            . I keep a chandler's shop. On the 30th of October, between two and three in the morning, I saw two men driving three pigs. At first I was not sure they were pigs, it was so dark. The pigs laid themselves down in the Kennel. I stopped the prisoner, and the other man ran away. I questioned the prisoner a good deal, where he was going; and he said he was going to market at Cow Cross. I told him there was no market that morning. He said that the little pig belonged to him, and that the other two belonged to the other man. Then I said to him that he must give a better account, and when I got near enough to him I seized him. I called the watchman, and he was taken to Bishopsgate watch-house. I gave the pigs up to the officer of the night, and he kept them in his cellar.</p>

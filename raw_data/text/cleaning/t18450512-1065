                  </hi>. I live in Allen-street, Back church-lane, St. George's in the East, and keep the whole house. On the 14th of May I went to bed at twelve o'clock at night—I shut the parlour window down but did not secure it—I was alarmed at four o'clock in the morning and found it open, and the Venetian blinds which had been shut both open—I lost a jacket, waistcoat, shirt, shirt-front, and pillow-case—a bottle was missing from the mantle-shelf, and some linen of my wife's—I have since seen them all.</p>

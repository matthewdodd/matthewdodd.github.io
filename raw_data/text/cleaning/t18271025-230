            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Bethnal-green. On the 4th of October, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the evening - I saw Smith in Artillery-lane, with these posts on his shoulder - Norton was walking behind him, and knowing Norton, I watched them down into Petticoat-lane, and saw them offer them for sale; they could get no purchaser, and left them at a public-house- I went to Lambeth-street; two officers came and took them away - I saw Smith next morning, in Norton-folgate, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner NORTON. Q. Did you ever say you would proceed no further, if you got 1l.? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is your mark, which says you have received 10s. 6d.? A. Yes; from the time I was at the office: his wife has been bothering me - I received 10s. 6d., and have it at home - I did not undertake not to appear, on receiving the rest; the mark on this paper is not mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It says, "Mr. Briggs received 10s. 6d." - Did you make your mark to this? A. No - I never saw that paper before; ever since I was at the office, she has been after me - I would not tell her where I lived; she offered me several sums, if I would throw out the bill - I said I would not do any such thing, and the prosecutor, to get rid of her, told her where my sister lived - I took it from her, to get rid of her bother; she said if I would take 3l. she would get it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take it? A. She put it into my hand.</p>

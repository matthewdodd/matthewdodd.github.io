                  </hi>. I am shepherd to William Smith, who lives in the parish of Harrow. On Wednesday, the 22nd of August, he had some sheep in a field in the parish of Pinner—I counted them in the evening, and they were all safe—between six and seven o'clock next morning I went to the field, and one was gone—I found the head, skin and entrails, in a few minutes, about a hundred yards from where I had left the sheep—it was the skin of one of master's ewes, which had been safe over night—it had a dot on the rump, ruddled—I took it home, and it has been in Walker's, the butcher's, possession ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Harrow. On the 23rd of August I went with a search-warrant to Roots' house, he was not at home—I did not know he lived there then—I found nobody at home myself but his wife came to the house as his place of residence—Walker, Murch, and Roe, were with me—I remained outside the house—I saw them bring a quantity of mutton out, and it was given to Walker—I after<lb></lb>wards apprehended Roots at Merry hill-farm, the same day.</p>

I accompanied Greenhill to search Roots' house, and saw a leg of mutton, a shoulder, two parts of a neck, the scrag, and a piece of the brisket found—I had the skin given to me—I fitted the leg to the skin, and also fitted the shoulder to the joint—the leg and shoulder fitted, and tallied with the shank bones left in the skin—I have not a doubt they formed part of the animal—it was cut up very badly, not like a butcher would do it—it was very fresh, as if killed the night before—there was fat torn from the leg adhering to the skin, and the fat on the leg corresponded.</p>

I know the prisoners by working with them—on Wednesday, the 22nd of August, I was at work just by Armstrong—in the afternoon it rained and I went to shelter—he asked me if I should like to have a piece of mutton—I said, "Yes"—he asked what joint I should like to have—I said a leg if I had any thing, as there was something to cut from—next morning, about seven o'clock, I was going up the lane, and Armstrong came down to me, and said, "I have brought what we were talking of yesterday"—I asked him what it was—he turned away, and said, "I will bring it down to you presently"—I saw him afterwards showing Wade some meat, which he had tied in a smock-frock—it appeared to be mutton—I did not get any from him—he took it across the road, behind a hedge, and came away—he left it there, and went to work, and between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him fetch it away from behind the hedge.</p>

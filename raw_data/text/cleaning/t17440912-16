Last Friday was a month, I saw the Prisoner go up the dark gate-way by Galley-Key, with this box under his left arm: about 10 or 15 minutes after, I met a woman in Thames-street with the same box. A few minutes after, I saw the Prisoner with Mr. Mead and Mr. Addison at the water-side; and they desired the box might be sent back again, and promised him favour. Said I, Bothaw, receive mery while you can - and he made reply, You black-guard dog, what business is it of yours? I went to the woman's house whom I saw with it under her arm, and found it in her room, under the rug upon the bed: And some people will scandalize me about it, with being a thief-taker, but I am sure I am not, for I want no reward - I knew the woman before, by her sitting with others and things upon the Keys ; and got information concerning it by a neighbour of hers in White's-yard, who saw her carry it into the house, after I had waited 2 or 3 hours at the door. - The Prisoner worked upon the Keys.</p>

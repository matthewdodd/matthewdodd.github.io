On the 23rd of July, I was just getting out of one of Mr. Barke's vans at Woolwich, and I saw the two prisoners standing at the Ship Tavern—they asked me to give therm somthing to drink, and we had some gin—we them went out together, and fell in with the marine—I had this bag with me, containing the articles stated—Ann Lcech car<lb></lb>ried my bag first, and the marine took it of her—we went to the White Lion, and had two half-pints of run and shrub, and Mr. Banister said, "Let this young man stop here, or let him leave his bag"—the marine said, "No, he is a shipmate of mine, he shall go with me"—he went out with the bag, and I followed him, and the prisoners followed me—Ross went on one side—Leech stepped up to me and said she wanted some money for supper—she then put her hand into my pocket, took out my money and started away—she took the bag off the marine's shoulder and ran away with it—they all ran away—Ross was not above twenty yeads from Leech—Ross did not do any think towards taking the bag—I ran after them, up Mr. Comber's-alley—I staid in the church-yard till four o'clock in the morining—I found this shawl in my pocket, which Leech thrust into it—I went the next mprning to the house where Leech was—I there found the bag—it had been cut open with a sharp knife, or some<lb></lb>thing—the clothes were out and the shells also—she said she knew the person who had the aheels, that it was Mary Ross—we went and found them there.</p>

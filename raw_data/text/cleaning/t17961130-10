               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. Sober as I am now; the silk handkerchief and my breeches with the watch in the fob were on a chair by the bed side; in the morning, between five and six, I found I was robbed of my watch and handkerchief; I lay in a back room to which I went through the front room; when I got up in the morning, I found the door of my room locked on the outside with a padlock, I made a noise at the door, and the servant came and opened it, she told me nobody had been in the room but the prisoner; she went up stairs, and the prisoner came down and abused me in a very gross manner, she took a case knife in her hand, and threatened to take my life, if I offered to accuse her of any thing of the kind; I told her I did not accuse any body, but my watch I had lost since I came into the house; I went for a constable, and had her taken up, the constable found nine shillings and three-pence upon her, and the silk handkerchief at a pawnbroker's, he shewed it me the next day, the 17th, the watch has never been found.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Bow-street, I am assistant to the officers; On the 17th of October, about eleven o'clock, the prosecutor came to me, and told me he was robbed; I went with him to a house in Dyor-street; we stopped some time below stairs, and the prisoner came in, he said, she was the woman that shewed him the lodging; I searched her, and found in her pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300025"></xptr>a nutmeg-grater and this duplicate, by the direction of which, I went with the prosecutor to the pawn-brokers, and found the handkerchief, the pawn-broker brought the handkerchief down to the Magistrates, and the woman was committed, the watch was never found, I found some money upon her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DOBREE sworn. - I am a pawn-broker, at No. 135, High-Holborn; the prisoner pawned this handkerchief with me the 17th of October, between ten and eleven in the morning, I lent her a shilling upon it, I have had it ever since; I know the prisoner, I am sure she is the person that brought it. (The handkerchief was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was standing at the corner of Dyot-street, the prosecutor asked me to go and have a pint of beer in the public-house, I went, and we had two pots of beer, and he asked me to take him to my lodgings, I took him home, and he gave me a shilling for his bed; he said, he would give me two shilling to sleep with me, he gave me but one, and gave me the handkerchief for the other; I went to bed with him, but he behaved so rude and indecent, I could not stay in the bed with him; I went up stairs and slept by myself, and in the morning I pawned the handkerchief for the other shilling, as he had given me but one; when I was taken, they knocked me down, and used me very ill, I was eight months gone with-child, and their usage occasioned the death of the child; I had 12s. in money they took from me.</p>

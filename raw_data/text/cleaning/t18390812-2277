The prisoner's father is a navigator, and his mother goes out to wash and clean—they lodge in the second-floor room at that house—the prisoner was with them when he was at home—on the 26th of July I went out about half-past seven, and returned at eight o'clock—I had locked my room door, and put the key into a little oven—when I came back the key. was in the door, and the door not locked—I went into the room—I found my waist-ribbon on the floor, and my work was lying about—I opened my box, and missed my gown—the prisoner did not come homo till eleven o'clock the next morning—I did not then know that he had any thing to do with my gown, but I suspected him.</p>

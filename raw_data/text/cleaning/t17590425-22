            . The goods mentioned in the indictment, mentioning them all by name, were all taken out of our house, my mother's property, all but two linnen handkerchiefs and a petticoat, which are my property. My mother is ill, and unable to stir out of her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. The prisoner was my mother's servant for between fourteen and fifteen months; in the last two months I missed several things, especially at washing times; when I have asked the prisoner after such or such things, she would make several pretences, they might be mislaid, or the like. At last I said to her, if you are honest yourself, you may keep bad company. On Wednesday the eleventh of this instant April, she was to get up to wash at four in the morning. I call'd her up. I went to bed and slept again. At seven in the morning she came to me, and said, Pray, madam, get up; for God's sake, madam, get up. What is the matter, said I? - there has been thieves, they have broke the house open; the kitchen window is broke, and the pewter is taken from the shelves, but I have not power to look farther to see what is lost. I said, it is strange you should see this at four, and stay till seven before you come to tell me of it. Said she, I sat down and cry'd. I went down stairs, and said, I suppose the plate is gone. She said, she supposed so to. I told over the pewter, and missed eight pewter plates. We had a pretty large quantity of pewter stood by in a closet, which she had access to. She said, they had taken a gown of her's, and several other things; and that they had been in the parlour, and taken the tea spoons from off the table. I said, I was awake from three to four and heard nothing. They must be extreamly still in what they did. The following night we could not get the window mended, we were forced to get two men to sit up to watch the house. The Apothecary that came to see my mother said, have you not some suspicion of your maid being a little concerned in the thing. I said no; she has lost things of her own. Said he, I would not raise a suspicion on an innocent girl; but I am informed, she lets in a man every night into your house. The next morning, a man that serves us with fish, came and asked me, what gown it was that my maid had lost? I said, a red and white flower'd gown; said he, I know that to have been carried to pawn, with a white petticoat, that I believe was none of her own; and I believe three pewter plates, by a woman that has been seen to come to your house on nights; and that person had been concealed many weeks in the house unknown to me; and that at that time she was in our house in the kitchen. I went down, but could see nothing; I heard a rustling in the coal-hole, but I had not courage to go into it. I went up stairs again; as soon as I got up, the person that told me of it, said, he saw the woman run out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250029"></xptr> house. My maid was gone out. As soon as she return'd I taxed her with letting a woman be privately in my house. She said, whoever said so, she would make them prove their words, and denied it. In about a quarter of an hour's time, the fish-man came again, and brought the woman with him, that had been concealed in the house. He said, Madam, this is the woman, she will declare the truth herself. Then the woman said, Madam, I have been concealed in your house for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She was quite silent; but afterwards she own'd it, and own'd also that she sent that woman with her gown to pawn; the other woman said to me, she had carried out things to pawn for the prisoner, but had never wrong'd us of any thing; and was sorry she had been so unhappy as to have been guilty of what she had; I let her go, and turn'd the prisoner out of the house immediately; after that several of my neighbours told me the prisoner must certainly have a hand in the robbery; I was advised by a relation to go to Justice Fielding about it; I went there, and related the case; he granted me a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and the other woman, and a warrant to search. Mr Waters was with me at the time, we had two officers from Justice Fielding's to go with us to take up the two women; when we came to the house where they were, the people deny'd them; the door being open'd they were both in the room; the other woman being dress'd different from what she was when I saw her before, I did not know her; by the neglect of the officer she made her escape; the prisoner was concealed in a closet; when I came to ask her what she had done with the things; she answer'd, that my petticoat was under the bed she had laid in that night in the same room; I desired her to give it me; she took it from under the bed with two pewter mazareens my mother's property, and delivered them to me: there was nothing else found upon her; she declared, the other person, that had made her escape, had a silver salt and a large silver spoon, and some other things, my mother's property, at the time she had escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say took them ?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She said the other woman took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say by whose directions?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention all these goods to her?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she say took the petticoat and mazareens?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She would not own that she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say that other woman came to the house?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. She own'd that she maintain'd her there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own that the other woman took the goods with her knowledge and consent?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend at Justice Fielding's upon the prisoner's examination?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. I did: she would make no confession; she was committed to Clerkenwell New-Prison and from thence to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive all those things were under her charge in the house ?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. No, some of them were not; some of them were lock'd up, and the others were in common use about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What were lock'd up?</p>
               <p>Hinkle. Five of the pewter dishes, the two mazareens, and some of the pewter plates were lock'd up, but she had found a key that would open the lock that belong'd to another closet. After she had been examined, Justice Fielding advis'd me to have the other things advertis'd; upon which a silver salt, five silver tea-spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, were brought from Mrs Bebby's, a Pawnbroker, to Justice Fielding's, and I swore to them. The quilted petticoat and mazareens produc'd in court and deposed to.</p>

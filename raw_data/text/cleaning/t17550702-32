She inticed me to go along with her. She took me to a house in that alley, up two pair of stairs. She ask'd me what I would give her; I said I had but 4 d. 1/2 about me, besides my watch. She bid me give her the 4 d. 1/2; accordingly I did. Then she took the watch out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Bray. Between ten and eleven o'clock. After that, I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your watch?</p>
               <p>Bray. I miss'd it before I went out of the house, but she was gone first.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a public or private house?</p>
               <p>Bray. A private house, set out into tenements. I went the next morning, and ask'd her for the watch, but she deny'd knowing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen it since?</p>
               <p>Bray. It was brought to me last Thursday night.</p>

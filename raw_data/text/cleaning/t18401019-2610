                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Cox, a plumber and glazier, at Stoke Newington. On Friday, the 16th of October, I went to the street-door to take in some bread—my daughter Sarah, who is a year and a half old, followed me to the door and went down the step—I left her there for about two minutes, and then her necklace was gone off her neck—I saw no person near the door—I went down the street, and saw Walters walking away—Agar and Sugg fetched a policeman, who took Walters into custody—the necklace was three rows of coral, and was clasped securely round her neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live in High-street, Kingsland. On the 16th of October, as I was going into my school, oppo<lb></lb>site Mr. Cox's house, I saw the two prisoners coming up the lane—the child came a little way from the door to play with some more children—Reeves crossed over towards the children, and Walters went a little way farther, and stood still looking over towards the fields—he could not see what Reeves did—Reeves patted the little baby on the back, and pulled the snap of the necklace round to the back, he then unsnapped it and put his hand into his pocket with the necklace, he then went towards Walters, who was waiting for him, tapped him on the shoulder and said something to him, and they walked away together—I told the children what had hap<lb></lb>pened, and a little girl cried out—Reeves then ran away as fast as he could, and Walters walked quite fast in the same direction—MRS. Cox came out, and I told her.</p>

Cox went in-doors with the bread, and Reeves crossed over, stood a little while, and then tapped the little girl on the shoulder, put his hand into his pocket, pulled it out again, then pulled the beads round behind her neck, unsnapped them, took them off, and put them into his pocket—Walters went on to the end of the school, and stood still, looking over towards the fields—he was about thirty yards from Reeves—Reeves joined him, and tapped him on the shoulder, said something, and they walked away together—the little girl raised an alarm, then Reeves ran and Walters walked away quite fast.</p>

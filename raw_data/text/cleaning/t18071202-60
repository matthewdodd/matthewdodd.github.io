            . I am a scavenger's man. I was at work in the Haymarket. On the 2nd of November, between one and two, I saw the prisoner at the bar in the Haymarket, and a young man with him; I noticed him and the young man being about St. Martin's parish and in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Penfold's errand cart. - A. I had seen it against the Opera house tap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do any thing to the cart. - A. A young man that was with him took the band box out of the cart and delivered it to the prisoner; as soon as I saw that I left my cart and seized the prisoner directly with the property upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did very properly indeed - what became of the young man. - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both together when you laid hold of the prisoner. - A. No, the young man might be twenty yards from the prisoner; I seized the prisoner by the collar, I says that is not your property, come along with me; he said I shall not run away; I said I will take care you shall not; I took him into the Opera tap, and asked who owned the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found an owner for the box. - A. Yes, I held the prisoner till the officer came; the box was delivered into the bar of the Opera tap. (The box produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the same box that you took from the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was hired to carry it into some street at the Opera tap door, into Suffolk-street; I said to the young man that hired me, I was willing to carry it any where; he went up to the cart and gave it me; he had a smock frock on, I did not know him from Adam. When I saw the people were running, I did not attempt to run away, I was looking to see where they were running to. I did not know but what the man that gave me the parcel belonged to the cart.</p>

(The books produced.) Some of them I took out of the pawnbrokers, and some I stopt; I am sure all the books that I have here, he either brought me or sold me; I believe he first came to me about the 22d of September, and two or three days after, he brought me two or three odd volumes more.</p>
               <p>Did you keep these books by themselves, or mark them? - When he brought me some, two or three days afterwards, I had a suspicion, and I marked them; and the first I kept by themselves, as I always do, when I buy a lot; I put a cross upon them that I stopt upon him; after those I took out of pawn, there were thirty-two volumes of one sort, running numbers; and there were some odd volumes which I put my shop mark on.</p>

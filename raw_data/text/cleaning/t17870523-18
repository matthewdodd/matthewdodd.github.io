               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought this coat in Rosemary-lane on Wednesday, I believe it was the 2d of May, between four and five; I have witnesses I believe at the door; after I was taken up, I had not time to send to the place where I bought it, the man was not at home; but he heard of it after, and he said, if any thing further came of it; he would appear.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Are you a house-keeper? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - A wire drawer.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In the Borough.</p>
               <p>With whom do you work? - With Mr. Luxford in Houndsditch; I was drinking in Rosemary-lane a pint of beer, this man came in to bargain for a coat, and the prisoner chucked down a guinea and some silver, I cannot say how much silver, a man brought it there, and this gentleman the prisoner bargained for it, and gave a guinea and some silver, seven or eight and twenty or thirty shillings; there was a guinea and some silver thrown down, I did not take any particular notice; I knew nothing at all of the man, I was there before they came in; it was between four and five as near as I can recollect; it was on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Were they all strangers to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the house? - I staid about two hours; the man that sold the coat went directly, as soon as he sold it; and as soon as the prisoner had drank his pint of beer, he went away; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>He had never seen you before this? - No never.</p>
               <p>You and he had no conversation at all about this coat? - No.</p>
               <p>I should be very glad to know, as the prisoner and you were total strangers, and you had no conversation about this coat, how he came to find you out? - He sent down to the house, to know whether there was ever a one that saw him buy the coat, and I went there the next evening, and they asked me if I saw the coat sold, and I said yes; and if it was wanted, I would go and say so.</p>
               <p>How many people were in the public-house besides you? - There were a great many; I cannot say how many there were, I did not take any particular notice at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230032"></xptr>Was that a house you frequented much? - No; I call there now and then to see an acquaintance, a breeches-maker.</p>
               <p>Had you ever been in that house before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do the people of the house know you? - No, they do not, only by sight; I have been there five or six times before this.</p>
               <p>Court to Gough. Did the prisoner ever say any thing to you about purchasing the great coat? - No my Lord, not to my knowledge, he never did.</p>
               <p>Court to Ellis and Robinson. Did the prisoner ever say thing to you about purchasing the great coat? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told the alderman that I gave the money for the coat, and he waited an hour for me, to see if the witness would come; I told them I bought it.</p>
               <p>Court to Gough. Did he say before the alderman that he had bought it, or it was lent him? - He said before the alder- that he had bought it, but not to us; he told the alderman he would send for a friend, but that friend never came.</p>

On Tuesday, the 30th of September, I opened the window at six o'clock in the morning, I saw Lanham standing opposite the house in a door-way - she beckoned to me, and I went and opened the iron-gate, and she came to it; I had seen her there before; she asked if Mrs. Bacon, the cook, was come down; I said Bacon was not come down, but she would not be long; I told her to go round to the kitchen-door and I would let her in; I did so, and she told me to tell Bacon she was waiting: Mrs. Jones is the <rs id="t18281023-100-viclabel589" type="occupation">housekeeper</rs>

I told her she was not at liberty to give any broken victuals away, nor to have any followers - the kitchen-stuff was to be her perquisite.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there a bell at the iron-gate? A. No, nor a knocker; that is the only place to which a person should come on business, and go out; the wooden gate in the pales, out of which Lanham got, is only used for carts to come in. I am a widow - and all the provision there is under my care; I am responsible for it.</p>

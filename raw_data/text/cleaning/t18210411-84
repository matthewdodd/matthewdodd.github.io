On the morning of the 24th of November, I was at work in a garden, in Wheatley-lane, about eight o'clock. I saw the prisoner and another man come down the lane, with each a sack on his shoulder, which appeared very heavy. I watched the prisoner to the corner of the lane, he put his bag down and looked about - then took it up, and both went together towards Brentford. I followed them and sent for assistance - he stopped to rest. I followed them to Iseleworth Park - when they saw me following them, they took towards Isleworth they saw me - then threw down the bag and ran away. I did not see him again till he was taken up. I am sure the prisoner is one of the men. I knew him before. I followed them to the lodge - Neal came out and overtook the other man who has been convicted. I did not see the prisoner again till about a fortnight ago, when I took him myself, at Mr. Hunt's, a chimney-sweeper's, at Brentford. When I went to enquire for him he was denied - I found him in a bed-room. I left the bags with Winkworth.</p>

            . I am carpenter to the Duke of Northumberland. On this morning I was going home to my breakfast, about half-past eight o'clock, and met two men in the lane heavily laden, with each a bag. I will not swear the prisoner is one of them. When they came opposite me, they threw the bags down, and ran away, one was secured, and the other escaped. I fitted the lead to the staircase - it fitted the edge and was quite fresh cut - it was stolen from those premises. It is worth about 25 s. per cwt. and would take much more to repair it.</p>

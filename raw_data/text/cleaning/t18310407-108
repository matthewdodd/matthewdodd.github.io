            . I live at Wisbeach, in Cambridgeshire. I came to town on Friday, the 18th of March, and about ten o'clock that evening I met Morris in Bishopsgate-street- I looked very earnestly at her; she came back to me, and after some conversation, took me to a house in <placeName id="t18310407-108-crimeloc604">Gun-alley</placeName>

Bank note, and a 5l. Wisbeach note - (none of them have been found;) Morris returned to the room, and laid on the bed a little while - I did not feel her pick my pocket; she called out some name, and Christian came into the room - Morris then jumped up, and ran away; I immediately felt, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070063"></xptr>missed my money and notes - I told 
               <persName id="t18310407-108-person954">Christian</persName>
             I was robbed, she said, "Not you;" I said "I am of 32l." I went out of the house, and saw another woman at an up stair window - she came down; I told her the same - she went up again, and then an old woman came halfway down the passage, and began had using "Murder! he says he is robbed;" a parcel of Jews and people then came up, and I ran away, but when I got to the top of the passage two of them knocked my hat off, and I ran out of the passage; I saw two respectable women standing at the corner, and asked them the name of the place - they said Sandyhill; I wrote that down, and went to the station in Spitalfields - I was directer there; I returned from there with Pillington - we found Christian that might at a chandler's-shop; she was taken into custody, and next day Waters and I went to the house I was robbed at, and found Morris up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say you were not drunk? A. No; I had breakfasted on the road from Birmingham, and had tea at my aunt's - I had no dinner; I drank nothing on the road - I got to London about two o'clock, and had part of two pints of porter at my cousin's in Houndsdrich; I had no gin before I met them - I went to no gin-shop with them; I drank only two glasses at the house - I know the money was safe when I went on the bed, and directly Morris was gone I missed it; my trousers were not off - they were down, the notes could not have fallen out of my fob - I did not unfold the notes in the room, but I had seen them at Birmingham the day before, and am certain I put the same bundle into my fob in her room - they had before been in a pocket-book in my side pocket; I never said I put them into my great coat - the Policeman took me to a room where there was a woman in bed - he said, "Is this her?" I said I could not tell till she got out of bed, and when she was up I said she was not; I was never in London but twice before - the woman who kept the house was at Worship-street, and asked a few questions; I was about half an hour with the prisoners - Morris had a bonnet on; I remarked her features particularly - I positively swear they are the two- I have not expressed a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he go to a house to look at another woman? A. Yes - he wished her to dress, and then said she was not the woman.</p>

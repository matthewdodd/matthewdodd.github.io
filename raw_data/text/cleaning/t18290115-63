            . This is my property - they ought to have been sold for about that price; it was the prisoner's duty to have entered them in this book, which he has not; I went in about an hour after Mr. Clarke had left, and asked him if any one had been there to buy any thing; he said there had not.</p>

I found I sold the collars too cheap, for a gentleman came into the shop, and asked the price of one, and I told him half-a-crown; he would not give that, he went to the other shop, and the boy came to me for some: I asked him what they sold them for: he said 4s.; I then found I sold them too cheap, and I meant to keep the money back till Saturday to make it right.</p>

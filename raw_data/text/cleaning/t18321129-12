            . I am twelve years old - I live in Three Cradle-street, nearly opposite Morrice's warehouse. I came out about seven o'clock, to get a penny worth of biscuits for my schoolmaster's little boy, and saw Draper at the gate of the warehouse, by the lock - I went back to school with the biscuits, and about eight o'clock I came out of the school, which is over the prosecutor's warehouse; I saw Draper standing at the corner of the court - he went away for about five minutes, and then he came back; I was standing at the corner of the court - he went back, and came over to the gate of the warehouse; I thought he was making water at first, but I heard the padlock struck up against the door several times: the door was secured by two padlocks and bars - I then went, and called Mr. Purser, who has the care of the warehouse, and lives two or three doors from it; I went on to the corner of the court, and heard the locks knock up against the door again, and then Draper went away; I saw him run from Mr. Purser.</p>

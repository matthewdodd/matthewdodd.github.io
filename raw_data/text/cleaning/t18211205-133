On the 25th of November, I was awoke, and found the chaise-house broken open, it was secure at dusk - a hole was cut through the gates large enough to admit a man; I missed a pair of chaise reins, thirteen live fowls, two dead ones, and six ducks; an iron chisel was left behind. On the Wednesday following, I found the reins at Marlborough-street.</p>

            . I am a patrol on the Harrow-road. On the 26th of November, about six o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner on that road by the five mile stone, and took him to the Green Man, public-house, and found a chisel and knife on him. He had left the fowls at the Green Man, public-house, the people are not here, the landlady's son said in his presence, that he left some fowls there in the course of that day - he brought out seven fowls tied in a pair of trowsers, and a pair of chaise reins; the prisoner did not deny leaving them then, but said they were his own, the fowls were dead and picked, and a bloody knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>MR. TILLOT. The reins are mine.</p>

In consequence of information, on 20th Dec, about 11 o'clock in the morning, I went with Webb to opposite 43, London-road, where the prisoner lives—a short time after we got there, the prisoner came out of his house with a blue bag with something in it—I was in plain clothes—I cannot tell whether he saw me or not—I crossed towards him, and he turned and went to the side-door of the Prince of Walet, which is within three or four doors of his own house—the front-door of the public-house is in the London-road, and the side-door in another street—I followed him—he passed the bar, and went up a passage to a little room at the end, down a step, which was dark—I was close to him, and met him coming out of the room again without the bag—I stopped him, and said, "Where is that bag which you had?"—he said, "I had no bag"—I said, "Yes, you had; it was a blue one"—I pushed him back into the room, and in doing so my foot struck against something, which was this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is similar to the one he was carrying, and was lying close to where he stood, just by the table; it was a very small room—I said, "This is the bag; what has it in it?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I told him I was an officer, and he matt consider himself in custody—I examined the bag, and found it contained 100 pairs of kid-gloves, seventy pairs of woollen, and eight odd gloves—I took him to the station, and afterwards searched his house—I afterwards received six gloves from Mrs. Wilson, which match six of the odd ones I found.</p>

I was with Trew, in plain clothes in the London-road, on 20th Dec, and saw the prisoner come out of No. 43 with a blue bag—I watched him—he turned down the first street on the, right, and went is at the side-door of a public-house at the corner of the street—the front door is in the main-street, and there are two doors in the side street—he want in at the furthest side-door—we went in—Trew followed him up the passage, I and I remained in front of the bar—in about two minutes, Trew came back with the prisoner and the bag—we, went up the London-road, met an officer of the L division, and we went to die prisoner's house—Trek searched it, and found a quantity of jewellery, rings, plat and watches—while he was searching, I had the prisoner in custody, and also the bag, and the prisoner said." Those I gloves in that bag can be accounted for; they were bought at Mr. Bay Ley's in I Wood-street, Cheapeide"—I asked him for the invoice—he said he hid no I invoice; they were bought as a job—lot about three weeks before.</p>

                  </hi> I am housekeeper to William Hare, Lord Listowel. I had the charge of his house, which is called Kingston House, Knightsbridge—his Lordship has been absent some time—on Monday, 4th of Oct., I went to bed about ten o'clock—before I went, I looked round the house, and fastened it all—on the following morning I was awoke by the gardener, went down stairs about half-past six, and went into the morning room where I found the window open—it opens on to the lawn—I am quite certain that window was closed the night before, and barred with two iron bars—I then went into the drawing-room, and found the window there open—it is a win<lb></lb>dow folding down to the ground—that was closed the night before, and had a bar across the shutter—it had not been opened for a fortnight—the shutter was inside—I missed from a room called the still-room, six silver tea-spoons, a silver pencil-case, and a purse with about six or seven shillings in it—they were all my property.</p>

                  </hi> I am gardener to Lord Listowel. On Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, 5th of Oct., I was going round the house an usual—I was on the lawn within the garden walls—I sleep on the grounds—I noticed the window of the morning room open—I went to unlock the door that opens from the lawn into the kitchen-garden, and saw footmarks on the border near the wall—I found a button there—there were the footmarks of three different persons—I called up the housekeeper—I was present when Bradshaw the policeman compared a shoe with the footmarks in the garden, on Wednesday morning, about half-past seven, they corresponded—I gave the button to Bradshaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the footmarks leading from the window, or towards it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a gravel walk, we could not tell which way they walked from the window as the footmarks did not leave any trace there—the marks were on the border in the kitchen-garden—they were about a quarter of an inch deep—the policeman fitted the shoe first, and I afterwards—I fitted the shoe into four or five marks, and found they exactly corresponded—we did not walk on the mould ourselves—we could reach the marks from the walk—we just put one foot on, to get over to the other side—there were three different footmarks—it had not been raining at all—the soil was quite moist with the dew, and it had been raining two or three days before—there was no rain during the night, or the day after, not between the time the foot<lb></lb>marks were made, and the time we compared them—there were a few pinks growing in the border—there were no flowers and vegetables growing where</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 5th of Oct., I went to Lord Listowel's house, which is in the parish of St. Mar<lb></lb>garet's, Westminster, between eight and nine o'clock—I went into the morning-room, and the open window was pointed out to me—I examined it inside and out, and the shutters likewise—in my judgment it had been opened from the inside, a person could then come on to the balcony, and then there are three steps down to the garden—I went to the drawing-room, and found the front window of that open—I examined it from the outside—the handle of the shutter might have been turned easily, and by just pushing it, it might be forced in—the bar of the shutter would not fasten, so that outside push would open it, and the window was opened by it's being left not catched—there was a handle to it with a catch—I then went to a wall dividing the kitchen-garden from the lawn, and found several footmarks there—I traced the footmarks of three different persons down the kitchen-garden—I received this button from the gardener—on the evening of that same day I was in Knightsbridge, and saw the prisoner there in company with, I dare say, a dozen others—I took him into custody—before so doing, I observed a button off of his coat, which coat I produce—I took him to the station, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and three halfpence on him—on the following morning I took his left shoe to Lord Listowel's, compared it with the footmarks there, and they exactly agreed—when I took the prisoner into custody, I told him I took him on suspicion of being concerned with others in committing a burglary at the Earl of Listowel's—he said he knew nothing about it—that was all he said—I found in the drawing-room a piece of greasy paper on one of the chairs, and two Lucifer matches on the carpet.</p>

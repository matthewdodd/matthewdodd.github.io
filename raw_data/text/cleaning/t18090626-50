            . Q. You are one of the partners in the house - A. I am. I went with two officers and searched the prisoner's house; with Tipper and Bray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner rent the whole house - A. So she informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you searched her house - A. The 13th of June, about two o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the husband at home at that time - A. I saw a man there at dinner, I asked her if that was her husband, she said no, her husband had gone in the country to work at the harvest, he was a labouring man; she told me this person I saw there was a lodger, in the man's hearing; the man said he was a lodger, he worked for a stationer. On the right hand side of her kitchen I found the plates that are stated in the indictment; I took down twenty six plates with the name of Hale and co. stamped on the back of them, we have them manufactured for us. In that room we found some butter boats, they are marked; under the bedstead, in this room, the kitchen, was an old drawer containing a number of knives and forks, they are marked as before; and up stairs we found in a box that was broken a parcel of our knives and forks; the decanters and glasses were found in the kitchen; I asked her how she came by these things; she told me she purchased them when she took the house and furniture; she said she could not exactly recollect the person's name; she had the house about twelve months, and that she had given twenty two pounds for them things.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the worth of the things that were marked with your name that you could swear to - A. Rather think the knives and forks cost two guineas a dozen, the plates about five shillings a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this woman been in the habit of coming backwards to your house - A. About five months; she has been in the habit of coming for the servants clothes.</p>

            . I live in Bowling-alley, White-cross-street; I am a married woman, my husband is a sailor; before this woman came into the house I was a lodger of the man and his wife that she took the house on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you lodged there - A. Six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that kept the house when you lived there - A. One Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. Not Holland - A. It was Collins; he was a labouring man; the prisoner was a sober, honest woman, and always bore a responsible good character. When she took this house she bought every thing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260043"></xptr>was in the house, and some of these things were in the house when she took it; the plates and glasses, I have seen a great many of them there, they were a kind of china plates. She paid twenty two pounds for the beds and all the things that were in the house. I lodged there six months when Collins kept it; I have left it about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. That makes a twelve month altogether - did you ever go with this woman to the London tavern - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Collins do any thing at the London tavern - A. His wife had washing from some tavern, I never enquired into what tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plates were there with Hale and co. on them - A. Not above half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there particular that should draw your attention to the name being on the plates - A. Why I was looking at them one day I came down there; I asked her what these plates were a piece; Mrs. Murphy said she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days was that before you went away - A. I went away that Friday night that Christmas was; this was on Thursday, the day before I left the house; it was that I remarked the plates, I had seen these blue ones when Collins lived in the house; it must be upwards of a twelvemonth ago when I saw them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Collins and you intimate - A. No; I had no dealings with him, no further than going through up into my own apartment; I never visited her, nor dined with her, nor drank tea with her.</p>
               <p>Q. It was rather taking a liberty, you taking these plates down - A. I did not take them down. I saw them on the mantle piece; they were facing of me just as I went in the door; the front of the plates were towards me.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you saw the name of Hale and co. upon the fronts - A. Yes, I did; the letters were large enough for any one to read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let me see one of the plates, were they coloured letters or plain - A. They were coloured letters.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tipper. Are there any such plates there - A. No; we found no plates with coloured letters in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Traile. When was you called upon to give evidence upon this occasion - A. Mrs. Murphy sent for me this morning. And what I saw in the house, I speak to no more. The plates were larger than them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these plates and tell me whether there are any with coloured letters - A. No.</p>

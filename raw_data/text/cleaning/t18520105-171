I was on duty in York-terrace Mews, at 1 o'clock in the morning of 2nd Jan.—I heard the breaking of glass at the back of the house, 6, Nottingham-terrace—I listened, and got on the top of the wall—I called my brother officer—I saw a light in the back premises of Mr. Griffiths's house—his premises are bounded by a wall, and on the other side there is a mews—I scaled the wall and entered the premises—there is a library built out from the house—I found the library door just ajar—I asked who was there—no one answered—we got a light, and went in, and found the prisoner crouched down in one corner—we asked what he did there—he said he lived there—we roused the inmates of the house, and took the prisoner into custody—that library communicates with the house by an iron door, which was fast—there were some marks of an attempt on that door on the library side—there was one square of glass broken in the door, by which I entered the library, that would enable a person to put his hand in and undo the fastenings—the fastenings were undone, and the room was in confusion.</p>

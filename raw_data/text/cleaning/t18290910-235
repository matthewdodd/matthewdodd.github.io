               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had you been walking with Mary Allen? A. It might be about two hours - we had one pot of beer to drink - I had been paying some bills, and might have taken a glass of porter before; I will not swear I had not taken any spirits - I was quite sober - the house has not a very respectable appearance; I had been asleep perhaps two hours and a half before Jones came - she did not come to the door, and ask for a light - when she came, I thought it was Allen -I had known Allen for two years; my watch was found in a pair of bellows, in another room - I missed it before the light was brought up; I was certain it was gone, for I had had it in my hand just before - there were no other persons but Allen and myself in the house - there is only one room in it - the watch was found at No. 6, another house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the light came, you saw the watch was gone from the mantel-piece? A. Yes, but I had missed it before - a little light came from the window - it was beginning to be day-light; I had light enough to see the prisoner's person before the candle came - I am certain she is the person who came up, before she brought the light, both by her appearance and her voice.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went with the witness to No. 2, Providence-place, where he said he had been robbed - I could get no admittance; but having seen a woman come out, and go to No. 6, I followed her -I got in at the window, and the constable found this watch in the bellows in the first-floor room; I found the prisoner in the same room, and took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go there? A. Twenty minutes after three o'clock - I suppose the prosesecutor had not been with me above five minutes before I went there - I had to get a light, which occasioned me to stop a few minutes - it is a bad place - some of the houses are open the greater part of the night; Mrs. Fulmer is the landlady of that house.</p>

            . I am a coachman, I drove Mr. Green to town; I received a paper trunk from him, at Blackheath, which I put into the boot of the coach; we never stopped till we came to the bottom of Fleetmarket. Mr. Gundy who keeps an oil shop there, and was in company with Mr. Green, got out, I took out a hamper of Mr. Gundy's, there was an-hamper behind the coach; I went to the back of the coach to untie the hamper, then as I stooped, I saw a man's legs by the fore-wheel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120007"></xptr> I thought it was somebody rummaging the boot; I ran directly there, and saw the prisoner with the trunk under his arm; I run after him, and he dropped the trunk; we secured him and carried him to the round-house in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>(The trunk produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did you not say, when you took me to the Round house, let the lad go, there is only a parcel of rags in it.</p>
               <p>Green. I said no such thing; there were some clouts in it; we had a child with us; I said, he would have had a good booty, for there were two watches in it.</p>

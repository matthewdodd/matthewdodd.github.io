On the 3d of January, when I opened my shop, I missed four packages of combs from my window - they were worth about 12s.; a pane of glass was broken, and a piece of glass taken out - I looked out and saw Jones; I ran and caught hold of him, and asked what he had done with the combs - he said he had not taken them, but that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120051"></xptr>Hearn had; I went to his house in Barley-court, where I found one comb, and at Hearn's house I found five more. Hearn said he had sold some at the house of Cochrane, in St. Giles's - I went there and found sixteen, which were all my property - they were worth 5s.; and Cochrane said she had given 8d. for them. I can swear to the paper they were in - they had been in my window the night before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have some combs which I found at Jones's, Hearn's, and Cochrane's, in St. Giles's - I asked Cochrane what she had done with the combs she bought of Hearn; she said they were in a box, which she opened, and I took them out; she said at first that she gave 5d. for them. and then 8d. Jones said he did not take them, but Hearn took them out of the window with a hook stick.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY DANBY. Q. When did you first see Hearn? A. The day after I missed the combs - I asked what he had done with them, and he said he had sold them to a woman in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>COCHRANE'S Defence. I bought them for 8d., and sold them again - when I heard they were stolen I went and got them back; he told me he had found them, or I would not have bought them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am a milliner—I keep the house No. 121, High-street, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. On Tuesday night, Jan. 10th, I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, my niece came up stairs and shut the staircase door—I told her we did not generally shut that door, but it did not signify—no one opened it again—I then went into my own room, shut the door, and went to bed—about two o'clock I heard a noise in the kitchen—I afterwards heard a noise against the door of my room, and afterwards beard a noise in my room—it seemed to me to be on the drawers very near to my bed-head—I sat up in bed to listen to the noise, and saw the figure of a boy or man by the side of my bed—as he was passing along I said, "Who is in ray room?"—I spoke twice, and then heard the person rush out of the room, and something sound as if it touched the edge of the door—I heard a creaking substance passing by very quickly—I afterwards heard a noise in the kitchen—I saw a light shine on my window-curtain during the time the person was in my room—it was not by that light I saw the figure—it was very moonlight, and there were lights in the street—I could see the figure very well—in the morning I found my chamber door standing wide open—I called one of my young people to me, and I then went down stairs—it was somewhere about eight o'clock—I cannot tell exactly—it was before eight—I went down into the work room, and found a cash box there broken open, that had been on my drawers when I went to bed—when I heard the noise in the night I dared not get up, I was so frightened—I had nobody near me except one person who was in rather a delicate state of health—I generally place both my cash boxes on my drawers before going to bed, but this night I put the other containing gold and silver under the bed, and that remained undisturbed—the cash box that was on the drawers was broken open, and about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper taken from it—I had seen it last when I went to bed, on my drawers—I had locked the coppers up my<lb></lb>self just before going to bed—I generally keep one cash box for silver and</p>

               <p>gold, and one for halfpence—I also found five tea-spoons and two table<lb></lb>spoons gone out of a cupboard, which was not locked—I had seen one of them just before I went to bed—I afterwards found missing from the shop some ribbon, buttons, and needles, some sugar nippers from the kitchen, and I have since missed several articles which are not in the indictment—I have every reason to believe that the person got through the kitchen window, as it was found unfastened in the morning—it was fastened overnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married—I was on a visit to Mrs. Gardiner, who is my aunt, I was up last, about a quarter of an hour after her—I saw every thing secure in the kitchen—the window was fastened with an inside shutter, and I believe with a bar—I did not put it up myself, but I saw that it was secure—I was the last to close the staircase door that leads to the kit<lb></lb>chen, from the staircase to my aunt's bedroom—the kitchen is on the first floor—there is a staircase below the door, and another staircase above it—I slept in the adjoining room to my aunt, over the kitchen—I saw my aunt close her door, and then I closed my own—I heard a great noise during the night, but not being accustomed to that neighbourhood 1 did not think it anything particular, as there are perpetual noises in Whitechapel all night—I live in the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's servant. I fastened the kitchen window with a bar—I got up about eight o'clock in the morning—I found the kitchen window shutters a little apart, the bar taken out, and lying on the dresser—there was a pane broken a long while before—there was no fastening at all, and the window could be pushed up—it was a sash window—it was down when I went to bed, and in the morning it was open—anybody could have got in through the window by opening it—they could pull the shutters apart afterwards—there is a bar inside, but they could easily push the shutters a little apart, and pull the bar down—the window is big enough for a person to get through—the person must have put the shutters to again—I heard nothing in the night.</p>

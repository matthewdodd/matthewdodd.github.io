               <p>Prisoner.

I could spare a little at a time better than a great quantity.</p>


               <p>Court to Herne. Are you sure they are your things? - I brought them from Marlborough-street office; there is no mark on them; I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Mr. Herne keeps seven or eight labouring men; I goes out from six o'clock to six o'clock, and they are in from morning to night, most of them Irishmen; I gave 18 d. for the head, 1 s. for the collar, and 2 s. for each of the other things.

I went to her the next morning to desire she'd tell me who she saw go out at my door; she said some of my lodgers. Upon my asking her whether she knew any thing of the matter, she told me her mistress bid her come into my kitchen and take the cloaths and give her them out; and after that she bid her go and take the pewter, and she went but could not reach it; then she went into the closet and found three razors, and told her mistress of them, and she bid her take the best of them; that she took one and went to the necessary-house and there fell asleep and left it there. We found one there the next morning; and that her mistress bid her go from thence to a neighbour's cellar and stay there 'till morning, and in the morning go to the Seven Dials, and there she would send her some victuals; and that the next morning her mistress sent her a rowl; the next day she altered her story and said it was one

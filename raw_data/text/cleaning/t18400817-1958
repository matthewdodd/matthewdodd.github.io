                  </hi>. I live with my brother-in-law, Mr. Stowe, a to<lb></lb>bacconist in Barbican.

               <p>him, and then he threw 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter—I would not give him the shil<lb></lb>ling—and when he saw my brother come out, and call out, "Stop him, do not let him go," he threw his pipe down and ran away—my brother went after him and brought him back in about two minutes—a constable was sent for—he was detained in the shop, and said to me, "If you give me that, I will give you another; you say you have a bad shilling, let me see it"—I said, "No, you shall not see it, the policeman shall see it;" I gave it to the policeman, and after he was secured I went to the jar, found the sixpence, and gave that to the policeman.</p>

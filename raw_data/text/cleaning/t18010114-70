               <p> - AMOS sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Saunders: On Thursday evening, the 15th of January, I saw the prisoner take a cask off the lead in my master's shop; it contains three hundred cod founds; I pursued him, and in about five minutes I came up with him; he was stopped in a court in Miles's-lane; I picked up the barrel in the court; it might be 160 yards from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. Yes, I first lost sight of him in the turning going up Miles's-lane, he had a comrade with him; as soon as I came out of the shop, I saw two soldiers; the cask was carried home, and I put a mark upon it; I am sure it is the cask that was stolen. (The cask was produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the face of the prisoner? - A. No, he was too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Q. If there were two soldiers, how can you swear to this man? - A. I cannot swear to the man; here is a witness that never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see two soldiers? - A. Yes; they both ran together till they came to the first coach-turning in Miles's-lane; I holloaed out, stop thief, all the way that I went; the prisoner at the bar turned into a court, he had the cask then; I laid hold of his coat behind, and he dropped the cask; then he turned round, and struck at me; he slipped out of my hand, and got away, and the other soldier swore he would knock my head against the wall; I called out to the foreman of the shop, and told him to take care of the cask, for it was there, and he was taken immediately, and delivered to the officer: when he got away from me, before he could get up, another man came up and boned him again; then the officer came up and took him.</p>

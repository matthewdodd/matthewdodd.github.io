No; I caught him and took him to my house, I talked with him a quarter of any hour; I said; if he would tell his accomplice, I would discharge him; he first said he would, and then he would not, then I took him to the office, I have the tippets here.

               <p>Q. Are these the tippets you saw hanging from his apron? - A. Yes, there are half a dozen of them; I am sure they are my property, they have my mark upon them.</p>

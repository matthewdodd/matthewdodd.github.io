On the 29th of July, I saw a person get out of Mr. Webb's parlour window; he ran off - he appeared to have a black coat and a handkerchief under his arm - I told Mr. Webb; I saw the prisoners at Hatton-garden the same day - Barker had a similar dress on to the person I saw; but I could not see his face.</p>

On the 19th of December the prisoner came to my shop with two more persons, about half-past eight o'clock at night - they inquired for some bonnets; one of them selected a bonnet, which came to 1s. - the other two stood before the prisoner; I do not think they were in the shop a quarter of an hour before I missed some stays - I said to the prisoner"You have taken my stays;" she said" I have not;" they did not go out, for I would not let them - I sent for an officer, but could not find one; I kept the prisoner in the shop, and put my hand up her clothes, where I found these eight pairs of stays, which are mine.</p>

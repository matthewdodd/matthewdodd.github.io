You have been sufficiently fortunate in this instance, that of the breaking out of the house, there is not sufficient evidence to affect your life, and to prove that part of the charge that is capital; for if there had, it is very probable that your Sovereign, however gracious his inclinations are, would not have thought you a very proper subject of mercy; for the fact of a servant getting up in the night, and robbing his master's house is so extremely dangerous to every family, and to the peace and good order of society; that no punishment that the law can inflict can be too severe in this: it is my duty, and the duty of the Court to prevent you from the possibility of doing future mischief, and to sentence you</p>

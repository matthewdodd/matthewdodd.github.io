Mr. Deseaves being near me, asked me if I had lost any thing ; I put my hand into my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone: then the gentleman ran and catched the prisoner, and I after him, and found my handkerchief in the prisoner's hand. [The handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to.] I had it in my pocket when I set out from St. Mary Axe, which was about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deseaves. I was along with the prosecutor at that time under Ludgate, where there was a great crowd, and the prisoner rushed by. At the same time I saw something go out of the prosecutor's pocket; it appeared like a handkerchief, but I could not be certain it was; then I told him of it. The prisoner ran away, and I after him, down the Old Bailey, where I took him, who had, at the same time, the handkerchief in his hand; and the prosecutor came up in about two or three minutes time, and took it.</p>

               <p>Coming through Ludgate, I picked the handkerchief up, and put it into my pocket; then I went down the Old Bailey, where the gentleman came, clapped me on the shoulder, and said, You have got my handkerchief; I replied, I found it, and if it is yours, you are welcome to it.</p>

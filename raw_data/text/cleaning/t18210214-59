            . I am a broker, living in Wheeler-street, Spitalfields, about a mile from the prisoners. On the 6th of January, the prisoners came to my shop, and offered to sell some blue and white plates. Richard said his father gave them to him, and that they had been in the family some time; I gave him 2 s. 6 d. - there were about eleven of them. He said, he had three or four articles in the furniture line, if I would walk home and look at them - he asked me 2 l. for them. He assured me his father gave them to him, as he was about to be married; but he was obliged to sell them to go into the country to his uncle. I offered one guinea and-a-half for them; he refused - I returned, and offered 2 s. more, which he refused. He took me to a house, which he called his own, near Shoreditch Church - both went, but Richard was the man I dealt with. About two hours after, he came and asked me to buy some books; he had them in his hand - I declined. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can't we agree for the other things?" I refused to give more, but gave them 1 s. to bring them, which they did that night. I paid them 1 l. 12 s. 6 d. for a chest of drawers, four chairs, and one wash-hand-stand table - it was twilight when they brought them. I sold all the things. I sent Mr. Swan to where I sold the drawers. I do not know who bought the other things.</p>
               <p>MR. SWAN re-examined. I can swear to the drawers; I have had them four years, and gave 50 s. for them - the plates were blue and white.</p>

He has turned me off on account of this—on the 31st of October, about two o'clock, I was directed to take a parcel to Pearce, Stone, and Halling's, Charing-cross—when I got opposite Burleigh-street in the Strand, the prisoner came across and asked me if I was not Mr. Backwith's boy—I said yes—he asked me if I was not going to Halling, Pearce, and Stone's—I said yes—he said, "I come from them, we are waiting, as they want it at their other house in Tottenham-court-road, No. 153, and not at Charing-cross"—I did not know whether they had got a house there—he told me to go along with him, and asked me to have something to drink—I said no—he gave me a sixpence, and told me to go and get half a pint of porter—I went into a house and got it—when I came out I found the prisoner outside—he said I was to come with him, and I did—when we got nearly to the top of Drury-lane, he said, "Now give me the parcel, I will take it on to Tottenham-court-road"—he took hold of the end of it—I thought all was right, and let it go—he desired me to make haste home—I believed he was an honest man, from, from his knowing where I was going, and asking if I was Mr. Backwith's boy—I saw him again on the 1st of December, in Quaker-street, Spitalfields—I followed him to Norton Falgate—I saw a policeman, and gave him into custody—I am quite sure he is the man—I was with him about a quarter of an hour—I never saw him before—I recollect him by his countenance.</p>

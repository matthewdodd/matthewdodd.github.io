            . In October last, I lodged in the same house, as the prisoner. I work for a tailor and lodge up two pair of stairs in Windmill-court, Rosemary-lane, she had lodged on the one pair with her husband, the house is let out in lodgings; I remember on Thursday night the 18th of October, she was in my room that evening, from dusk till very near nine o'clock; it was the day Jacobs was taken up, she went out from my place about nine o'clock, and I saw no more of her that evening; she had neither bonnet, shawl, or silk handkerchief on.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You live on the second floor, might she not go into her own room - A. She borrowed a candle of me, went into her own room, returned the candle to me on the stairs, and went out without shawl, bonnet, or handkerchief on; she had no bason or any thing in her hand, she was very much in liquor indeed, I was quite sober; she came home about eleven o'clock, and called up the stairs to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is me," I made no answer; she called again, and I said,</p>
               <p>"Very well," she had left her door unfastened, I had not asked who was there; I did not see her again that night, she continued to live in the house till the 26th of October; I have not seen her since, till now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I came into your room; told you I was going on an errand, and asked you to take charge of my room - A.

            . I am a tailor, and live in the front garret, at No. 83, Rosemary-lane. On the 18th of October, from nine o'clock at night, till very near eleven o'clock, I was at the Seven Stars, public-house, Rosemary-lane; I knew Jacobs, by seeing him come there to drink his beer, he was a Prussian. I have since seen him in Newgate; he came to the Seven Stars a little before nine o'clock that night, and was very drunk indeed when he came in - he had a pint of beer and sat down by himself, in the same box as me, and while we sat there the prisoner came in; I am certain of her person; she was very much intoxicated; she took up his pint of porter and drank out of it; he rebuked her; he said,</p>
               <p>"You have no right to drink that, without my privilege" - she called him a son of a w***e; he spoke to her again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he use abusive language - A. No, he was grumbling; I said</p>
               <p>"Mr. Jacobs, it is very rude for any one to come and drink your beer, - I should not like it myself;" the prisoner turned round and staggered towards the door, and when she recovered herself, she sat down by the side of Jacobs, and remained there till eleven o'clock - they did not talk together.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened near eleven o'clock - A. Jacobs got up, and said, I will go home - he was so much in liquor then, that he staggered up against the door, and was near falling; the prisoner was very tipsy, she said she would go, and in following him to the door, she fell down; I said I would go, and went over and picked her up; Jacobs went out - she followed him, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time during this period had the prisoner a bonnet or hat on her head, shawl or handkerchief on her neck, or bason in her hand - A. She had not, I am quite positive of it; Jacobs went on staggering, and she went after him, they went on as far as the Alderman Parson's head, public-house, which is about two hundred yards off in Rosemary-lane; it is the next public-house; she then put her hand round him, laid hold of his hair, and fell down, he tried to disengage himself from her, and owing to her drunkenness, she fell; a parcel of people came by, somebody helped her up; Jacobs went on, and I crossed the way, and left them - it was in my way home - I live at the further end of the lane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know this was the night Jacobs was taken up - A. Because I went up stairs and was eating my supper, and heard the call of Watch! I came down and asked a man who was passing, what was the matter - he said, it was a drunken man, named Jacobs, going to the watch-house; I did not go to see him; I had my work to go to in the morning - I did not see Jacobs again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not the curiosity to go to the watch-house next day - A. No, I went to work at six o'clock; I did not see him till after he was convicted; I did not know it would get to such serious consequences; I did not know where he lived; I worked for Messrs. Gilson and Smith, of Poplar, at the time; I had just come from work, and only drank a pint of beer; Mr. Husband keeps the public-house - I am sure she is the woman, I have known her, by sight, four or five years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not been in this country eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Witness. To the best of my knowledge, I have known her four or five years - I am sure it is above eighteen months.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he use any violence to her, previous to her falling - A. No, except to disengage himself from her.</p>

            . I live in White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, in the two pair front room, and work in a glasshouse, for Mr. Glover. On the night Jacobs was taken, I was at the end of White's-yard, about eleven o'clock, I never saw the prisoner before that, she asked me if there was any public-house open where she could get refreshment; Jacobs was by her; I did not know him; I saw him next day at Lambeth-street office, under examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Jacobs was with her - A. Yes, he and the prisoner were standing together at the top of Whites'-yard; they were both very much intoxicated; the prisoner had a blue gown on, and her bosom was all exposed; she had neither shawl, bonnet, or handkerchief on, or bason in her hand. I told her the White Lion, in White Lion-street, was open. Whites'-yard is about twenty-yards from Alderman Parson's head, and more than that from the Seven Stars; she and Jacobs went round White Lion-street, and while they were walking along she called for assistance of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what happened to make her cry - A. No, they had got a little way from me; I went up, and she then gave charge of Jacobs for robbing her of her shawl, bonnet, and one shilling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You heard the charge? A. Yes, Jacobs attempted to strike her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of her - A. No, for the watchman knocked him down, then sprang his rattle, and brought more assistance; Jacobs made no resistance; I followed him to Whitechapel watch-house; he was taken from there to Wellclose-square, as they were repairing the watch-house; I was returning home, and two watchmen took me in custody, as the prisoner swore I took the property from Jacobs; the watchman told me she said so, and she swore it at Lambeth-street, next day. When she was giving charge of Jacobs, she said she was a married woman; I said, if she was, she would not be out at that time of night, and an hour after that she gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not taken in charge as you were returning home - A. Yes, the watchman charged me with receiving the property; I was not taken for an hour after, and was at the watch-house - I had been waiting near Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Q. If a gentleman meets you, you go home with him. A. I am out at night - I never saw Jacobs before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you discharged at Lambeth-street A. Yes, I was taken before the Justice - and discharged; I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial; I did not think it would come to such a pitch as it did; Jacobs did not know where I lived - I was not sent for - I knew nothing about Jacobs' trial.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell any one what you knew of this business - A. About two days after, several people came to Lambeth-street, and I told them; I was applied to to become a witness on this trial about a month or six weeks after.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a silversmith, and lives in Cornhill. On the night of the 18th of October, I was passing the end of Rosemary-lane, it was after eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner - I do not recognise her features - but from her stature and appearance I believe it to be her; I saw Jacobs and a woman (whom I believe to be her) in contact together; he had hold of her arm, and did not seem inclined to loose it - some words passed between them both, and in about two minutes a watchman crossed over and laid hold of Jacobs, and endeavoured to loosen the woman from Jacobs' hold; he released her for a moment, but she came round towards the watchman and he caught hold of her again; the watchman endeavoured to loosen her again, but finding he could not do it easily he struck the man three or four times over the arm; and in consequence of their struggling several watchmen came to their assistance; I do not recollect the rattles springing; they then endeavoured to get him to the watch-house, which they had great difficulty, and trouble to do - he laid hold of the shutters, and did what he could to prevent them; then one of the watchmen came behind and struck him a violent blow over the head, and knocked him down; both him and the woman were drunk, beyond a doubt - there was never more than a dozen persons collected.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them use any threat to the woman what they would do, or threaten any violence - A. None whatever, I am positive of it - Jacobs was taken to the watch-house - I left them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear whether the man was charged with any offence - A. As far as I saw, the woman was running about the street saying,</p>
               <p>"I will give charge of him," but I did not hear what she charged him with; she had neither bonnet or shawl on - she was brandishing her hands about.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to hear of this matter - A. At the time it occurred, I did not hear the man's name, nor did I hear the trial, but I read the trial in the Sessions Paper; and hearing the man was ordered for execution, I supposed it to be the same party as I had seen; I made enquiry; went to Newgate to see the man, and knew him to be the man; he referred me to his master; when I went to see him I told him what his dress was at the time - it was a slouched hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false that I was ever in the middle of the street - or said I would give charge of him.</p>
               <p>Witness. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say is, that when I was here before I told the truth; when I was at the office all the blunder I made was, the watchman said it did not matter whether I said where I was going, and at the office I said I was going for a pail of water; but before you, my Lord, I told the truth.</p>

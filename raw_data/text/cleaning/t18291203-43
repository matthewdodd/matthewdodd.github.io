               <p>WILLIAM RICH. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in King-street, Seven-dials, about eight o'clock in the evening, on the 24th of November - I saw the prisoner coming through the street; I suspected, and followed him to Drury-lane - I there stopped him, and found on him twenty-three pairs of patent brass hinges; he said he was going to Field-lane, but he would not tell me where he got them from - I took him to the watch-house, and the next morning found the owner; the prisoner had three pairs in his hat, some in his right-hand pockets, and some in his left-hand pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to say he did not tell you where he got them as soon as you asked him? A.No; he said at the watch-house that he found them in a court in Crown-street; he told me he was going to Field-lane, and in going along the street he said if I liked to go with him, I should see where he was going to; he said at the watch-house he would go back to the place, but he did not tell me where it was - our inspector and two or three more were there at the time; there was a man with me when I took him - the prisoner said he got them in a court, and when I locked him up I went there, but there was no such thing, nor had any person seen any; he was coming from Crown-court, towards Field-lane, when I took him - I believe there is a shop in Field-lane where they buy such things.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WICKS. I am shopman to Mr. Johnston. I missed a number of hinges from a tier of shelves near the door, and some from other shelves - on the evening of the 24th, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I had double locked the shop door; on the morning of the 25th I found the key would not open the door, and then I missed the property.</p>

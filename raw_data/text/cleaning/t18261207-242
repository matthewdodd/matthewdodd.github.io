            . I live at the corner of Three-fox-court, in Long-lane. I was in my shop, and saw three men hustling a man at the corner of my door - I and my brother rushed out; my brother and the prosecutor followed the prisoner in the direction they ran - I had seen three of them run down there; I observed one of them, and firmly believe him to be the prisoner; I went down Long-lane to the pig-market, to meet them at the other end of the court, but before I got there I met the prisoner, who was the first person running; in fact, I saw no other person running - I cannot say whether he came out of the court, as I was then about twenty yards from it. I seized him, and said, "You are the person who robbed the man of his watch" - he said, "You are mistaken, I have done nothing;" my belief is that he is the man.</p>

I was coming up Long-lane, at a few minutes after six o'clock, and saw Gardiner and the prisoner scuffling in the road; they got on to the pavement; the prisoner tried to get away, but could not - I saw him take something from his coat-pocket, and throw it into the passage of a house there - I called to the landlord, and said, whatever the man had got, he had thrown into the passage; he called for a light, and this watch and case were picked up in his passage, in two different places.</p>

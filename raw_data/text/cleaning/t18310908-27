            . I sweep a crossing by the East India House. On the 5th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with a child about two years old; it was crying - it struck me, from its appearance, that it did not belong to her; I said,"My good woman, where are you going with that child?"- she said, "What is that to you? mind your own business;" I said I considered it my business, as I was confident it did not belong to her - she said it did; the child could not talk to be understood - I said I was fully confident, from its respectable appearance, that it did not; I took it up in my arms - she said if I offered to take her child away she would be d-d if she would not split my nose; I then applied to Drinkwater, and gave her in charge - she was taken to the watch-house with the child- I afterwards saw the father returning home with it, and told him what had happened; the child was bathed in tears when I saw it.</p>

            . I am one of the City Police. Brown came to me at the corner of Bishopsgate-street, and I went and found the prisoner sitting on the step of a door, with the child sitting by her side; I asked whose child it was - she said it was her own; I told her to get up, and said I should not let her go, as I was not satisfied about it - she then said it was not her's, but a neighbour's; I asked her the name of the parents, at the watch-house -she said the child's name was Billy Atkinson, that the father was in trouble, and the mother had been put to bed eight or nine hours ago - that the parents lived in a court opposite Bishop's gin-shop, Rosemary-lane; I thought from its appearance that it did not belong to her.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SINDRY. I am beadle of the parish. I heard the prisoner give the account of the child as Drinkwater has stated; I went to a court opposite a gin-shop, in Rosemary-lane, but could find nobody named Atkinson - the prisoner did not say where she herself lived; I made inquiry, and found out the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to the Virginia coffee-house, and saw the child at the top of the Minories, crying; I took hold of her by the hand, and was taking it, not with intent to steal it, for I could not keep myself; I meant to take it with me as far as the coffee-house, and come back again, but was detected by Drinkwater, who took me to the watch-house, and, being a little intoxicated, I gave him a little abusive language.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN. When I saw her she appeared rather in liquor, but not insensible, far from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Miller's-lane, Vauxhall—the prisoner came to lodge with me on the 15th of July, and remained till the 25th, when she went away between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning—she did not give me the slightest information that she was going, and I had not received a farthing of rent from her—I did not see her go out—on that day I missed a black satin shawl, a parasol, a pair of new black silk gloves, and a handkerchief—I had seen them safe about half-past seven o'clock the same morning, and, to the best of my belief, they were on the dining-table in the front parlour—the prisoner hired a bed-room of me, but she had the use of the front parlour occasionally—I am sure I did not give her authority to meddle with these things in any way—I have not seen any of them since, but they were seen the day after she left.</p>

On Friday morning, the 25th of July, I saw the prisoner at Mrs. Medwin's house—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing morning I saw her again in Leicester-street, Leicester-square—I observed she had a parasol and a satin shawl belonging to Mrs. Medwin—I believe she had the gloves and the pocket handkerchief, but I could not</p>

               <p>swear to them; I could to the shawl and parasol—she said, "Halloo, Wat<lb></lb>kins, I am glad to see you," and she told me, if I would go to Mr. Jones's, she would satisfy me that she had stopped there all night—I went there—she introduced me to the clerk—there were two or three entrances to the premises, which I was not aware of—she told me to wait—I waited two or three minutes; I then turned round, and she was gone—I inquired, but I could not find anything of her—I knew the parasol, because I gave it to Mrs. Medwin myself, and I had burnt a hole in it with a cigar—I saw that hole in it; and the prisoner made the remark to me, "I hope Mrs. Medwin is not angry at my taking her things."</p>

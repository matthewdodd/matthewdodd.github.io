               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where do you live? A. Opposite the Red Lion - the prisoner lives at the top of the lane - my back door is frequently open, as I have three or four lodgers - some of them were at home when I came back from church - the cock was fastened to a pipe in the cellar - in June last the old pipe was taken, and I was forced to go to the plumber's for fifteen feet of this new pipe, and had this cock put to it - I saw it safe a little before eleven o'clock - I had the same lodgers living with me when I lost the old pipe - the prisoner has often been to my house - he brought my coals - I gave information on the Monday to several persons, that if this cock was offered for sale, they should stop it - I know the prisoner was in the habit of buying small articles of this sort.</p>

            . I am a plumber's labourer. I know this cock by the bent appearance of it and the tinning - I tinned it, and was employed in fixing it on the 30th of June, and this pipe corresponds with what is left.</p>

             (City-policeman No. 36). I found this pipe in a corner of the prisoner's house covered with a basket - there was a quantity of lead and another cock there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was it? A. In the corner of the parlour within the shop - I went to search the house - the prisoner's wife told me there were lodgers in the house - I did not examine the rooms - I only searched the parlour and the shop - this was on the 7th of August - it was a coal-shed - I believe the prisoner deals in marine stores - he was not there when I first went, but I went again and found him - I believe his name is over the door.</p>

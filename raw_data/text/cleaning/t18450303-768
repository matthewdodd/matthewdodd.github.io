                  </hi>. I am shopman to Frederick Folkard, a pawnbroker, at No. 160, Blackfriars-road. On the 13th of Feb., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop, and heard something move ill the window—I cast my eye towards it, and saw two fingers inside the window, lifting up a card of mourning rings—the window was not open, and the wires were up outside, to protect it—a piece of glass had been starred out—eight mourning rings were on the card, worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lifted up the flap of the counter, ran round, and as soon as I opened the door I saw the prisoner drawing them through the wires—I went to lay hold of him, but fell down—I got up and pursued—we have two reflectors inside the window, which show a light outside, and I saw his face distinctly—I was close to him before I fell—there was another one with him—I pursued him across the road—he ran down Wellington-street, and turned up Angel-place—I shouted out, "Stop thief!" all the way along as I went—I saw no one down the street—I did not see the prisoner go down Angel-place, the street is not straight, one house pro<lb></lb>jects out a little, next door but one from this court, and the moment I turned into the court the prisoner came back put of the court—it was no thoroughfare—I was, I dare say, three or four yards behind him when he ran up this place—I caught hold of him, and his hand was bleeding inside in the middle—I said, "Where is the card of rings you have taken out of the window?"—he said, "I have not got a card of lings; what card of rings?"—he kicked me, and tried to get away—he threw off his hat and scarf up Angel-place, among the snow—when I caught him he had no hat with him—I brought him back to the shop, and gave him into custody—the card was produced—it then had four rings on it, and one was picked up on the ground, and was produced by Mr. Coleman, a gentleman who was passing by at the time—this is the card and the rings—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—they belong to my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock-manufacturer, and reside in Hemming's-row, Charing-cross. I was passing along Blackfriars-road on the evening of the 13th of Feb., between six and seven o'clock, and all at once heard aery of "Stop thief!"—I immediately stopped, looked round, and saw two per<lb></lb>sons running across the road—they both passed me—I stopped nearly op<lb></lb>posite a street—the first one that was running threw something from his right hand directly he passed me, and within about six or eight yards of me—thinking it was only a piece of paper, I let it lie for nearly a minute—a little boy who was passing said, "He threw something down"—I turned it over, and saw it contained rings—a lad named Hackett was taking it from him, and I took it from Hackett—it was a card containing four gold rings—this looks like it, but I could not swear to it—I took it over to the pawnbroker's, and laid it on the counter—it lay there till the police<lb></lb>man came in—I did not see anybody take it from the counter—there were four rings on it when I took it from Hackett—I felt in the snow, and found another one—I am quite sure that what I took from Hackett was what the man threw away—I saw the man's face when he threw it away—there was light enough for me to see his face—there was a lamp close by—he passed close under the lamp—it was the prisoner—I did not see what became of him after he threw it away—they both ran on—no one was fol<lb></lb>lowing them at that time—it was on the opposite side of the way to Jr. Folkard's that he threw the rings away, about fifty or sixty yards off it was not near Wellington-street—I think it was nearer the bridge, but I cannot say—I did not know the prisoner before—I saw the policeman take the rings off the counter—I am sure he took what I got from Hackett</p>

            . I am a constable at the London-docks. On the 29th of March I was on duty at the London-dock western gate, and about ten o'clock I received information that Goodchild was coming up with his cart loaded with wool; he came up, and presented me a pass for eight bales of wool, from No. 3 warehouse - I said, "Stop your horses," and he did; I said, "Did you load this cart?" he said Yes - I said, "Did you tie the bales on?" he said Yes; I said, "Have you any thing in the cart more than you ought to have?" he said No, not that he knew of - I then got on the top of the bales of wool, and found this bag of wool thrust down between the two top bales, and covered over with a tilt; I should not have seen it unless<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070071"></xptr>I had searched for it - one of the top bales had been cut, and a quantity of wool had been taken out; I took a sample of the wool in the bag and in the bale, and it corresponds exactly - I said to Goodchild, "You see this bag - what have you to say?" he said he was innocent of it, and it must have been put in while he went to get his pass.</p>

            . Q. Did you go off to give information, leaving these two men in the cart? A. Yes; of course I lost sight of them - the other man might have gone off with the little bag.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBINSON. I am clerk to Messrs. Meyer and Joseph Taueman - they live in Bishopsgate-street, and are general merchants. We employed the two prisoners to get the load from the London-docks - they are in the employ of Vestry and Cobley; I saw the bales, and there was a deficiancy of 13 lbs, in one of them, but there had been a sample taken out, and there was some loose wool in the cart, which might probably have been dropped in plundering; I saw the prisoners at the docks that morning, waiting with the cart - I went to the docks again about eleven o'clock, and then the information was given me; the bale had been cut and tora across, right in the middle - I have had a good deal to do with wool, and I have no doubt that these are both the same wool.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What kind of wool is it? A. German wool; it is not all of this quality - I would not venture to swear to it twenty or thirty miles off.</p>
               <p>Sermon's Defence. I had been speaking to Goodchild, and that is all.</p>
               <p>Goodchild's Defence. I loaded the eight bales, and left my cart to get my pass; when I was driving away the officer came and asked what I had in my cart - I said eight bales of wool; he said, "Any thing else?" I said, "Not to my knowledge;" he said, "I must look:" I said, "You are welcome" - he found this bag, and said, "How did this come in?" I said, "I don't know - it must have been put in by some one while I was getting my pass."</p>

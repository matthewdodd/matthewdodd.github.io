               <p>I am the mother of the last witness; I slept in the house this night and I came down between five and six in the morning, and when I came down I went to open the kitchen door and it was locked, and I went across the road to Mr. Harris for the key; I knew that he layed there that night, and that he had gone across the road, I stopped there, it may be twenty minutes or half an hour, and when I came back again with the key in my hand, Mr. Harris was with me, I saw this girl coming out of this house very fast with a bundle, and I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300004"></xptr>hold of her arm and asked her where she had been? When I went out in the morning I left the kitchen door locked and the street door on the latch; I went out at the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street door left open by Mr. Harris? - I cannot tell what he did, but I found the kitchen door locked and the street door on the latch, I came back with Mr. Harris with the key of the kitchen door in my hand; then I saw this girl running out of the street door of the house, she said, will you buy a bit of edging? I said let me look at it, and I saw this here apron hanging out of her lap on one side, and I said what have got here? she made no answer to that, I said you have got some of our property here, directly I took hold of her and we found the lock was taken off the kitchen door and the door was wide open; the lock was not quite off but loose.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you went over the way for the key, as you was in the house, could you not get into the kitchen without going over to Mr. Harris? - No, I could not; how could I get in without the key?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the kitchen door before you went out that morning? - Yes, I went to get into the kitchen in the first place.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this kitchen door look into the passage, or is it an inside door? - It is a door inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other door to the passage? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door to the passage locked or unlocked? - I cannot say, the door that was broke open was an inner kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to this kitchen door before you went out was it light or not? - It was light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that door was locked? - I know it was fast, but when I returned it was quite open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these articles taken from the girl? - I do; I am sure the shoes laid on the window the night before; the apron is my son's wife's, but I had washed it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them all to belong to the prosecutor? - I am positively sure of it, the apron has aquasortis on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave the street open? - No, I pulled it to; I went out at five o'clock, and Mrs. Joel came over to me for the key, and I returned with Mrs. Joel before six o'clock.</p>

             I found the prisoner coming out of the street door with some edging in her hand; I took all the articles from her at the door and sent for an officer and gave charge of her, and have kept the articles ever since they were before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lock when you came back? - It was forced open, and from the force of the lock the window was broke; there is half a glass window to the kitchen door.</p>

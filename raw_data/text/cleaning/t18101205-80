            . I am an officer. On the 5th of November, I was in Chick Lane. About a quarter before seven, I saw the prisoner and another lad together. I crossed over and met the prisoner, I said</p>
               <p>"Bill, what have you got here," he said</p>
               <p>"it is not mine, I have found it," I said,</p>

            . I am nine years old, my father is a carpenter, he keeps a chandler's shop in Saffron Hill. The prisoner came in for a two-penny loaf, he made a bother about it, he pointed out which he would have, I gave him that which he pointed to. When I went in doors, my mother came out, she asked me where the cheese was gone, there was nobody in the shop but the prisoner. I did not see him take the cheese. The cheese was there when he came in, and when he was gone, the cheese was gone. I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it is my cheese.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from my own house about half after six o'clock at night, I was going to my uncle's. I was going out of Harps Alley I saw the cheese against the side of a court, I picked it up, and went to Black Boy Alley. Mr. Hutt stopped me, he asked me what I had got, I told him it was mine, I picked it up.</p>

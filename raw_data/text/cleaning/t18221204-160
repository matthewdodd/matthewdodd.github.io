While he was getting out of the carriage I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I seized him by the collar. He drew his hand out of my pocket, and I heard the money fall to the ground. There was a crown, and two shillings, I endeavoured to pick it up, but other people did that. I only got two-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was any body near you except me - A. Not on that side. I was wedged up till the carriage moved on, and at that instant he put his hand into my pocket. He said if I would let him go, he would go quietly - I let him go; he up with his fist, and knocked me backwards; but I got hold of him, and the gang pushed me about, but I kept my hold.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer. I was coming from Brentford, and saw the prisoner hanging with his right arm to the coach, and his left hand up against the woman's clothes - he seemed to move it; he saw me, I believe, and put something to his mouth - I ran after him, and saw him turn; he sat down on the irons, and then put his right hand to the prosecutrix's clothes - I ran, and when the coach stopped, I saw her clothes were cut; the prisoner was in sight, and she said, "That young man was behind;" I ran with another man, and we took him near the bridge - he had a large clasp-knife, and this half-crown was in his hand; a little boy told me he had it in his right-hand, and it was so - he had denied having any thing on him but 2s., which he had; the constable found the knife on him - he is not here; he took the knife from him at the office at Bow-street - I should think it was not sharp enough to cut the clothes.</p>

             re-examined. Q.What was cut? A. My gown, petticoat, and pocket; he showed the knife, and said, "That is the only knife I had."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you had your half-crown in your pocket? A. Yes, about half an hour before I saw the prisoner; it was loose in my pocket, and had been given me three hours before by my mother - I did not see any other person behind the coach; my sister sat on one side of me, and a young man on the other - my sister's clothes were cut in three places: the young man who was sitting was on my left-hand side, and my clothes were cut on my right side, and my sister's on the left.</p>


               <p>MR. BARRY to WILLIAM TAYLOR. Q. Have you not seen boys and men hanging behind a coach? A. Yes, but the prisoner's arms were through the irons at the top - he was hanging with his arm to the iron, and his left hand was up to her clothes; it was not pressing against her - I thought he was going to cut her clothes, from the position he was in, and from his hand moving; as soon as the cry of Stop thief! was raised he ran away - I suppose ten minutes had elapsed from the time I first saw him till the coach stopped; she did not get down - the coach stopped to change horses.</p>

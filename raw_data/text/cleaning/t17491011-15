            . On the 18th of September I was going about my business crying old cloaths, I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling for these two handkerchiefs: I ask'd her what was the matter; she said she had been robb'd the night before. When the handkerchiefs were taken from him I ask'd if he had any other things; in searching him I found a pair of spectacles, a knife, a wooden spoon, and a tin pot; he said he brought the handkerchiefs at the sign of the Greyhound, but did not mention the street; so I and two other man brought him to the Round house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humes. Coming near my own house, seeing a struggle between the woman and the prisoner I heard the woman mention every thing before they were found upon the prisoner; and after, I saw the tin pot, spectacles, and wooden spoon taken from him.</p>

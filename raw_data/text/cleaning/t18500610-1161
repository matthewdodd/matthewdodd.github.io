Emanuel, knowing them to be stolen—he said he was packing some rags, and he asked me to allow him five minutes to go down stairs to finish his job—I said, "No," he must consider himself my prisoner, and go the station—he then sat down on a bed in the parlour, and began crying—he said, "Now I am <hi rend="italic">done!"</hi>

On Sunday night, 12th May, my beat was in his neighbourhood—he told me he wanted to be called on Monday morning at three o'clock—I called him—he said he was going to fetch some tailors' cuttings, and he was obliged to go early after them—at a few minutes before five o'clock that morning I was standing at the corner of Duke-street—I saw a cart which Lawrence was driving, there was no one else with it—it was drawn to Duke-street, opposite Tom's-conrt, where Bayes lives—after the cart had stopped there I saw Bayes come across Oxford-street towards his own house—that was the same way I had seen the cart come—Bayes asked me to have something to drink—I was willing to have something if there was a house open—I afterwards saw the cart and some bags containing rags—I will not be positive whether there were five or six in all, but Lawrence had taken two or three off the cart before Bayes got to it, and they laid in the archway—they were then all taken off by Lawrence, and put under the arch, and then Lawrence and Bayes both carried them into Bayes's house—on the Wednesday evening afterwards, at a little after nine, Bayes was standing at his shop door, and he said to me, "I am going to</p>

            . I am guard of the Tally-ho, Birmingham coach. On the 8th of December Mr. Osmond was a passenger - I put his portmanteau, baskets, and carpet-bag into the boot at Coventry; we got to Hadley a few minutes past six o'clock; the boot fastens with an iron bar, which crosses and clasps on a staple under my seat - there is a key-hole in the boot; soon after six o'clock I heard a noise, turned my head, and saw the boot-door open, and the prisoner turning from behind, and running away from the coach; when I first saw him, he jumped from behind the hind-boot, and ran away; I jumped from the coach, and hallooed Stop thief! I am sure he is the man; I pursued him five or ten yards, and then saw the portmanteau drop from him - I picked it up, and ran on a little further, with it under my arm, two or three yards, and there laid this carpet-bag; there was nobody before the prisoner who could have dropped them; I continued to call Stop thief! Tearle came running behind me, with a lantern in his hand - he passed me, and pursued; I pursued a little way, and then turned back with the portmanteau and bag, as they were heavy - they were what the prosecutor had given me; I saw the same baskets next day; the prisoner was brought back - I put him on the coach, and brought him to London; I asked what he had been doing that day; he said he had been shooting over Mr. Byng's grounds; I asked where his gun or dog were, and if he had a certificate; he said, Oh! many men went shooting without a certificate - that he had left his dog with Hawkins, a small farmer, and his gun with a friend; I brought him to town, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were pursuing, was there no other person before him? A. Not that I saw - if there had been, I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does your boot fasten by a bolt or lock? A. There are both, but it was not locked; it was not very dark - there was no moon nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100069"></xptr>stars visible; if a person had been far off the prisoner, I could not have seen him; I said at the office it was a man like the prisoner, in a long coat, but not that I did not know who it was; I went to Hawkins to enquire about the dog; the prisoner might be two or three yards off when the portmanteau dropped - I was almost near enough to catch hold of him - I will swear he was not ten yards from me; I saw it was a portmanteau when I came up; I turned back, and two men came up with the prisoner in less than five minutes; Hawkins is not here; the baskets were found behind a sand-heap by the road side.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Did you find any dog at Hawkins? A. No, none had been left there; he must have dropped the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whatever was dropped, did you pay most attention to that or the man? A. I looked at both - I did not lose sight of the man.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live at Hadley. On the evening of the 8th of December, about six o'clock, I was crossing the road - I heard a coach coming, and hurried over to clear the fore-wheels; I afterwards found it was the Tally-ho; I first heard an expression of regret, as if a man had lost something, or somebody, and let him go; I heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran behind the coach to see what was the matter, and saw the guard pick up the portmanteau - I passed him in pursuit of a man, who I saw running as fast as he could; I stumbled against something, but did not fall; I put my lantern down, and it was the carpet bag - in doing this I lost sight of the man; I still ran on, and listened to hear if he was running along the road, but he was not - I then crossed the road, and saw Testing and a carpenter with the prisoner; Testing had hold of the prisoner - I thought him the man I had pursued; I held the light up to him, and found he was exactly the size of the man who was running before me; I had been within about two yards of him - I could look over his shoulder, and I judged him to be the man; I took hold of him, and called to the coachman to stop; I picked up this piece of a leather strap, and behind a sand-bank, about seventy yards behind where the coach stopped, I saw two baskets found, on the left side of the road - there is a ditch and a hedge between the bank and the road; the strap was opposite the sand-heap, and has a broken buckle to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is the sand-bank from where you first saw the prisoner? A. About thirty yards - I lost sight of him just about that place; I was from two to four yards from him; I did not see him threw any thing away - It was a dark night; my eye was fixed on him; the baskets were nearly full - I could throw one of them twenty yards myself; I had my lantern, but that was not on account of the darkness of the night.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Were you crossing the road when you ran out of the way of the coach? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an exciseman, and live at Hadley. On the 8th of December I heard a cry of Stop thief! and came to my door; I saw the coach standing at a little distance, and a light near it - I presently saw some persons running together towards me; I observed one person with a dark coat on - he crossed straight towards me, where there was a deal of mud and stuff - he seemed to me to be in the centre; some others went straight on; there was one on the left went up a lane, I opened my little gate, and saw the prisoner running, and Hickmott after him; Hickmott said, "I see nobody else on the road, and I shall stop you;" he was near my house then; I went up, and saw the prisoner in his hands; Hickmott was induced to let him go, as he said, "Yonder he goes - stop him, stop him!" there was nobody else to stop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he been crying out before that? A. Immediately he saw Hickmott close to him he called out, but not before, for he had passed me before Hickmott came up.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. From the time you came out, did you see any body running in the same direction as the prisoner? A. No; when Hickmott let him go, he ran as hard as he could for about ninety yards; I pursued; Hickmott ran and took him again; and, as we brought him back, we met Mr. Tearle with a light - I am certain he is the person Hickmott had taken before; I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This was a lightish night, was it not? A. Middling; I could see pretty well - if a man had been within twenty yards of me, I could have seen him; if he had thrown away the basket I should have seen him - I think there was nobody ahead of the prisoner, when he crossed towards me; there were some persons before him, and some behind when he crossed; I cannot tell how many; there might be three; I saw the prisoner come across to the dirty place, where nobody would go unless they were forced - nobody was stopped but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If any body had taken you, you would have said you was not the man? A.

            . I am a City officer, and received the prisoner in charge on the 8th of December; I found on him nine sovereigns, 2s. 6d., a silver watch, a 5l. Bank-note, a 5l. country-note, and a 5l. note stamped "Forged."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not keep all this money? A. No; I gave Mr. Walton the sovereigns and silver.</p>

            . One of the keys produced fits the bolt of the boot - I have not tried it, but it is such a key as I use, and I have no doubt it would open it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the baskets safe that night? A. Yes, about four o'clock, at Redburn; I forget whether they were tied together - the portmanteau might weigh 30 lbs. or 40 lbs. - I do not believe he carried them all, but that they were thrown out of the boot one at a time - one man could carry them all.</p>
               <p>MR. OSMOND. The bag, baskets, and portmanteau contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could you, looking at a man four yards from you, see him throw these baskets away? A. Yes, I should think so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I started early that morning by the coach, and had been shooting the whole day; I have been at the public-house before, and the landlord has lent me a pointer dog which he keeps.</p>

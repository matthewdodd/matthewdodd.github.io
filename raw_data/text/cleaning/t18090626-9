On the 26th of May, between one and three o'clock, I saw the prisoners together in the shop, I was at the distance of between eight and ten yards; I did not hear what they asked for, they left the shop; a man came up to the door, and said we had been robbed. I pursued them; they crossed Bishopgate-street, and were a little way up Union-street before I got up to them; my shop is opposite of Union-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company - A. They did; one was stopped when I went up, and the other was coming up to her; I pulled Cooper's cloak of one side in Union-street, and saw the muslin under her arm; she dropped it, I picked it up, and desired her to walk in with me, she did; and the other was brought after her by Baldero. I sent for an officer; we examined them, nothing else belonging to me was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon examining that piece of muslin, did you know it to be yours - A. I did, it had my shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You served them with nothing that day, did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them how they came by it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pretend that they had bought it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you serving in the shop that day - A. Mr. Baldero and two others; I could not be certain that my boy was in the shop, the other young man was I know.</p>
               <p>Q. And Baldero is the only person of the three who is here - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prime cost of that muslin - A. Half a crown a yard; there is fourteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>- BALDERO. Q. Are you a servant of Mr. Styles - A. Yes. On the 26th of May, I was serving in the shop, I saw the two prisoners come in as if they came in together; they immediately followed each other, they took no notice, nor did they speak to each other during the time they were in the shop.

               <p>Q. How far did she stand from the other prisoner - A. Close by her. When I returned again she asked me for half a shawl; on my telling her that we did not halve them, she left the shop immediately followed by

               <p>Q. Were there any pieces of muslin on the counter near where Cooper stood - A. There were several, and this amongst the rest; I saw it about a quarter of an hour before; in a few minutes after they left the shop from information I followed them, and when I first got sight of them they were near Union-street; they both took up Union-street; I detained Cooper, requested her to go back; she hesitated and appeared not willing to go back; Mr. Styles came up, took hold of Cooper's cloak I saw the muslin under her; I took hold of Brown, requested her to go back with me; she did, I followed her; they both came back to the shop. Sapwell was sent for, he examined them; Mr. Styles charged him with both of them, as they were together at the time of stealing it; they said they had no knowledge of each other. I am quite sure the muslin is my master's property.</p>

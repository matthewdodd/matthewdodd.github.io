            , you have been guilty of an offence of this sort; aggravated as it was, you have added greatly to that aggravation by attempting to keep yourself from the hands of Justice in the manner you have done; the offence was certainly a very bad one, and when persons attempt to support such conduct by attacking those whose duty it is to bring them to justice, and by attempting the life of those people that come to apprehend them, it is peculiarly necessary they should be made examples of; in this case it is not owing to you, but rather to the hand of Providence, that the lives of these persons were saved; the sentence therefore is, that you be transported for seven years to Africa</p>

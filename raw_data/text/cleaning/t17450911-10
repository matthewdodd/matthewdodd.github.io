             lived over my head. On Monday night the 28th of July, they came home about eleven o'Clock at night; I did not see them bring any thing in then, but they went out again, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, and she came in with a bundle, and he had a kettle and something in it that rattled. They left these things in his apartment, and went out again, and the third time they came in with some sheets and other things, and then the clock struck twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring a candle in with them then?</p>
               <p>Crockett. No, she left a candle in the window the second time they were there. About five o'Clock they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they carry these things with them?</p>
               <p>Crockett. No, but they were carried out of the house. I got up about seven o'Clock, and saw that the window shutters had been cut open, so that I could put my hand in between the two window shutters, (I made a complaint to the neighbours of it; for Watland always desired us or some of the neighbours to give an eye to his windows whenever we went by, when he was out of town) one pane of glass was broke, and the window shutter bedaubed with mud. The neighbours would have had me have taken out a warrant, but I did not care to do it till the Prosecutor came home. Jones went to Rag Fair to buy a bit of Salmon, and somebody who knew that I was going after him, bid him not come up the Lane; so when he saw me, he threw the Salmon away, and put the dish under his arm, and run away. I found under the head of the Prisoner's bed a large spike nail, a chissel, and this bunch of keys, [some of them were pick lock keys] I sent to Watland, but could not find out where he was. In about three weeks his wife came to town, and Jones confessed at Mr. Unwin's house that he broke Watland's house open about 12 o'Clock at night, but that he never should have done it if he had not been in liquor, and he owned the taking all these things.</p>

            . On the 29th of July Crockett came to me, and said, there was a poor man's house broke open, and desired me to go with him to Jones's house, for he did not care to go without me, for fear of coming into trouble. I went with him, and in the Prisoner's room we found these things [a bunch of keys, a large spike nail, and a chissel] and a great part of the goods which the Prosecutor lost: I carried these things to my house, and in about three weeks time the Prosecutor and his wife came to town, and they came to my house; I fetched the things down, and Watland said, they were his. I had intelligence that Jones used to make it his constant practice to go to St. Paul's to pick pockets; so I went into the middle isle of the church, and saw the Prisoner pass by me: I did not rightly know him, but he saw the Prosecutor, and so turned back again into the Isle; I took hold of him and pulled him back, said I, is your name

So I let him go, for I thought he would come along with me, and I was not willing to make a disturbance in the church; he run away, I cried out stop thief, and he was taken presently, and was carried to my house; he denied the fact for a considerable time, but afterwards he owned that he and Moore broke open the Prosecutor's house between twelve and one, and took the things that were missing, and said, he was sorry that he should hurt a man he knew, and one he knew to be poor.

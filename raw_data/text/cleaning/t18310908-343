               <p>THOMAS BOYCE. I am a constable of Hampsted district. On the evening of the 6th of August I saw the prisoner in company with another boy go into Mosely's shop- the other boy took down a cage, which had white mice in it, and the prisoner took down a pair of skates - I pursued him, and took him to the watch-house; I found the skates on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor took the value of the property, and here is the paper he signed for it.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Chapel-street, Somers'-town. The prosecutor told me he had taken 2s. of this man - I did not write this paper; I saw it at the Northampton Arms, Pentonville - the prosecutor was there, drinking with Mr. Meares and two young men; Meares in a bird fancier, at Pentonville - I saw the paper in Lewis' hands; Lewis wrote the body of it, and Mosely put his name to it, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is not the whole of it in one handwriting? A. I should not think the name was written by the same person - I was not present when it was written at all; the prosecutor told me he had received the 2s., and did not want to hurt the man.</p>

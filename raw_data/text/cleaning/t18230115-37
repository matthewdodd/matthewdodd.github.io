On Monday, the 16th of December, about five o'clock in the morning, I went to work, and returned about twenty minutes before five o'clock in the evening. I went into the garden, and in three or four minutes saw the prisoner come up to the garden gate, she asked me to come and unlock the door, for she could not. I went, but could not open it; I then went round to the back door, and found it pulled too, but not fastened. I went up to the bed-room, and found the bolt of the lock of the bed-room door broken, and my chest broken open; I do not know what was in it; the prisoner came in - she lived at one end of the house, and I at the other; we rent it of Mr. Trimmer; my wife's box was also opened; the prisoner pretended that her door was broken open as well. I looked at it, but could see nothing the matter with it; she appeared very much frightened when I examined my boxes. I could not find the property any where. I went to Crawford to my wife. I met Beswick, and told him; I accompanied him to search the prisoner's room - we found nothing; we then went to a room which is not occupied, and found concealed up the fire place, a bag with my coat in it, and all the other property.</p>

            . I am a horse patrol. On the 16th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's room - we found her in bed; I desired her to get up - I found nothing in her room, but in a back room unoccupied, we pulled the bricks down from the chimney, and found a bag containing all these things. The room door was tied with a string; she acknowledged the bag to be her's; she was present when we found it. As we went to the Magistrate's next day, I asked if she had done it; her mother was with us - I told her mother I did not believe but she had somebody to assist her, and she told her mother in my presence voluntarily, that three gipsy women pressed her to commit the robbery.</p>

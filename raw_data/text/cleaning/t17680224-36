            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner lodged a week in our house in a one pair of stairs room, her husband belongs to an Indiaman; I heard her say before this, the first money she could get she would follow the ship to Portsmouth; she came into the public-house while we were at dinner, and went out again; I went home after that, and with difficulty I got the key into the hole of my room door, which is on the ground floor; at last I found the door only upon the latch; then I missed all the things mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176802240023"></xptr> in the indictment; I went and told my husband; Mrs. Pain told me she saw a person, describing the prisoner, with a bundle, as much as she could carry, come out at my door, and go towards the Butcher-row; I pursued, but could not find her; I got in a carriage and went to Portsmouth, she was not there; on the Friday following I met her by accident, within twenty yards of my own house; I took hold of her, and told her for what I held her; she begged I would let her go; I took her into a public-house, and saw there in her hand part of the cuffs of one of my gowns (produced in court, and deposed to;) she was carried to the watch-house; in the morning she sent for me, and there owned the fact; she cried, and said she was drunk when she did it; she said one of the gowns she had pawned in Moorfields for 6 s. and the stays for 18 d. but could not tell the pawnbroker's name; some she said she sold in the Minories; I have got no more than the cuffs again.</p>

               <p>M. Pain. I live right facing the door; I saw her the week after at the Justice's, and am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>These people, my prosecutors, keep a disorderly house in East-Smithfield; she drawed me away from my mother, a green grocer; she lives now in New Rag-fair; what money I got from men, this woman made me give to her; when I threatened to go from her she said she would lay me rotting in a goal; I never had a husband in my life, I was backwards and forwards at her house three quarters of a year; she and her husband get their living by unfortunate girls, and when they are for going away from them they threaten to put them in goal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Pain. What is the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Pain. He is a baker, he rents a house of my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he carry on baking?</p>
               <p>Pain. No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they get their living?</p>
               <p>Pain. I never heard any cabal in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they keep a reputable house?</p>
               <p>Pain. I never hear no noise, they always pay me honestly, and I have no business no farther.</p>
               <p>Q. to C. Taffe. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. I have known her about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she lodged a week in your house, did she lodge with you no longer?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. I once lett a room to her and a young fellow, but that was not in the house we live in; I know nothing of any one that belongs to her; when I first knew her, she lived in a yard where my house was, in Hog-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she has a husband, what was he?</p>
               <p>C. Taffe. He was a picture frame maker.</p>

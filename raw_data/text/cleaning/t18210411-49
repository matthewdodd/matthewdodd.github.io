I secured him without losing sight of him. He said he had merely met Griffiths.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Golding, of Temple-place, Blackfriars. I was walking with Read, he laid hold of Griffiths, and Perry ran off; Read let Griffiths go, and I laid hold of him - in less than a minute after he put his hand in his coat pocket, and threw the snuff-box over the rails, into the garden; when Read came up I gave Griffiths to him, I then got over into the garden, and picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GRIFFITHS. Q. Did you keep hold of me all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110028"></xptr>the time - A. Yes; he was walking away - I collared him immediately that Read let him go. He threw the box away after I collared him.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITHS. Q. Did I not say I would go quietly with you - A. No, he said he would not go.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENNETT. I am a leather-dresser. I was passing near Gate-street, and saw the prisoners running; I followed, and saw Barton detain Griffiths - I saw Griffiths throw something over into the garden; Barton got over and brought the snuff-box. Perry was stopped in Holborn.</p>

On the 27th of December I went out about seven in the evening, and returned about twelve, went to bed, and arose the next morning at eight, at which time I missed my shoes and buckles; I missed also my coat, waistcoat, breeches, four shirts, and two pair of stockings; I locked all these things in my box that afternoon at four o'clock, and I found it open the next morning; the prisoner lodged with me, and was my bedfellow and fellow-servant; he slept out that night, and went off the next morning at six; he was missing for near eight weeks; he was taken by one of our patroles with my breeches on him; I found nothing about him but the breeches and knee-buckles. (The buckles produced and deposed to.) When he got up at six in the morning, he said he would go hard to work.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Rainsford; on the 15th of last month my master lost five old coach glasses, and a half one which was broke the day before, they were worth 15 s. a-piece, when I came to the stable in the morning, the coach house was broke open, and the frames left in the carriage, and the glasses taken out; the next morning I heard a man was taken up with some coach glasses in a green bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the glasses in the watch-house? - No, not till they came to the Rotation office in Litchfield-street. (The glasses produced and deposed to.) The man was taken from the watch-house to the office in a coach, and the glasses too, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to the glasses! - Only that they fit the frames.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at them, and see whether you can take upon you to swear to them. - It is hard swearing to glass, but I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing before the justice? - He said, he had them of a man at the end of Welbeck-street to put them in frames for him, a man that was going into business.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these glasses of any uncommon size? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Are they the exact number that your master lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - He was taken up about five in the morning, in Charlotte-street, near Portland-street, that is not far off.</p>
               <p>Court. How many streets distance? - Just across Portland-place a little way.</p>

               <p>I am a lamp-lighter; I took the prisoner in Charlotte Mews, about five, the clock had not struck; he was standing still, I was going to alter the lamp, and I said, what do you say, he said, I am calling my boy, I thought he was a chimney sweeper, he was coming out with these glasses and a great coat; I asked him what he had there, he said, it was some glass he was going to polish, says I, friend you must stop a little, it is our orders to stop any suspicious person, the same as a constable or watchman; he took the glass to the watch-house, and the account that he gave of it there was, that he had it from a man to polish; but he could not tell the man's name, nor the number of the house, nor any thing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The person I received these glasses of came to my house the day before I was taken into custody, he asked me to make some frames, and to come between five and six for them, it was in Welbeck-street, at a public house where I had been before, he was was to meet me there; he met me about half an hour after five, as nigh as I can guess, he gave me the glasses in a green bag, he left me just as that man stopped me in the street, I was stopping to rest myself, I said, I had some plate glasses, and was going to make some frames for them, I was taken to the watch-house; I could not find the man that gave them to me, he said he would come to my house as soon as I was there.</p>

On the 19th of July, I went out between one and two o'clock, leaving my watch hanging in a cupboard in a corner of the shop, four or five yards from the window; there is a dresser before the window: I returned about five o'clock, and it was gone - I found it at Hatton-garden; I had left my daughter Anna in the with a child eight months old.</p>
               <p>ANNA MARIA SMALL. I am nine years old in October. On the 19th of July my father left me in the shop with the baby; a man came in, and took my father's watch off the nail in the cupboard; I never saw him before, but I know the prisoner is the man, because I saw him when he took it - I had seen it in the cupboard before he came. When he came in he asked for a penny-worth of milk - I went to get it him, and when I had turned round to get it, I heard the watch-chain rattle; the cupboard had two glass doors, one of them was shut and the other put too; he could see the watch in the cupboard - any person outside could see it: when I returned with the milk he was walking from the cupboard up to the dresser, with one hand in his breeches pocket; I looked, and the watch was gone; I said, "You have got my father's watch;" I put the milk down on the dresser, and he said, "Don't make a noise - don't make a noise; I will give it you;" he laid hold of my shoulder, and throw me down; he then ran out, and I after him, calling "Stop thief! you have got my father's watch;" he was brought back to the shop in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any fear at this time? A. Yes; I was afraid that he was going to take the watch, but not of anything else; I did not see him take it off the nail, but it was in the cupboard before he came in; I saw Mrs. Wyatt in the shop directly I returned.</p>

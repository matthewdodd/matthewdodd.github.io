Walker, of the Commercial-road; I directed one of the clerks to enter them to Walker - the parcel was tied up; I said "It is unusual to let goods go by a stranger without a written order;" he immediately pulled one from his pocket, which I produce; I gave him the goods and he went away with them - they were worth 22 l.</p>

            's house; on the 9th of December, about eleven in the morning, the Prisoner came to see me (as she said) because I always gave her good advice; she said she had married a porter at an inn; I asked her how she came hither ? she said she came with a hare on Saturday night, and that between Saturday and Wednesday, her husband had run away and robbed her; said I, it is a commong thing for a woman to rob her husband, but not for a husband to rob his wife ; the Prisoner followed me into the inner room several times; I had washed one of the spoons, and put it into the cup which stood in a corner cupboard (with the rest of the plate that was stolen) in the inner room; and it being near two o'clock, I said Nanny, I must go, I wonder my husband does not come home; she said, when you go I will go. I went to make up the fire, and missed a little bit of a poker; I locked the door of the inner room as well as the outer room, and went out. I had been gone out about half an hour, and when I came home my husband said both the doors are broke open; what, said I, both the doors! yes, said he. I clapped my hands and said, Nan has done this I am afraid, meaning the Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you returned ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . Both broke open; and I missed a silver cup with two handles, three large spoons, three tea-spoons, a silver strainer, a scarlet cloak and a black bonnet , which were all in the inner room when I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the things what course did you take?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . I went to the Prisoner's father, and told it him as a secret; he said he did not wonder at it, for it was not the first time. The next morning I advertised her, and this young man, Mr. Prior, Mr. Young the goldsmith's man, that bought the plate of the Prisoner, came to me, and said he had bought a cup and a spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to see them since ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I did not see them till last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the cup and spoon?</p>
               <p>[Mr. Young produced the cup and spoon, which Mrs. Greenwood said was what she had lost.]</p>
               <p>Eliz. Greenwood . The Prisoner was apprehended , and I went to Newgate to see her, and asked her how she could serve me so? for, said I, I always gave you good advice, and she did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with robbing you?</p>
               <p>Greenwood . Yes, and she did not deny it. I asked her how she did it; she said, she broke the door open with her hand, and thought the devil helped her, and she said she sold the cup and spoon to this young man, Prior.</p>
               <p>Pris. I cannot deny it in any shape, and leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Q. Messrs. Bailey and Brooks are the <rs id="t18130113-34-viclabel189" type="occupation">contractor</rs>

               <p>Q. Had these gentlemen lost any of these wayling pieces - A. Yes. The wayling pieces of timber are tied together with ropes. We missed several of them. I went to Shears's. At Shears's I found three pieces of wayling, one piling, and one pile-head. Shears's premises, where I found these things, is No. 9, Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of anything Shears said to you did you go to a man of the name of Denny - A. Yes; and in consequence of what Denny said, I went to the prisoner. The prisoner said, they were small pieces floating on the river, and he thought them not of much consequence.</p>
               <p>- DENNY. Q. Did you sell any pieces of timber to Shears - A. I did; the pieces of timber that were produced at Bow street. I bought them of the prisoner about a week, or better, before they were in possession of Shears. I live in Shire-lane, Temple-bar. In the morning, a little after eight, this timber was put up against my place. The prisoner was with them. He asked me, whether I would buy them. I asked him, whether they were his property. He told me, that he took them up in the river, and that they were his privilege. I gave him two pounds sixteen shillings for the five pieces. There were two more pieces. I gave three pounds five shillings and six pence for the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shears. There were five pieces of timber found at your house - A. Yes. I bought them of the last witness, Denny. I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS. I am a Bow-street office patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on last Sunday, about three o'clock. I told him, I apprehended him for selling some timber to Mr. Denny. He said, he picked it up somewhere about Blackfriars-bridge.</p>

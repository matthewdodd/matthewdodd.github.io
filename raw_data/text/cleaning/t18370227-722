On the 30th of December, about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house—I was not at home, and he sent for me—I saw him at the Harrow public-house—I have known him three or four years—he asked me if I could clip a horse for him—I said I could—he said he had not yet purchased the horse, that she belonged to a little man inside, that there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between them, and he dare say he should have her, or he intended to have her—he said he wanted it done as quick as possible, for he wanted to show her—I went to the White Horse and Woolpack at Old Ford <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Do her—that is about a mile from the Harrow—he went on first—I stopped to get my comb and scissors, and then followed him—he told me to come to the White Horse—I went and found him there, and there was a little dark man there, who looked a good deal like a Jew—I heard the prisoner ask him if he was to have the horse—he said, no, without he gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the prisoner said he would not have it unless 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were thrown off, I cannot say which—the prisoner agreed to have it of him, and something was written on a stamp by the little man, which he gave to the prisoner—no money passed between them in my presence—we then all went into the, stable together—I found a chestnut mare there—she had been sweated a good deal, and was stained with sweat and dirt—she had no shoes on behind, and her tail was bleeding, having been fresh Docked—(I afterwards saw the same horse at Worship-street)—the prisoner paid me for the clipping—he walked on to the White Horse before me, and a man named Basset, who was with him, walked with roe to the White Horse—the prisoner could not have got there above two or three minutes before me—I never saw the dark man before—the prisoner and he talked very friendly together, but the prisoner told me he was a stranger to him—I should think South Mimms is nineteen or twenty miles from Bow—it it a cross-country road—the prisoner told me he had bought the mare for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, and live at Ware. I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—I always believed him a very upright man in his dealings—Osborne and the policeman came to me to inquire for the prisoner, and I told them where to find him—I went to his home—I found him at a public-house, and told him the officers were after him for horse-stealing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you buy the grey mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I had teen her often before I bought her—I don't think I was in town on the 30th or 31st of December—I never was at Old Ford—I am not a horse-dealer, and never was—I have no forge at Ware—I have stables for four or fire horses there—I have seen Basset three times—I do not know a man named Simpkins or Jenkins—I know Bush—he has clipped horses for Be—I know Lockwood—he was my father's servant some years—I had bought horses of the prisoner before I bought the grey mare—the grey mare was the last I bought—I did not intend to buy her—I had asked him to look for a horse for me, and he said, "You can take my grey mare, and work her till I get another for you;" but since he has been in prison he wanted the money, and I have paid him for it—I have not beard that the grey mare was stolen—nothing of the kind—no inquiries have been made about her—I have known her for years—Osborne had her before he did, and before that, Searle, of Loughton—I cannot say exactly how many horses I have bought of the prisoner—it may be eight or ten, and two or three perhaps within the last twelve months, for my own use—I went to his house the day he was apprehended, but he was not there—I had not seen him before I went there—I saw him about five minutes after I had been there—his house is in a yard in Worship-street—he has an apartment there—when I went there I got a piece of paper from there, and burnt it—I went to the house for the prisoner, as I was ordered by Osborne and the officer—he was not there—from there I went to the Magpie and Cock—I can explain what the paper was which I burnt—the prisoner wished me to pay him for this mare, and asked me to lend him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him at the time it was rather inconvenient, but he could have it by-and-by—he said, would I accept a bill—I said, "Certainly"—when he was taken into cuatody, I said to him, "That bill, of course, is of no service to you"—he said no, and if I asked his wife for it, she would give it to me—I then burnt it—it was a bill for 32, which I had lent him about ten day or a fortnight before he was taken—no other name was on the bill but my own and his—I did not notice any name—I did not pay that attention to it—I did not look at the back—the prisoner found the stamp and drew the bill—he did not buy it in my presence—I swear that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183702270054"></xptr>
               <p>I did not notice the amount of the stamp—the bill was written at his own apartment, his wife was present at the time it was written, but nobody else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that positively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You ask me almost too close a question there—I don't remember any more—I will swear there was not more than one other man present besides myself and him—I don't know that there was another man—I can't say that Basset was there, or that he was not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you examine the chestnut mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her on the Tuesday—I cannot remember the day of the month—she was lame in all four legs, and with spavins in both hind legs—there was an enlarge, ment on the near fore-leg and a navicular lameness of the off fore-leg, and she was a <hi rend="italic">high-blower—a roarer.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Pawson and Company, of St. Paul's Church-yard. On the 6th of December, I was in Wood-street, Cheapside—I had a parcel in my pocket—I do not know the contents, but I missed it—I turned, and saw the prisoner passing from behind me—he crossed the road, and when he got to the corner of Huggin-lane, he ran—I ran, and called "Stop him"—he threw this parcel behind him—I took it up, and pursued him till the policeman took him.</p>

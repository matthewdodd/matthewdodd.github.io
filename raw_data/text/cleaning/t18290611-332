The prisoner lodged in the same room with us; last Monday week, I put my husband's coat into a box just before I went out, at twenty minutes after seven o'clock in the evening, and took out an apron - I left the prisoner sitting in a chair; he pretended to be asleep: I came home in a short time - he was there; my husband came in soon after, and the prisoner went into the privy - when he came in he had the coat wrapped up, but the skirt of it hung down; I was standing at the room door, and saw him go past - I called my husband, and said he had his coat; he would not believe it till he looked into the box, and missed it - he then pursued, but did not catch him; the coat has not been found.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY ROACH. My wife said the prisoner had taken my coat - I looked into the box, and it was gone; I pursued the prisoner, but lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is your name Roach? A. Yes; it is not Murphy.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LINDLEY. I am a constable. I took the prisoner, and said it was for stealing a coat from the prosecutor - he said he was no thief, and would not be taken by any body; he showed fight, but I struck him with my staff - he gave the prosecutor some wounds, and he has not been able to work since.</p>

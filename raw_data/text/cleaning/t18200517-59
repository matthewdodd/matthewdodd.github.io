            , JUN. I live in Prujean-square, Old Bailey. On the 12th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I had been at the west-end of the town; and, in coming through <placeName id="t18200517-59-crimeloc349">Temple-Bar</placeName>

I turned round, and was called to by a gentleman, who said, that the person crossing the road had got my handkerchief. The prisoner was the person; and I collared him before he got to Shire-lane. I asked him for my handkerchief; he had got it in his hand; I took it from him, and gave him in charge. I did not see any one with him.</p>

            . I am in the Town Clerk's Office. I had been to Somerset House; and in returning through Temple-Bar with a friend, I saw Mr. Webb and a young woman with him; it was on the Strand side. In going through the arch, I saw a handkerchief partly out of his pocket. There were only two persons between Mr. Webb and us. Suspecting them, I watched them, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Mr. Webb's pocket; he was then through the arch. Mr. Webb turned shortly round, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"There is the thief that has got your handkerchief." I did not know what became of his companion, he disappeared. Mr. Webb laid hold of him before he got to Shire-lane, on this side of the Bar. We went as far as Chancery-lane, and delivered him into custody.</p>

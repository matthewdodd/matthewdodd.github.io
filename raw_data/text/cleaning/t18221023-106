In consequence of the rain coming through the roof, on the 24th of October, I went on the roof the house, the prisoner followed me up of his own accord; I found the lead cut from all round the building - it measured an hundred and thirty-five feet; three quarters of it had been taken away, and the rest rolled up ready for being carried away; the lead which covered the trap-door appeared to have been removed for some time. On returning with the prisoner, I said it was most surprising how it could be cut without his knowing something of it; he said he cut some of it to mend other parts, and that I told him to do it, which was false. About eight o'clock in the evening I went up with a dark lantern, and found some sheet lead folded and laid on the rafters; that was done since I had been there; and in the morning I found the prisoner's basket with a quantity of lead folded up on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not that place free of access to every body - A. There are two separate parts of the building, and the porter at the gate is ordered to admit no one. It is impossible for any body to get on the roof; a female pauper was found there six months ago, when a ladder had been left there. Three pieces of the lead were in his basket.</p>

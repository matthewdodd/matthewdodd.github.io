                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Marquis of Anglesey public-house in Bow-street, in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden—I rent the house and live in it—on Saturday mght, the 12th of July, I shut my house myself at a quarter past twelve—I was the last person up—I saw everything secure, and went to bed—about two o'clock in the morning I was called up by the constable, who was outside my front door—I let him in—my front door was fastened, and my house was just as I had left it, except a trap<lb></lb>door between two walls, which was burst open—that door was a part of the house—it is between an old wall and a new one which they had been erecting—it is between the old house next door, which was under repairs, and my house, and led into my passage between the bar and the tap-room—there was a vacancy in the wall in consequence of repairs, and that door was put to supply it, so that in fact it formed part of the wall—I found it had been forced open from the other side into my passage—they must have got at it from the house which was under repair—it had not been left open—it was fastened—I found a drawer in my bar had been tried at by some instrument, and there were marks of a screw-driver on it which corresponded with the marks of one which was brought by one of the officers.</p>

We were rebuilding a party-wall between the Marquis of Anglesey and the house which was repairing—I put up a door in a temporary way, about four o'clock on Saturday afternoon—I merely put a holdfast or two and a bit of wood—the wall had been condemned by the district surveyor—we had pulled part of it down, and there was a vacancy of about eighteen inches between that and the new wall, and I fastened up this door—the adjoining house was empty—I went to work on the Monday morning, about nine o'clock—I found the door had been disturbed, but it was then put up again—there was no staple to that door, nor padlock—there was to the front door of the house No. 23, Russell-street, and the staple was wrenched off that, and the pad<lb></lb>lock undone.</p>

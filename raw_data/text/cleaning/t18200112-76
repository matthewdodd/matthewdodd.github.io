            . I am watchman of Great Wild-street. I heard the cry of Stop thief! looked up Pitt's-place, and saw the prisoner running as fast as he could. When he got to the bottom I collared him, and asked him what was the matter? He replied,</p>
               <p>"Nothing - there is a row in Drury-lane, and I want to get out of it." I took him up the court about twenty yards, when he upset me, knocked me down, and my lanthorn broke. I pulled him down with me, and still held him. When I got up I heard something jingle under my feet. The prosecutor immediately came up, and said he had been robbed of his watch by the prisoner; I picked the watch up in the area where we fell. I was taking him to the watch-house, and when we got to Wild-street he said,</p>
               <p>"Let the old fool go to hell, he has got his watch. I will give you something handsome to let me go, as it will be a serious job to me - I want to fly and be off." He put 6 s. 6 d. into my hand, but I kept hold of him and the money, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He searched me before the watch was thrown down, and found nothing on me - he took 6 s. 6 d. from me.</p>

I am a messenger at the General Post-office—the prisoner has been employed there about two years—on the 1st of March he was employed in the inland office, collecting letters behind the stamper—his duty was to take the letters from the stampers' table to the sorters' table—in doing so I perceived him separating two or three letters by themselves, and place them behind a row. of letters which he had col<lb></lb>lected—he took the whole parcel up in his arms and conveyed them to the sorters—he took those he had put at the back part of the row with the rest—I followed him to the sorters without his observing me—I observed that he only left about half the row of the letters at the sorters' table—he kept the latter part of the row still in his hands, which contained those I had ob<lb></lb>served him put at the back—he carried those letters back with him to<lb></lb>wards the stampers' table, and on his way back I perceived him shifting some letters under his waistcoat—he put the others which he had carried back,</p>

               <p>down on the stamping table, with some others, and conveyed them down to the sorters—after he had done so I perceived him put his hand up under his waistcoat again, as he returned to the stamping table—he appeared at if he was adjusting his waistcoat—I communicated the circumstance to Mr. Hodd, a clerk in the office—(<hi rend="italic">examining three letters produced by Matthew Peck</hi>)—two of these have passed through my hands—I have marked one of these which is directed to Miss Jones—I have written "loz." on it—this is my hand-writing—it was my duty to weigh the letters—I can speak positively to this—here is another directed to Miss Terry—I recollect seeing this pass through my hands—they all bear the inland stamp of the 1st of March on them, and would arrive in due course by the mail that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the inland office, and was on duty on the 1st of March. In consequence of what Forbes said to me, I caused the prisoner to be searched by Peek, the officer, in the inspector's room-before he was searched Peek asked if he had got anything about him which he ought not to have—he said he had not—he was asked if he had any ob<lb></lb>jection to be searched, and said no—Peek searched his waistcoat pockets, then opened his waistcoat, and discovered two or three letters inside the waistband of his trowsers—he wore a waistcoat with sleeves, and no coat—his waistcoat was tight down—it was left up a short way and the letters thrust into the waistband of the trowsers—I do not recollect what he said on their being discovered—Peek said something to him, I do not recollected what—all three letters bore the inland stamp of the morning of the 1st of March, and the marks of the country towns they came from—it was the prisoner's duty to carry letters over the proper weight, which had not paid sufficient, to the sorter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was his duty to separate from the letters any which were to be paid for above the amount of the stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certianly not—he should carry all the "more to pay" letters to the sorters—it was his duty to carry the whole, whether there was more to pay or not, but the packets that are stamped at that table are to be carried to a different place altogether—but these are stamped with the unpaid letters and are taken to the sorters—the others are taken to another sorters table—it was his duty to carry all the letters from the stamper to the sorters, those that have the proper stamps to one table, and those that have more to pay to another sorter's table—all three of these letters had more to pay—the letters are taken by Forbes to have the stamp "More to pay"put on them.</p>

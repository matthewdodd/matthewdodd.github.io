            . I live opposite Mr. Harris. On the 21st of May I was standing in my shop, with Sandell - I could see into the prosecutor's shop; I saw Bishop, and another person, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, go to the prosecutor's shop, and I saw the waistcoat go off - Bishop either concealed it in his apron, or under his apron, and they went away; I sent Sandell, who ran, and collared Bishop - I went over; we took him into the prosecutor's shop - the other person got away; I cannot swear that it was Berry.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was passing the prosecutor's shop, and these two witnesses had Bishop in the shop; I saw Berry run across the street, and go up another street, towards Crabtree-walk - I took Bishop at the shop, and about twelve o'clock Berry came to the office with some provisions for Bishop, and I took him.</p>

               <p>Berry. He first swore he only saw my dress, and the next time he said he saw my face. Witness. I deny that - I saw your face and dress too.</p>

             sworn. -I am servant to Mr. Stewart: On the 5th of November last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner ask for something for Mr. Houston, I could not hear what; for my master called me up, and said, Tom, you must take this over to Mr. Houston's, there were ten guineas in gold, and a two-pound note and a one-pound note; as I was coming out of the shop the prisoner at the bar met me, as if coming from Mr. Houston's; he began swearing at me for not making haste, he told me the gentleman was waiting for the money; and knowing that he was the man that came into the shop for the money, I held my hand to him and he took it out; I came back, and my master wondered at my coming back so soon, and he sent me to Mr. Houston's to enquire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say I swore at you; what words did I make use of? - A. A d-'d puppy, or a d-'d scoundrel, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>- HOUSTON sworn. - I am a hot-presser, in St. Helen's; I know Mr. Stewart as a baker living near my residence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do not know any thing of him at all; I have not the least idea of his countenance.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not give him orders then to request ten guineas, and a two-pound and a one-pound note? - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Stewart.) Do you know when he was apprehended? - A. A fortnight ago last Saturday; he was detained by another baker attempting the same again; I saw him in Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court, and the decision of the Jury; I have a wife and three children who reside thirty miles in the country, and my friends are all there; I did not expect my trial to come on so soon.</p>

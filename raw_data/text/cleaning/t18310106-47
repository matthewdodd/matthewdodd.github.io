            . I am a corporal in the 9th Lancers, which the prisoner belongs to. In consequence of information, on the 9th of December, at ten o'clock, I went to the part of the barracks which he ought to have been in, and he was absent - he returned drunk at half past one in the morning, and was lodged in the guard-room by the serjeant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I in the barracks at nine o'clock? A. I cannot say - he was reported as present, but absented himself afterwards; the Toy is about a quarter of a mile from the barracks - if he was present at nine it was his duty to remain all night; I produce a handkerchief which he left in the barracks.</p>

            . I am a private in the 9th Lancers. On the 12th of December, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the barracks drunk- he called for a light, which was brought; I saw him take a handkerchief out of his breast - he said he would see what money he had; I saw him with about 2s. 4d. - he concealed it somewhere in the bed, and threw the handkerchief on the bed; he went to bed, and about four o'clock a serjeant and file of guards came in and awoke him - they took him to the guard-house; the handkerchief was left in the room - the corporal has it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see what money I had with me? A. I did - only 1s. 3d. was found in the morning; he answered to his name at the barracks at nine o'clock, and went out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure that is the handkerchief he threw on the bed? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ANDREWS. There is a seam across the handkerchief, where it had been torn; this is the handkerchief in which I wrapped my bag and money.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoner? A. For some weeks; I paid some money which I had borrowed - I put this money into the bag, the bag into my cap, and the handkerchief on it.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GUNNER. I am certain the prisoner is the man who was in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man says he has known me some weeks - I had not been at Hampton Court above ten or twelve days, and came from Hounslow; I wrote for two witnesses who were at the public-house, but they are not come; I went in there, and asked the pot-boy if he wanted to buy a cap - he said No, but sent the prosecutor to me: I sold it to him for 8d. - he afterwards came, and asked if I had any brown Tommy (bread) to sell; I said No - I went out; he followed, and fell down the steps of the house - I took him up, went home with my two comrades, and answered to my name at the barracks; next morning he came, and picked me out from the other two men, who were in the guard-room; where he says I robbed him, it is not above a dozen yards from the sentry at the gate, and he never heard him.</p>

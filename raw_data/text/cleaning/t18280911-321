I came from Bedfordshire on the 16th of July, late at night, and could not get a lodging - I was walking in the street, and met the prisoner between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 17th - she asked me to give her something to drink; I said it was late, and we could not find a place; she said she would find a place, and I went and gave her a glass of rum, and took one myself: we came out, and she wanted me to go home with her, which I refused, but I went with her into some alley, and she clasped her hands round me, and asked me to go home with her - I still refused; she drew her hand from me - I felt my fob, and my watch was gone - she then ran off; I pursued, but lost sight of her - I met Lewis, who asked me what was the matter - I told him; he took her- I am sure she is the person; I was a little the worse for liquor, but knew what I was about; I did not give her the watch, nor promise her any money.</p>

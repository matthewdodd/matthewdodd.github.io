                  </hi>. In May last I lived servant to Mr. Banyon, at Watermen's-hall. The house was under repair, and he and the family were at Greenwich—I was left alone in care of the house, and Frances Pritchard, whom I went to see, begged me to give her a bed—I allowed her to sleep with me, and when she had been there about a week she mentioned the prisoner to me—he came, and she told me, in his presence, that he was her nephew—at her request I allowed him to sleep in the house, although I was very much against it at first—he slept there the Saturday night before the robbery, and came again next Friday—he said he had a friend outside, he would bring him in, and he would send for some beer—I said there were quite sufficient men, and I did not want any more—he did not come—next night he slept there again—he said nothing that night about his friend—he said he would go out and fetch some beer—I begged him not, as we had bad supper, and did not want any, but he insisted on going—I could not get the jug out of his hand—he went out, and was gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—his aunt let him in—he came into the kitchen, which is up stairs—before we went to bed that night I was going down to fasten the door; his aunt generally went with me, but he said, "You need not go, for I have fastened it"—I said, "Never mind him, we will go"—I went down—it was not fastened, and I fastened it—we then went to bed at the top of the house, and he slept on the second floor—next morning, Sunday, a little after eight o'clock, I came down and saw a pair of trowsers belong<lb></lb>ing to Mr. Banyon's grandson on the ledge of the kitchen window—they were not there the night before—I bad not seen the prisoner that morning—I heard him coming down stairs afterwards, and thinking there were the foootsteps of more than one person, I went to the kitchen-door, saw him coming down first, and another person following him—I asked how he could do such a thing, meaning, to bring a man to sleep there unknown to us—he said he was only a poor country fellow out of work—he ran out of the house as fast as he could—he came and looked for his hat, could not find it, and went without it—I felt so alarmed at the sight of the other, I do not know what became of the man—I then went into Mr. Banyon's bed<lb></lb>room, and found a drawer open—I afterwards went down into the wine-cellar, found the door broken open, and the padlock forced off—I had given the prisoner a whole candle to go to bed, and found his candlestick by the cellar-door, and the candle burnt out—I found some keys belonging to Mr. Banyon behind the screen in the kitchen.</p>

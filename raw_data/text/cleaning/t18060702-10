             sworn. On the 16th of June I laid myself down to rest between the hours of five and six o'clock in the evening, on the left side of a path going from <placeName id="t18060702-10-crimeloc50">Brom lane, Old Brentford</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had your watch in your pocket before that time. - A. I had seen it about five minutes before I laid down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober. - A. I had drank three pints of beer in the course of the day; the prisoner at the bar came and laid down by me, I felt him draw the watch out of my pocket; he then got up and walked away, I got up and followed him, he had not gone ten yards from me before I catched him by the collar; I think I said, You rascal you have robbed me of my watch, he replied he had not seen the watch, and while I had got him by the collar, he dropped it with his left hand on the ground, and with his right hand he gave me a violent blow on the eye and knocked me down and ran away; I picked up the watch and pursued him to the Red Lion at Brentford; there I delivered him into the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner. - A. He worked in the garden, I had known him about three months; I produce the watch, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>(The trunk deposed to by Wright.)</p>
               <p>It never went out of my sight.</p>
               <p>What became of it afterwards? - It was carried up to the office directly the alarm was made of stop thieves; as soon as I heard that I took hold of Mr. Noble by the collar; Master, says I, you have stolen this trunk; he had got up to the coach, and was putting it into a hackney coach, there was but one on the stand, at the same time the people came running up the street, and made the alarm of stop thieves; he was taken directly.</p>

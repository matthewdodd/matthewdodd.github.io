            . I was going up the Lane, I followed the prisoner, and saw him take first a piece of roast pork, the next he took out of a dish was a piece of pickled pork; I saw him put it under is coat, I went into to the house and catched hold of his collar, I asked him what he had got there, I took him out of the door, he knocked me and kicked me about, there were eight or nine of us to take him. He had come out of prison a week before.</p>

            , at Ball's Pond, Islington; the field is called North-field. When bricks are delivered to a customer, before delivery, we give a delivery note; that note is shewn to the kilnman; they come to our accompting-house, and take the delivery note; that note contains the quantity of bricks to be delivered.</p>

               <p>Q. On the week before Trip was dismissed, you were plowing in the field - A. I was. I plowed on the Monday, and on Thursday. On the Monday, I saw Elliott in the field; he came with a cart and one horse; he took the bricks from out of the field; Tripp, the kilnman, delivered them to him. I saw the prisoner load the cart, and I saw him take the bricks away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go down to Ratcliffe Layer with Goodwin - A. Yes; I examined the bricks on the prisoner's premises. I could form a judgment of their being made in Mr. Scott's mould, and I know them by their being made with coal-dust instead of ashes, and I found some others that were made in 1813.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the field bricks of this years making - A. Yes, and in 1813. Balls Pond brick field is by the side of the road; some evil disposed person knocked the stock off the table; the moulder knocked the two nails out, and got two spikes with two large heads; that made the alteration in the stock; after that, all the bricks had the impression of the heads of the two spike nails; I found ninety-three thousand were missing; these bricks were about two pound a thousand; we had originally about four hundred thousands; we had two hundred thousand made last summer with that mark.</p>

             - A. Yes; I recollect his ploughing the field a week before I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140076"></xptr>dismissed; while he was ploughing there, Elliot came with his horse and cart; he took away five hundred bricks from the kiln; I helped him to load them; he paid me two shillings a hundred,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any ticket with him - A. No; he must know they were stolen. Master sells them at four shillings a hundred. I was afterwards dismissed. I did not give any information of the robbery untill I was in custody myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have carted bricks from Mr. Scott's fields five or six years. All that Tripp has been saying, is wrong. Shortly before Christmas, I carted three or four thousand bricks from the prosecutor's; I had tickets for them, and then Tripp told me if I wanted any more bricks, to come to the field, he was authorised to sell them. While the road was snowy, I had only a one horse cart; I could not go down the lane; I went afterwards for some bricks, and paid the whole value. I repeatedly asked Tripp for the tickets; if he did not make the return to the master, it was not my wish that he did not. Gentleman, if he is permitted to swear that I had the bricks for less than the value, I trust you will not think that I bought any bricks knowing them to be stolen.</p>

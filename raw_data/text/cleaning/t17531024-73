             before the commissioners for the bankruptcy to prove a debt that very day; there was a paper drawn up between them at some house near Guildhall, which was a tavern, some head, I know not the sign. This was about nine weeks before last Christmas; there was a note drawn by the prisoner, which Sopp signed; then Sopp gave a bag to me with some money in it, and ordered me to deliver it to the prisoner Hine, which I did, and Hine delivered it to Sopp. This was all done in about two or three minutes. I don't know what sum it was; but there was thirty-six shilling pieces, for Sopp gave me three out of the same bag afterwards, to pay to the clerk of the commissioners, Mr. Maschal, which I did; then we went all three together before the commissioners, Hine proved the note under the commission, and he was after that made an assignee.</p>
               <p>Q. What date was put to that note?</p>
               <p>Seyden. It was dated 16 or 18 months back, but I will not be positive to the exact time. A note was shewn to him by the prisoner's council, with the commissioners names folded in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the note?</p>
               <p>Seyden. No, it is not, but when it was unfolded he said he'd swear it was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the note being wrote was it that you went and proved it?</p>
               <p>Seyden. It might be an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had it in their possession?</p>
               <p>Seyden. Hine had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any objection made to the shining of the ink being fresh wrote?</p>
               <p>Seyden. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body of the note wrote before the date was put to it?</p>
               <p>Seyden. Upon my word, I can't be particular as to that, I know it was consulted betwixt them two to date it back on purpose to prove it.</p>

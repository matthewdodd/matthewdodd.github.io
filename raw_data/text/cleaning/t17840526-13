               <p>In what state did you find the bolt of the door? - It was open, I had not particularly observed the window, I had no reason to think it was broke, it is a window to the back part of the house, that looks into the yard which adjoins to a stable yard, and we pass it constantly.</p>

             called over to me, that she rather suspected there had been, or were, some thieves in the house, I went down stairs and saw the kitchen, and the things being thrown about gave me a suspicion; in the further corner of the kitchen, between the copper and the water-tub, I found the prisoner covered with a basket, with some shoes in it.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was that? - It was about seven.</p>
               <p>Were there any things in the basket with him? - We found a bundle with some shirts and things, and some chocolate tied up in an apron of the maid's.</p>
               <p>What account did the prisoner give of himself? - The maid asked him at that time what brought him there, he said he only wanted to see his fellow servants, I remember his living in the family before; the bundle is in Court, I had it in my custody till the re-examination, then I delivered it into the man's hands that swore to it.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. Where were these things found wrapped up in that manner? - Between the water-cask and the copper, under the prisoner, he upon that, and the basket upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing about the charge.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to call? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this case will give you very little trouble, the only question is, whether you will find him guilty of the burglary or of stealing in the dwelling house only.</p>

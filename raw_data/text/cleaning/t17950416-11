               <p>Q. How did he come up to you? - He was behind me; I parted with a friend at the corner of Fetter-lane; going up Fetter-lane I heard somebody behind me, supposing it was the friend that I had parted with, and when I came near to Clifford's Inn, the prisoner rushed on me, and consequently I immediately turned about, and collared him with my left hand, at that moment he was putting the handkerchief behind him, and I put my arm round and took the handkerchief from him, he had it in his right hand.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Fetter-lane that day? - No; the prisoner was brought to my house in Fleet-street; I am ward beadle; the prosecutor brought him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any handkerchief brought there? - Yes; Mr. Paterson gave it to me.(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it till now? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The handkerchief that I gave the officer was the handkerchief that I took off my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that the handkerchief that you found in the hands of the prisoner, was the handkerchief that you took off your neck and put into your pocket? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And that same you delivered to the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Fetter-lane to buy a bit of pork for Sunday's dinner, and I picked up that handkerchief, and a woman was quarrelling with me who should have it; and immediately that gentleman came up and said, it is my handkerchief; and I said, if it is your's, take it; and he said, I will not be positive whether you have picked my pocket or no, for I found it three or four times partly out of my pocket; and some people thereabouts said I should do for a substitute soldier; I said I was not fit for to serve my king and country; and they took me to the hall.</p>
               <p>Court to Paterson. Did any of this conversation pass in the way that he puts it? - It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you doubt at all whether it was taken out of your pocket? - I did not.</p>

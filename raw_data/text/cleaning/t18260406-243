About half past five o'clock on the morning of the 24th of March, I went into my cow yard, and saw the prisoner coming out of one shed into the other, with a bundle under his arm: he turned into a stall where a chaff-engine was - he laid down his bundle there, went into another stall, and laid himself under the horse's head; I sent a man for the watchman, and the prisoner went into another stall; I then seat another man for a watchman; he attempted to make his escape, and I tried to seize him with one hand, having my light in the other, and some measures; he got from me, and ran to an open fence; I threw down what I had, and seized him by one leg; he then took a knife out of his pocket, and cut my two hands. One of the witnesses then came to me, and he cut at him in the legs; I tried to get the knife from him, but could not; he then cut at my legs, but with the back of the knife. I seized him by the throat - Ellen Mullins came, and got the knife from him - he was then taken to the watch-house - these articles were found in the manger.</p>

            . I am a watchman; going up Plough Court, on the 9th of June; between nine and ten in the evening. I heard a noise; the prisoner said, here is Hurle the watchman; the prosecutor said the prisoner had robbed him of seven guineas; I was going on duty; the prisoner and prosecutor were together; I said, Sir, can you make your assertion good? he said, yes; then I took them both to the watch house, and before the Justice; next day she produced the money in the watch house; she put her hand in her pocket, and laid six guineas on the table; he insisted she had another guinea; then with some hesitation she pulled it out of her bosom; she said very little; I believe she was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say it was her own?</p>
               <p>Hurle. She said something I cannot say what.</p>

               <p>As I was in Clare Market, the prosecutor asked me where I was going; I said for something for supper; he asked if I would go with him; I said, no; at last I consented to go; he asked me to drink a glass of wine; I said, no; he said he would make me a present of some money if I would go with him; he gave me six guineas, the other he took from me was not his. Hurle is not a watchman; he said he would take us to a public house, and instead of that took me to the watchhouse; the man took away my cloak from me; they said I should have it again, and then the prosecutor said he would give me a guinea for my cloak.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabriolet-builder, in Red-lion-yard, Great Warner-street, Clerkenwell. On the 2nd of September, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to hire a cabriolet, as he stated—I let him one for a week, at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid one week down—here is a paper, signed by him, (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "I, William Pearce, 27, Chenies Mews, top stable, agree to hire a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> of Robert Richardson, of Red-lion-yard, Clerkenwell, at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, one week to be always paid in advance. I also agree to pay for all damages done to the said <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> while hired by me, except fair wear and tear I also agree to give a week's notice, or pay a week's hire, when I give it up. William Pearce. 2nd of September, half-past three o'clock." He had a person outside, in the yard, to take it away—I never heard any thing of him till the week had expired—that was the Friday following, when I found he did not reside in the place mentioned in the agreement, neither could we find the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> or the man—he was the not known at No. 27, Chenies Mews—I went there on the 9th, and could hear nothing of him—on the 11th, I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the hands of Mr. Ashley, in Chenies Mews—I took him into custody, and he was released the next morning—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 12th, I found the prisoner near Bromley, in a donkey curt, and put him into custody—he said, "I have done it, I know, and I must suffer for it"—and, in answer to a question, he said he took it away with no other intention than to sell it, as he had got no horse, nor any means of working it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-builder, and live in Chenies Mews. I bought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> of the prisoner—on the 2nd of September, about five of six o'clock, he came down the mews, and asked for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man that was driv<lb></lb>ing for himself, who wished to buy a neat <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I asked what he wanted for it—he said "8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I said it was not worth that, and bought it of him for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. repairs to it, and sold it for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and should not have got that, but I took an old one in exchange.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the Strand, and first saw the three prisoners near Southampton-street, in company together. I saw all three take notice of gentlemen's pockets, they came close behind the prosecutor, I watched them narrowly, saw one, (I cannot say which) put his hand into Wall's pocket, and draw the handkerchief a little way, and as they got opposite Exeter-change, they made a pull at it, and it came out, they had kept close to him for about one hundred yards. One of them immediately crossed into the middle of the road, the other two went on. Mason secured the one in the road, I secured the others, searched them, but found no handkerchief. I am certain I saw them take it. As I was taking them up Catherine-street, a young lad, whom I knew to be a thief, came up, and spoke to one of them, he attempted to strike at me with a stick to get them away, but I took them to the watch-house. Mr. Birnie admitted Mitchell to bail.</p>

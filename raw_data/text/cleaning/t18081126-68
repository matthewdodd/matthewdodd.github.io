               <p>Q. How long after she was discharged did you examine the state of your linen - A. I think it was the 2nd of October we searched, and missed a great many articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say from your own knowledge that there was a table cloth missing - A. Yes. In consequence of which I went to Donaldson the officer; he found a duplicate on her person; we took her up on Sunday morning; the officer has got the duplicate. It directed me to Mr. Turner in Brydges street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the table cloth when it is produced - A. Yes, there is my name written upon it in full length, in permanent ink.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that table cloth - A. Fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the table cloth was in your house when she came into your service - A. Yes, it was used the day before.</p>
               <p>- DONALDSON. I am constable of St. Martin's in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend this woman in consequence of information of the former witness - A. I did. On Sunday the 2nd of October, I took her in custody and searched her; in her right hand pocket I found this duplicate of a table cloth, pawned on the 1st of October, for three shillings; I went to Mr. Turner's on that Sunday morning; he shewed me the table cloth. The prisoner said she had the duplicate of a woman of the name of Turner, at the King's Arms in Oxford road; she told me the woman had gone down to Chatham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Old Bond-street. Alexander M'Coy was in my employ for about a month or six weeks, and Charles, only on the day on which he was taken into custody. In consequence of some suspicion, 1 directed the police to watch my premises—I cannot swear to this hamper, but I can to the stout and ale it contains—the bottles have my name on them—the prisoners had no authority to remove them from my premises.</p>

               <p>CHRISTOPHER PRIOR sworn. - I was quartered at the Queen's-head, in St. Martin's-lane: On the 26th of August, I was coming from Shadwell; I have a wife and four children; as I was going from my quarters to shadwell, I met the prisoner and another woman between the New Church and St. Clement's Church, in the Strand; the prisoner took hold of me by my knapsack strap, and pulled me round, and told me her sister and her had but one penny in the world; they asked me if I would make it up a quartern of gin; I told her I thought she had had gin enough; I told her I should not mind giving her a quartern of gin, but I thought there was no house open to get it at; and she told me, at the watering-house, the corner of <placeName id="t17970920-43-crimeloc222">St. Clement's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - A. Between twelve and one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the box in her hand? - A. Yes, and very near got it out of her hand, only the other was rather too nimble for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day? - A. I had been upon the Queen's guard that day, and then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200049"></xptr>had to go round from public-house to public-house till between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. As sober as I am now; she asked me to have part of the gin, and I would not, for I told her I wanted to go home to my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met this man and another woman, and they asked me to drink with them, and I took a glass of liquor with them, and wished them good night, and then he came and charged me with taking his money; I went with him very readily; I had no money at all about me.</p>

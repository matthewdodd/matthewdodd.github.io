                  </hi>. I live at Upper Clapton, and am servant to Alexander Bell. About half-past three o'clock on the 11th of August I saw the prisoner at the gate—I thought my fellow-servant would answer her—the prisoner went down into the kitchen—I saw her go out—I had left my bag on the table in the kitchen when I went up stairs, and when I came down I missed it—it contained the articles stated—having missed it I thought 1 must have moved it—I did not think any more of it till the policeman came in the evening to ask me if I bad lost any thing—I have since seen the things—they are mine—they were secure five minutes before she came into the house—there was a handkerchief belonging to my master—this is it—I don't know whether she had a basket—she had a large cloak on. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not take them—I know nothing of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 138.) My brother-officer searched the prisoner, and found the bag on her—I took her in Upper Clapton, at near four o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAMARKILL</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 68.) The prisoner was brought to the station-house by Connell on the 11th of August—she was desired to pull off her cloak, and inside there was a large pocket, which contained the bag and these articles in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was walking to London—there was another female walking, and she asked me what time it was—I said I did not know—she then asked me to hold this bag while she tied her boot lace—we walked on till we came to a large gentleman's house—she said, "Will you wait here? I want to go ill; "and I said, "I want a sister of mine, but I don't know where she lives"—I gave her a description of her, and she said she would</p>

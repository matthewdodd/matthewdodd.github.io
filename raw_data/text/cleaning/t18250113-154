The prisoner came to lodge with me on Thursday, the 2d of December; he took the second floor back room, and was to pay 5 s. per week; he left on Wednesday, the 7th, without any notice: I missed this property, which was locked up in a drawer in my bed-room, adjoining his room. I had seen the drawer safe locked on the Wednesday, and I found it broken open and the property gone next morning; the coat was in my first floor front room. I went up to clean myself at ten o'clock on Wednesday morning, and the prisoner opened his door, and put his boots out, and said</p>
               <p>"Will you get my boots cleaned?" I locked my own door and went down, and gave the boots to the servant. I went up again to my room - the drawer was then perfectly right; he did not leave the house before I left on Wednesday morning - he went out afterwards; the coat had been in wear ever since last May - it was a great coat; I was at home about two o'clock, when the prisoner came home, and asked the servant to get him a mutton chop for his dinner, for which he gave her 6 d.; she went and got a beef-steak; I went out, then returned, and found the steak in the front of the fire - I asked why it was not gone up, and the servant said the gentleman is gone out.</p>

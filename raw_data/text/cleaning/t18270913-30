I had Dr. Bell's System of Tuition, and a piece of India rubber, in my outside coat pocket; I felt a hand at my pocket as I stood at the fire - I said to my friend, "I am robbed;" the book and India rubber were gone; and, on turning round, I saw the prisoner behind me - several persons were near me; as I attempted to turn round I received a blow - I do not know who it was from - the prisoner was close by me - I did not see my property about him, and have not found it - it was not him who struck me, I am certain.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and was in the prosecutor's company; he is training master for a central school. I was immediately behind him, and saw the prisoner with his hand in Edgcumbe's pocket; he said, "I am robbed;" and I attempted to seize the prisoner, but a blow, which Edgcumbe received, prevented me - he then made his way through the crowd; I did not lose sight of him - Edgcumbe seized him; he was given in charge, without being out of my sight - we were under a lamp, and I was nearly touching him when his hand was in the pocket.</p>

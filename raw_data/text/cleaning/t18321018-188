            . I am a Policeman. On Wednesday, the 3rd of October, about one o'clock, I met the prisoner at Highbury, driving three beasts - I told him there was no thoroughfare for cattle through Highbury-park; he had another man with him - he told me he was going to Whitechapel-market with them, and had brought them from Mr. Matthews, the Bull and Butcher, at Whetstone; he said he was a stranger at the place, and the man at Holloway toll-gate directed him to go that way, as the nearest; he then asked the nearest way to Church-street, Stoke Newington - that would be out of his way to Whitechapel; I followed him to Islington station-house - I then took him into custody, and he there said several people at Islington knew him; he mentioned two persons, and I took him to Mr. Mason, a salesman, who said there was a Mr. Matthews, a butcher - I then took him to Mr. Stringfield, in Whitechapel market, who he said was his master, and when I got opposite the shop he ran away - I pursued, and took him; I left the cattle at Mr. Laycock's, at Islington, and was present at Hatton-garden when Pocock claimed them - the prisoner sent the other man back to the station-house, for something he said he had left there, and I never saw him afterwards; he said he had employed that man to help him, as the cattle were wild - the prisoner gave his name as Harris, but at Hatton-garden said it was Abbott.</p>

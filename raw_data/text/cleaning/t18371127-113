                  </hi>. I am in the employ of James Francis Thompson of Crown-street. At half-past six o'clock, on the 6th of November, I was behind my counter, and saw Prince come into the shop, and take this gown off the bar—I went round the counter after her—she walked to the door, and gave it to the other prisoner, who walked on—I accused her of taking the gown off the bar—she said she did no such thing, but she was looking at a pocket handkerchief—I left her with one of our young men, and followed Dempsey, who crossed and went to a shoe-shop—I asked where the gown was—she said she had no gown, and had not seen her friend—I went for a policeman, and while I was gone, the policeman of our beat came, and found the gown where I had seen Dempsey—I did not we Prince give it her, but I saw her turn round and speak to Dempsey, and then, when she turned round, Prince had not got the gown—the gown was found at the shoe-shop where I saw Dempsey go to—no one but Dempsey could have put it there—I did not see Prince pass any thing to Dempsey, because her back was to me—I know no one else took the gown, became no one else was at the door, and I went after her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prince. Q.</hi> What is the reason you did not take the gown from me, if you saw me give it to Dempsey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came to you and asked you for it—you said you had no gown—there were persons in the shop, but I saw her take it off the bar, and walk to the door.</p>

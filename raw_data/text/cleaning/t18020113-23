Parkes's, Broad-street, St. Giles's: On Monday morning I went there, and found them; the weight of them was one hundred two quarters and twenty-one pounds; I desired to see Mr. Parkes, and after a communication with him, I gave directions, in case any more were brought, to let me know: On the 31st of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was sent for; I went and saw the two prisoners at Mr. Parkes's with 162 shoes, weighing one hundred three quarters and seven pounds; they were taken to Marlborough-street.</p>

             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Parkes, ironmonger: On the 31st of December, the prisoners brought a parcel of horseshoes; they came together about seven o'clock in the evening; the shoes weighed one hundred three quarters and seven pounds; I know the vmen well from having been there on the 18th of the same month; I sent up to Messrs. Moorcrost and Field's, as I had been directed to do; they were asked where they brought the shoes from; they said, they brought them from Paddington, from one Morris; a little time after, Messrs. Moorcrost and Field came to the shop; they were to have thirty shillings a hundred for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Field. I know these shoes to be mine; they are marked with the letter M; the shoes are made by two different people, each has his own mark.</p>

            Have you never said that you believed this man's son was the person who had stole them, and these people the persons who disposed of them? - A. I may have said so, but not that I know of.</p>

            Do you not now believe your servant who has run away, was the person who stole the shoes? - A. I have no doubt but he had something to do with stealing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he had the whole to do with the stealing of them? - A. That I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Jones. I have no doubt of these shoes being Messrs. Moorcrost and Field's.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You missed them from time to time, so that it must be some person who had the opportuinty of frequently taking them? - A. That night we found the yard-door open, and the shop-door open.</p>

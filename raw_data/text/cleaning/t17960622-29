               <p>Q. And perfectly sober? - A. Yes; and perfectly sober; I went to my lodgings, and they were gone to bed; then I went down the street to see if I could find a public-house to sleep, and who should I meet but this person, and she persuaded me to go home with her to her lodgings; I took particular notice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220053"></xptr>of my watch when I went up to bed with her; she opened the padlock to go in and she struck a light, and asked me to strip and go to bed; I took particular notice of my money and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular reason for taking particular notice? - A. Yes; I thought I might get into bad company, and I wished to know; when I went to bed with her I gave her two shillings; I had twenty-seven shillings in silver all but half-a-guinea, which was in gold; I wound up my watch at eight o'clock while I was in the public-house; I pulled off my breeches and put them under the pillow, I am sure the watch and money was in them at that time; I slept with her some part of the night; I missed her between four and five in the morning, I awoke at that time, and got up, and went for a constable, I was not away above ten minutes; and when I came back, I found the same padlock upon the door that there was when I first went with her; the constable tried to find her all day of the Sunday, it was on the Saturday night that I went with her; we could not find her, and then I employed some officers; and Mr. Longden found her on Monday morning, and she was committed to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at the Magistrate's? - A. Yes; I saw her there, and from there she was committed to Newgate, that is three weeks ago last Monday; I have not seen my watch nor money since.</p>

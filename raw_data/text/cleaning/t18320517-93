            . I am thirteen years old - I live with my father, who keeps the Three Tuns. I recollect this witness and the prisoner coming in; there was a dark great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170066"></xptr>coat in the room - I do not know where it laid, but I saw the prisoner come out with it under his arm, and go away.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANNING. I am a traveller. I was at the Three Tuns, and saw this lad come in with two or three persons, and go into the tap-room; I was at the bar, taking a glass of ale; one of the men came out of the tap-room, and asked for a hard brush - the landlady turned to get it out of a locker, and while she did that one of the men went off with the coat; I consider the prisoner was one, but I cannot swear to him - I could to the man who asked for the brush.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGGINS (Police-constable F 35). I was in a house about a month after this - I heard the prisoner and some others talking about a coat, and I took him on suspicion.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I received information from Nisbett that he had seen some boxes pass between the prisoners; I took Scammell first, and asked him what he had done with the boxes which he had - he said he had had no boxes; I mentioned about some being taken from a tobacconist's in Gray's Inn-lane - he still denied it; I then said he had sold some to Shepherd - he said he had sold him five for 9d.: I sent for Shepherd, who denied having any, but when I told him Scammell had acknowledged he had sold him some, he said he had bought five of him; he then took me to a house, and gave me five, and when I got him to the station he told me there were two more at his house - I went there and got them; he sells greens and other articles about the streets.</p>
               <p>Shepherd. Q. Did you ever see me do any thing wrong, or idle my time? A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES TILT. These are my boxes. I put eighteen boxes on one side of my window that morning, and eighteen on the other; I lost fifteen of them in the evening - a piece of glass was broken out of my window; it had been mended, but the piece was quite firm in - these are worth seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Scammell's Defence. Shepherd bought them not knowing them to be stolen; I told him I had found them.</p>
               <p>Shepherd's Defence. I bought them, but I declare I never knew they were stolen.</p>

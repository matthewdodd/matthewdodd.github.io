                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live at No. 110, Blackman-street, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. I left my coat hanging in the counting-house at ten o'clock on Thursday night, the 17th of April—there was a letter in the pocket—the coat and letter now produced are what I left there—I was not the last up that night, nor the first up the next morning—I looked at the skylight over the counting-house the next morning, and part of the frame of it was broken—they had first broken a square, and opened a small light, and then opened the skylight, and got in—I missed the coat which had the letter in it.</p>

I saw the skylight safe on the night of the 17th of April at ten o'clock—I was the last person in the shop—I locked the shop, and all was safe—there was a half-sovereign, three shillings, nine groats, thirty-six pence, and twenty-four bal£ pence in the till—I awoke in the morning about six o'clock, and went down a few minutes after—I then found the skylight broken—they had entered the shop, and taken the money from the till, and I missed two coats from the counting-house—all the drawers in the counting-house had been broken open, and the papers were all about the floor.</p>

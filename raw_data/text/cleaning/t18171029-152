I lodged in the back garret, and the prisoner, Jones, lived in the front garret, with his father. On the 27th of October, I came home between one and two o'clock and found my door unlocked; I went out a little before eight o'clock. I am certain I had locked the door - I locked it again, and went out at two o'clock; I looked round my room and saw a box open - I thought I might have left it open myself; I did not know that anything had been taken. I returned a little after ten o'clock at night, and saw my landlady, and told her that my door had been opened. I went up stairs without a light, took the key to open it, and found it again unlocked; I struck a light and saw a small mahogany box, where I kept my money, placed on the table - I looked round my room and missed a clean shift, which I had placed on the bed. I went to the landlady and told her what I had missed, and staid with her till her husband came home; we went up stairs, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. The landlady found that the door had been forced-the edge and the door-post had been broken-it had not been forced with any great violence. The next morning, the prisoner, Jones, was taken up.</p>

            . I live on the second floor in the house. On Sunday morning, Mrs. Payne told me she had been robbed, and told me to take notice of anybody who came down; I was sitting in my room and heard a great noise at her door, up stairs; I went out, went up a few stairs, and saw the prisoner, Jones, opening her door with a fork - I ran up and called out, "here is the thief!" he ran into his mother's room - I took him back and shewed him the fork, which he had left in the door; he at first denied having been near the door - He then acknowledged he had been there twice the day before. I sent for Mrs. Payne - She gave him in charge.</p>

            . On Monday morning, the prisoner, Jones, brought me down a pair of stockings, and asked me if I knew where I could go and sell them; I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290050"></xptr>I thought Mrs. Sullivan would buy them; I took them to her - He said he would wait at the chapel steps, in Peter-street, while I took them to her - She had only got two-pence halfpenny. I came out - He gave me an halfpenny out of it. He went up stairs again and brought down a shift and an apron - I took them to Sullivan, she was going out with her milk pails, she went in doors and took them - She had no halfpence - She was to give me 4d. for the two. He went up stairs again and brought down a pocket-book, we took that down as far as Peter-street, and he waited at the corner of the chapel steps; I came back again to him with the pocket-book, gave it to him, and said I would have nothing more to do with it; I told him I would give him the halfpenny back to-morrow. He went home, and I also went home; Jones threw the pocket-book into the brewer's cellar, at the sign of the Cock, in Cock-court. I took two pair of stockings to Sullivan, the first time.</p>
               <p>EDMUND PEPPER. I am a constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoner, Jones, into custody; he said Manley had encouraged him to rob the prosecutrix - He said Manley asked him if there was anybody, who lodged in the house, that went out to work, and he told him, yes; Manley then said, "what a fool he was that he did not break open the door and rob them," and that Manley said he would bring him a bunch of keys if he would unlock the door-but as he could not procure the keys, he persuaded him to break it open with a fork; and that he brought the things down, and gave them to Manley, who took them to Sullivan's, in Peter-street; he afterwards saw him, and he refused to give him any money for what he had received for them. He described Manley to me, and I took him - He denied it before the magistrate, and afterwards confessed he had carried the thigns. Plank and I went to Sullivan's, and found her husband, intoxicated, by the fire; as soon as we entered the apartment there was a sort of an alarm; young Sullivan was melting some pewter, which we thought were pots - He ran under the bed and hid himself. Plank found a pair of stockings in the room, which was claimed as part of the property; when the prisoner, Sullivan, was brought to the watch-house, the shift was found on her back.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mrs. Sullivan's, in Peter-street; she placed herself in the door-way - I was under the necessity of forcing myself in; her eldest son ran to the bed and put something into it; I put my hand in, and found it was hot pewter. I searched a box, and found a pair of stockings - I asked her how they came there? she said a boy had left them with her son the day before; I asked her where the shift, apron, and other things were that he had brought; she said she knew nothing about anything, except the stockings, which were left with her youngest son; I found her youngest son, and asked her if that was him, she said, "yes;" he said nobody had left any stockings with him - I took her to the office. I desired the prosecutrix to look at the shift she had on her back; she immediately called out, "she has my shift on her back." I made her take it off.</p>

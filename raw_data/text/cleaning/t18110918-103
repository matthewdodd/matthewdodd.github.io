On the night of the 7th of August, between eleven and twelve, when I went to bed, the chapel was secured. A little before five in the morning I was disturbed by a door slamming, I got up and found the prisoner in custody of Mr. Shubirt and two of his apprentices.</p>
               <p>Q. In the chapel did you find any of the things removed from where they ought to be - A. Yes, I saw them the night before in their places, the looking glass standing over the chimney, the fire irons in the fire place in the Vestry. I found them in a pew in the meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your husband live there with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the windows were broken open - A. A shutter was broken open, and a square of glass was broken. I had fastened the window on the Sunday night myself, and it remained shut till the Thursday morning.</p>

            . I live about one hundred and thirty yards from the chapel. On the morning of the 8th of August, a little after four I called up my apprentices, I went with them to to this chapel, I found one of the shutters open, I entered the meeting door, we saw the prisoner coming up the aisle; we found the door open, and went inside, the prisoner was coming up the aisle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180042"></xptr>as we went down I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any marks of violence - A. I did, there was marks of a crow on the door of the vestry, and at the window, we found the crow about twenty yards from the place, and the crow fitted the marks exactly; I saw the prisoner jump in the window like a bird. This is the glass that was in the vestry, and these are the fire irons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up early that morning, and was going towards Bow, and going across the fields it rained very hard; I went up to this meeting-house-door for shelter, seeing the window open I looked in my hat fell off; I instantly jumped in. Mr. Shubirt met me, and asked me what business I had there; I said I had no business, if you think me a thief, send for a constable and search me; I was searched, and no property found; I have nails in my shoes, and jumping in the window to get my hat, my foot slipped, and by that means my elbow broke one of the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Shubirt. Did it rain hard - A. It rained a little.</p>

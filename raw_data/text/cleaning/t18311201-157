I came from Trowbridge, Wilts, and at the time in question, lodged in Castle-street, Westminster.

            . I am a Policeman. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of 4s.; he had walked on a little way - I went, and overtook him- I found 7s. 6d. in his left-hand waistcoat pocket; I am certain he was sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money was my own; I had been to my sister's, in Tothill-street, but she was out - I asked a man, who sold fish by Storey's-gate, my way; this man said he would show me - I had a bundle under my arm; he asked me to let him carry it, which I did - he said he was in great distress, and had been out of work eleven weeks; I put my hand into my pocket to give him some halfpence, and dropped a shilling; he put his foot over it, and pretended to be looking for it, but I took it up; he stopped in the Strand, and said, "Are you not going to give me something to drink?" I said not till I got home; (I got a friend to go to Castle-street, but he could find no such person;) he bid me good night, and in about ten minutes two Policemen charged me with robbing him.</p>

On Sunday, 7th Nov., about the middle of the day, perhaps 2 o'clock, the prisoner called and asked me for change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said I would see if Mrs. Goulding could give him change, I came back and told him we could not, we were very much troubled to get small change up the Hill, and it did not suit to give him change—he said he wanted it because he had a new situation in view, and he was engaged—(I had before that given him money from Mrs. Goulding)—I did not change the note, or send him anywhere to get change—I did not know that he was going to get change—he left, and within an hour afterwards returned, and said he would pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards the debt he owed Mrs. Goulding, which he paid to me.</p>

On Sunday, 7th Nov., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my bar; the prisoner came in and asked me if 1 could change a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for Mrs. Goulding—I told him I could—(Mrs. Golding lives near me, and is a very charitable lady, making gifts on Sundays)—I gave the prisoner nine sovereigns and two half sovereigns, and he put this note on the counter—I asked him to put his name on the back of it, and he wrote this "P. Goulding" on it—he had a glass of ale and a cigar, for which he changed one of the half sovereigns, and then left—I paid the note into the Excise-office next day (Monday), and on the following Saturday it was returned to me stamped" Forged"—the prisoner was dressed quite differently to what he is now, he was quite respectable then, and wore a black coat, waistcoat, and cravat—I wrote nothing on the note, but can swear that this is the signature he put on it.</p>

About the beginning of the second week in Nov., between 9 and 12 o'clock in the morning, a person very like the prisoner, but differently dressed, came and asked me to change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I have no doubt in my own mind that the prisoner is the man—he had the note in his hand; I said, "Who for?"—he said, "For Mrs. Gassiott, over the way"—I asked him to put Mrs. Gassiott's name on it, and got him a pen and ink inside the bar; he wrote "G. Lomax" on the note, and I gave him five sovereigns, I think, for it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); this is the person's writing on the back; there was no other writing on it at the time—I kept it till 12th Nov., and then paid it to Mr. Haddock, Messrs. Young and Bainbridge's collector, and it was returned to me on 16th, with "Forged" printed on it—I was standing behind the bar, saw the man coming in, and thought it was Mr. Gassiott's butler, and looked particularly at him, because Mr. Gassiott's butler wears a white neck handkerchief, and the man who came wore a dark one—it was not Mr. Gassiott's butler, and I have no doubt in my own mind that the prisoner is the man.</p>

On the 8th of Septemper, I went to No. 4, Thames-street, Greenwich—I entered at the front door—I did not see either of the prisoners there—there is a gate at the side of the house, large enough for a cart and gig to go under—on going it at that gate, I found a shed with an earth floor—on examining the door, I found a piece of brass at the side, and a write attached to it at one end, and the other end attached to the latch—on pressing my foot against this brass, part of the door flew open, large enough to admit a man—I turned into the middle shop, and on examing the floor, discovered a trap-door which led into a vault under the shed—the trap was made in a slanting position, so that a man might slide down on his back; and in the vault I found a large quantity of sheet copper—on weighing it, I found one ton eleven hundredweight and a half of copper, and three ton three hundred weight of sheet lead, and this flanch—all these were in the vault—I after<lb></lb>wards went up stairs, and in a small chest of drawers found a quantity of Writing-paper—the drawer was not locked—there was a shop in front of the premises, being fitted up as a plumper and glazier's—I did not perceive any name written up in front.</p>

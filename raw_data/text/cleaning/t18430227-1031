                  </hi>. I am carman to James Scott Smith, and George Smith. About two o'clock, on the 9th of Feb., I had a wagon at the White Swan-yard, Mile-end—I had a copper can then—I went on to Thomas's-street, Whitechapel—some one gave me information a little after three o'clock, and the can was gone—I went to Traling's house—I saw him, and told him I came to search for a can—he said I might search, he knew nothing about it—I and the officer searched, and found the can in an ash-heap, covered with ashes—it is copper—it was beaten in this way when I found it, but was quite sound when in my wagon—I can swear to it as my masters'—it has his name and number on it—it is worth two guineas when new.</p>

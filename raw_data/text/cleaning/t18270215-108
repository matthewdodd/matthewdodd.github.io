On the 28th of December the prisoner carted some potatoes for me, to Mrs. Mahoney, at Poplar - I told him if I did not meet him at Poplar, he was to receive the money for them, and take care of it for me; I had not entrusted him with money before. I found the team left at the Coach and Horses public-house, with a man, and he had absconded; he was apprehended in about a month - he was my weekly servant.</p>

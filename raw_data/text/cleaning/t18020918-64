               <p>WILLIAM BRYANT sworn. - On the 17th of August, I was coming from Knightsbridge, and went to the sign of the Turk's-head, in a street that goes up to Bloomsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay any time in this public-house? - A. Yes, it was about half-past eight when I came out; when I went in, I called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you? - A. Three or four pints, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober when you went out? - A. I cannot say I was sober, because I had been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner? - A. He was in the same public-house, in a corner, all the time; he wanted to introduce himself to me, and I told him several times to keep his own company, and he was not content with that, but he took up the pot and drank; when I went away, as I was going out, the door was half open and half shut, when the prisoner passed me; and as he passed me, he put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and took hold of a silver watch that I had in my pocket, and a pair of silver buckles; I took hold of him directly, and he strucke me; he used very bad expressions, and said, if I did not let him go, he would have my life; I struck him several times myself; two more then came up to his assistance, and he got away; he ran down the street, and I after him, and the watchman caught hold of him; then some others endeavoured to rescue him from the watchman, and he ran into a public-house, in St. Giles's, the Black dog; I pulled out my handkerchief to wipe the blood off my face, and the prisoner run up stairs; in about two minutes, I went up stairs and found the prisoner undrest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch and buckles? - A. No; the man that came to his assistance, ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were about a dozen girls of the town in the house, and he was handing the watch and buckles about to the girls.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any women with you at this public-house? - A. No; there was nobody with me any part of the time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180033"></xptr>Q.Did you pull out your watch at all? - A. Yes, once, to see what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CROCKER sworn. - I am a patrol belonging in Bow-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the street, when Bryant was pursuing the prisoner? - A. No; I was coming down Bowl-yard, and, at the Black-dog, I saw a number of people round the door; I heard a young man had been robbed; I went into the house, and asked the landlord where the young man was; he was in the bar; I went up stairs, and in the room, behind the chair, I found the prisoner, with his coat, waistcoat, and shirt off, fitting down upon the ground, in the room, there was part of an old black coat and an apron; the prosecutor identified him immediately; I took him into custody, and searched him, but found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bryant.) How was the prisoner dressed at the publie-huose, where you were fitting? - A. The room was dark, it appeared to be a dark coat, and a black apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty with Roberts, on the night of the 2d of January, about a quarter to five o'clock in the afternoon; we saw the prisoner in Oxford-street, with two others, about his own size; they were in company; we watched them some time, and saw them following carts and waggons; we followed them down St. Giles' to near King-street, where there was a dray; the prisoner bent down under it; he came away, and went on to the corner of <placeName id="t18280110-123-crimeloc638">King-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You saw the prisoner give it to him? A. Yes - I only found 7d. on the prisoner - I had seen him put the bundle and umbrella against the bricks, before he put the prosecutor against the bar; he did not appear to be taking care of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you meet him? A. I think about a quarter past five o'clock - I remember him perfectly - I do not remember saying I had not got my watch - I drank nothing after I met the prisoner - I remember his face well - I might give him the watch.</p>

            . I am a gentleman's coachman. I heard a noise, and found the officer holding the prisoner; they appeared to be struggling, and were both out of breath - I assisted, and as soon as I collared the prisoner, he asked the officer to show his authority, which I believe he did; he said at the watch-house, that if the officer would swear he had the watch, he would swear any thing, and denied having had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you understand by that, that he denied having had it? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Hampstead, and met this gentleman in Holborn; he ran against me - I said,"My friend, you are rather intoxicated;" he asked me to see him as far as I was going; he took his own road; he dropped his bundle - I took it up, and placed it towards his arms; he said carry it for me: he dropped his umbrella - I took that up - I left him in Gray's Inn-lane, and the officer took me.</p>

                  </hi> My husband is a baker, on Clerkenwell-green. On Thursday, 11th Nov., the prisoner came and asked for a penny loaf—he gave me a good half-crown—I put it into the till—I gave him two good shillings, and was going to give him fivepence in halfpence—he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "I beg your pardon; I find I have a penny in my pocket I did not know of"—he put down two shillings—I took the penny up, and gave him the half-crown—as soon as he was gone, I found one of the shil<lb></lb>lings was bad—I called after him—whether he did not hear, or did not wish to come back, I do not know, but he did not come—I went about five doors after him, took him by the collar, and brought him back—I said, "You have changed one of my good shillings, and given me a bad one; you must come back with me"—he said, "I gave you a good half-crown"—he repeated that several times—I said, "Yes, and I gave you two good shillings, and you have changed one, and given me a bad one"—he said, "Any person might make a mistake"—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody—I gave the constable the bad shillings—the prisoner was remanded till Saturday, and then discharged.</p>

On the 5th of July, about three o'clock in the day, I was coming into the passage; I saw the prisoner going along the passage towards the street door. I halloaed out to her to stop. She had a bundle with her. She stopped in the passage. I called a man to stop her; she went away a few steps from the door; the man made her come in. She had still the bundle on her arm. I examined the bundle. The articles all belonged to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This gown is mine. She came down stairs with this apron tied before her; two tablecloths are mine; a pair of stockings, two shirts, and three shifts, and one coat, that is mine, and the shawl is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these things been - A. They were taken from a closet in the two pair of stairs front room. I never saw the prisoner before. I asked the prisoner where she found them things; she said, a tall man in black gave them to her. I had seen the things safe in the morning. I asked the prisoner a second time where she got the property; she then said, are they yours? I said, yes, they are mine.</p>

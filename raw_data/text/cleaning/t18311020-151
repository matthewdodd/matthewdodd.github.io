            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday morning, the 9th of October, about half-past five o'clock, I saw the prisoner come from the area gate of No. 26, Seymour-street, Euston-square - he dropped a little white parcel, then took it up again, turned round, saw me, and ran off; I followed, and saw him throw something over into the area of an unfinished house, in Drummond-street - I sprang my rattle; he ran down a mews, got over four walls, into the carcase of a house, and escaped - I went back to the area, and found three pairs of stockings in a cloth; I went to the prisoner's house the same day, in plain clothes - I knew where he lived; he was denied- I then sent another person; he was denied again - I found him on the Tuesday night, at the Rising Sun, Somers'-town; he said he was innocent - I am sure he is the man; I knew him perfectly well before - I took him to the watch-house; he had two pairs of trousers on, and between them I found a pair of stockings - he said somebody must have put them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not pass close by him at twelve o'clock that very day? A. I did not - I have not asked any body what kind of a person he was - he had blue trousers and a blue coat on; I had no quarrel with him that night; he did not throw a piece of tobacco-pipe at me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any mark on the last pair? A. They are marked T. R., and belong to the same family as the others.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. -On Saturday fortnight, at half-past twelve o'clock, I saw him dreadfully intoxicated, and tried to get him in, for fear he should get into trouble with the Policemen; Taylor, who lives in my first floor assisted, and his brother, who is out of town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you succeed in getting him in? A. I got him in about two o'clock, and it was near half-past two when I came out, leaving him dreadfully intoxicated - he had not any sense in him.</p>
               <p>JAMES POSFORD. On my solemn oath, the prisoner did not throw any pipe at me; I was with another person, but I saw no pipe at all - I did not attempt to take hold of him between eleven and twelve o'clock - if I wanted him I could have taken him; my serjeant was with me - he was sober at half-past five o'clock in the morning, when I saw him with the property; the two witnesses sent to the prosecutrix, and offered her money not to appear.</p>

            . I live at 123, Newgate-street, I am a wholesale glover. The prisoner Cowling came to my house, on the 21st of January, he brought an order, as if coming from a customer of mine; this written order is one of my customer's cards</p>
               <p>"two dozen woodstock gloves, one dozen tan ditto, and two dozen coloured kid;" at the bottom it is,</p>
               <p>"let the mens be as near the size of the pattern as you can". I executed the order, and gave them to him, five dozen in the whole; this was between twelve and one o'clock. I knew the prisoner, he had lived with a customer of mine, a Mr. Tidcomb, of Knightsbridge; the prisoner delivered me the pattern; I delivered them to the prisoner as the order of Mr. Tidcomb. He came again on Monday, the 23rd, with this written order, as from the same person, for</p>
               <p>"three dozen of Norway ditto gloves, of different colours;" that I delivered also. I sent to Mr. Tidcomb; he said, he never received the goods, in consequence of that, I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>MR. TIDCOMB. I live at Knightsbridge. The prisoner never lived with me as a servant; he has been in the trade. I never gave him any order, or sent him to Mr. Uxley for goods, nor ever did I receive the goods; the order is not my writing.</p>

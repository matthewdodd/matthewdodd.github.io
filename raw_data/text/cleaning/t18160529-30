            . I lost this carpetting on the 9th of April, at about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; the door having been left on jar at that time in the morning, somebody got into the parlour where it was then, and stole it. In consequence of information, I saw a roll of carpeting on the seat of the privy in Mrs. Breadcult's yard; she pointed out a man to Harrison, who secured him; that was Greenwood.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Newell. On the morning in question, when I was in the kitchen, in consequence of hearing a noise in the passage, I opened the door, and saw the prisoner Martin going out of the ware-room, with a roll of carpeting on his shoulder; I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he told me my master had sent him for it. He went out at the door with it, the moment he got out he ran as hard as ever he could, and I went to the counting-house to my master.</p>

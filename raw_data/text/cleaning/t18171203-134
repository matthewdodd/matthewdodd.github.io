            . I am a bricklayer. On the 20th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Seymour-place; I was informed that thieves were in the house, I ran out, and found the prisoner, Kelly, in the custody of the watchman; I went to the house top, and apprehended the prisoner, Long, coming through the trapdoor, off the roof. He said, "I am one of them, do not hurt me;" the gutters were all ripped up, and part taken away. I found an axe within two yards of the place where I took him. The only way to the roof was getting up the rafters.</p>
               <p>JOHN YOUNG. The prisoners were catching birds in Bryanstone-square, I told them to go away-they would not. When I returned from dinner, I went to Seymour-place, and nailed a rail up, about two o'clock the door was broken open, the staple of the lock drawn, and taken away, no person had been in the ground but the prisoners. The same night I was going along Seymour-place, and the watchman took Kelly.</p>

            . I am a watchman. A little boy told me there was some persons in the house; I found it surrounded by a crowd; I went for my lanthorn, and returned to the house, and found the prisoner, Kelly, quite bloody; he said he came there to ease himself, and somebody had thrown a stone at him, and cut his face. I found the lead cut, in the house-as I returned I found Long was taken; I found an axe there, the head of which was bloody. It is an unfinished house.</p>

I went into the street, and saw a person look over the parapet wall - I gave the alarm; the watchman took Kelly, his face was cut very much-he must have fallen from the window.</p>

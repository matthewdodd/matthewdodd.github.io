                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Camberwell. On the 22nd of October, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening. I heard a noise in the shop—I went in immediately, and found the till on the floor—I had seen it about five minutes before—there was then five or six shillings in it—nobody had been in the shop after I saw it safe, to my knowledge—when I got into the shop I saw the prisoner outside the door, collared by the witness—he struggled to get away—the money was in the till, which was on the floor.</p>

I was standing close by the prosecutor's shop, at about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and saw a person go into the shop—it was the prisoner, I am sure—I watched him, and saw him reach over the counter, and take the till out—I stopped him at the door with it—I took hold of him, and he made his escape—I have not the least doubt of him, and swear positively he is the man.</p>

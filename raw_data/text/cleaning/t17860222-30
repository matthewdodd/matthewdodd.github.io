               <p>On Thursday afternoon the 9th of February, about five, the prisoner brought this piece of gold to me to sell, I asked him how he came by it, he said he had it of one Mr. Turner; I sent to Bow-street for an officer, he told me he met a man coming into town, who got him to sell it; but however, I heard the prisoner acknowledge before the Magistrate that it was his master's property.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made to him to induce him to confess the truth? - Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was present when he was examined, I heard him acknowledge taking the gold.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - No, Sir; so far I told him, if he would give up the other part of it, I would shew him all the favour that lay in my power, but that was after he had made the confession, I am very clear of it.</p>
               <p>How large was the whole piece? - Three ounces one penny weight, the whole value is better than ten pounds.</p>

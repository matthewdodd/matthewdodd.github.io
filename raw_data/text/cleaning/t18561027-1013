                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On the morning of 9th Sept., about 9 o'clock, I went to the house of the prisoner Clark, he in a marine store dealer, at No. 24, Dudley-street, St. Giles's—I saw Clark in the shop—I told him I wanted to speak to him in private, and asked him into a back room—on getting there I told him I was a police officer, and said, "I came in consequence of receiving information that you have received ft quantity of globes, atlases, and other things, from the shop of Mr. Wyld, No. 457, Strand"—he said, "No, I have not received anything of the wrt"—I said, "Yes, you have had them, and the globes were removed from your house with a horse and cart on Monday week last"—he hesitated some moments, and said, "Well, have you seen the old man that moved them!"—I said, "I want to know who brought them to your house"—he hesitated some minutes, and said, "They were brought by two respectable looking young men," and he said that himself and his wife were ill in consequence of their being in the place—I again asked him who brought them there, and to that he made no reply—I told him he must consider himself in custody on a charge of receiving that property, and on looking round that room I found aeveral articles that were stolen—I said, "These are stolen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270103"></xptr>
               <p>also"—he said, "Well, I don't know, I buy a great many things"—I called in Holmes and desired him to search the room that I and Clark were in—he did for a minute or so—he then went upstairs—he had not been up two minutes when he came running down with some parchment deeds in his hand, which had been partly burnt—he said in Clark's hearing, "They are burning the property upstairs"—I desired Buck, another officer, to go to his assistance—I then left Clark in charge of another policeman, and I went upstairs to a front room, occupied by Clark and his wife—I searched that room, and in a drawer in a chest of drawers I found this magnifying glass—Clark was taken to Bow-street station and charged with receiving the property which was then produced, stolen from Mr. Wyld on the morning of the 23rd Aug.—on the charge being read, he said he hoped we should deal as leniently as we could—he said the property had been brought to his house by a young man named Johnson, living at No. 14, Ashley-terrace, City-road—on 23rd Sept I went with Buck and Holmes to Harradine's place, No. 9, Bermondsey-street—he is a marine store dealer—I found Harradine in the back parlour with an elderly female—I asked him bis name—he told me it was Harradine—I told him we were police officers, and that we had come in consequence of his haying received a quantity of globes stolen from Mr. Wyld, No. 457, Strand, on the morning of the 23rd Aug.—he said it was a b—lie, and he endeavoured to take off his coat to show fight—I endeavoured to calm him, and told him to take it coolly and hear what we had to say—I said, "You have been dealing with these globes, you have been identified as being at St. John's Wood with them on the morning of the 15th Sept, and leaving them, directed to Mr. Wyld, at a receiving house for parcels"—he said no, he did not, he did not know St. John's Wood—I said, "The man has identified you"—he said, "I was at home all the morning "of the 15th; I left my house to come to Bermondsey-street; at 9 o'clock in the morning I left Dockhead, and came directly to my house, No. 9, Bermondsey-street, and remained there till 2 o'clock in the day"—I said, "You are in the habit of dealing with a man of the name of Clark"—he said, "Yes, I am, the last deal I had with Clark was for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 6th Sept."—I asked him if he had any book or document to show to that effect, and on looking at his file I found I a receipt for rags, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take it, I left it with him—he asked me I to leave it with him as it might assist his defence.</p>

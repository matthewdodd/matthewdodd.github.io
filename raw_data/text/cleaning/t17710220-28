He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200052"></xptr> first came and asked for a little beer; one of the clerks bid him go down stairs, and he bid the cook give him some: it was in the hard weather: he pretended to be a dustman. My master bid him sweep the door, and he would give him something. He confessed the fact afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Aspinall. He confessed that he took the spoon; but said, that he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he confessed it?</p>
               <p>Aspinall. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he disposed of it?</p>
               <p>Aspinall. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any favour if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Aspinall. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lutwich. I am a silversmith. The prisoner came to me with this spoon (producing it,) and said, that his wife had found it as she was sifting cinders on a dunghill in Tottenham Court Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce the spoon?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. No, not at first; he said, that his wife had found a spoon on a dunghill: I told him, that he should make some enquiry about the owner; he said, that it was so long as three days, and that he could not find the owner. I said, Let me see the spoon; he then went away, and came in about two hours after. He first came about five o'clock; he said, Here, I have now brought the spoon, if you will buy it of me: he then shewed it me: the bowl was all over wet mud; he stroked the mud out of it first, the other part was clean; I saw the crest of a castle on it: I said, Friend, I hope you came honestly by it; he said, Yes. I said, Sit down, my neighbour Castle has just such a crest on his plate. I bid my people take care of him: I went to Mr. Castle's; he said, it was his crest; I described the man, and they said, such a man had been there; they bid me stop the man, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about the spoon?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. I asked him how he could rob so good a friend; he said, he was sorry for what he had done; he cried, and said, he was in liquor, and hoped we would forgive him: he had offered it for sale at another silversmith's, but that person did not like any trouble, so he gave it him again; but I am determined to stop every thing that appears to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Court. Sir, we commend you; you are quite in the right.</p>
               <p>Q. To Aspinall. Look upon this spoon.</p>
               <p>Aspinall. It is my master's property; I know it by the crest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>

               <p>My lord, I was cleaning the street. I went and asked for a little beer; the cook gave me some victuals; the spoon was among the victuals; I held up my apron; the cook put it in: I had had victuals at several houses that day, so did not know at which house I had the spoon at; if I had, I would have carried it back.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lutwich. Did he tell you such a story as this?</p>
               <p>Lutwich. No; I am informed he is light fingered: I asked his master to appear for his character, but he would not.</p>

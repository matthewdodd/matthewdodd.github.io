I went out before the cart, to Mr. Wilson's, on the 14th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I received there, about one hundred and sixty pounds weight of silk, from Mr. Joseph Wilson; he himself gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you received it? - A. I put it into my bag; I had not the cart there at that time; I tied it up, and from thence I went for the cart; the silk was left at Mr. Wilson's; my fellow-servant came with the cart, and I put it in, and saw it locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure if is the same silk? - A. I am sure they were the same bags I had before tied up; but I cannot swear to the silk; Godfrey, my fellow-servant, drove the cart from there to the Dolphin, in Milk-street; Mr. Wilson lives in Wood-street; I went into the Dolphin first, in order to take up the load; I had a heavy load from there to put into my cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cart? - A. A covered cart, with doors before, and doors behind, painted blue all over; the doors were locked up, with a bolt and a pin, and a padlock, and that I saw locked up myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you saw the lock fastened? - A. Opposite Mr. Wilson's door.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a cart is your's? - A. A blue, covered cart; it was fastened with a double bolt outside, and bolted and barred in the inside; from there I drove to the Dolphin, in Milk-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it get safe to the Dolphin, in Milk-street? - A. Yes; it is close by Honey-lane-market; we have a room there; we keep our silk in that, we collect; and I went in to assist my fellow-servant with a very heavy load; I don't think we were absent five minutes; when I came out, I missed my horse and cart; I went back, and told my fellow-servant the horse and cart were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a horse with it? - A. Yes; it was standing still; the horse appeared to have been drove very violently indeed; it had stood there near three hours; about half past nine I examined him, and found he had been driven very hard; one of the reins was cut, on the right hand side of the horse; I examined the cart, and took the watchman and saw the cart had been broke open; then I came round and saw the name upon the cart, and I put the cart up at the livery-stables, and informed Mr. Desormeaux where his cart was.</p>

               <p>Q. In the presence of Graham? - A. Yes; I said, I would have nothing to do with it; and they went about their business; the next day, the 17th, I was taken up, and taken to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, in consequence of what passed between you and the Magistrates; you were set at liberty? - A. Yes; the next morning, Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of the prisoners afterwards? - A. Not at that time; I went to look for them to purchase it of them, the Sunday following; I saw

             in Holborn; I said to Graham, let us go into a public-house and have some rum and water; I then said to Graham, if he could help me to be the purchaser of that silk, I would give him five or ten guineas for his trouble; he came in the evening, between ten and eleven o'clock, with Wheeler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else come with them? - A. Not at that time; I believe, little Clements came with them, I cannot be positive; Wheeler said to me, if it had not been for Graham's recommendation, he would not have come to me; I said, never mind, I will purchase it of you, if I can; he said, I must give him half-a-guinea a pound; I said, if I could not get it for less, I would give half-a-guinea a pound; he said, I should have it the next morning at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Two o'clock; before it was light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he made this offer was Graham by? - A. Yes; Wheeler, Graham, and Clements, called me up at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Clements? - A. The least.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it Wheeler said to you? - A. He said, I should not have it only for Graham's recommendation; they came at two o'clock, and said, have you got the money altogether.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did they say that, on Monday morning? - A. Yes; I said no, I have not, I will not deceive you; I have got but 100l. if they would credit me till seven o'clock, I would borrow it; they would not do that; then, I said, I would have it in the evening; then I should have the money together; Graham came in the evening, and said, I am sent by Wheeler, to see all the money ready then; he saw the money; then he said, he had orders not to let the things go from the place where they were, unless I went and paid the money, as soon as they were in the coach; that I would not agree to: no, says I, you may depend, I will pay for them as soon as they come to my place, then Graham went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any of them again? - A. In the course of about an hour after, Wheeler, Graham, and Clements, came to my house; we went to a public-house, and had some drink together; and Wheeler said, why do you object to give me the money, when they are in the coach? I said, I would not buy them except they were brought to my house; then they agreed to call me up at two o'clock on Tuesday morning; at two o'clock on Tuesday morning, Graham, Wheeler, and Clements, came and knocked me up; at two o'clock I got up, and we went into a coach, in Oxford-road; there the coachman changed his coach, and we went over Westminster-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coachman? - A. I should know him, if I saw him: we went to one side of the Apollo, there the goods were.</p>
               <p>Q. These three persons called you up; did they leave you, or continue with you, when you went to the Apollo Gardens? - A. They went up to the house; then I saw Hooker, the middle man, and Joshua Wheeler, and Wheeler's brother, and there was another man, I cannot recollect his name; six in all.</p>
               <p>Q. What morning was this? - A. Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it, when you got to the Apollo Gardens? - A. Between two and three; they led me into a little house, near the place I mentioned; and there was eleven sacks of silk.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What little house, a necessary-house? - A. No; it was a small house; the house of George Wheeler; we were all there together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it was silk? - A. I felt it, it seemed so; I looked at some.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it manufactured or raw silk? - A. Raw silk; we all helped to carry it into the coach; I was the person who took the last sack.</p>
               <p>Q. They all assisted? - A. I did not take par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130081"></xptr>ticular notice who carried, but we were all employed; nobody could go in the coach, it was so full; I went on the box, and the rest followed the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the coach drive to? - A. Towards my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before this given information at the office, what you intended to do, when you were to be at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coach drive to your house? - A. Yes; I opened the coach-door, and my shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the persons that went with the coach? - A. They were all round the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the three prisoners were there? A. I don't know whether they were near; I stood at the door, and some were behind me;

             - we live in King-square. I am a bonnet-maker; I had been up nearly all the night, working for my mother - about a quarter before four o'clock that morning I looked towards a dust-hole, which led towards the back of Mr. Kent's premises, and saw two men, the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080109"></xptr>and another woman, at the dust-hole against the wall; the prisoner had one basket on her head, and another in her hand - each of the two men took a parcel out of the dusthole; one of the men took two parcels wrapped up in brown paper, and put them both into the prisoner's basket- her bonnet fell off; one of the men said, "Never mind your bonnet;" she said, "I must have it," and the other woman took it up, and put it on her head - the prisoner said to the men, "Now, you cut;" they all four went away together - the other woman carried the small basket to the corner of the court, and then the prisoner took them both again - I followed them down Horse Shoe-alley into Long-alley, and then gave information to a private watchman; he pursued them as far as Catherine Wheel-alley, Bishopsgate-street - I am quite sure the prisoner was one: there are two or three yards to cross from where the dust-hole is to the prosecutor's yard, but it will lead there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that a convenient spot to get to the prosecutor's house? A. They can get that way - it is about fifty yards off; all the four persons seemed to be engaged in the same transaction - it was day-light; they were not there more than five minutes before I followed them - the prisoner did not take the parcel from the dusthole; she stood about four yards off.</p>

            . On the morning of the 7th of May I received information, about half-past four o'clock that the prisoner had some property - I saw her carrying a basket, and another woman and two men with her - I met a private watchman, and he joined me in the pursuit; when they got to Bishopsgate-street, they crossed over towards Petticoat lane - when we came up to them they all ran; the prisoner was taken, with this property.</p>

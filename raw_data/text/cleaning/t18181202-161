I asked him what address I should put on it? He said he worked for Mr. Rotten, but that he lived at No. 3, Baldwin's-gardens. I knew Mr. Rotten, of Mount Pleasant, he is a large iron-founder, and lives about four hundred yards from me. I told him so, but do not know that he said he lived there. I asked the prisoner his name? He said Smith, No. 3, Baldwin's-gardens, which I wrote on the note in his presence, (looks at one) this is it. I beckoned to my wife, as I intended to have the first man stopped, who came to change a note, as I did not know a good one from a bad one, I did not suspect the note. I sent for an officer, Read came, and found 12 s. 6 d. in silver on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say his master's name was Robson, not Rotten - A. He did not, I could not be mistaken, as I mentioned the name again to him. The door was open, and he might have ran away.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Had you ever intimated to him any doubt of the note - A. None whatever; I am certain he said Rotten. I knew Robson also, he lives in Little Sutton-street.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 14th of November, I was sent for to the prosecutor's shop, took the prisoner into custody, and found 12 s. 6 d. on him, and 5 1/4 d. In his coat pocket I found a pound of lump-sugar. I inquired at No. 3, Baldwin's-gardens, for a person named Smith, but found no such person there. There is such a parish as St. James, Clerkenwell.</p>

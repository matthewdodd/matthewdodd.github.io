                  </hi>. On the 28th of March last I kept the Robert's Arms, Devonport-street, Commercial-road. I went to Gravesend on that day—I left a desk in my dining-room first floor—it contained eight sovereigns, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, some silver spoons, a gold chain, and some articles of jewellery belonging to Mrs. M'Beath—I returned on the 29th, and found that the desk had been removed into the bar parlour in my absence—I took it up stairs again where it had been before—on the Monday morning I opened it, and put in it two sovereigns and a silver snuff-box—on Tuesday, at four o'clock, I went to put in three more sovereigns, and the desk was gone—I called my wife and niece, and asked if they had removed it—I then spoke to the pri<lb></lb>soner, who was my potman, saying my desk was gone, and asked if he knew anything of it—he said, "No"—I gave him into custody—he was remanded, and kept in custody for a fortnight, and there being no further evidence he was then discharged—ray family consisted of myself, my wife, my niece, and the prisoner—we had no female servant—some time after I heard of the pri<lb></lb>soner being taken up—I had then let the house to a Mrs. Harris and removed.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living with my uncle, Mr. M'Beath, in Devonport-street, Commercial-road. I remember my uncle going to Graves<lb></lb>end—after he was gone the prisoner brought the desk down out of the upper room—he shook it, and there was a jingling sound—he looked at my aunt and said, "I can hear your locket and chain is here, Ma'am"—she said, "Yes it is"—he shook it again and said, "There is something besides that in here"—my aunt said, "Yes, all we are possessed of is here; if this desk was to go we should be ruined"—the desk was then put on the sofa—I did not see it opened—my uncle came home on the 29th, about ten o'clock, and carried it up stairs again—on Tuesday, the 2nd of April, he missed it—there was no one in the house that went into that room but my uncle, my aunt, the prisoner and myself—the prisoner slept in one of the bed-rooms up stairs—there was no female servant.</p>

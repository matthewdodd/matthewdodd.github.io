                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Newman Farquhar, of Abingdon-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner some time by his living as footman with Mr. Morrice, my master's relation, in the Regent's-park—the servants at the two houses became acquainted with each other—since he left Mr. Morrice's service he has been constantly, for the last three months, coming to my master's house—on the 9th of May I put the plate Into the chest—it had been taken out on the 8th for a party which my master had—I found it all correct by the lists which were in the plate-chest—it was the plate which Mr. Farquhar's mother had sent, and the lists were in Mrs. Farquhar's hand-writing—the prisoner was there when I put it away, and helped me to clean it—I kept the key of the plate-chest in a writing-desk over the stable—I kept it in my pocket for several days be<lb></lb>fore I put it away—he knew where I kept it—on the 10th of June I went to the chest, and missed the things—I did not find the same lists there as I had left there on the 9th of May, but two fresh ones in a different hand writing—one of the two other lists was in a young lady's handwriting, and the other was Mrs. Farquhar's writing—the plate left in the chest nearly corresponded with the lists that had been substituted—seventeen large spoons, eleven small forks, and other things had been taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did your master entrust you with the key of the plate-chest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did from the 8th of May till I missed the plate—I kept it in a writing-desk—the prisoner knew where I kept it, and where the plate was—no one knew but him, that I am aware of—I never put the plate away before any body but the prisoner—I never went to the plate-chest but this once—a man named Plum comes to see one of the female servants, and visits her down stairs—I do not know whether it is with my master's knowledge—he never forbad my having a friend to see me—I am not aware that he knew of Plum's visits—I was not always at home when he came—he generally came once a week—he might have come oftener—I am not acquainted with the man—I have spoken to him, no farther—I never sat and drank with him—I have seen him in the house for two or three hours together—I do not believe he has ever staid all night—he never visited me in the stable.</p>

               <p>prisoner was once in my service—I gave him a written character when he left, as I thought well of him—I know the man named Plum—he is a clerk in a house of business, and is a respectable person—I believe these two lists to be in the prisoner's hand-writing—I can have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often have you seen him write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very often—I have seen him write—I have had receipts from him—I have seen him write twice—once was about the beginning of 1838, when he brought me an account and signed a receipt, and once, about September, 1837, when he also wrote his name to a receipt, or it was brought to me with his name to it—I did not see him write it—he generally brought them ready written—I did see him write his name in 1838, and I may have seen him writing in the kitchen—I did not see what he wrote—I merely saw him using a pen.</p>

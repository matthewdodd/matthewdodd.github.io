            . The prosecutor and I were coming arm-in-arm along Fleet-street. A gentleman came and tap'd him on the shoulder, when near the Horn-Tavern, and said, a man had pick'd his pocket. We both took hold of the prisoner: soon after, the prisoner, took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and dropped it by his left side; I saw him do it. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>They took hold of me, and were going to carry me to the pump, in St. Paul's Church-yard: I got hold of his collar, and he of mine: I said it should not be done, without a right understanding for it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner was very resolute, and wanted to get away. I told him, if he would not submit quietly, I would take him to the pump: then he said, he would go to the watch-house, but before we got there, he offered to run away.</p>

On the 1st of March I was in the Old Bailey, about half-past four o'clock - I had come on a short stage from the White Horse cellar - I got off at the Bells Sauvage; I there pulled out my purse, paid 1s., tied the purse up again, and put it into my coat pocket - I was in my master's livery, and the pocket of the coat I had then on was behind; when I had got a short distance up the <placeName id="t18310407-93-crimeloc523">Old Bailey</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you were-sober? A. Yes, quite; I had no handkerchief in that pocket; it was rather a long purse - I did not hear the prisoner inquire for Mrs. Smith; I am sure it was the prisoner who picked up the purse - he went on his knees, and begged for merry; I saw a woman in the butcher's-shop, and I believe there was a woman on the stairs - it was the prisoner gave me the purse; I was asked at the Compter what I had in it, and I said I believed 1l. 8s. or 1l. 9s., and it turned out to be 1l. 8s. 9d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What was the distance from the place you were robbed at to those stairs? A. I should think about fifty yards - the stairs are in New-court.</p>

            . My husband is a stationer, and has worked for thirteen years in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. I saw the prisoner on the day in question; he came through my place which is like a thoroughfare - my house is at the corner of an alley, leading to New-court, and the private door is as public as the shop door - you go through a covered way; the stairs are on the left-hand side as you go through - I suppose ten persons had been through there within half an hour of the time the prisoner came; when the prosecutor came in, he first said it was a book, then he runimaged his pocket, and said it was a purse - my daughter found the purse on the stairs; I am quite sure she picked it up, and gave it into the prosecutor's hand - he shook the prisoner, and the prisoner drew himself back, and said he would not be shaken by him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you live up stairs? A. No, I keep the ground floor - my daughter is thirteen years of age; I have lived fifteen or sixteen years in London, and am the mother of six children; I never picked up a purse before - I never saw the prisoner or the prosecutor before; I did not cry "halves" - the prosecutor said he thought the prisoner's hand had been in his pocket; there was no other man in the place at that moment - the prisoner was standing by the prosecutor, and the prosecutor took hold of him and shook him; the prosecutor said it was his purse - I did not go before the Magistrate; I was not sent for - the prisoner did not stop in the passage till the prosecutor stopped him; he was going through pretty quick, as all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070058"></xptr>persons do - he said the prosecutor was mistaken, and begged he would let him go about his business, as he was deceived in the person; there was no person on the stairs: a great many people go through - it is not a regular thoroughfare.</p>

            . I am daughter of the last witness. I saw a scuffle on the 1st of March, and my mother called me to get a light to look about the passage, and the stairs - I found he pause, and gave it to the prosecutor, who had hold of the prisoner; I am sure the prisoner did not pick up the purse - I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who threw the purse there? A. I do not know; I was at my tea - my mother went forward first, and then called me to get a light to see if I could find a purse or a book, or any money - I looked on the stairs, and found a long purse with money in it; I could not find it without a light - the prosecutor said it was his purse; I saw the prisoner there - he kneeled down, and prayed for forgiveness.</p>

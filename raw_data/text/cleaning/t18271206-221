            . I am the daughter of George Weller. I shall be nine years of age in January - my uncle came and asked if my father was at home - I said he was gone out - he asked if my mother was at home - I said No - he said he saw my father go into the yard with a gig; he then went away, and came again and knocked at the door as hard as he could, and rang the bell, and said my father wanted his great coat, as he was going out with a chariot; I said my father was gone out post - he said his job was altered - he was going out with a chairot - he then ran up stairs, took the coat, and ran down.</p>

            . I received information, and took the prisoner on the Friday following; I asked if he knew any thing about a robbery at Mr. Gray's - I did not then know it was his brother; he laughed at me, and said, "Now I shall go to Newgate again for it, but I don't care; I shall get over it." I found three duplicates on him, but none relating to this coat; I then went down to Mr. Gray's, and found it was his brother.</p>

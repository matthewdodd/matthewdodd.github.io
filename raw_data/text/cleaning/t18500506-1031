                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth. On Sunday, 28th April, I was in Battersea-fields—I had been with two young men in a beer-shop the first part of the afternoon—the prisoners, and a man named Cooper, and another young man, were drinking with me—Hopkins produced 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards another pot—I refused to pay it—I had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a few halfpence in my left jacket-pocket, and a tobacco-box—I had not too much drink—I am sure I had the money—I left the house—the prisoners followed me about 200 yards, and the other man—they came up—Hopkins knocked me down—they <hi rend="italic">straddled</hi> me, and swore if I did not give them money they would rip my guts open—I knew Hopkins before—I managed to get to the tent, into the back part, and they pulled me out by my heels—Hopkins got a <hi rend="italic">libbet</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">cock-shy</hi> stick, about five inches round, and swore he would beat my brains out if I did not give him my money—I do not know which dragged me out; they were both together—Russell then got the <hi rend="italic">libbet</hi>, and swore he would knock my brains out—they pulled my handkerchief off my neck, and pulled off my shoe and my belt, and wanted to borrow a knife to get my other shoe off—about five children were there, who live in the tent—a little boy fetched his father to my assistance, and they left me—I went into the <hi rend="italic">jerry</hi>, but they had got there before me—I then missed my money, tobacco-box, handkerchief, shoe, knife, and cap—this is my cap and tobacco-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was knocked about the eye and face; my face was all over blood next morning, and it had swelled very much—I have known Russell's family about twelve months, she was in the beer-shop, but I did not see her when they came out after me—we could not find the handkerchief—the policeman gave me my shoe again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barnes'-common—my sister was living at Battersea-fields, in a tent, and I was stopping with her. On Sunday night, between nine and ten o'clock, I was in the tent with Joseph Cooper, Sarah Taylor, and two more children—I saw Hines about one or two hundred yards from the tent, and a man and woman with him—Hopkins is the man—it was a moon shiny night—they knocked him down, and dragged him along—he tried to get in at the back of the tent—my sister said, "Don't go in there; come in at the front—the two men pulled him out by the legs, hit him in the mouth, and knocked him down—Hopkins got a <hi rend="italic">straddle</hi> of him, put his hand over his mouth, took a steel tobacco-box out of his pocket, shot some money out of it into his hand, and gave it to the woman, who was standing close to his heel, and the other man asked Joseph Cooper for a knife to cut Hine's shoe off, as his foot was swelling—Cooper would not give it him, because he said he was robbing the man—he picked up a <hi rend="italic">libbet</hi>, and said if he did not keep quiet he would beat his b—y brains out—they took his handkerchief, strap, money, and shoe, and went away—Hines got up, and came to the tent—we took him to a beer-shop, and found the prisoners and the other man there—we told Cooper, who was there, that Hopkins had been robbing the man—he struck Hopkins, to make him deliver the money up, and then struck the other man, and Mrs. Land pushed them both out—</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am member of Parliament for Halifax—my estate was at Turnwood, in Dorsetshire—I have lately sold it—in 1845, during the season, I resided in John-street, Berkeley-square—I had previously resided in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square—when I left John-street I had some articles of furniture—I arranged with my valet to leave them on the first and second floors of his house, and I was to make use of that lodging until I got a new house—in Nov., 1845, having left my valet in the country, I hired the prisoner temporarily for the job as valet—he went out of town with me—I resided at the house of my aunt at Exeter, and afterwards at Cheltenham—I staid at my father's house there, and then came to London for a day, and then we went down to Turnwood—he was with me one month from some time in Nov. until Dec.—we returned to town together—I returned with my regular valet—the prisoner had his account paid at Turnwood, and parted with me at the Nine Elms station—I lost sight of him for some months, except seeing him once or twice in the street, I heard nothing of him for three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260020"></xptr>
               <p>months, I believe—I had delivered to me at the Traveller's Club, two or three, or perhaps four, small notes from him, requesting the loan of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I immediately destroyed them—I paid no attention to them—as well as my memory serves me I saw him in the street afterwards, and said I was surprised he did not know better than to write to me for assistance at the Traveller's Club, that any servant, however short a time he had been with me, ought to know that he should apply at my lodgings—about July last he called on me at my lodgings at Cottage-road, Chester-square—I do not remember what part of the month it was—I should say it was the end of July—I had some conversation with him—I do not think Sir George Hamilton's name was mentioned—he asked me for assistance, which I declined, alleging that I thought an able, smart, and active servant ought to have got a place if he chose, and I was displeased with his having written another letter to the Traveller's Club asking for a small sum of money, after I had forbidden letters to be sent there—I met him in the street in Aug. as I was going to the House of Commons—nothing was said on that occasion about Sir George Hamilton—he asked me to give him a written character—I said, "As long ail am in London any gentleman who pleases to apply to me will hear whit I have to state, that you have lived with me a month or six weeks, and, as far as I know, are a decent, respectable servant, I rather object to giving a written character; I will think of the matter"—while he was staying with me I rather believe I inadvertently gave him reason to suppose I had more power of getting him a place than I really had—he says so, and it seemed to be impressed on his mind—I forget how it arose—I said, "When a gentleman, a friend of mine, returns from abroad, if you are a good coachman or groom it may be in my power to recommend you, and I will do so"—Sir George Hamilton at that time was abroad—on the 3rd of Sept. he called on roe for a written character—I was in the act of writing it when he called to ask for it—he was bad up into the room—I delivered the character into his hands—this is it—it is dated 3rd September—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"James Newbery was engaged by me last winter to wait on me during my valet's absence. He served me at my then house in the county of Dorset, and travelled with me to Halifax, and when there be always conducted himself with perfect propriety, honesty, and sobriety during the two months he was with me, and I should think would make a superior and valuable servant—<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE</hi>, Cottage-road.") It in mistake about Halifax—at the time I wrote it I was under the impression that he had been with me longer than he was—I was anxious to give bio the benefit of the best testimony I could, having learned from him my character would be of considerable importance to him, as his late master bid failed and was out of the way—I made the best character I could—he received the character, and I was very much surprised that he did not thank me for it—he complained that I had not got him the situation with my friend, and I think he said I had recommended somebody else, that I had hired all Sir George Hamilton's servants, and one word from me could have got him a place, and that I had also bought his horses—my answer was that I had new hired a single servant for that gentleman, that unquestionably I had been ready to recommend him, but it was a question whether I could recommend him since that period, that I had given advice to the stud-groom with regard to sending horses abroad, but he might learn that I had not bought any horses for him, that Lord Villiers was the person who was employed to buy them—he repeated the same statement, doggedly adhering to his assertion—that gave me the impression that he was endeavouring to pick a quarrel, or that he was not in his right mind—(I have condensed the conversation)—as he went out of the room he said something, the meaning of which I could hardly under<lb></lb>stand,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184610260021"></xptr>
               <p>but which received its explanation from his subsequent conduct—he stood with the door half between him and me—he said, "I shall call at the Travellers'," or something of the sort—I think I went out of town, and did not go to the Travellers' that day—on the next day, the 4th, this letter was brought to me from the Travellers' Club—I believe it is the prisoner's writing—he has stated that it was—(<hi rend="italic">read—"</hi> Sept, 4th, 1846. Sir, I feel very much disappointed in not having the place with Sir George Hamilton, after having promised me; I should have thought, after what has passed between me and you, you would have got me the place; I shall go to the club, or clubs, which you belong to, and tell them what you are, which I can prove; I shall likewise let your father and mother know what you are, and likewise the public, and if you do not do something for me I shall acquaint a lawyer of it; you know very well what you wanted me to do to you; it is right the public should know who are these persons; you said that if I left my mistress you would do something for me; you have driven me to do what I have done, and you have acted very unhandsome to me; I can return to you, and if you do not answer by return of post I shall tell the committees of the clubs which you belong to, and if you like to vin-dicate yourself I am to be found in Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's; certainly I shall disgrace you; my address is, 'James Newbery, at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's' ")—on the receipt of that letter, (I am not very clear as to the dates,) as I was going out at that time, I took the name and direction down, and left the note at home—on my return from the City I stepped into Brooks's-club, and wrote a letter to him, which I did not send, because I thought I would condense it—I afterwards wrote this letter—I accidentally retained the draft of it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—</p>
               <p>" 12, Cottage-road, Chester-square, Sept. 4, 1846.</p>
               <p>"Some one has written, in James Newbery's name, a threatening letter to Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe that the letter is written by James Newbery. The letter is sent to Mr. Davis Protheroe's lawyer, who has orders to prosecute the writer, if necessary. Probably the letter is written to gain the benefits of a prison, or of transportation—one of which would certainly follow a prosecution; if this be the case, the writer's wish will not be gratified, as Mr. Davis Protheroe will treat this and all other letters with perfect indifference, and the writer may take what course he likes: it will not have any effect on Mr. Davis Protheroe. Mr. Davis Protheroe does not believe it comes from James Newbery, as only yesterday morning he received what alone he asked for—a letter of recommendation, testifying his good conduct when on a job in Mr. Davis Protheroe's service; and James Newbery only expressed some disappointment that he had not got a place as coachman to Sir George Hamilton; on which he heard, from Mr. Davis Protheroe, that he had never hired one servant for Sir George Hamilton, and had recommended James Newbery in the winter, when he thought he might suit the place. There being, therefore, no assignable reason, nor motive, for such an act, Mr. Davis Protheroe cannot believe the letter comes from James Newbery, who must be simply mad, if he wrote it. Mr. Davis Protheroe's answer to the writer is, that he will pay no attention to this or any other such letter. It is a threatening letter: threatening letters are punishable with im-prisonment or transportation, and nothing else will they ever get.—<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD DAVIS PROTHEROE</hi>. P.S. Mr. Davis Protheroe bad mentioned to James Newbery that letters should be sent to his house, and not to the Travellers' Club, out of kindness, as he thought it only creditable and respectable for a servant to seem to have the power of calling on a gentleman at his house. It is no annoyance (if annoyance is intended) for letters to be left at clubs: they</p>

               <p>are often lost, and the writer is the sufferer. Mr. Davis Protheroe's intention seems to have been misunderstood, and his good-will thrown away,—<hi rend="italic">To James Newbery.</hi>"</p>

D. Protheroe, 12, Cottage-road, Chester-square, Pimlico. Sir,—I have now done what I stated to you I should do: that is, I have wrote to one of the committee, which is Captain C. C. Berkeley, and told him my address, if he wished to see me, to state further particulars.—<hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES NEWBERY."</hi>—I staid a few days at Cheltenham-when I returned I was prepared, at that moment, to go abroad—I had my passport ready, but I received this letter, which arrested my progress—I wish, in reference to the last letter which was read, to state, that in the con<lb></lb>versation I had with him, he muttered something about writing to Mr. Berk<lb></lb>ley and the Travellers' Club—(<hi rend="italic">read)—"</hi> To the Gentlemen of the Tra<lb></lb>vellers' Club. I wish to inform you, E. D. Protheroe is guilty of that crine which is forbidden by God and man; I also consider it my duty to let the members know what sort of a man he is, for the short time I was with him I have convincing proofs of E. D. Protheroe; it is well known the steward of the other club which he belongs to lost his place, through accusing him of an unnatural offence, which I can prove he is guilty of; I sent him a letter on Thursday of what I intended to do, and what I have now stated in this letter; I hope the gentlemen of the club will take into consideration what sort of company they are in; if he E. D. P. likes to take me up, I am to be found at Mr. Collins's, Mason's-yard, Duke-street, St. James's"—on the next day I came to town late in the evening, and lost not a moment in ascertaining whether my solicitor was in London, and put the matter in his hands—on my solemn oath there is not a particle of truth in the assertions the prisoner has made against me.</p>

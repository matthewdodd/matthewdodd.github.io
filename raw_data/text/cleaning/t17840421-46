               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was coming through the city the day that Mr. Pitt was coming to dine at Grocer's-hall, we were about two thousand in company, standing and walking, there was a great crowd of people; I saw the prosecutor running, with his bundle over his head; says he, I have lost my money; a man came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270095"></xptr> laid hold of me; I suppose they judged because I was meanly dressed I took it; I am as innocent of it as any gentleman here in Court.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A <rs id="t17840421-46-deflabel269" type="occupation">shoe-maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17840421-46-defend646 t17840421-46-deflabel269"></join>; I have been but a fortnight in England, I came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>You are not an Irishman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of Ireland? - Broadie, in the county of Meath; I have nobody to speak for me, without it is your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have stood your own friend when you had it in your power.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the only doubt that arises in my mind upon the case is this, he is charged with having assaulted this man, and with having taken this purse by force and violence from his person; now whether it was a fact of that nature, or whether it was what I dare say the prisoner meant it should be, a picking of pockets only; I think that is the material question on this case, for there seems to be no doubt but he had a great share in the mischief, whatever it was: now if he laid hold of the man's bundle behind, and so pressed him backwards by force, and so took the purse out of his pocket, I think the indictment is proved, and it will constitute a robbery, because it is a forcible taking from the person; on the other hand, if when the prisoner was in the crowd, the prosecutor was thrown back, and his pocket was picked, that would be stealing, but it would not be robbery, because to make it a robbery, there must be some degree of force used on the person of the man from whom the property was taken; the prosecutor says, that force was used by the prisoner, and by some person who threw him back; if he did, that is as I told you, robbing him; if it was the other way, that would not be a robbery, but stealing; therefore, you will take that single point into your consideration: if you agree with the prosecutor, and think he was sufficiently attentive to what passed, to be able to know with certainty that the prisoner was the man that actually threw him back by his bundle, then you will find him Guilty of this indictment as here charged: if you think, from the situation he describes himself to be in, and the crowd that was there, that part is not sufficiently made out to your satisfaction, you may acquit him of the robbery, and find him Guilty of stealing only.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not the crowd press you? - He pressed me himself, he stood at my shoulder, as this man may do now.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you on the pavement or the highway? - On the pavement.</p>
               <p>Court. How near was the coach wheel to the pavement? - As close as it could get once.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you actually clear that the prisoner

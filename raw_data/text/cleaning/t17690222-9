About the latter end of January the prisoner's landlord, where he lodges, sent me word, he had charcoal, sea-coal, and wood, and on the Sunday he had made a great fire, which had alarmed some of his neighbours; they thought he had been doing something that he should not. I went up into his room, and found some of the remains of the things, some pearl ash, and between two and three pounds in money; upon which I imparted this to some of my men, and ordered him to be set about some work, and take particular notice what silver I gave him. I marked two pieces of silver, and put them into the window, between the bar and the casement, where he sat; he had not been at work from the Wednesday till the Monday following, and the Wednesday after I missed one of the pieces of silver. I told two of my men of it, and we went and found him at the Coach and Horses in Aldersgate-street: I charged him with having robbed me; he denied it: I said, You have some of my property about you; he said he had not. I desired him to let me search him; he consented, and pulled his clothes off in the presence of the people, and I found the piece of silver that I missed in the fob of his breeches. ( Produced and deposed to, by a hole made in it and being bent at one end.) I mistrusted him some time, by his earning so little and spending so much.</p>

            . On the 1st of February, between nine and ten in the evening, my master desired me to go with him to find the prisoner. We found him at the Coach and Horses in Aldersgate-street. When my master first charged him with stealing the silver, he denied it strongly, I believe for an hour. My master desired to search him; he did; and this piece of silver was found in his fob.</p>

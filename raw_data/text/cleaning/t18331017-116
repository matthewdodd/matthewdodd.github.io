            . I am an officer. On the 11th of October, I watched the two prisoners from Marylebone-street to St. James'; I saw them go into several shops, and at last Pearce went into Mr. Gooch's, in <placeName id="t18331017-116-crimeloc635">Curzon-street</placeName>

            . I was with this officer, what he has stated is correct - I took Gordon, and found this pair of silver spectacles in his hand, which I had seen him draw from his pocket; I said, "How do you account for these spectacles?" he said, "They are my own;" I said, "I suspect you took them from the brush-maker's shop in Curzon-street" - we went there, and I said to the prosecutor, "Sir, do you now miss anything?" he said "No;" I then said, "Sir, do you wear spectacles?" he said,"Yes;" I said, "Where are your spectacles?" he looked for them, and they were gone - I showed him these, and he claimed them as his.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW GOOCH. These are my spectacles; I think they must have been taken from my writing-desk.</p>

Having repeatedly missed goods and money out of the till; I was determined to find out the cause; and I went to Bow-street and got an officer, who examined the prisoner's box by my request, and found goods in it of mine, which formed part of those mentioned in the indictment. The box was locked, and the officer obtained the key from the prisoner. The prisoner slept in an adjoining room behind the shop. There were some of the things in the box, which I had missed six months before.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer, I went with Mr. Pitt to his dwelling house, on the 5th of April last. I saw the prisoner there, whom I searched; I found a silk purse on him with four pawnbrokers duplicates in it, and a box key, which he said belonged to his box. I brought the box to him, and gave him the key I have mentioned, and he opened the box himself, and part of the property named in the indictment was there. In a paper in his pocket were two other keys. I took one of them to his master's till, and found it opened it. He acknowledged that he had another box at his father's which had property of his master's in it, I took the prisoner with me to his father's, and there we found this box, which he acknowledged was his. The third key opened it. I found a quantity of hosiery of all descriptions in it, and at the bottom I found a piece paper with forty-nine pawnbrokers duplicates, the greater part for articles of hosiery.</p>

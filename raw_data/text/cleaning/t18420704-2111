On the night of the 24th of June I went to bed just before eleven o'clock—I was not the last person up, and did not fasten up the house—I was disturbed about half-past one—my master went down stairs first, and I went next—the kitchen-window was thrown wide open, and the window-shutters were thrown down—the shutters had been shut when I went to bed, and the window was fastened down—I found the area-gate was wide open—the policeman went and got a light, and went down stairs—we found all the kitchen-drawers, wide open—twenty-four shillings, two pence, and six halfpence had been taken out of the cook's drawer, and two pence and seven halfpence taken from a reticule-box on the shelf, and a small knife and a pencil—this was on a Friday night, and on the Sunday Bight following the prisoner was taken.</p>

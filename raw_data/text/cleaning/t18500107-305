                  </hi>. I live at 10, Albany-street, Regent's-park, and am a partner in the University Loan Society, which is held at 3, Gower-street North. The prisoner called there some nine months ago, and borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came again about 10th or 12th April, and wanted a further loan of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he applied for a form, for which he paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I told him to put down the name of the security, and it would be enquired into—he then left the office, taking the form with him—he called a third time, and brought a man with him who he represented as John Bolton, bis security for the loan—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was then granted, deducting five per cent. interest, and Bolton signed the note in the prisoner's presence—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner signed it and handed it to me—the payments were not duly made, and in conse<lb></lb>quence we endeavoured to summons Bolton, who had put his name as security—the prisoner then said the real Bolton did not sign the note, but he would endeavour to pay the money himself by instalments—he gave Bolton's address as 8, Church-row, Camden-town—I endeavoured to find him—there was no such person living there.</p>

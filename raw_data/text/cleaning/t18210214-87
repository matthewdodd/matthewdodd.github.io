            . On the 14th of February, I came out of the Royalty Theatre at half-past ten o'clock; Johnson and another girl followed me across to a public-house, and asked me to give them some beer. I stood drinking with them for half an hour - we had two pots of beer between us three and a companion of mine. My companion left, and I went with them to a house in Rosemary-lane; I got there about half-past eleven o'clock. The other girl took me up stairs, and I gave her 3 s., and 6 d. to get a pot of beer, she did not return for a quarter of an hour. Johnson stood at the door with me waiting for her to return. Holland and another man came into the street, and asked what was the matter; Holland said he would try to find her. She came back; the two woman and the two men then took me to a coffee-shop, a good way off; we had some coffee, which came to 8 d. - all sat in the same box. Holland took his watch out, and shewed it to me; he then asked to look at mine; I took mine out, he opened and examined it, shut it again, and returned it to me. Then Johnson asked to see it, but I said No; she then snatched it out of my hand, and away she ran out of doors. I followed her, but two men in the passage prevented my getting out, and when I did get out they directed me the wrong way after her - I do not know who they were. I was quite sober. I have not found my watch.</p>

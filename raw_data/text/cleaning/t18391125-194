On the 11th of November, at about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was down in my wash-house, and a person called my attention to the street-door being open—I had left it shut at seven o'clock, and left all the articles stated safe in the parlour—I had not locked the door, but closed it after me—it would not open with<lb></lb>out turning the handle—when I came up I missed all the articles—the linen was in a basket, wet, having just been washed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 38.) On Monday evening, the 11th of October, soon after nine o'clock, I was with Sergeant Pocock, near Cromer-street, and saw a man go into a house there with a basket on his shoulder, it was not the male prisoner—I had noticed Jemima Dorsett, for nearly an hour before the man came, watching at the street-door of No. 31, Cromer-street, looking out at the door, up and down the street—it was about ten minutes after nine o'clock when the man went in with the basket on his shoulder, or head—he held it with both hands—the pri<lb></lb>soner Dorsett spoke to him, and both went into the house together—it is full half-a-mile from the prosecutrix's—the man came out in about half<lb></lb>a-minute, and crossed directly over to me and Pocock—we both ran away, and when we got down some steps into a court, Pocock called out, "George, come back, it is no thoroughfare"—we went there to conceal ourselves—we returned in a few minutes, and saw the man Dorsett, who is not in custody, standing talking at the same door with Jemima Dorsett and another man—he said, "I heard Pocock's voice, I can swear to it: I heard him say, 'George, come back, it is no thoroughfare;' I know Pocock's voice; it was his voice; it is no go; they think I have got swag, but they shan't have it;'"—Dorsett must have heard this—he ran up Cromer-street, leaving Jemima Dorsett, and she went in-doors, into the same house—we made the best of our way to Maiden-lane, Battle-bridge, and saw the prisoner Dorsett pass us with a large bundle under her cloak—we watched her to Ashby-street, Somers<lb></lb>town, (we went to Battle-bridge, suspecting they would come there)—she</p>

               <p>knocked at the door in Ashby-street, and went up stairs—the came out in about five minutes—I stopped her, and asked what she had done with the bundle she had under her cloak just now—she said, "I have left it at my sister's"—while I was talking to her, I saw the prisoner, William Lewis, and the man not in custody, who went into the house in Cromer-street with the basket—Lewis saw me, and crossed over to me—the other made his escape—I gave Lewis into the custody of another policeman, and went with Jemima Dorsett and Pocock to No. 22, Ashby-street, where, in the second-floor, front room, I found the prisoner, Cecilia Lewis—I know she lives with William Lewis by seeing them together before—I asked her what she had done with the bundle her sister had left there—she said she had not received any bundle from her sister—I turned up the bed, and between the bed and sacking found these two pictures—Pocock found a bundle in the room—Cecilia Lewis said, "How dare you look at that bun<lb></lb>dle? don't open it"—she went to snatch it from him, saying it was filthy linen, not fit for him to look at—he opened it, and it contained nine linen shirts, and other things, wet—I left them in custody and went with the male prisoner—I took him into a chandler's shop, and found in his coat pocket, a bag containing eleven skeleton keys and some lucifer-matches—I have since been to the prosecutrix, tried the keys to the outer door, and two of them open it—when I returned to my brother officer, the prisoners were down in the street, and Jemima Dorsett said that was not the bundle she had taken to her sister.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw Collier watching—I saw Jemima Dorsett standing at the door of No. 31, Cromer-street, a long time, and I saw William Lewis go into that house—Collier was behind me and could not see him—it was about ten minutes after nine o'clock—Jemima Dorsett was standing at the door at the time, and a man named Dorsett, who is not now in custody, immediately followed with a basket on his shoulder—I afterwards saw the man Dorsett come out and go up Cromer-street—he crossed over towards us—Collier and I immediately ran down the court; Collier was first—I called out," There is no thoroughfare, George"—we returned in a few minutes, and saw Dorsett at the door of 31, Cromer-street—soon afterwards we went up towards Battle-bridge—we crossed the fields, the quickest way to Ashby-street, and in a few minutes saw Jemima Dorsett pass us with a bundle under her cloak—we watched her to No. 22—she came out in two or three minutes, and Collier stopped her and asked what she had done with the bundle she took to that house—she said, "I left it at my sister's"—just at that moment Lewis and the man Dorsett came down a court into the street—the man Dorsett ran away and Lewis made a stop—I went up to the room—Catherine Lewis was sitting in a chair, with her shawl and bonnet off—I found a bundle of linen in a cupboard—she came there and caught hold of me, and said, "I <hi rend="italic">dare</hi>, you to touch my dirty linen"—Collier said, "Open it"—it consisted of</p>

               <p>nine wet shirts, two shifts, and other property—we took Jemima Dorsett into the room, and while Collier went out to search Lewis, Dorsett said, "That is the bundle I brought here"—I am sure she said so—she after<lb></lb>wards said it was not the bundle, it was another; but there was no other bundle in the room—there was One dirty shirt and a dirty gown in the room besides.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live at No. 4, Red Lion-row, Walworth. I have known the prisoner Dorsett nine or ten years—I never knew a blemish in her character—I live a long way from them now, but. twelve months ago I lived very dose to them—I know her husband—I know he is her husband—they were married at Shoreditch church, I think, my wife was present at her marriage, but I was not—they always lived together as man and wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith. I saw the prosecutor beckon to the officer—I stopped to see what was amiss—the prisoner had her band under her apron—she would not take it out—the officer asked her what she had got—she said what was that to him, he might take her to the station if he wanted to see—the officer turned to speak to the sailor—a man who stood by, gave two or three nods—she winked to him, and he passed dose over to her—she would not take her hand from under her apron—the man held out his hand to take something from her, and she tried to pass something to him—I gave her a push, and the officer asked him what he had got—he showed a farthing—another man came up, and she passed something to him, and he put it into his left hand breeches' pocket.</p>

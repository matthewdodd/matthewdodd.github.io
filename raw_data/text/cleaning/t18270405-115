On the 19th of March I sent my little boy, who is ten years of age, to Mrs. Davis, at No. 11, with a pair of sheets, two shifts, and a petticoat, which I had had to wash, and they were to go there to be mangled; this was a little after seven o'clock - I saw him go into the house, and ran back to iron a shirt; my little boy came directly, which surprised me; he said a young woman met him in the passage, and told him Mrs. Davis was not at home, and she took the things - I ran there immediately and found Mrs. Davis was at home. I have since seen the sheets at a pawnbroker's; they belong to a customer of mine, and have I. H. W. on them.</p>

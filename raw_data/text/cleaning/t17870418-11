               <p>I am servant to Mr. Linnell, of Paddington; the next door to Mr. Shepherd's, I was at work for my master in the field nearest to our yard, and nearest to Mr. Shepherd's; as I was going away, I turned round in our own yard, and I saw three men look over the rails; that was about one in the afternoon; then there was one over the rails, one getting over, and one in the ditch; they are the rails that come out of Mr. Turner's, that keeps the King and Queen, into my master's field; they were in my master's field, and the foremost man came stooping along in the ditch towards Mr. Shepherd's garden, and the next did the same, and the third likewise, till they got to the end of Mr. Shepherd's garden, where the linen hung by the hedge; I looked after these people, and I went back into the field where I had been at work, and I peeped through the pales; I hid myself from them; I was within thirty or forty yards of them; first one got over the pales to look over, first one took a peep, then another, then one put his foot, and his knees were at the top of the pales, then he got down, then another got up and peeped, then they were all three down at once; then they beckoned with their hand to a fourth man, who was in Mr. Turner's field; that man came in full view of my face; he was a short little thickset man, in a blue coat; then he wanted to come, and they were all in the ditch together; then I thought I saw one almost on the pales, one of their faces was towards me, I thought he watched me; then I went away; two of them then set off in a hurry, and went into Mr. Turner's field, two staid; I went and told my fellow servant to have his eye to the linen; I was gone about a quarter of an hour, and then I saw a woman, and some other people running; I heard an outcry that all Mr. Shepherd's linen was gone; I set off after them, and the three men were taken; I knew them again, and the very shortest one of them said to me, now do you know any thing of me, master? I said, are not you one of the men that the other beckoned to, to come into the field? and he denied it; and I said that the man in the red coat was the man that came within ten yards of me, and the other man in the brown coat, was the man that had his back towards me, and the other I was not so sure of; I know them by their persons very well, and by their dresses; the man in the brown coat had his back to me, and looked over his right shoulder; the man in the red coat was him that came nearest; the little one is the same one, according to appearance, that they beckoned to come to them; I saw the linen found; I saw the servant maid pick out a shirt out of the hole of a tree belonging to my master's field, and I saw the corner of a blue apron hitched upon a hook, the corner of an outhouse at Mr. Ward's; they found a bundle of linen which had been thrown over; I was before the Justice with them, and these men said they had been at the Spotted Dog, at Westborn-green; one said that he knew but one of them; then another said that they all knew one another, and they happened to meet together.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear positively to all these men? - I can be positive that these are the men I saw first; I have no doubt in the least but they are the same four persons I saw first; I am equally sure of all of them.</p>

               <p>Was the linen found in the way they run, or the contrary way? - It was partly the way; I did not see them at the place where the linen was found; they passed the place where the linen was found after I lost sight of them; I was before the Justice of peace, and heard these men say they had been at the Spotted Dog, and had been drinking together.</p>

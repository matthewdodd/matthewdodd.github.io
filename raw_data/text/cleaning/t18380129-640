On the evening of the 22nd of December I met the prisoner Davis at the Red Cow, in King-street, Deptford—the prisoner Brown was in her company in the house, and I drank with him—Davis took me to a house, a few steps from the public-house, in the same street, New-street—Brown followed us—I went up stairs with the wo<lb></lb>man—Low, another female, was there—she went out of the room, leaving me and Davis together—I pulled the watch out of my waistcoat pocket—we went on the bed, and I laid my watch on the table—there was a piece of candle in the room, but it burnt out—I called for an<lb></lb>other—Davis got out of bed to go down stairs to get another light—I got out of bed after her, and felt on the table and missed my watch—she wished to go down for the light—I objected to her going, and said I would go myself—I stopped at the door till a lady brought the light up—I insisted that they both should remain till I went down and got a policeman, which I did, and he took them in charge—they were discharged.</p>

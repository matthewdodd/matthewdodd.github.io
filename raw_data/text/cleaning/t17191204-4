Two other Evidences, who were in the Room when the Prisoner Pain pleaded that she and Challenged Pain with them, confirmed her owning them as before. The Prisoner Pain pleaded that she being necessicated at that time, took the Goods and pawned them, with an intent to being them again; and that the Drawer was not lockt but open; that Elizabeth Marshal knew nothing of it.

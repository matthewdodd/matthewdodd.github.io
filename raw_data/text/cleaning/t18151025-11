On the 21st of September, a quarter before six in the evening, I missed three hats from the door; I immediately went over to an old woman sitting opposite, and received a description of two men from her. I then went to Mr. Lee, an officer, in Field-lane, and almost immediately afterwards, we found Marks disposing of one of the hats in Mrs. Cottorell's shop; we took him into custody; he answered the description of one of the men, given me by the woman. In a short time afterwards, I and Lee went into the Thatched House, and found the prisoner Noakes, with another of the hats on his head.</p>

I found the prisoner Marks, in Mrs. Cotterell's shop, trying to sell this hat; I instantly seized him, and gave him into the charge of a brother officer, named Corby. I then went into the Thatched House, in company with Cannon; and there I found Noakes, with this hat on his head.</p>

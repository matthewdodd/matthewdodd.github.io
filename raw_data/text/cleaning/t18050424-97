             sworn. - I am an officer of Hatton-garden: On the 15th of March, about twenty minutes after six in the morning, I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240077"></xptr>coming up Union-street, Hatton-garden; the prisoner at the bar was offering to sell these four cushions to a master baker, as he was coming out of a public-house; he called them chair-seats; the master baker knew me, and seeing me come up, he said to the prisoner, this man will buy them, he is something in the brokery line; I asked him where he brought them from; he said he bought them at Enfield, and gave half a guinea for them; I told him I would buy them and him too; I took and locked him up and the four coach-seats. I produce them. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming out of the country, where I wrought hard for my money and whatever I have had; I have threshed and ploughed for eight shillings a week; I have a wife and two babies at home; I could not get a bit of bread to maintain them; I was coming up to London, and as I was coming along I happened with a man in a cart; he said, my lad, where are you going to; I said, to London; he said, I have got some cushions to sell, if you are willing to get a few shillings by them; I gave him half a guinea for them; I had but sevenpence halfpenny left; I am as hard working a lad as ever you knew, you may depend upon it; I had just come up out of the country the morning as I happened with this misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of the persons here that you ploughed and threshed for? - A. No, they are not here.</p>

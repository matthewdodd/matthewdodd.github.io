               <p>MR. BUTTRESS. The prisoner was in my service, and received money for me.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA RAWLINGS. I am in the prosecutor's employ as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040056"></xptr>weaver. I bought a piece of silk of my master, and was to pay him by instalments of 10 s. out of every piece of work that I took home; it came to 6 l. 13 s. 8 d. I took work home on the 19th of June, and the money I was to receive was laid down on the counter. I had had an advance before; the prisoner put down 2 l. 13 s. 4 d. on the counter; I said you will take the 10 s., meaning for the silk, I owed nothing else, and he took up 10 s. I can swear there was one half-crown among it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You said take the 10 s. - A. Yes. I have a memorandum of the payments, which he made at the back of the bill. Here is an entry on the 19th of June of 10 s.</p>

               <persName id="t18221204-145-person1273">Q. </persName>
            Is there an account of any 10 s. being paid - A. Yes, on the 28th of August, which is the first sum. When he was discharged, he was requested to make out his balance; he made out a balance of 68 l.; there then appeared a deficiency of 13 l., which he acknowledged he had applied to his own use; he was discharged on the 25th of October. The amount of his deficiences is 800 l.</p>

             re-examined. The piece I was paid for on the 19th came to 7 l. 13 s. 4 d. I had received 5 l. in advance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What had you drawn on the work you were on at the time I left - A. two pounds, that is not the piece in question. I always came for advances on Saturday. The 19th was Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If Rawlings's account, in folio 136, is examined, it will be found that no deficiency whatever occurs, though it may not appear in the amount of 10 s., it appears as 20 s.; he acknowledges receiving 2 l. on the work he was on when I left, and 3 l. is entered, and the extra 1 l. is designed to cover what is stated in the bill; it was not entered at the time through the great pressure of business.</p>

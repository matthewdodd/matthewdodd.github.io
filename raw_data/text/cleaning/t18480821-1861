                  </hi>. I am a driver, in the employ of Chaplin and Horne. I know Sammon—I saw him on 29th June, in Fetter-lane, about thirty or forty yards from the White Horse, with a horse and cart—I saw Smith go behind the cart, and throw a parcel into it—I saw there was a box on the copse of the cart in front.</p>

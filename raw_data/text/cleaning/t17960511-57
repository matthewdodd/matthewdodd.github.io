             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday the 7th of this month, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Fenchurch-street. I saw the prisoner in company with two others; the prisoner beckoned to the others to follow him close, and they made a run up to him immediately. As they got to the prisoner they followed Mr. Ray very close, and I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket and take out a red pocket-book. I immediately tapped Mr. Ray, and told him the prisoner had picked his pocket of his pocket-book. Mr. Ray turned round, and the first thing that struck his attention was the pocketbook lying on the ground at the prisoner's feet. Mr. Ray immediately took it up; I laid hold of the prisoner and took him over to the oil shop, and got a constable and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>(The pocket-book was produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to the India-house to get a captain to go to India; going there I was accused of taking that gentleman's pocketbook innocently. I saw a pocket-book lying; he took me to the oil shop, and I was examined by Alderman Pickett, and committed for trial.</p>

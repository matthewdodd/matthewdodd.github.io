               <p>CHARLES WOOLLEY. I live at the Bull Inn, Aldgate. On the 24th of April I met the prisoner in the <placeName id="t18340515-51-crimeloc291">Minories</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. He was in liquor - the woman who was with him, and was acquitted, put her hand into his pocket - a man who was with him gave the money into my hand - I was in liquor, and so was he. Witness. There was no man with me - I was not in liquor, nor was she.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was given into my charge between two and three o'clock in the morning, by the prosecutor - she was brought to the watch-house by the patrol and searched - but before that I asked the prosecutor what he had lost - he said, a sovereign and some silver; and there was a particular sixpence that he could swear to - I said to her, "Now I am going to search you, if a sovereign is found on you, does it belong to you?"- she said, "No, all the money I claim is eighteen pence"- I searched her, and found a sovereign, a battered sixpence, and seven shillings besides - and he produced another sixpence like it, a twin - here is half-a-crown, four sixpences, a shilling, and a sovereign.</p>

               <p>JOHN FORESTER. The prisoner was not what I call totally drunk, what I call spun - she had been drinking, and the prosecutor was fresh - the prisoner said some man had given her the money.</p>

            , I observed Brown driving a waggon in Wigmore-street; I lifted up the tarpauling, and saw the leg of a man - I followed the waggon, which went up Edward-street, into Portman-square - the horses were stopped in Baker-street, by the prisoner Brown; I did not hear him speak, but thought he did -I observed his lips moving; he immediately drove the horses on, and I saw Brotheridge come from under the tarpauling in his shirt-sleeves; I told Brown to stop the horses, which he did - I got up into the waggon, and Brotheridge said, "So help me God, master, all is right;" I found the bung of the hogshead of sugar half way up, and found this bag; he said, it was only a little he had got for his own use - they said they were going to deliver it; I asked Brotheridge what he had been doing there - he said he had been asleep; I said it was strange to go to sleep without his jacket and hat - the waggon went to Mr. Salter's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any person present at this conversation? A. Yes, Sayers and my brother officer, who was not bound over - Sayers is not here; I did not ask Brown whose servant he was, but I asked if Brotheridge was regularly employed, and he said No.</p>

On the 28th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, Brown came into the shop, and said he had brought two hogsheads of sugar, that a very unpleasant circumstance had occurred, for he had brought a man to assist him, and the Policeman had discovered that he had been taking sugar out of the hogshead; I thought it was a trifling circumstance, and desired the waggon to be brought to the door; I then saw several Policeman, and one in the waggon, who was examining the nose-bags; they then showed me the hogshead - the tin was off the drawing-hole, and some lumps of moist sugar were in the waggon - the tin had been forcibly removed, but was not entirely taken off; I took a sample from the bag and the hogshead - there were 22 1/2 lbs. of sugar in the bag; we did not weigh the hogshead, but it was nearly full, and as full as many hogsheads - we found it was a rocky hogshead, being in large lumps, so that if the tin had been removed, this quantity of sugar could not have got out without some hand - I received the hogsheads from Clark, the carman; I had paid 72l. for them, but he was answerable for the safe delivery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Clark here? A. No, his name is Thomas; I believe I never had a hogshead with the tin robbed off.</p>

            . I am the regular driver of Mr. Thomas Clark's waggon - I was employed on his account to remove this sugar; on the 15th of November; I took in one hogshead at the East London-docks, and one at the West India-dock - they were in a perfect state, and the tin safe over the bung; I met with an accident, from a pully falling on me, and employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290068"></xptr>Brown to drive the waggon, and gave my papers to the foreman to deliver my load - they were quite safe when I received them, and I do not think the tins could have been chafed off - I should have gone alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the custom sometimes for a carman to ask another to give him a lift? A. Yes, I could not have taken out the hogsheads myself, but there are men standing about in the trade, and sometimes the grocers men would do it; the tins will chafe off at times in going along; I have known Brown three years - he bore an honest character; I know Mr. Clark's name is Thomas, by his bills, and his name is on the waggon - he has no partner.</p>

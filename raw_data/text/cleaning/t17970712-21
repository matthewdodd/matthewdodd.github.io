               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular that had happened when he came to make his survey? - A. He had a basket and trowel in his hand, he said he would leave it in our cellar; I had very strong suspicion that he robbed Mr. Smith, and determined to watch him; he surveyed and signed the specimen, and was coming up stairs and I drew back; he came up into the passage, and looked round him, upon that he muttered something to himself about the specimen, and went down into the cellar again, I followed him, and saw him stoop and pick up the sat which was spread about the floor in the cellar, he took it up and put it to his nose to smell it, and then put it in his pocket.</p>

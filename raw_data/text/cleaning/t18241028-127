I did not know the others - the prisoner seized me by the cuff of the coat, and dragged me against the poles - the other two men were gone forward - he did not speak to me, but gave me a knock on the head and kicked me - he then grabbed at my watch; I seized it, and the glass was broken in the scuffle - I asked him what he wanted - he said</p>
               <p>"I want to rob you, what do you think?" I then ran away from him and got to my lodgings - he followed me; but when I rapped at the door he run back - he tried to get my watch and got hold of the ribbon; but I got it from him - he seemed to be tipsy; but he could run very well - I had seen him about a fortnight before that time - he was apprehended next day about two o'clock at the Rising-Sun public-house, at Enfield Town. I was not at all hurt, but my clothes were dirtied.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard of this transaction the next day - I took the prisoner at the Rising-Sun public-house - he said he knew nothing about it. I have known him from a boy - he said he left the public-house about half-past eleven o'clock, and went home with two men named William Hill and

               <p>"Yes" said he,</p>

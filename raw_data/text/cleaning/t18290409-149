I heard the prosecutor cry Watch! and several voices cried Watch! likewise - I ran to the end of the alley; some person said, "There is a man murdering a girl at the top of the alley:" I went up and saw the prisoner in the grasp of the prosecutor - she gave charge of him to me for ill-using her; and he said, "I give charge of this girl for robbing me;" I said, "Of what?" he said, "My watch;" I said, "Are you sure that is the person?" he said."Yes, quite sure;" I said, "Don't use her ill - come to the watch-house;" he was a little in liquor, but he seemed to have his senses about him, and to know very well what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through this place, and had just come from a raffle; the prosecutor was calling out Watch! I passed him, and said, "What are you calling Watch! for?" he caught hold of me, and said I had robbed him; there were two girls and three men just a-head; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated.</p>

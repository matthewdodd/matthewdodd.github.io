                  </hi>. I am servant to Sidney Bower, of Park-terrace, Peckham. On Thursday afternoon, the 17th of August, between three and four o'clock, I was in the front kitchen with the door open, and observed a shadow—in three or four minutes I saw the shadow again—I went to the back door, and saw the prisoner coming down stairs from the back parlour with the cruets in his hand—I took them from him, and held him till mistress came down and took him from me—he got away from her, and ran away to<lb></lb>wards the Kent-road—I pursued but did not overtake him—I am quite sure he is the boy.</p>

On the afternoon of the 17th of August, between three and four o'clock, I was in Park-road lying on the grass just against the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house, and saw the prisoner run out of Mr. Bower's gate, and the witness after him—he ran towards Kent-road-bridge—I met a policeman, and told him what I had seen—I am quite sure he is the boy.</p>

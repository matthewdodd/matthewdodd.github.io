               <p>The prisoner was my assistant—on the 26th of July, I delivered the let<lb></lb>ters in the Spitalfields walk—the prisoner was on duty with me—he came at a quarter past three—I opened the bundle of letters which arrived at three, and divided them between me and the prisoner—he would have the letter for 9, White-street—it would be among his portion, and ought to have been delivered by four o'clock.</p>

               <p>I live in Warwickshire, when I came to London I spent the evening in Shoe-lane with some friends, about three o'clock we came away, and coming up Fleet-street I had an occasion to stop, and my companions had got about forty yards before me, I overtook them at <placeName id="t17830723-73-crimeloc343">Temple Bar</placeName>

I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came it to be so long as five or six weeks before you became active in pursuit of the person that robbed you? - I had always the sight of her in my mind, I have not been at home since.</p>
               <p>How long did you purpose staying in town when you left Birmingham? - It was very uncertain.</p>
               <p>How came you by this property? - By my business, I am a broker at Birmingham, I brought it from thence, and part I took at Newmarket, I came on purpose to go to Epsom.</p>
               <p>Oh, what to the races, then I understand you are of that description, you came up to pay a bet did not you, and was going to Epsom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the consequence was if you lost this money you could not pay the bet? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>To what amount might that bet be? - I cannot say, they were different bets.</p>
               <p>Do you usually carry your money about with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230097"></xptr>Why is there no banker at Birmingham? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What kind of pursuit have you made after that girl for these five or six weeks? - Very great.</p>
               <p>Have you been backwards and forwards through Temple Bar? - I have been once or twice but not at night, I will not go again.</p>
               <p>Then I understand when you are at Birmingham you are a broker, and when you are in town you are a horse-racer? - I received some money to bring up.</p>
               <p>What time did you sup that night? - We had no supper at all.</p>
               <p>What all drink? - I believe we had a lobster or two, we staid till two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>And will you take upon you to tell those gentlemen there, who are intelligent men, that you were sober? - I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Are you married? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You paired yourself as well as your companions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The girl met you the other side of Temple Bar? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you go into the house your companions went into? - I told them I would treat them all, I did it to accommodate my townsmen.</p>
               <p>Being come to the bar you all drank together? - Nobody drank at all.</p>
               <p>How many companions had you with you? - Three or four, I believe some were at the door, I believe two or three women came into the house, and two or three of my countrymen; we stood at the bar.</p>
               <p>You did not retire into any more convenient place? - No.</p>
               <p>When you four were together you described the girl as being uncommonly amorous, and putting her hand about you, and then it was that you met with the loss? - She had felt before.</p>
               <p>She had taken this from you before she came into the house? - No, I tell you.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been able to trace any of these notes? - I have been seeking after them.</p>
               <p>Have you found any of them? - I wish I could.</p>
               <p>Have you advertised them? - No, I went to Mr. Drummond's to have them stopped.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you said, this woman put her hand about you before you went into the house? - She drew her hand between my thighs, and up and down my thighs, says I, my dear do not you be too busy.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not she have picked your pockets at that time? - No, Sir, she did not then pick my pockets.</p>

            . On Friday the 23d of September. I went out; and when I came Home, about seven o'Clock next Day, I was told, that Lewis had been in the House two or three Times, and had broke open the Door, and my Drawers, and took out a Diaper Table-cloth fringed, which cost me a great deal of Money; I lost that and the other Things.</p>

            's. and I went into the inner Room on the Ground-floor, to hide myself - I did not see him; I was told, he pretended to come with a Constable; and came in a very vile Manner, and swore he would have me; he b roke open the Chamber door on the Ground floor, and then he broke open the Drawers, and took out something - I saw a sringed Table-cloth under his Coat - he did not look for me when he came into the Room, but went directly to the Drawers, and broke them open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he think you were hid in the Drawers?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had looked about the Room might he have found you?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. Yes, he might have found me; I was hid behind the Curtain - I had lived with Mrs Dawson about a Month - when he had got the Table-cloth he went away directly; I did not see him take any thing else.</p>
               <p>Jury. What had he to break open the Drawers with?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. The Drawers were all locked, and the Key was in one of the Drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have opened the Drawers with the Key; did he break them open?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. He broke them open, because the Key was broke.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he break open the Door of the Room?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. Yes - the Door was broke open, for I had locked myself in, but how he did it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come in?</p>
               <p>Fitzmorris. I did not see him at all - I did not see him that Night.</p>

I never saw the Prisoner in my Life before he came into the House that Night, this was about eleven o'Clock, and the second Time of his coming; the first Time he came was about nine o'Clock, he came and asked for the Gentlewoman of the House, Mrs Dawson; he cursed and swore greatly, and bid me get out of the House; he came again in half an Hour's Time, and came in, in the same Manner; he said, there was a young Woman in the House which he had a Warrant for; that he was sure she was in the House, and he swore he would have her out; he said, he was sure she was in that Room, and broke the Door open, and went in there, and then broke open the Drawers.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in the Room with him?</p>
               <p>Williams. No; no-body but the young Woman, who was behind the Curtain; I saw him, as he was going away, with the Fringe of the Tablecloth hanging out of his Pocket - I did not see the Constable near the House; the first Time you came, there was a tall Man in a Snuff coloured Coat with you; but the next Time you had no body at all with you - it was the Friday before Michael mas-Day - I am Mrs Dawson's Servant - I never spoke to you in my Life before that Night; only I have heard the Neighbours say what Sort of a person you are - it was the Chamber-door you broke open - I need not tell you what Time it was, for certainly you must know that.</p>

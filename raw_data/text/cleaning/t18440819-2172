                  </hi>. I went to No. 9, Alpha-terrace, a few days after the 24th of June, and saw a copper in the kitchen, the property of Richard Thomas Thornton Brown—there was a sort of whitewash on the top of it, as the house was under repair.</p>

I live in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, and am employed at Mr. Brown's house, Alpha-terrace, Wawortb—I saw a copper in the back kitchen of No. 3—I was in the habit of leaving my tools in the copper—there was a holdfast in the bottom of it, and the damp had caused it to rust and corrode on the bottom, and by that I should know it again—I saw a copper found on the prisoner which had the mark of which I speak—I saw it fitted to the kitchen—it fitted exactly—the kitchen had been coloured a</p>

I live in Peacock-street, Newington-butts, and have lived there thirty years—the property is my own, and is leasehold—I have known the prisoner six or seven years—I had been to the Borough to look at a horse for a gentleman, and on returning I met him by the Elephant and Castle on the 29th of June, I think, at half-past six o'clock—a man came after him with some copper, lead, and different things, in a bag at the back of the Elephant and Castle—he took the copper out—it was bent up like a hat-box—he said he was going to sell it at Haman's, who keeps a marine store shop at Wai worth—the prisoner said, "You cannot sell it there, they don't do business this day"(I believe Haman is a Jew)—the prisoner said, "I will buy it of you, if we can agree"—he looked at them, and offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole, if he would come to where he lived, as he had not the money about him—they went there, and the prisoner gave him half a sovereign and I think a crown-piece—the copper was all beat up together—there appeared more than one—after he paid him I believe they had some beer—I left them there—I did not examine the articles.</p>

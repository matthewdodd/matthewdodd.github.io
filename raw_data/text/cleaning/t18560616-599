Mr. Nathaniel Overbury keeps goods there, but he is not in partnership with Mr. Robert Overbury—the ware-house is on the ground floor in front, and at the back there is a counting house, which has a skylight over the whole of it—Mr. Salaman is a solicitor, and he occupies an office over the warehouse—there is nothing over the counting house—there is a window from Mr. Salaman's office which comes to the skylight—on 7th May there were some boards lying on the skylight—the workmen had been at work the day before, laying some lead on—I know Mason's-alley—there is a wall there, over which you can get to our premises—there is just one warehouse between Mr. Overbury's warehouse and the alley, and by getting over that wall access could he had to our premises—that is the way the workmen went up—on the evening of 7th May I left the warehouse about 25 minutes past 6 o'clock—I was the last person who left—I locked the warehouse door, and took the two keys with me, a Chubb patent lock, and another lock—at that time everything was safe—on the following morning I was called to the warehouse at a little after 6 o'clock—my residence is at No, 27, Basinghall-street—I went to the warehouse, and found two policemen there—I saw seven pieces of woollen goods near the street door—some of them were Mr. Robert Overbury's—the greater part were Mr. Nathaniel Overbury's—they were in the warehouse, and covered up, when I left on the previous evening—they had just come in—they were given back to us by order of the Magistrate, because we had them for an order—I went from the street door to the warehouse door, which is on the left hand side of the passage—that was the door that I had left locked, and both the staples were off—the screws had been drawn—the bolts of the locks were shot—they must have been opened from the inside of the warehouse—there is an alarm bell there, the wire of that was let loose, and the hammer was down on the bell, so that it could not strike by opening or shutting the door—I found five or six more pieces of cloth had been removed—I noticed the skylight of the counting house—there is a counter under the skylight, and on the counter there was a plank in an inclined position from the skylight down to the counter, so that any one could slide down—a pane of glass had been taken out of the skylight—that glass was all safe the night before—I went up stairs to Mr. Salaman's office—I found the door of his back office had been broken open from the inside—that could have been done by getting in at the window from the skylight, and the window was</p>

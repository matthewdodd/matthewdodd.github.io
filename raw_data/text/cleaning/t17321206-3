               <p>John Ferrers. The Prisoner came into our Shop, in <placeName id="t17321206-3-crimeloc14">Blowbladder-Street</placeName>

We did not chasser with him then, but he setting them down at the farthest end of the Shop, went towards the Street Door, and stood leaning with his Back against the Counter. I and my Maid watch'd him (for I had lost some Goods the Saturday before) and we saw him put his Hands behind him, and take a Parcel of white Balladine Silk out of a Wrapper, and thrust into his Bosom. Then he walk'd a Yard or two farther into the Shop, and I went and collar'd him, and order'd my Man to take the Silk out of his Bosom, which he did: I weigh'd it, and sent for a Constable. The Prisoner seemed very much surpriz'd, and said the Devil egg'd him on to do it. This Evidence was corroborated by the Maid and others, and the Jury found him <rs id="t17321206-3-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

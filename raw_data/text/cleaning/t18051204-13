               <p>Q. How much was delivered? - A. One hundred and eighty-three quarters and six bushels, according to the metre's bills, and that was the quantity that we expected.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact how much was delivered? - A. I told the sacks, and the sacks were right according to the complement; to the best of my belief and knowledge they were right.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not measure the contents of each sack? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks there was you cannot tell? - A. Two sacks make a quarter; double of that number were in sacks.</p>

             began to converse with Mr. Killock's man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Ives there? - A. No he was just gone on shore. Mr. Killock's man went into the bed place and searched for Ives; we went there to take him; during the time we were searching for Ives,

             made off by means of another barge; it being dark, we could not get hold of him there. We found eleven bushels of wheat and six sacks; and five of the sacks has Mr. Killock's name on them; we detained the boy, and put him and the wheat and the sacks into our boat; I went instantly and apprehended Ives, where he was on shore, and put him in the boat also; he had left word where he was, the boy went with us and shewed us where he was. The boy instantly told me the same story as he has your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. This going to Deptford was not in course upon Mr. Killock's business? - A. Yes, it was, he supplies the Victualling Office with flour. I produce the sacks and a sample of the wheat.</p>
               <p>(The sacks indentified by the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor.) It is the river Lee, whether you pass by Bow Creek or Limehouse; is it a navigable river that your barge came along the cut from Upper Homerton; Did your barge come along that cut? - A. There is no other way, that is the only navigable part.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brown.) Where did you see your uncle convey these sacks into the bed place? - A. Opposite Homerton.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor) How do you account that the whole quantity that you expected should be delivered at your house, and yet they should have these sacks? - A. My people not having suspicions of these bargemen, being in the habit of coming up and down every day, they might have placed them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these six sacks of wheat? - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Charles George Price Windsor, of Victoria-road, Kensington. On the 2nd of Nov., the family was out of town—I do not know when they left home—it was on a Thursday—I was left alone in the house—I was at that time acquainted with the prisoner Blackman—the night my master left, a nurse was left in the house in charge of a little boy—I slept alone in the house on Friday night—Blackman lodged in High-street, Kensington, at Mr. Braid's sweetmeat shop—I went there on the Saturday, saw Blackman, and asked her to come and sleep with me that night—she did so—I slept alone on Sunday night—I saw her again on Monday, and went out with her from about eight o'clock till half-past, to see my bro<lb></lb>ther—she slept with me on Monday night and Tuesday night—I went with her on Tuesday nignt to her mother's, to tell her that she was going to sleep with me—she also slept with me on Wednesday and Thursday nights—in the coarse of that time I had some conversation with her about a young man who I knew at Lambeth, and on the Thursday she wanted me to go there to see if he was single—it was first spoken of in the day time, and again in the evening—I declined to go, both times—on the Friday night she slept with me—she asked me several times that evening to go to Lambeth to see this young man, and she went with me to her mo<lb></lb>ther's to say she was going to sleep with me, and after she had been there the repeated it ever so many times before her brother, asking me to go—she wished me to go at past ten o'clock, before her brother—she repeatedly expressed a wish that I should go—she did not state any object she had in wishing me to go—on my refusing to go at ten o'clock, she went up and whispered to her brother—I have a slight recollection of seeing Jones at her mother's that night—nothing was said in her brother's presence about plate—when we were at home, at Mr. Windsor's, in the course of the week before the Friday, she asked me whether they had taken the plate with them—I told her I did not know—she said what a lot of plate I had in my charge—I said I should not wish any thing to be missed, for I was very careful of it while they were away, and said that I had hid it—I did not say where—she knew it was down stairs, because she has seen, me go down stairs to hide it—she slept with me on the Friday night, and left between eleven and twelve on the Saturday—she had a dress to make for me, and she went to fetch it—she returned between one and two—she did not bring the dress—she said she had been in the town to her brothers—she stopped till about three o'clock—there was no occasion for her to have returned that I know of—she again left at three to fetch my dress—she returned at six without it, and said she had for<lb></lb>gotten it—she asked me a great many times that day to go to Lambeth—I said I could not say, I did not know whether the family would be home—she pressed me several times, and at length I agreed to go—we started about half-past nine—I am sure it was post nine—before we started I secured the house—I</p>

               <p>give her tbc keys to mind, because my pocket was very shallow and torn—I locked the kitchen door, the garden gate, and made all secure—we came out at the front gate, and up Victoria-road—when we got pretty near to the top of Victoria-rood, leading to the Kensington-road, she said she must go home for a handkerchief for her neck—I offered several times to lend her mine off my own neck—she said no, she must go home, and she ran away from me, and went home—she said she would not be many minutes before she was back—I followed her to where she lodged in High-street, Kensington, and I saw the prisoner Jones standing at the door of the house—she was in the passage—I saw her brother come along the passage, and Jones said to him that he could fetch the dog—Jones and Blackman's brother then went off together towards the Victoria-road—the female prisoner brought the keys to me, and told me to take them for fear she should lose them; and she went after them, in the same direction—she was not many minutes gone—she then came back, and begged of me again to go to Lambeth—I did not notice that she had any handkerchief on her neck then—she did not go up stairs to any apartment to get one while I was there—her brother and her returned nearly together—I do not know which returned first—I saw nothing more of Jones then—the female prisoner and I then went on to the Victoria-road together, and when I said I would go home, she said what was the use of going home, why not go on to Lambeth?—I said no, I would return home, for I did not like leaving the house—she several times wished me to go on to Lambeth—we then went down the Victoria-road together—when we got to my master's house I saw a man walking about there—I said to her that I did not like the appearance of it—we walked past the house, because I wanted to look at him—she then wished me to go with her and buy some paper in the new town, which is just beyond the back of our house, in the direction we were going—I said no, I would go home—she then wished me to go round the back of the house, not to go in—I said no, I would go in—I then gave her the key, to open the front garden gate—she made a great noise with the keys in opening it—when she had opened it I went in, and went round to the back kitchen door—she followed me—I had the key of the door, and tried to open it with it, but did not succeed—I tried to open it, and then the front bell rang—I gave Black man the key, and told her to try to open the door while I went to see who was at the gate—when I got to the gate there was nobody there—I did not see the person that I had formerly seen walking before the house—I then saw a light up in my master's dressing-room window—I was frightened, and began screaming "Thieves" and "Murder"—Blackman came to me, told me not to make that noise, and asked me what I was screaming about—Mr. Gee, my master's next door neighbour, and a gentleman named Surplim, who lives there, came to my assistance—I went to the back kitchen door; it was then open, and I saw Jones and another man rush out, and go towards the back gate, which was locked—they tried to open it—Jones then came up towards me, and the other one rushed towards the trees, and got out of sight—I told Jones he was the man that came out of the kitchen—he said he had only come to hear the screaming—I pointed him out to Mr. Gee, who took him—I then went for a policeman, and found Dunbar—before I came back Jones had been taken away—I went into the kitchen and found every drawer open—the plate-basket, and every thing on the table, and nurse's boxes, had been broken open, and a desk, (the plate was found up stairs in a bag)—all the things were still in the boxes and drawers, but were all turned over—the cupboard had been opened—in Mr. Windsor's dressing-room one drawer was tried to be broken open—the other drawers were not locked, and the things in them had been disturbed—most of them were found in a strange</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 91.) On this Saturday evening I was fetched by Moore to the prosecutor's house, and found Jones in Mr. Gee's custody—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this skeleton key in his waistcoat pocket—I have tried it to the back kitchen door of Mr. Windsor's house, and it will open it—on our way to the station he dropped these three skeleton keys—I called to a man named Price to pick them up, which he did, and gave them to me in his tight, while I had hold of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 125.) At a quarter to eleven o'clock on this night, in consequence of some cries, I went to Mr. Windsor's—I found a rosewood desk broken open, on the bed, in the bed-room, and a drawer broken open—the drawers in the kitchen were all open, the things all tumbled about, and a box open—among other things, I found a carpet-bag in the bed-room on the second floor, where the box was—it contained this plate, which I produce, some coats, trowsers, and other property—this rose<lb></lb>wood box appeared to have had an instrument put in it to force it open, but it has not been opened, only attempted.</p>

I was in my cart, taking the two prisoners from the Police-court, Hammersmith, to the new prison, Clerkenwell—I heard Jones say to Blackmail, "Did you see the rosewood case that I tried to open?"—she made some reply, but I cannot say what, for she was at the back of the cart, and I was in front, driving.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable; I was sent for to the Two Brewers, Brewer street, Westminster, just before ten o'clock on the 9th of August; I found there the prisoner at the bar, the soldiers, and the prosecutor, I certainly did take the prisoner out and rub her down, I looked very hard in her face, she said Renny if you will go out with me I will tell you where the property is; she took me two hundred yards, lifted up her petticoats, and was going to drop the things in my hand, I took the money and returned with the prisoner, and I asked the gentleman to tell what it was; he described the purse and the gold pieces, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my purse, and the sort of money that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the money up from the place by the prisoner's side. I at first denied I had it; as soon as the constable was charged with me I delivered it to him.</p>

I planted one at at each door and went up to the two pair front room door; I heard a noise as if a box was breaking open; I went up quietly and come down again; I sent for an officer of Bow street; Sayer and Atkins came; I remained at one door and the coachman at the other. When the officers arrived we went up stairs together to the same door and pushed the door open, we went in and saw the prisoner in the act of having some goods out of the box; we saw the box had been broken open, and a poker laying by the side of the box; some of the goods laying on the table, I think; I am positive there were some on the carpet, and some was remaining in the box; there were twenty five pieces of worked muslin, and one piece, I believe it is called worsted net. The prisoner, when he saw me, wrung his hands and begged me to forgive him, he said he would never do so any more; I told him he must take his chance. We then took the prisoner to Bow street.

               <p>Q. On the 14th of January do you remember seeing the prisoner come there - A. Yes; I was taking the baggage from the coachman who was at the top of the coach; I left some of them unloaded from the coach in the yard while I was taking the packages to the warehouse. It being dark I could not see the directions, only the size of the box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a box afterwards at the prisoner's lodgings, or at Bow street - A. I did. By the size of the box I believe it to be the same that I took from the coach that night. When I returned for the two other boxes the prisoner was standing by, I asked him to lift up one box, he did so, and he said he would bring the other to the warehouse; I missed him and the other box both together.</p>

On the 14th of January, in the evening, I saw the prisoner there; he had a pint of rum; I saw the prisoner go out of the yard, he came in the yard again just after the Southampton coach arrived; in about twenty minutes after I saw him coming out of the yard with a box on his shoulder; he let it fall; he ran across the road and went down Dolphin yard. I saw the box again at Bow street; I believe it was the same box by the size.</p>

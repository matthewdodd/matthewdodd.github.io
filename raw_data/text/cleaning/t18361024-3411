                  </hi> I am a patrol of Farringdon Without. I was in Fleet-street, on the 26th of October, at eight o'clock in the evening, and saw the three prisoners arm-in-arm—I knew them before—I watched them for about five minutes and saw them attempt several gentleman's pockets as</p>

               <p>they walked along, Franklin in particular—I followed them to Ludgate<lb></lb>hill—they there attempted a gentleman's pocket, but he turned into a house, and they were disappointed—they then turned back, and when they got on to the Kings and Keys, Yates partly took this handkerchief from a short gentleman's pocket, and when they got further on, Franklin took it quite out, and gave it to Smith—I seized them—Smith dropped it from under her shawl, and Franklin tried to put it down a grating with his feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of St. Bride's. I was with Thorpe, and saw these prisoners at the end of Black Horse-court, Fleet-street—they crossed, following a gentleman to Ludgate-hill—they were disappointed—they then turned, and followed a gentleman up Fleet-street—Yates attempted to draw the handkerchief—the gentleman turned and put his hand to his pocket—Yates then gave it up—Franklin and Smith were arm in arm—Franklin then left Smith; and when they got a little further, Franklin took it quite out, and gave it to Smith—I followed the gentleman and asked him if he had lost any thing?—he returned about ten or a dozen yards—I then went to capture Yates, who ran across Fleet-street to the end of Water-lane, and then the gentleman was gone—he had said it was his handkerchief, but he did not come to the watch-house.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of William Cowell, and live in Flood<lb></lb>street, Deptford. On the 26th of December, about six o'clock, I was in the tap-room of the Walter Arms public-house, with my husband—I saw the prisoner there, and the prosecutor asleep—I was close by him—he was asleep some time—while he was asleep I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from his neck, and a tobacco-box out of his pocket—when he awoke he said, "Ann Cowell, do you know any thing about my being robbed? "—I said, "Yes, " the young woman that sat alongside of him had robbed him of his handkerchief and tobacco-box, and had put the handkerchief alongside of him—I got ill-used, and got a black eye, from their companions—I was afraid to interfere before the prosecutor awoke, she had so many on her side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did you not say before the Magistrate, that you should have given information but were afraid of being ill-used by the bad characters that were with her? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. And that is what I say now—they were drinking with her—I bear a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you ever been charged with any thing? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. That has nothing to do with this—nobody can come forward to say so—I was not tried and convicted of felony, and had three months imprisonment at Maidstone—I was never in trouble at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Were you not tried at Maidstone, convicted, and sentenced to six months imprisonment, and suffered it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Has that any thing to do with this?</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you mean to swear you were not? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No, I do not mean to swear it—I did not come here about that—I came to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, and that is the truth, I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief—I have known the prosecutor a good bit—we were girl and boy together—he is married, and has two children, I think—I never said I would swear black was white for him—I never said any thing of that sort to the landlady of the house—I never exchanged three words with</p>

               <p>the landlady—I remained in the room till the prosecutor awoke, and till the policeman came, and took her—the policeman came about twenty minutes after seven o'clock—it was not ten o'clock before any account was given to a policeman—it was past eight o'clock at the prisoner was going to the station-house—I saw her take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's neck, and the tobacco-box from his pocket—I do not know what she did with it—she did not remain all the time—she went out—she was not there at the time he awoke—she went out for about twenty minutes, and came in again—he then asked where his property was, and he was knocked down and ill-used by the young men who were with the prisoner-she came in almost directly after I told him who it was—I was struck, and my husband also—all three of us were ill-used.</p>

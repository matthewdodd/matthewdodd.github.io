            . My husband's name is Joseph, I heard the prisoner was taken up and carried before my Lord Mayor for striping a child in Bartholomew close. I, having had one stript, went there to see if I could find out whether or no it was she that stripp'd mine. I there taxed her with it, upon which she owned it, and also that she had stripped two others: And since she has owned that my child's stays and stockings were stopped on Clerkenwell-green: I went and found them out, and the person is here to give his evidence.</p>

            . I was at work where the child's mother lives, in Black-horse yard, Pick-ax street, there came news that a child was stripped near Bartholomew-close. I did not know whose child it was then. The prisoner was stopped. I went and took hold of the child. I then asked the prisoner if she stripped the child, she said yes, and that she had proffered the things to sale which she took off the child back.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken from the child?</p>
               <p>Dawson. A coat and skirt, (produced in court.) Then a gentleman came and asked me if I was the father of that child, I said no, but I was servant to the child's father. A constable was sent for, and he was charged with the prisoner, and we took her before my Lord-mayor, and from thence to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before that time?</p>
               <p>Dawson. No, never in my life.</p>

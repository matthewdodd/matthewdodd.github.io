             was with me, they bid us stop and deliver what we had we told them we had no money; they began to rissle us; they looked to my shoes, and took one of my buckles out, and held it up to the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing in their hands?</p>
               <p>Worley. They had each a pistol, they unbuttoned my breeches, and wanted to see if I had a watch. When my buckle was held up, one of them said, they were Wedges; then they came and took the other; but before that was taken out, there came three more, then they took Paget's buckles out of his shoes; then Esq: Gore's chariot was coming by, they all five quitted us, and ran to take hold of the horses reins, but the coachman would not stop, and they fired two pistols directly: This was just by us, then they made off. I took particular notice of the prisoner, he stood close by me, with a pistol in his hand, while my buckles were taken from me, being one of the first two that came up. It was a man with a scarlet waistcoat, blue coat, and hat stapt all round, that took my buckles. There was a lamp just by us; as I kept looking in the prisoner's face, he said, if I spoke a word, he would blow my brains out. I am very sure he is the man. I seeing an advertisement afterwards, went to Justice Fielding; there I saw my buckles ( produced in court, and deposed to); after that I went to see the prisoner in New Prison; upon seeing him, immediately I said, that was one of the men. I know nothing against the woman.</p>

She said to the other woman that came with her, make haste, and tell them to make their escape: So I stopt that woman. Then I ordered the constable to go and search the prisoner's lodgings, there he took the man at the bar; then we went before Justice Welch, and I advertised the buckles by Justice Welch's order, and the prosecutor came and described the buckles before he saw them; he mentioned a little strain which one of them had on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the women brought the buckles?</p>
               <p>Spencer. The other woman did; but said they were Blake's property, and Blake said the same, and that she came by them as I mentioned before.</p>

             M'Gennis. I am a constable, Mr. Spencer sent for me about half an hour after eight, and gave me charge of the woman. I put her in the round-house. I heard her order the other woman to go to her room, and bid the men make their escape, or to come and blow our brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words?</p>
               <p>M'Gennis. She said, I am taken and stopt upon the buckles, make all the haste you can; and tell the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070005"></xptr> men to make all the haste they can out of the lodging. When I came back I went as we had appointed to meet Mr. Spencer at Justice Welch's; the Justice ordered me to go for one of my brother constables, named Langrey, and search the woman's lodgings. The other woman directed us to the house of M'Dearman, Buckridge Street, St. Gyles's, we went there: The woman bid me take care of myself, saying, if there were six of us we should not be able to take them. We took Mr. Scott and Mr. Carlisle with us; we saw the prisoner lying on the bed with his clothes on, through the key-hole. I cried, Jack, open the door; he would not answer; then I forced the door; open, we all four took hold of him; in searching the bed I found a pair of silver buckles; we found a brace of horse pistols loaded in a little closet near the bed, and two silk handkerchiefs lying with them.</p>
               <p>Paget. Those buckles and one of those handkerchiefs (produced in court, taking them in his hand) were taken from me the night I was robbed.</p>
               <p>M'Gennis. I found a jacket in the room, with some loose gunpowder in the pocket.</p>

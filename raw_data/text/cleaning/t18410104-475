                  </hi>. I am the son of Mary Mayes, and drive her wagon—she lives at Sudbury. On the 26th of December I was stopping at the Queen's Head public-house, in St. John's-street, to take up some corn for my horses—my wagon was covered, and the tail-board Was secured up—the hamper, containing these bottles and spirits, was in the hind part of the wagon—I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, on the ladder up behind—he had no business there—I asked what he wanted—he had this hamper in his hand—he dropped it, and tried to make his escape—I collared him—we scuffled together—one of his companions came and tripped my heels up—we went down together, and after that another of his companions came and kicked me in the face—as soon as the policeman was called, the others got off, but I held the prisoner—the hamper contained what is stated in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A. Rather so; I never lost sight of him - he turned two turnings, and was taken in Gracechurch-street, but I was further from the wall than him, and did not lose sight of him; I was three or four yards from him, opposite the corner - he was in dark clothes; I am sure he is the man - I saw him the whole time; nobody else was running - he turned to the left into Eastcheap, and to the right to Gracechurch-street.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was passing down Fish-street-hill, and heard a cry of Stop thief! the prisoner ran towards me - Saunders was pursuing, not above seven or eight yards behind; nobody was before them - he had not got the coat when I stopped him; it was afterwards produced, and claimed by Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark? A. No, the gas was lighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Cannon-street, and on crossing over I saw a number of people running - I went to see what was the matter, and accidentally ran against the Policeman; my hat fell off, and I fell down - this man charged me with stealing the coat; if any body else had happened to have fallen they might have said so.</p>

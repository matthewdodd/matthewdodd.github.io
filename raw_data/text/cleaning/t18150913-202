            . I am a baker, and live in the Minories. The fire broke out at a little after nine o'clock, at the back of Mr. Wilson's; I went to assist him; and when I came back, my house was full of furniture. In about ten minutes, both the prisoners came in; Howard pretended that he was a sufferer in the fire, and that almost all the furniture there was his. He asked me for an old hat; I offered him one all over flour, but he did not choose that. He asked me to lend him a one-pound note to pay the men who had been assisting him to move his goods. Pepperidge was with him, and brought in some of the things; I told him a little beer would be quite enough to give the men, and lent him five shillings; he then wanted to sleep in my house; but I could not let him do that. The next morning, they both came about eight o'clock, and claimed all the things that were there, chairs, tables, sheets, chest of drawers, and such like; they brought porters with them, with knotts, straps, and ropes, to carry every thing away. At first, I did not object to it; but soon after, the real owners came, and then it was discovered. Howard was then taken to the watchhouse, and Pepperidge went away.</p>

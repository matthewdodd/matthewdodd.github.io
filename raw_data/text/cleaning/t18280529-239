I met the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 4th of May, about ten o'clock, at the top of East-street, Hoxton, about two hundred yards from Mr. Salter's with a bundle - I asked what was in it, he said some washing; I took it from under his arm, and seeing some hair and the rest of these articles in it, I took him to the watch-house.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of May, I went out at four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving my door on the single lock; I came home about eleven o'clock at night - I had drunk rather more than had done me good; the door was locked - I went in and went up to bed - my wife perceived the things disturbed; we had left nobody at home; we looked and missed these articles from the first-floor front room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been drinking before you left home? A. I had taken a little - I know I pulled the door too.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elizabeth-street, Dorset-street, Ratcliff. On the last Saturday evening in Nov., about six o'clock, I was coming home with some grocery, and by the railway I saw two boys running with a great bundle between them—one of the boys was about seventeen or eighteen years old—I do not know either of them; it was so very dark I could not see their faces—they were abort forty yards from the prosecutor's house, coming as from Stepney-causeway—that does not lead from the prosecutor's—they were going at the side, not going by it—about ten minutes afterwards my mother sent me out for some bread, and as I came back I saw another boy at the same place, by the rail<lb></lb>way, with a blanket rolled under his arm—it was a person about the same size as Allen.</p>

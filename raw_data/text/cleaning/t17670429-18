I asked him for my watch; he said he had not got it. I charged the constable with him, and we were both put in the watch-house all night; after that a watchman brought in the watch with the glass broke; I paid him for finding it; he still denied that he ever had it; his hand was cut, and he said I cut it, but we found a knife in his pocket bloody.</p>

            . This is my handkerchief; I live at No. 89, Cheapside. On the 10th of June, I was walking up Ludgate-hill - I heard an alarm given, and then missed my handkerchief - I went to the watch-house and saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain of it? A. Quite</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing along, and heard the cry of stop thief; I was coming down Fleet-street from Drury-lane - I heard the alarm, and ran with the people, and got eighty or ninety yards a-head; this lad was in Bridge-street; I was going up the steps by St. Bride's church - Mr. Green and two gentlemen took hold of me, and in about four minutes this lad came up; I was taken to the watch-house - I did not have the handkerchief, nor had I seen it till it was produced at the watch-house; a handkerchief was picked up in a crowd of one hundred and fifty persons - this officer is the father of the lad, and most probably (while having been here), he has instructing him what to say on my trial - he has false-sworn himself.</p>

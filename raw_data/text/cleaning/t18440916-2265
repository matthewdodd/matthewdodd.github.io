                  </hi>. I am clerk to the churchwardens and vestry<lb></lb>men of the united parish of St. Margaret, Westminster, and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster. Mr. William Bent is one of them, and there are others—they are governors of the poor—the prisoner was employed by them as collector of the poor-rates—he has been so for many years—I have the poor-rate book here for the year 1843—the rate is made annually, and col<lb></lb>lected in three instalments—it was the regular course of business to give the prisoner a copy of the rate for the purpose of his carrying it in his pocket to go about to collect the rate—that was done with respect to the rate for 1843—I saw him with the book in his possession, and there were always blank printed forms of receipts given him to give to the parties who paid the rates—it was his duty to pay the money he received to the bankers—here is the printed account of the rules and regulations—it is printed in the head of the book which is given him to collect with—I have here the book in which it was his custom to enter the sums he received in the course of each week—the week ending on the 4th of May last, is the last account which he rendered to me—here is the account of what he charged himself with having received in the preceding week—it was his duty to render that account to me every week, and he did so every week; and upon my checking it with his account, it was his custom to pay the money into the bankers'; and then it was his duty to bring me the receipt from the bankers', to show that he had paid it in—on the week ending the 4th of May, he charges himself with having re<lb></lb>ceived 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought that account to me on Monday the 6th of May—he did not bring me a receipt showing that he had paid this amount into the banker's—in consequence of that, I went in pursuance of directions, and saw the prisoner at his house on Tuesday, the 7th of May—I asked him the reason this money had not been paid in—he hesitated some time, and then said he had not paid it in—I then said, "Is that all, is there nothing else; there are some large amounts outstanding; have any of these been re<lb></lb>ceived?"—he said, "They have"—he came to me on the following evening, and dictated to me a list of the sums in which he was a defaulter—the sums which he had received, and not accounted for—they amounted to 538<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that included the 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Daniel Owen, of Great Coram-street. It is his dwelling-house—he does not live in it himself, tort his assistants and servants do—it is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury—Mr. Owen has a bed-room there, and sleeps there occasionally—he is a linen-draper—on the 26th of May, about half-past eight o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came into the shop with another man—the prisoner walked to the further end of the counter—I was in the window when he came in—I went round the counter to him—the other man and the prisoner were toge<lb></lb>ther—the other asked for some green silk, to make a shade—I sold him ft quarter of a yard—he asked for tome ribbon—I went to get it, and wh"ti came back I saw they were rather uneasy—I began making out the bill, and they both stood up—the other man stood between me and the prisoner—I said, "I wish to see what that gentleman (meaning the prisoner) has under his cloak"—I suspected he had something—he had then gone a little way from the counter or table—he had receded back—after I addressed him a second time he replaced this piece of satin upon the table—he had taken it from the shelves—I did not see him take it, but I saw the place where it had been taken from—I saw him put the satin and his cloak upon the table, and when he took his cloak up there was the piece of satin—I could not see him put the satin upon the table—I saw the cloak lifted up, and then I saw the satin—I swear the satin was not there before he put the cloak down—I called another shopman, and he came—I told him, in the prisoner's hearing, that that gentleman had had a piece of satin under his cloak—the prisoner said it was a mistake—he kept continually saying the same till they got to the door, and then he and the other man ran away in different directions—the other man gave me half-a-crown to pay for what he bought, which came to 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not wait for his change—I pursued the prisoner—he ran to the Colonnade in Brunswick-square—I was returning home and met an officer,</p>

               <p>who took him—I know this satin is Mr. Owen's—there are sixty-eight yards of it—it had been kept upon the shelves—after I saw it upon the table I looked up to the shelves and missed it from there—it was a table I was serving at—he could get at the shelves by going round.</p>

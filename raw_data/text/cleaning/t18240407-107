On the 26th March, about twelve o'clock, I was wheeling gravel, nearly opposite his house, and observed Donahu and two others at play. I watched them for a few minutes, and then saw one, less than either of the prisoners, go from them, and walk by Harris's house, then return, and go into the shop, he came out in a minute or two, with something bulky under his coat, he joined the other two, who were fifty or sixty yards off, and all turned out of the road. I gave an alarm - Harris's son joined in the pursuit; I fetched Larkin, and took Donahu in ten minutes; I am certain he was one of them; he was in company with the boy. I saw a decanter in his bosom as I followed him, saw him take it out, and put it on the coping of a wall. I took it up, followed, and never lost sight of him afterwards.</p>

             sworn. - I am in partnership with Robert Jackson, in the ironmongery business.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dwelling-house is this? - A. It is more properly warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any one sleep in the place where these things were taken from? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. None of your servants? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? - A. From October, 1795; he was employed to load, unload, and had the keys of several places, and nobody else; in consequence of information I received, I went on Friday, the 8th of September, to see the execution of a search-warrant; I went with Carpmeal and Miller to both houses; I saw the things found in Prince's-street; the tinder-box has our mark upon it; as to the plated wire, we had such, but never made use of it; I was present also, when the things were found at Temple street; this pruning-knife has our shop-mark, these fireirons are extraordinary good, case hardened, and such as we had in our shop; but in our warehouses it is impossible to miss them; here are thirty-nine tiles that corresponds exactly with what we lost; they were brought for the purpose of making an oven for Government, and there are several pieces of wood that have our marks upon them; here is a washing-tub, with our shop-mark to it; I saw the prisoner at Mr. Carpmeal's house, and informed him we had found these things; he told me, that I had told him he might take what he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him so? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Jackson has retired from business, has he not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not allow him an annuity? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not allow him a certain stipulated sum every year? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you get three thousand or three hundred a year, he has exactly the same sum? - A. Yes; but if I become a bankrupt, every shilling of his must come forward, and he acts in the business every day, from five in the morning, till eight at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Whatever losses are sustained in the trade, fall upon you intirely? - A. Yes.</p>

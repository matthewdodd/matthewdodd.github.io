Two ran down Warwick-lane, one up, and the other down Newgate-street. I followed the two down Warwick-lane, suspecting one of them had picked my pocket. I had not followed them above fifty yards, before I saw a handkerchief in one of their hands. I called out Stop thief! and at the entrance of Warwick-square he was stopped by the watchman - it was the prisoner. He said he had not got it, nor did he pick my pocket, and I might search him. I said he must have thrown it down very near that place; I went back a few yards, and found it on the ground. I never lost sight of him after I saw it in his hand.</p>

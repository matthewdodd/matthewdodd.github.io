On the 9th of March, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Portland-road, and saw the two prisoners—they passed me—I saw their dresses hanging very loose and confused about their persons—I followed them a few yards, and then asked what they had got—Watts said she thought it very</p>

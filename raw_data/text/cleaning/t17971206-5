               <p>Court. Q. By a fair blow, or did he shove you down? - A. A fair blow; he struck me somewhere about the breast; then I caught him again, and knocked him down; he had then got into Thames-street, there I got assistance and secured him; he had left the bladder behind him, it was fixed to the cask; I went after the bladder, and there were seven pints in it; it was then in the custody of Mr. Gower.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bladder that you saw when you came back, like that which you first saw in the prisoner's hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fixed to the cask? - A. There was a plug put into the cask, and a quill fixed in the neck of the bladder, and put in where the plug was, and then there was another hole made at the top of the cask for vent.</p>

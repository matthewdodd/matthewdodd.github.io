            . I live in Regent-circus, Piccadilly.

               <p>Jones. Q. Did you see me throw the handkerchief away? A. No; you were all three together - I had heard so much of Barking, I was anxious to pass them; I saw them together for five minutes - they seemed in conversation lowly, but were not arm-in-arm.</p>

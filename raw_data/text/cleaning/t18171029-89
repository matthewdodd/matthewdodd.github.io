               <p>JOHN LANGFIELD. I am a constable. On the 6th of October I went with Mr. Wickham and his wife to the lodgings of Sarah Troup, sen., in Gilbert-street. The prosecutrix charged Troup, jun. with stealing a 20l. note out of her looking-glass drawer. I asked her if she knew any thing about it? she said, No. I searched William Troup, the husband, and found nothing on him. While I was searching him, Troup, sen. threw something into the fire-Wickham said the 20l. note was thrown into the fire - I immediately went to the fire, and took out a piece of brown paper, which contained a key; the looking-glass was brought to the room - I tried the key to the drawer, it opened it. I searched Troup, sen., and found a 1l. note and 9s.6d on her - I found two sixpences on Troup, jun. I searched the apartments-on a shelf I found a tea-caddy. Troup, jun. said there was nothing in it, and I had no occasion to take it down. I took it down, and found a 1l. note and a pair of ear-rings in it; the prosecutrix claimed them, and the 1l. note also. I turned down a bureau bedstead, and found a shift and two pair of stockings, which the prosecutrix also claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were two beds in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the bureau bedstead belonged to the younger prisoner - A. I do not know - She claimed the tea-caddy.

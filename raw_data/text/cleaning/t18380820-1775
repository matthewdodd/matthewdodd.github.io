                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the house, No. 62, Alders<lb></lb>gate-street, in the parish of St. Botolph-without, Aldersgate. The pri<lb></lb>soner has been in my service about eleven days, in consequence of the ill<lb></lb>ness of my other servant—on Sunday, July 22, I went out about one o'clock, and returned about half-past eight—I was informed she was not at home—I went up to her bed-room, and found the servant's box broken open, and her things apparently gone—I went immediately to my bed, room, and found my bureau broken open, and missed sixteen sovereigns, a half—sovereign, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a necklace, a pocket-handkerchief, and shawl—the prisoner was brought home with some of the articles, on The Monday.</p>

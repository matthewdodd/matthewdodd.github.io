               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. When did you make the memorandum? A. Some time before I lost it - I took it from the note itself - the prisoner had been in the service five or six months - the Colonel had a good character with him - the trunk was in the servants' hall, which other persons had access to. I am certain I left the note in the pocket-book - I spoke to him immediately I missed it - that was three or four days after I had seen it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough street. I had information of this - I went to Canterbury, and arrived there on Sunday, the 11th of September, and received the prisoner in custody there from the gaol, in con - sequence of a statement in the "Hue and Cry" - I told him what I took him for - he said he found the note against the hall door, and changed it, and he thought his father had made it good - that he bought a watch; which I took out of pawn at Canterbury - he was in a respectable situation at Canterbury, and bore a very good character there.</p>
               <p>MR. HOPKINS. I am clerk in the Cashier's department in the Bank. This note was paid by me in July - I have a memorandum of it, which I took from the bank book, I made it myself - it was paid in July - it is dated the 22nd of June, 1833.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any other of the same number? A. There are never two notes of the same number and date.</p>

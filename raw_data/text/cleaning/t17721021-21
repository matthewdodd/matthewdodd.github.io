I struck the man that was in the middle very hard, and wrenched myself from all the rest; they all fell upon me; I had a small stick in my hand, which in the scuffle they broke I had the thick end in my hand, and one of them had the other end, and struck me with it on the head; I struck one very hard with the bit I had in my hand; then one of them said shoot him, and I expected they would, but they did not produce any arms; seeing they had no arms, I attacked them, and they all run away; I pursued as far as Newington Green, which was about two thirds over that field and another; there is a place called Spring Gardens, Ward endeavoured to escape me there, by getting through the gate, and putting it to, but I got hold of him. Some people that came from Newington Green stopt the other two.</p>

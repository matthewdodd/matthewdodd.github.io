On the night of the 31st of July, about eleven o'clock, I was returning home in St. George's-road, and was suddenly knocked down, and, when down, I found the prisoner in the act of taking my watch out of my pocket—I called out "Police," and tried to take the watch from him—he held the Watch, and I held the seals, until Lee came up—there were two persons attacked me—the one who got away knocked me down, and the prisoner took my watch—I am certain he is the man—the watch produced is mine—I am certain.</p>

Walters"—it appeared to have been meddled with—I made a mark on my invoice, and it was re-weighed.</p>

               <p>Shackell to the shop of Hampton and Russell, upholsterers, in Leicester-square, and saw this piece of stuff in the window, exposed for sale—there was no ticket on it—I went into the shop and asked the price of it of a shop<lb></lb>man—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard," which was remarkably cheap—I saw Mr. Russell afterwards, and told him it was stolen—in consequence of what he said, I went after Jones, and took him into custody the next morning—I told him I believed he had sold some tabouret in Leicester-square, a short time back—he said, "Yes; I did"—I asked him how much he had for it—he said he could not recollect what he received for it—I said, "I am bound to ask you where you got it from, for it is stolen"—he said, "Well, I had it from a man of the name of Lucas; he had it to sell"—I then asked where Lucas got it from—he said Lucas made such goods—I told him he did not, for I had known him many years in the coach-trimming line, and he did not make such things—he then said, "Well, he had job lots in exchange for other goods"—I said, "This is a job lot; it was stolen, and I must detain you"—I then went with Shackell to Lucas's house, in Edward-street, Bethnal-green—I saw him there—he knew me—I told him I was come to speak to him about a piece of silk goods, that he had let a man named Jones have to sell—he said, "What piece of goods?

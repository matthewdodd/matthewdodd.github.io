            . I am a smith, I live opposite of Mr. Brown's shop. On the 25th of February, between two and three in the afternoon, I saw Green and Britten, and a little boy was with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that they are the two persons. - A. Yes, I know them to be three suspicious characters; I followed them from Clark's-place to Islington church; they returned to Clark's-place again, the little one that got away went into this shop and got this baize; the little boy went up the steps, the biggest stood against the door post, and the little one in a brown jacket clapped this green baize into the big one's arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up the steps strait or creep up. - A. He crept up so as they could not see him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the tall one stand against the doorpost. - A. Yes, his name is Green, Britten was standing close by him; I saw the little one take this piece of green baize and put it into Green's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see from what part he drew away that baize. - A. I thought it was a yard or two from the door post; it was standing upright when Green had got it in his possession; they all three made off together. I pursued them about twenty yards from the shop, and took Green in custody with the baize under his arm. A relation of mine came up at the time and took Britten.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the green baize in your custody ever since. - A. Yes, it is the same that I saw these boys take out of the shop.</p>

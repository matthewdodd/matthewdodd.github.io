            , I am son-in-law to Mr. Robbins: my mother waked me; I jumped up, opened the window, and saw the prisoner run from the house; I put my shoes, stockings, and breeches on: I went out and saw a man behind an elm tree; I went after him; I traced him as far as Davis's; there I got intelligence of him, and then took him at the Black Lion, at Kingsbury; there were three more, which three were in the house; whether those two were in the house or no I cannot tell; the house is a lone house 30 yards out of the lane, and a considerable way out of the high road; there is no other house near it. When I took him, his white stockings were all wet and dirty, seemingly as if he had been going through wet grass. I am sure the man I took at Kilburn is the same man I saw at the door; I know him by the clothes, and one shoulder was higher than the other.</p>

            . I lie in the room over the room where the people got in; I was waked by a cluttering at the window; I saw three men in the house, neither of whom were the prisoner. I heard them unlock the door, and heard them afterwards go out; I saw these three men turn round the corner by the yard, and immediately afterwards the prisoner went away from the wall of the house and went straight forward.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 8th December, I was with John Coppick; and we went to the Blue-coat-boy at Islington, at half-past eleven at night - I was not drunk - we had one quartern of gin there - we stopped four or five minutes - we were then going on - I then saw the prisoner; but I had not noticed him in the house - he told my friend he would see the old gentleman home - he laid hold of my arm, and we walked down <placeName id="t18340102-44-crimeloc246">St. John-street-road</placeName>

               <p>JOHN COPPICK. I was with the prosecutor - I can corroborate what he has said - I knew nothing of the transaction till he said he had lost his watch - he dropped his umbrella, and pursued, and took the prisoner - the prisoner denied having the watch till the officer came up, and then he gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

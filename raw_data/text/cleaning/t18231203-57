I never authorized him to pawn any goods for me, nor ever knew that he did. I have his cash-book made up to the 4th of November - there is no entry of any sum of money received for the goods stated in the indictment - he made the cash-book up on the 5th of November, at my request. I said "Is everything included?" He said "Yes; everything." I counted what money I had in my pocket, and said, "You cannot be correct, as I am 4 l. short." He then wrote the memorandum of it. I was once told, on my return from the country, that 12 l. 13 s. had been borrowed from a friend to pay a bill - he never intimated that it was a pledge. I made no reply - he was to pay it out of my property. On the 5th of November his desk was opened - Read took what duplicates were in the small box, and Lee those in the desk - they led me to different pawnbrokers, who are here - he has not given credit in the book for any of these articles.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. On the 19th of July two pieces of Irish were pawned with me in the name of Hughes, by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew the prisoner very well - A. Yes; I knew his name, and where he lived, for I had his card, which he gave me at a former transaction. I put H on the ticket, for housekeeper. I did not know that Mr. Vipond occupied the house.</p>
               <p>MR. VIPOND. This is my linen - I was not in want of money in July - I have frequently lent the prisoner's brother-in-law money, and the prisoner knew that - I lent him 40 l. about that time. Since I have been in Hatton-garden I have never been in want of money - I have had 100 l. in my pocket for months together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever fail in trade - A. Yes, in 1820. I had prosecuted one Oldfield about that time, for keeping a gaming-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At which you had been a player - A. Never in my life - I do not know whether he was ever brought up for judgment - I left it with my solicitor. A servant of mine had squandered my money there, and so I prosecuted him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Oldfield was never brought up for judgment, and that the Attorney-General has himself interfered to bring him up - A. I do not know it - I never attempted to have him brought up - I was never informed of any goods being pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is an entry of 34 l. on the 21st of July, what means had he of receiving that sum - A. It appears by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030031"></xptr>the book to be received by the collectors out of doors from 260 people. I have no petty cash books; his wife keeps a house-keeping book; there are no credit entries in it. I heard Marshall examined in the last case. I never applied to him for goods till after the prisoner was apprehended. The prisoner bought the blankets for me, and the invoice was made in my name; if he became responsible, it is without my knowledge; I paid for them. My private mark is on this linen. I never sell whole pieces of this quality; my stock was taken some time in July.</p>
               <p>NICHOLLS re-examined. I have some cloth pawned for 1 l., and a remnant of cloth and kerseymere for 3 l. I gave the persons the duplicates produced.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker and live in Holborn-row. On the 9th of November 1822, two scarfs were pawned in the name of Jones for 2 l. On the 14th of June 1823, a piece of linen for 30 s., and two pieces on the same day for 2 l., in the name of Jackson, and on the 27th of September, eighteen yards of silk for 25 s., and fourteen yards for 20 s.; and on the 13th of August, thirteen yards of cotten for 16 s.; the corresponding duplicates are here.</p>
               <p>MR. VIPOND. These articles are mine, and have my private mark on them; the stock was taken by the prisoner, and the account left in his hands to be cast up; he has never returned it to me; if they had been sold, they should be entered in a book. I find two pieces of silk corresponding in length with hese, which are entered in a fictitious name.</p>
               <p>Q. Could all these goods go out of your stock without your knowledge - A. Yes, because they were taken at different times. I missed the twenty shawls, and asked him for them; he said they were gone upon approbation to Mr. Evans, his brother-in-law, they are entered on approbation to Evans.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a situation of two hundred guineas a year, and left it to go with him. We had fifty interviews; he always said I was to have half the business: he did not wish my name to appear, as I had take the benefit of the Insolvent Act; he said he had plenty of money to live on, and would go down and live with his family. On the 4th of November he laid a trap for me; he said he wished me to balance the cash; he always had the balance in his own hands. I had none, he is indebted to me above 100 l. for money paid on the partnership account; he has kept the book from me for the purpose of getting me out of this comfortable business.</p>

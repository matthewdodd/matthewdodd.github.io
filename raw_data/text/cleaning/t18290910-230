On the 24th of July, between seven and eight o'clock the prisoner came into the coffee-house as a customer; I was serving - he called for a go of rum, which I gave him and a silver tea-spoon with it; a person afterwards came in who I had seen in his company the night before, when we had lost four spoons - his companion had a go of whiskey; we had other customers in the room - they staid till ten, had supper, and two more goes after, and had four spoons altogether - I missed two before they left the house; they had the tavern mark on them - they went out together; I followed them out, pretending to go to see the time - I came up with them, caught hold of the prisoner, and the watchman took hold of the other; I had given him information before they left - they wanted to know what charge I had against them; I said I would let them know when we got over to the watch-house - before we got there, one spoon was found with the tavern mark on it: I had seen the prisoner attempt to throw it away - only one has been found: the prisoner said he had taken it up with his handkerchief by mistake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you brought the glass of liquor did you not observe my handkerchief on the table? A. I did not; I noticed his hat on the table and saw him playing with the spoon in his hand, while his hat was on the table - we were going to discharge all the servants on account of losing so much plate.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a barrister. I was at the coffee-house, and in consequence of information from the last witness I followed the prisoner and the other out; and when we got about two yards into the street, they were stopped by Argent and the watchman - I happened to be about a yard behind the prisoner, and saw his right hand coming out of his coat pocket with a white handkerchief in it, and the end of the spoon peeping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100113"></xptr>out of the handkerchief - I immediately collared him, caught his hand, and held it with the handkerchief in it; I said, "You will see the spoon here," and took it out of his hand - he held out his hand, and said, "Oh, I have got nothing."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you recollect saying at Guiddhall that when you took the spoon out of my hand that you said, "That is not it?" A. I did not say so - I marked the spoon with my initials, and gave it to the officer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he had placed his handkerchief on the table to prevent his coat-sleeve from getting wet, and on replacing it in his pocket, he was unconscious of the spoon being there.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Clarke. I and him were engaged in the back shop - I heard a noise in the front shop, and saw the prisoner going out with the boots in his hand; he turned round, and immediately ran out -I pursued him; he went about two doors from the shop, saw me following, and immediately ran - I am quite certain he is the person; he ran down Poppin's-court - I saw him stopped at the bottom of it - it leads to Harp-alley; he dropped the boots in the middle of the court: there were two pairs - there was nobody in the front shop; I have not the slightest doubt of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to John Tennant, Esq., of Albemarle-street. On the 12th of July I was in Piccadilly—the prisoner accosted me, and said she would go with me—I told her she could not—she said she would go where I was going—I went and drank with her at a public-house—we then went to Jermyn-street—she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse, containing three sovereigns and six shillings—I gave the alarm, and ran after her—the policeman secured her—I was knocked down by two men when I gave the alarm.</p>

At a quarter before eleven o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running down Jermyn-street, towards York-street—I ran after her, and took her—the prosecutor was behind me—I believe he was knocked down—I overtook the prisoner in St. James's-square—she was willing to go to the station, and said, "Search me."</p>

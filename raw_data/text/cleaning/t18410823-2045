On the night of the 15th of July, I was on duty in St. Giles's, and saw the prisoners a few minutes be<lb></lb>fore twelve o'clock, and another young man with them—I was then at the corner of Bainbridge-street, and they were at the opposite side of High-street, near Crown-street—in consequence of something, I came towards Bain-bridge-street again sooner than I should have done—when I got near Lau<lb></lb>rence-street, I heard the screams of a female—I went towards them into High-street, and saw the two prisoners, and another not in custody, close on a female—Patten had his arms round her neck—he appeared to be try<lb></lb>ing to throw her down, from the distance I was off, I was in the middle of the road, but he let go—Taylor struck her in the face, and said with an oath, "Go on"—she fell down, and he kicked her in the body, about the hip—I took hold of Taylor, took out my rattle, sprung it, and seized Taylor and Patten at the same time—Taylor said with an oath, what did I stop him for, and directly struck me in the mouth—Patten stood by.—I did not allow him to depart—another constable came in a minute or two, and took him into custody—I told him not to go—he could not have gone, because I should have seized him—after great resistance we took Taylor to the station—I had seen Taylor strike the prosecutrix in the face once, or twice, or three times—his hand was moving—she went down in the struggle, and he kicked her—I do not know what became of the prosecutrix, but when we got to the station she was there—her face and head were cut dreadfully—her mouth was bleeding, and a little swollen, and</p>

                  </hi>. I live at York-cottage, Kensall-road. The prisoner is my husband—we have been married twenty-six years, but we have not been living comfortably together for the last six years, as he has not been employed in mind or business, and has been intemperate in his habits—he has used threats to me several times—about Christmas last he asked me for some money, and words arose from that at the time, and he had a pistol in his breast from 7 o'clock all the evening; I went down stairs, and was afraid to go down again, and I stopped till one of the women fetched my son home, and then I opened the prisoner's coat and showed my son the pistol, and told him that his father had got it there to blow out my brains—the prisoner told me that if I did not get out of the way, or something of that kind, be would blow my brains out; but it is some time ago, and I do not wish to say</p>

               <p>anything but what I can call to mind—on Wednesday, May 25th, I returned home between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, and found my husband moving the mattrass that I had taken from his feather bed, because be had told me the day before that I must look d—d sharp if I had a chance to take care of myself, and I was afraid to sleep with him—he was taking away the mattrass which I had put for my own bed to make up his bed, and I said, "John, how can you expect I can do my work, if you will not let me have my bed?—he said, "There is your bed, come to it;" and I said, "No; so long as you use such expressions to me, I never can come to your bed"—I then went down stairs into the back washhouse—I was coming out of the washhouse with a candle in my hand, and he was coming down stairs; I saw something like a pistol buttoned under his coat as he came down—I went into the parlour where Mrs. Pusey and Ruth were, and made a communication to Mrs. Pusey—I then sent Ruth to fetch a jog out of the kitchen, and then went to draw some beer at a little cupboard under the stairs; I heard the prisoner's foot, put my head out of the cupboard, and he was close to me with the pistol in my face; I struck the barrel with my right hand, and said "John, don't shoot me!"—I screamed out "Mrs. Pusey, he is shooting me!" and she was there in an instant—I said, "Keep the pistol down, Mrs. Pusey," which she did—my husband seized me by the neck, and I came to the ground—I recollect creeping under his legs to get away, and Mrs. Walker came in and released me—at the time the pistol was presented at me, I heard the snap of the flint, but saw no fire—my hand was cut with the flint in two places, as I got hold of the pistol close up to the lock—it was the same pistol which he had before; he had had it some time—I believe he was sober—I ran for protection into a neighbour's house.</p>

On 25th May, I was in the parlour between 9 and 10 o'clock, and heard the snap of something; Mrs. Yates screamed out that she was being shot—I went, and saw Mr. and Mrs. Yates struggling with a pistol—I caught hold of the pistol to prevent his shooting her—she begged of me to keep it down, which I did—he tried to get it from me—he got his wife by the throat with his left hand—Mrs. Walker then came in, and took the prisoner's hand from his wife's throat, and she ran out at the front door—the prisoner asked which way she was gone; and I said "Out the back way," oh purpose to deceive him.</p>

I have lived with Mrs. Yates about three months up to the present time, and have heard Mr. Yates and her quarrelling—when I had been there about three weeks I was sleeping underneath the room they slept in, and heard something rattling overhead, and loud speaking between Mr. and Mrs. Yates—I went to the bedroom, and said, "Is anything the matter? Is any one ill?"—Mr. Yates said, "No;" but Mrs. Yates said, "Something is the matter, and pushed open the door, and I saw Mr. Yates standing with a stick in his hand—as I was standing in the landing I beard him say that if she left the room she should leave it a corpse—on Wednesday evening, 25th May, I went into the other room to get a jug for Mrs. Yates, and saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner standing there with his elbows on the mantelpiece, and a pistol in his breast; he had his hand on it; it was under his coat, but I could not see the handle of it—when he saw me go in the room he removed his hand from his pocket—I brought the jug to Mrs. Yates, and went into the parlour, and after some time I heard the snap of a pistol; I am sure of that—I then heard Mrs. Yates say, "Oh, Mrs. Pusey, he is shooting me!"—I went into the passage to see what it was, and Mrs. Pusey went down—I saw them struggling, and opened the street door, and went for a policeman—when I returned the prisoner was in custody.</p>

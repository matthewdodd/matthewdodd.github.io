            . I had country lodgings at Mr. Poe's at Islington; there came a journeyman carpenter one morning, and said he had seen the prisoner and Duncomb over night, with a jack going into Old-street; he suspected they had stole it; two or three days after, Duncomb came into the house; Mr. Poe sent for a constable, and took him before justice Welch; he confessed before we went there, and also before the justice, that he and the prisoner had stole that, and what he is now charged with, from out of Mr. Poe's premises, and had sold them to Thralkill. I went to Thralkill and asked him about it; he owned he had bought several things of Duncomb.</p>

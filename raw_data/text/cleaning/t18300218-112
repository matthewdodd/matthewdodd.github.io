I have said all that I could to him, but am afraid to no purpose. I have taken this plan to mention it to prevent any person from hearing the conversation; a few moments conversation with you would be advisable, away from the house. - I am Sir, your most obedient.</p>

               <p>MORGAN ORAM. On the 6th of January I went to the 2s. gallery at Drury-lane theatre with two little boys - there was a very great crowd at the door: the prisoner was there - he called out to another soldier, "Houston, this person has assaulted me;" I said, "It is false if you say so; any more than being pushed against you, which you know was the effect of accident, the crowd being so great"- I was then holding the youngest boy with my two hands to prevent his being hurt in the crowd; the other boy was further on - the other soldier turned round and said,"Never mind now, stop till bye and bye:" after a little while, he turned round again, winked at the prisoner, and said "Keep your eye upon him;" this was before the doors opened, and just as the doors opened he said, "Take off his excommunication;" the doors opened, there was a great rush, and the little boy cried out - I said to the prisoner, "Do take care, and don't hurt him;" he immediately took him up in his arms, and said he would take him into the theatre - I took some money out of my pocket to give the prisoner to pay for the boy's admission and in my confusion I gave him the 6s. 6d., which was all I had in my pocket - when I got to the pay-place I told the eldest boy he must wait there while I went back for some more money, as I had given it all to the soldier, or had dropped it - the prisoner took the little boy into the theatre, and I went back for more money; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I went back, and took the elder boy into the theatre - I looked for the prisoner, on account of his having the child, and saw him about half way down the gallery, sitting by the side of the little boy - the gallery was so full I could not get near him at all, but I called to him, and told him to take care of the boy till the play was over; which he did, and when it was over, he brought him to me - I gave the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180053"></xptr>something, but I am not certain what it was, "I was so agitated from the threats he had made use of in the first place - he did not make use of any then; I took the two boys home to the City - nothing else passed between the prisoner and I on that occasion; I have no idea what I gave him - it was a little change; on the Friday following the prisoner brought me a letter to No. 6, Tavistock-street, where I live - he had not known before where I lived; the little boy will state how he came to find me out - when the prisoner brought the letter he said, "Take it, and read it, and come away from the house; I want to speak to you"- I read it, and the officer has it; this is the letter - I went up Charles-street with him, and he said the serjeant obliged him to come to me for some more money, as the paltry sum I had given was not enough - I said it was a shameful and a scandalous thing to come to me for money when he knew he had no charge against me, but being pushed against him - he said he knew that, but he was obliged to come, as his serjeant would not be satisfied without my sending him a couple of sovereigns - I said it was a very hard case indeed, as I had not so much money by me - I had not above a sovereign and 1s. 6d. - he said he could not help it, if I did not send more he should he obliged to come again; and under the threats be made use of, I took out the sovereign and three sixpences, and gave him - I said that was all I had; he said he would try if that would satisfy the serjeant, and walked away with the money. On the Friday following a little boy brought two letters, one inclosed in the other, nearly to the same purport as the other was - I went out, and found the prisoner in Charles-street waiting for me; he said he was sorry, from his heart, to have to come to me, but his serjeant obliged him to come to get some more money - I said it was a very great shame that he should come in that way for money, when he had acknowledged, the last time he saw me, that he had no charge against me; he said he knew that, but his serjeant obliged him to come, or else he would report him, and he should get flogged - I said he had extorted money from me, and he wanted to extort more - he said he should be sory to do that, but he had had a long walk, he had just come off duty, and he hoped I would give him something - I offered him 2s. 6d. which had been marked; as I had in the mean time told my landlord, who had told a gentleman of it, and this plan had been arranged - the prisoner refused to take the 2s. 6d.; Mr. Tate came up, and took him into custody - he was very much confused, and begged to be let go; Mr. Tate gave him to an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What was the cause of our first interview? A. It was quite accidental - I was pushed against you by the crowd, as any other person might; and that would not have happened if you had not turned almost facing me.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give me? A. Six shillings and sixpence, to pay for the boy, because you took him in your arms - I did not know I gave you the whole 6s. 6d.; I told you to pay for him, nothing else; I certainly said I would see you after the performance, to take the boy home, or words to that effect - when you brought the boy I gave you something, I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, on your examination, deny giving me any thing but the 6s. 6d. at the theatre, and the 1l. 1s. 6d. in the street? A. I could not recollect every circumstance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say you had not given him any other money? A. I believe I said I could not recollect the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the play was over he gave me 10s. in a paper. Witness. I cannot say what it was - I do not recollect putting it in paper; I believe it was in paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you would see him when the play was over? A. To take the little boy of him - I do not know what I gave him, it might be a few shillings - I cannot swear whether it was less or more than 10s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he gave me the 6s. 6d. he said, "Take this, I will give you more after the performance is over, but do not expose me. Witness. I did not say such a word; I said I would see him when it was over, when he was at the pay door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say you would bring more money? A. No, I do not know what I got when I went home - but whatever I gave him was in consequence of the threats he made use of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the examination I asked him what money he gave me when the performance was over, and he said none. Witness. I believe I said I could not recollect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you deny giving him money at the end of the play? A. I believe I said I could not recollect; the push was quite accidental, and not in any indecent manner.</p>

            . My father is a deputy seacoal meter. I went with the witness to Drury-lane theatre on the night of the 6th of January; I saw the prisoner in the street, standing near the door - I heard him say Mr. Oram had assaulted him; Mr. Oram said it was false, it was the crowd pushed him - the prisoner said he had assaulted his person, to the best of my recollection - Mr. Oram was rather behind him; the prisoner said to another soldier, "Come out;" the other said, "Never mind;" the prisoner then said, "Houston keep your eye upon him" - we went into the theatre when the door was opened, which was in about half an hour; I went up stairs rather before Mr. Oram - when he came up, he said he was afraid he had lost his money; I said, "Have you had your pocket picked?" he said he must go back, and get some money; I waited for him - the other little boy is my brother; Mr. Oram came back in about ten minutes, and paid for me and himself - the prisoner took my brother in; I did not take notice how he got money to pay for him - after the play was over the prisoner brought my brother to Mr. Oram, who had waited for them, and Mr. Oram told me to go down and wait for him - he came down with my brother, and joined me; I know of nothing else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you known him? A. About twelve months - he took me to the play because my father had not time to go.</p>

            . On the 15th of January, about half-past three o'clock, Mr. Farrow, of Tavistock-street, who is Mr. Oram's landlord, told me of this circumstance - I stood with him some time, and a boy came into the shop; Mr. Farrow said, "Here is a note on the business I spokeabout"- I said I knew what soldiers were, and I advised Mr. Oram to go and tender the prisoner some marked money, and I should follow, to hear what he said - I followed him, and saw the prisoner join him near the end of Bow-street, they walked up Bow-street, and turned down a passage into Long-acre - I was as close behind them as I could be, without treading on their heels, and could hear their conversation from time to time - I heard Mr. Oram say it was a most false accusation; there was no ground for it, and it was very unjust that he should take the steps he did - the prisoner said he was sorry from his heart or soul, but he was obliged to do it - he did not believe him guilty of the charge, but was compelled to it by the serjeant, (I think;) I followed them into Longacre, and being fearful they might turn down a court, I took the prisoner, as I knew Oram was a timid man - I had seen Oram before this - I should observe, I had seen Oram offer him 2s. 6d., and the prisoner said it would not he worth his while to take so small a sum, as he had come a considerable distance - I took the prisoner, and brought him to Tavistock-street - I was very much excited at the time - a Police-man was sent for, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you known Oram? A. I should think eighteen months, or nearly, from seeing him at Mr. Farrow's.</p>

He said he had come to the house under a pretence of accusing him of taking improper liberties with his person, to get money, and he desired me to take him to the watch-house - the prisoner said, on our way to the watch-house, that the prosecutor had taken improper liberties with his person at the entrance of the theatre, and he confessed he had received some money - I believe he said 6s. at the entrance of the door, then 10s., and then a sovereign, and three sixpences.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night in question, I was at the theatre door, and was insulted by Oram; he gave me this money not to expose him; there was 6s. 6d., which was just sufficient for him and the two boys; he told me when the performance was over he would see me again; I brought the boy out, and he handed me the paper with 10s. in it; he put out his hand, and shook hands with me, and in a low tone of voice he said, "Here is 10s., don't expose me;" I saw no more of him till the day he gave me the 1l. 1s. 6d.; on his examination he denied giving me the 10s., and therefore must be allowed to be a perjured man, which I hope your Lordship will allow me to have the benefit of.</p>

               <p>You must mistake in that, you fixed on a wrong man, did not you? - Yes, I might, very like.</p>
               <p>Did you, Sir, or not? - I did.</p>
               <p>Who did that man turn out to be, that you fixed upon? - A man that seemed to be like the servant.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Do you know his name is Shallard; you fixed on him as the servant, and as the man who carried away your parcel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As the man who met you first in the yard, as the man who walked with you to the corner, as the man that carried away your parcel at last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was mistaken in that man? - They tell me I was.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt? - I do not give any thought of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to say, that you believe the man upon whom you fixed at Bow-street, is the other man that was concerned in this robbery? - No, I do not believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Then you believe you was mistaken? - In that part; I did not see this man at all.</p>
               <p>Was he in the room at the time? - He might or he might not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not he in the room at the time; did you instantly fix on the prisoner in the room? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you believe he was not in the room? - He might have been in the room and yet I not know it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that he was in the room? - He might be in the room.</p>

               <p>Do you believe he was in the room or not? - Well, I believe he was in the room.</p>
               <p>How much is Shallard taller than that man? - A good deal taller.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? - I think he is taller.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that you believe him to be an inch taller than the prisoner? - I certainly will venture to swear that he is taller than this man.</p>
               <p>You said at the beginning that the other was a tall man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you believe Shallard is a tall man or any thing like a tall man? - I say he is taller than the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that? - What a man thinks, and swearing, is a different thing; I swear I believe he is taller.</p>
               <p>How soon were you convinced that he was not the man that had taken away your bundle? - I never took him for the bookkeeper; I walked with the man that took my bundle, some yards, close to him.</p>
               <p>Then you had an opportunity of observing him? - Yes, this man stood with his back at the door, and I looked upon him as the master, and I took strict notice of him; the other man was longer with me; it was not above five or six minutes walk; I observed him so far as the darkness of the night would let me.</p>
               <p>It was a fortnight afterwards before you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to search his lodgings? - No, these things were never found again; I do not know where he was taken; I was not present.</p>

               <p>Whose coach was it? - One Mr. Cuttle's; he lives at Chelsea; his man was taken ill at our house; the Tobitt's Dog, the watering house.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this when they came to you? - Between the hours of nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to, do you recollect? - I went from Saint Paul's to Charing-cross first, then I came back and got half a crown to the Minories; the first fare began at half after three in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Had any of your other fares any bundles? - No Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>Do you often drive? - Not very often; I only put people into coaches, and they very often have bundles.</p>

               <p>Was you present when King pitched on Shallard; you know Shallard well enough. - I was not there.</p>

               <p>I went to order King to attend; I believe he is a servant to Mr. Madan, in the Temple; after he came up to Sir Sampson's, Stone was in the first parlour, at the Brown Bear; and he was desired to go into the parlour to see if he could see any body there; I desired Shallard to go over with him, at last he turned round and said, this is the man (pointing to Shallard); why says I, this is the man that came over with you; he said at Bow-street, that the prisoner was the book-keeper, and that Shallard was the man that took the parcel; Stone was likewise at that time in the room; he was sitting down, but looking up; he never held down his head at all.</p>

               <p>Was you one of those that was pitched upon as having stolen this bundle? - I was, the man made a stand and looked at me; in consequence of that, I looked at him; says he, you are the man; oh! then says I, let us go over the way; then we went over the way and Stone was there.</p>
               <p>N. B. Shallard went into the bar and stood by the prisoner, and appeared almost an inch taller.</p>

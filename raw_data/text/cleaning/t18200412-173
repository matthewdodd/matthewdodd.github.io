             slept in the house on the night of the robbery. The workmen leave about nine o'clock - the door is usually fastened by a bar, which is put across inside - that door communicates with Stonecutter's-alley. The door leading from the warehouse into the yard was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the warehouse on the morning of the robbery - A. I was called up about three o'clock in the morning of the 29th of February, I went to the warehouse, and observed the door leading to the yard open, and a skeleton key in the lock - it appeared they had entered there. I found a crow-bar on the premises; the door was left open. The door leading into Stonecutter's-alley was opened; the bar had been removed inside, it must have been opened inside. There is no access to the yard without getting over the wall, which is about ten feet high - there were marks on it, as if some person had climbed over. I missed three pieces of army cloth, in all about one hundred and thirteen yards. I saw them at Worship-street two days afterwards, and knew them to be ours.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Gate-street; the door of the prosecutors' workshop is in my beat. I tried it at nine and at twelve o'clock, it was safe then. Just before three o'clock in the morning I went up the alley, and saw some men pass by me in Stonecutter's-alley, at different times, and went towards Weston's-park, then up the mews again, and made a run. I wondered what was going to be done. I took my lanthorn, walked gently, and looked down Weston's-park, I there saw the back of a coach, it was yellow - there is a hackney-master lives at the upper end of the park. I went on the left hand, came to Mr. Dolan's warehouse door, and found it open; I then saw a parcel of cloth strewed about the yard by the door. When I got to the door, I saw the coach driving off in a direction towards Searle-street. I immediately sprung my rattle, and went round to Lincoln's Inn-fields. When I came round the corner two watchmen stood there; I desired them to follow the coach - it drove furiously away when I sprung my rattle, and I never got up to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You could not keep up to it - A. No, I was never nearer to it than forty yards, and did not see what was in it.</p>

            . I attend Spitalfields-market, and usually go to business about five o'clock. On Tuesday morning, the 29th of February, about half-past six, I saw a coach in Dorset-street - it was a yellow-bodied coach, and stood before an alley. I took notice of it, as my father supposed there had been a robbery, and saw six or seven young men round it - I noticed two or three of them, and should know them again; I could distinguish Pitt, Dodd, Prussia, and Simpson, and the coachman, which was Hewitt, the prisoner. They stood round the coach, I watched them about a quarter of an hour; then Pitt, who had a white coat on, asked me if I knew where there was a public-house, for he wanted something to drink? I said I did not know of any being open. They found I was watching them, came to the coachman, and he drove round to the end of the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he to pass the end of Crispin-street - A. Yes, to Little Paternoster-row. The men went up the nearer way and met the coach. I followed the men up the alley, and saw the coach right up at the end of the alley. Hewitt got off the box, opened the coach-door, and the men went up and took the cloth out. I think there were two or three more men than I have mentioned. It was woollen cloth. Pitt took one piece out of the coach, and went into Franklin's house, and the others followed with each a piece. I have known Franklin's house a long while. The coachman held the door open for them - the coach was emptied all at once. I did not see Franklin then, his house was not open - he keeps a little broker's shop, I have known him two or three years; the coach remained there. I went and told Gregory, the officer, what had passed; he ran down the court, and saw the men in the room; he sent for Armstrong. Gregory's house is eight or ten doors from Franklin's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Were not the shops open - A. There were none but potatoe-shops open. I was just by the coach, and saw them plainly - it was between dark and light. Franklin generally opens about half-past seven, or eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. You never saw Simpson before - A. No. I particularly noticed them all, and have no doubt of any of them.</p>

            . I am a cooper, and work at the corner of Little Paternoster-row. On the 29th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was going to work, and saw the prisoner, Pitt, who had a light-coloured great-coat on; he came, and walked up Paternoster-row - a short man was with him, it was not any of the prisoners. Pitt went down the alley, and into Franklin's house, alone. I knew the house before, but did not know Franklin. I think the shop was open and the goods at the door. Pitt came out instantly with a blue coat on - he had taken his great-coat off. He walked down Paternoster-row, and was crossing over towards the Ten Bells; at that time I heard the noise of a coach - Gregory and others had stopped the coach. Pitt stood still; the man who was with him was a Jew - when Pitt left, the Jew joined him again. The coach was standing at the Ten Bells door, which is about two hundred yards from Franklin's - it could have got within twenty yards of his house.</p>

            . I am a potatoe-salesman, and lodge with my brother in Spitalfields. In consequence of what I was told, between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I went up Little Paternoster-row, and saw Pitt, Dodd, Simpson, and Prussia inside Franklin's door - the shutters were down then. I saw a coach, which was No. 13, standing at the bottom of Little Paternoster-row. I then went and informed my brother, returned, and found the coach at the Ten Bells, and the coachman at the coach-door. It remained there till about twelve o'clock, and then drove away. I ran and saw an officer come up and open the coach-door, nobody was in it then. I immediately ran to Franklin's house, went in, and saw five or six men in the back-room behind the shop, Franklin was with them - they could see me. I stood there a minute or two, and the men ran out of the side-door into the yard; Franklin came into the shop. I followed them into the yard - they began to get over the wall into a farrier's yard, which communicates with the street. I ran round and saw Simpson, who had got over the wall into the farrier's yard. I saw the four prisoners, excepting the coachman and Franklin, in the yard. There were others, who got away. Simpson was immediately secured, and I took him to the watch-house, the others were also secured. I saw the cloth in Franklin's back-room, where the prisoners were. It was afterwards shewn to Mr. Dolan.</p>

I immediately sent for Armstrong and Van, and about half-past seven I saw Pitt go up to Hewitt, the coachman, and speak to him, he then drove on, and was going to turn his coach back to Franklin's; I followed, called two constables to take him, and I secured Pitt, who was taken to the watch-house. As I came out of the watch-house Armstrong came up, he and I went to Franklin's, and found the cloth in the room behind the shop - it was not at all concealed, and under the cloth was found a white great-coat.

               <p>PITT'S Defence.

Some persons were running - I believe Gregory was running after the men who belonged to the cloth. The boy pointed to me, and they seized me, and took eight 1 l. notes from me.</p>

               <p>FRANKLIN'S Defence. I knew nothing of the property having been stolen. It was brought to my place by the desire of Pitt, and I believe these to be the men who brought it, except the coachman. I did not know what sort of goods were coming.</p>

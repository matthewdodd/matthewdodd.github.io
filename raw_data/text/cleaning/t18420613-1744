On the 31st of May, I had been out to work in the morning, and came home to dinner alone—I went out again after dinner, leaving nobody in my house—my wife was out at work—I locked the house up, and saw every thing was correct and fast—I left the watch on the safe, and the victuals in the safe—I saw the watch safe at ten mi<lb></lb>nutes to two, and went out directly—I was afterwards called from my work, and found my wife had been home—I found the house locked up—when I went in I missed my watch, about a pound of bacon and a loaf of bread from the safe—whoever got in had taken a pane of glass out of the case<lb></lb>ment window—the fastening was just inside the pane—they could undo it then—I sent for the police—search was made for the property, bat it has not been found—I saw the marks of shoe nails on the window cill, I after<lb></lb>wards saw them compared with some boots, and four nails quite corre<lb></lb>sponded with the marks on the cill—I saw the marks before the boots were put on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harmondsworth, which joins Bedfont, and am a farmer. On the 31st of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner on Duke's-river bridge—I did not know him before—I went near to him, and am certain he is the man—he laid down on the wall of the bridge, and seemed watching me—I saw the black cap he had on was of a different colour underneath—I went home, and sat there some time, and saw him watching some people that were hoeing behind the house—I kept watching him at the back door, and saw him looking round, watching—I saw him go into the prosecutor's garden—he opened the gate with his left hand—he had a small bundle in his right hand—he went round the corner of the house out of my sight, but I could see him working his hands about, and in five or six minutes he went round the house, came out on the other side, and came on the bridge again—he then went into the garden again, came round the house again, and as he came round I saw something on his arm—he had been near the window, but when he came out the first time, I saw him go and try the front door, and when he came out of the garden the last time, he had something which he dropped, and stooped to pick up—I took a stick and went after him—he went over the Duke's bridge, and over the Queen's bridge, down the bank, then pulled his round frock off over his head, put some<lb></lb>thing into it, and took it away under his left arm—it made a large bun<lb></lb>dle—I could not follow as fast as he went—I saw him cross the gravel pits, and down Feltham-lane—I directly went to the policeman who was near, and sent him after him, and another man also—I went to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house.</p>

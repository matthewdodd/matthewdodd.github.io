                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Child's Hill-lane, near Crane's. At five minutes past twelve o'clock, on the 22nd of February, I was going to dinner—I saw the two prisoners coming down the lane, about half-a-mile from Crane's—they were going in the direction of Crane's, and as was sitting having my dinner, I saw them cross the field, and Cartwright had a bundle—I sent a little boy to give information—I then went down myself, and found Crane's house open—I went in pursuit of the prisoners—they saw me, and Cartwright dropped the bundle—I still followed, and got two fields further—I then picked up another bundle—I do not know who dropped it—I took them up—they contained these articles, which the prosecutrix identifies—I followed the prisoners to Bell's Eyes, Park-bridge, then to Chalk Farm public-house, then to the Southampton Arms, then to the George at Hampstead, and there we met them coming along—I am sore they are the two men who were together when the bundle said I was mistaken, it was not him, he was at Westminster at the time.</p>

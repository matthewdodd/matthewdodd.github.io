               <p>Q. He would make a noise at any thing passing in the street? - A. Yes; he is quite a little puppy; I came down stairs -</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light at that time? - A. No, it was dark; I had a light in my hand; it is not day-light till about a quarter before seven; I came down and found the street door wide open, and the bar door; the bar door opens into the passage, and the cellar goes down facing the bar door, it had been wrenched open; they had got in at one cellar window, and got out at the other; they are both on my premises, leading into the street; I cannot say whether that was fastened or not; it was put down because people walked over it; then they came up the cellar stairs and broke the cellar door open; I saw the handkerchief and the knife in the bar the night before; I had not seen the money; I called my wife, and she came down, and missed it; Robert Coomes, the officer, apprehended the prisoner, on Thursday following, at Deptford, in the street, I was with him at the time; we found the handkerchief round his neck; we searched him, and found the knife, and ten shillings and four-pence halfpenny in halfpence; we asked him, how he came by the halfpence; I told him, it would be better for him to confess.</p>

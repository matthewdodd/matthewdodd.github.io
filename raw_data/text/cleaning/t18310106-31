            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 17th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in my own boat, between Deptford and Limehouse; I saw a boat alongside of a barge - I rowed towards it, and saw the prisoner in the barge; I looked over, and saw this rope in the barge - I asked the prisoner what he was doing; he made no answer - I said I must take him into custody, and asked what he did with that boat there; he said, "Let me go on shore, and I will put her in a place of safety," but I would not allow him; I stepped into my boat, and he into the other, and rowed together for some distance - I said, "How came you to take the poor man's boat away?" he said, "Don't you know me? my name is Bill Jones, and I belong to the Towerstairs;" I said, "No, you are no waterman;" I got him on shore at the Dog and Duck - he sat down; I called for assistance, and put him into a place of safety; I took the boat and the property to the office, returned, and got him: when I first saw him he was about a mile from the Ocean, to which the rope belongs.</p>

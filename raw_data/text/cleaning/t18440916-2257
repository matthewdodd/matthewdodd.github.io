                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at Southgate, in the parish of Edmonton. About a fortnight before the 2nd of Sept., the prisoners came to the coach stables close to my shop—they came and asked me if there was any conveyance going a Potter's-bar—(I had never seen them berfore)—I said there would be none before five o'clock—they said that would be too long to wait, and asked if there was any public-house where they could get a pot of beer—I said, "Yes," and they said they would walk down the street with me—we went to my sister's who keeps a beer-shop—I remained there my dinner hour, and then went back—we went into the Cherry Tree, and had a quartern of gin—they then bid me good morning, and we parted—on the 2nd of Sept. I saw them again—I saw Taylor first, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, in a horse and cart, opposite my shop, with Mr. Collins, a rat-catcher, who lives at Enfield—I asked Collins about some bricks—they stopped—they afterwards went down the street—I did not see Taylor again till after eight, when he came into my sister's house, which is opposite my house—my shop is a quarter of a mile from my house—Bacon was not there—T ylor came in, called for half-a-pint of beer, and, seeing me there, he said he might as well make it a pint—we had a pint of beer, and, then crossed over to my house—there was a fair at Southgate on that day—my wife and I had before dinner arranged to go to the fair—she was not at home when Taylor and I went over—she was gone to the—I went down to clean myself—I fastened up the house when I left—the shutters were not up—I locked the door, and secured all the places—I quitted the house at a wuarter past eight o'clock—I and Taylor then went to the fair—my mother went with us from the beer—shop—I met Bacon at Consby's beer-shop, close to the fair—(I had seen him before at Consby's that same evening)—he proceeded to the fair with</p>

               <p>us, and there we joined my wife—we went into Pickard's booth—there was dancing going on there—I paid for the prisoners to go in—they said they would settle when we got in—I wanted Bacon to dance with my wife while I went to look after a friend—he wanted me to stop, and then said he would go with me—he did not dance—I heard no conversation between Bacon and Taylor—they left the booth between nine and ten—Taylor left first, and Bacon, I should say, half an hour after—Taylor said nothing to me when he went away—I saw nothing of them afterwards—when I left my house that night, I had in a little box within a trunk a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, fifteen sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns—there were also four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes in another part of the box, and a metal watch hanging by the fire-place in the parlour—we returned home at near twelve o'clock, and missed the property stated in the indictment—the watch had a paper or lining inside, by which I should know it—my watch-maker had given the watch to me between eight and nine that morning—it had been to be repaired—the lining has since been produced to me, and I am certain it is the same—we found everything up stairs all thrown about, and strewed all over the place—I found this screw, belonging to the parlour window, on the floor—it fastened the window from the inside, but the point of it just comes through, so that a person outside, by pressing it, could <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it in—the window was opened, so that anyone could get in—the lock of the door was not disturbed—the entry must have been made by the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 2nd of Sept. I left my house, about six o'clock, to go to the fair at Southgate—I left my husband's metal watch on a small brass bracket under the mantel-shelf—we had a large linen chest up stairs, by the bedside, in which was this little box, which contained a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, fifteen sovereigns, and four half<lb></lb>sovereigns, a piece of paper, and a sixpence—that was all safe when I left the house—I fastened up the house, and gave the key to my husband—I left no one inside—I went out with my little boy—the prisoners and my husband after<lb></lb>wards joined me at the fair about seven o'clock—we went into a booth—my hus<lb></lb>band paid for the prisoners—they said they would pay us again—my husband wanted to come out of the booth to see some friends, and he said to Bacon, "Take charge of my wife, and stand up in the dance"—Bacon said, "Oh, no, you had better, as the dance is commencing, stand up with your wife your<lb></lb>self"—Bacon refused—the moment we got up to dance Bacon disappeared—Taylor left first—they had both left within half an hour after nine o'clock—before they went Bacon was sitting beside my husband—Taylor never sat down at all, but seemed fidgetty—Bacon got up, and whispered very close in Taylor's ear—Bacon, noticing me, looked rather hard, and said, "I merely asked him if he had been playing a trick with my snuff-box"—Taylor said, "Oh, no, it is all right, all right;" and a few minutes after that Taylor dis<lb></lb>appeared—I saw no more of them that evening—we left the booth at eleven o'clock—on going home. I found the parlour window drawn back, and the</p>

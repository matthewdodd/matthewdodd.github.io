            . On the 29th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18140112-83-crimeloc431">Crown-street, Finsbury-square</placeName>

I instantly catched hold of him; he fell down. I still kept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120043"></xptr>hold, and with assistance took him to Worship-street office.</p>

               <p>JACOB LEWIS. I am a carpenter; I live in Crown-street. I saw a mob; a woman had lost her shoe. I heard a person say he has stolen my watch. I saw the prisoner; the prosecutor had caught hold of him. The prisoner said he had not got his property. I called for a light; I dragged the prisoner two feet with intention of taking him into the Flying Horse public-house. I was looking to see if the property was on the ground; I heard something fall. I saw the two seals in question taken up and delivered to the prosecutor. I am sure the prisoner is the same man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are the seals; the chain broke; the watch remained in my pocket. The prisoner never got away from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is against me.</p>

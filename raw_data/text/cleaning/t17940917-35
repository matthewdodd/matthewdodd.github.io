I looked very earnestly at her, supposing she had taken the ribbon, and found she was a good deal embarrassed; seeing this, I immediately listed up her apron, and took a quantity of ribbon from under her apron; with this she withdrew from the counter, and another quantity of ribbon fell on the floor; in consequence of which I took that up also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the ribbon fell from her, or from the counter? - I suppose it fell from the counter, in consequence of her apron being withdrawn from the counter; she appeared so much confused, that she sat down, apparently, very much affected, whilst I called one of the partners,

I know these ribbons by the pattern, they are ribbons so well known, that they are not marked with the private mark.</p>

I hope you will pity my situation.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you shew her either of these ribbons, or unpin them, and put them in her hands? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them on the counter at all? - I did not, I am perfectly sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had fruit in my apron, and whether the ribbon was under my apron or no, I cannot say, the young woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170099"></xptr>shewed me eight or nine pieces, before she picked out one that I liked.</p>

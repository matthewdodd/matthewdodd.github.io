            . I shall be fourteen years old at Christmas. I knew Charles Wells, (who was convicted here) when in Mr. Toth's service; I saw him on Monday morning, the 7th of June, between nine and ten o'clock; he came to my mother's, in St. John's-square-passage, about five minutes' walk from Toth's - he asked me to sell a gold watch for him; I saw it - it had two seals, a key, a guard, a ring, and a green ribbon to it; he carried them in his own pocket - he showed them to me when he came into Benjamin-street; I went with him to Field-lane, and saw the prisoner at his lodgings there - I knew him before; he got his living by buying stolen property, but sold pies up and down Holborn - I took Wells there, and asked the prisoner to buy a gold watch; he asked us to let him see it - Wells showed it to him; he said he did not think it was gold, but he would go and see if it was - he took the watch with him; I followed him to the shop of Mr. Reeves, a pawnbroker - he was asked 3l. for it before he took it there; Wells had said he would ask 2l. - I said, "Don't ask 2l., ask 3l.;" I believed it was gold from what Wells said - I saw the prisoner go into Reeves'; Wells was with me - neither of us went in; he came out and met us at the top of old Fleet-market, gave us 1s., and asked if we were not going to stand something to drink; I never saw the watch after it went into his hands - we went to the first public-house on the righthand side of old Fleet-market from Holborn, and had a quartern of liquor, and a 2d. cake, which came to 6d. - Wells paid for it out of the shilling; the prisoner then went away - Wells and I called in about two hours; he was at home, and gave Wells 8s. 6d. - we asked if he could not give us some more; he said nothing to that, and we came away - we both called again in the evening, and he gave 30s. into Wells' hand; I called alone two days after, and told him that

               <p>Q. When did you first tell any body of this? was it before or after Wells was tried? A. After Wells told of the prisoner, and I told Sir Peter Laurie at Guildhall - it was about eleven weeks after he bought the watch; I had been taken up then.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Mr. Low's wine-vaults, Holborn-hill. I have known the prisoner about three years - he offered to sell me the duplicate of a seal and ring for 3s., in pledge at Reeves; I bought it, and took the duplicate to Reeves'; they were shown to me by Ivey- I paid 4d. interest, and had a duplicate in my own name; a few days after, the prisoner brought me another gold seal - I gave him 18s. for it, and pawned it at Reeves' for 12s.; I redeemed them the same day, and delivered them back to the prisoner - he gave me the same for them as I had paid him; he lived in Field-lane - I have not seen them since; I cannot recollect what sort of seals they were - I asked how he came by them; he said he had found them, but did not say where - I saw him several times afterwards, but had no conversation about them; after he had been taken I asked him if there was any fear of my being taken, as I had bought the seals of him - he said No, I had no occasion to come forward to say any thing, for he should appear when his time was up, and he had no doubt he should get through it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot state on what day you received them from him? A. No, whether it was June or July exactly; I once pawned my watch at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160115"></xptr>Reeves' before, but nothing else; that had common seals to it, not worth 6d. each.</p>

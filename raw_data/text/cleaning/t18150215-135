I called the prisoner down for the keys, and asked him if he had any more work-boxes than what I saw in the cutting room; he denied any more boxes in the house. I asked him whose box that was; Squires said, it was his box, it contained nothing but his clothes; I pulled out an old coat, and under that coat was a lady's work-box, half a skin of morrocco leather, and three steel spring purses. Squires said they were his master's property; he allowed it was a wrong place for it to be in. We went a little further, and between the sacking and the bed of an old bedstead I found five skins of leather, as we have them from the leather dresser at Bermondsey, and some pocket-books of a large size.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday I went to Mrs. Morgan's; in the top shop I found a work-box, and three steel spring purses. I found five skins in a room where there were some property concealed, and on looking a little further, I found as many materials as would make twenty large gentlemen's pocket-books, ready cut up, secreted under some clean paper; in the top shop was this box, those purses; the leather I have kept locked up ever since. The next morning I went to the watchhouse, I said Squires, I have got a box out of your box; he said, I know you have. This is the box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is the same box I found in Squires box, it is my property, and all the property now produced is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master in his life time gave me that box to finish one month before he died; my master told me to put a top pocket to it, and to keep it till he called for it; that box had been in my box a month before my master died; I did not place it in my box with any intention to defraud my mistress of it.</p>

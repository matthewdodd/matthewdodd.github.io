            . Between the hours of eleven and twelve, on last Sunday was a month, the prisoner Ogle, called me up into her room; she lodges in the two pair of stairs, and I in the one pair of stairs, in Barrington's-house; I went in and saw a great smother; there was a large fire, I took some of the papers off and threw them into some water; a person in the next house saw it, and went and told my landlord. I did not know they were any thing of consequence; when I went up again,

               <p>Puttnam. They were some of them picked up by Barrington; these produced were some of them; I saw a vast quantity of shirts, how many I cannot say; I saw a pair of stone and a pair of silver buttons: Cox and Priestly came into the room between two and three o'clock and one Pat Nowland and they expected a Jew woman to come in the morning to buy some of the things; I heard them say so; she came about seven in the morning; I was not in the room when she bought the things; I met her coming down stairs with a great bundle, I am sure she carried none up.</p>

            . I am a constable; the landlord came up to Sir John Fielding's, and said this Puttnam could give a particular account of these people. I went to his house and she gave me this bosom of a shirt (producing it)</p>
               <p>Puttnam. I picked that piece of a shirt up upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Forbes. It is mine.</p>

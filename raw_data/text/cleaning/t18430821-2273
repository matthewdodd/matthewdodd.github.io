                  </hi>. I am assistant to my brother Samuel Walker who keeps the Cock and Neptune, in Ratcliff-highway. On the 25th of April I the prisoner came to board and lodge there, and agreed to pay 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he staid seventeen weeks, and his account was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—on the 2lst, he told me he was going off in the brig <hi rend="italic">Chance</hi>, Captain Harris, and gave me these two notes—he said one was a two months' advance note for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable two days after the ship left Gravesend, and the other for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, payable three months after date, and to be continued after the voyage was over—he said they were what the Captain had given him in part of his wages—he wished me to advance him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did so on the credit of the notes—next morning the prisoner took his things away, and took them to the Blackwall Railway office—he said he was going down to the ship—in conse<lb></lb>quence of some suspicion, I went down to Captain Harris, to the West India Dock, on Thursday morning, and showed him the notes—I got an officer, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman.</hi>) I took the prisoner into custody. I found on him this pocket-book, in which is written the name of the broker, in his own hand-writing, which accords with that on the notes—(<hi rend="italic">the notes were here read.</hi>)</p>

On the Monday I called alongside the ship; the mate told me the captain had not been. I went to the dock, and did not come back till half-past two o'clock. I asked the mate if the captain was there; he said no, he had been and had gone; but he said, "Here is something for you," and he handed me these two notes.</p>

                  </hi> I am an artificial flower-maker, and live in Greville-street, Hatton-garden. On the 15th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was walking in Leicester-square—I saw some persons running—I ran with them, and saw some persons quarrelling—I stopped to look at them—the prisoner spoke to me—he was quite a stranger—he re<lb></lb>marked that he would like to see the two men fight, there being a difference in their size—I said there was a great contrast in the, and they were badly matched—I walked away, and as I turned round by some wine vaults I felt a tap on my shoulder—I saw that it was the prisoner—he asked me what I was going to stand—I asked what he meant—he said if I did not give him some money or drink, he would call a policeman, and give me into custody for an indecent assault on him—I called him a rascal, and said if he did not be off I would call a policeman and give him into custody—I walked down James-street, till I came near the corner of the Haymarket—I saw a policeman—I went across to speak to him—the prisoner ran before me, and gave me is charge—I told him it was a false charge, because I would not stand drink or money, and said that I was the person who ought to give him into custody—I was taken into station and locked up all night—I was taken to Marlbo<lb></lb>rough-street the next morning, where the prisoner made his statement to the Magistrate that I had indecently assaulted him—the Magistrate released me till the following Saturday—I went then, the prisoner did not appear, and I was discharged—I did not see the prisoner again till the policeman called at my house, and said that the prisoner was in custody—I went and found he was in custody—I had given my right address at the station, and asked the inspector whether he would take bail, and he would not—I had never seen the prisoner in my life till I saw him in Leicester-square between nine and ten o'clock that night.</p>

I was on duty on the 15th of June in James-street, Haymarket—I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner coming towards me—the prosecutor was walking in front; the prisoner was behind him two or three paces—when they came opposite me the prisoner called to me, "Policeman, I give this man in charge for indecently assaulting me near the barracks"—I said, "In what way?"—he said, "By putting his hand on my trowsers * * *"—the prosecutor replied, "It is no such thing; it is for the purpose of extorting drink or money from me; I refused to give it him"—they were both taken to the station, and the next morning to Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—the prisoner was examined, and made his statement as he had done to the inspector the night before—the prosecutor was discharged on his own recognizance in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to appear on the following Saturday—I was there that day—the prosecutor attended—the prisoner was not to be found, and the prosecutor was discharged—the prisoner gave his address at the Black Horse,</p>

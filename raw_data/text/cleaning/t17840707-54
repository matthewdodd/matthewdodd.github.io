               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the same man? - Yes, I am sure he was the man that went down the area steps.</p>
               <p>Was the mug ever found? - No, I saw it not a minute before stand on the table in the servants hall, when I took him he said he had been on a message, and had stopped to drink a pint of porter which made him run so, and if I would go to his master, his master would come back with me, so I consented to go with him to Drury-lane to his master, and when I came there I said where does your master live, he said oh just here a little further, and then he attempted to get away from me, and he went down a little bit of a court, he said his master lived at the corner, and he went down and he turned round and says to a man that stood there, here Tom I want to speak to you, I said he should not, he said he would, and he went into a door and there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070080"></xptr> woman laid in bed, and he began putting his hands into the bed, I said you shall not; and when he came out he run away, and there came ten or fifteen dirty women about me, and no body came to my assistance but one of the runners to Litchfield-street came and took him, and found nothing upon him.</p>

               <p>How long was he out of your sight before you caught hold of him? - About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Then you went out and pursued a man that was making speed on his business? - Yes, I took that man.</p>

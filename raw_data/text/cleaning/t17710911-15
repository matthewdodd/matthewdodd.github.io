The prisoner passed close by my side, I felt something touch my right hand pocket. I put my hand in my pocket and miss'd my handkerchief. The prisoner passed on, and I observed him put his hand to his breast; it was his right hand which was farthest from me. I said to my father, I have lost my handkerchief, and I believe that man has got it. He said, charge him with it. I went to him and tapped him on the shoulder, and said, I believe you have got a handkerchief of mine; he said he had not; I said I would see; then my father and Mr. Horne came up, and we took him into a shop in St. Paul's Church-yard; and he dropped the handkerchief, (produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. How far was he got from you;</p>
               <p>Bellas. About four yards.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Horne confirmed this evidence.</p>

               <p>When Mr. Bellas took me up, a croud of people came about me, I desired to go somewhere to be examined? they took me to a shop; they found nothing upon me; I never saw the handkerchief in my life till it was produced.</p>

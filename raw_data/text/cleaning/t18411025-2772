                  </hi>, junior. I was living with my mother, Catherine Stokes, at the time in question, at No. 11, Great Bolton-street, Kenning<lb></lb>ton-common, in the parish of Lambeth, I think—she has only part of the house—a person up stairs, named Cane, has the other part—the house is divided—Mr. Farmer is the landlord—he does not live in the house. On Saturday, the 16th of October, I left home, with my mother, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, leaving my brother Christopher in the house—we returned at eight, and found the door open—I got a light, and found my brother's drawers unlocked and empty—there had been five shirts, four pairs of trowsers, and three waistcoats in it, also a frock-coat—several things were taken out of my mother's drawers—three dresses and two cloaks—the cloak and gown now produced are part of my mother's pro<lb></lb>perty—my brother had gone out after us.</p>

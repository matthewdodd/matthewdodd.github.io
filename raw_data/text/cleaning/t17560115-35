               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I live in Holywell-Lane, Shoreditch parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live with you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He work'd with me, and had been down stairs where the things were; after that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150033"></xptr> was observed to go out-with another man's coat on his back, upon which we pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he work'd with you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He had work'd with me much about a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner taken ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. We took him in Winifred-street, Whitechapel, and brought him back, when we delivered him to the watch, and saw the watchman take the things from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Name what things.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 17th of last month I had the prisoner delivered in charge to me. I searched him in the watch-house, and found these goods here produced upon him. I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Rumbolt. He said a woman gave them to him, but would not tell who that woman was.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you hear the prisoner own any thing?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said, at the time I took him, he had my wife's apron, but did not know where it was. That was on the outside of the other things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Allen and his part<lb></lb>ner, drapers, in High-street, Marylebone. On the 30th of November, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I heard the cloak-stand move, which stood in the shop—I was behind the counter—I looked out at the door and saw the prisoner with a cloak over his shoulders, which had been on the stand—I ran out, hallooing "Stop thief," and never lost sight of him till he was pursued by the policeman—he was stopped in my sight, and dropped it in the mews—I lost sight of him for about five minutes after the policeman joined in the pursuit—the cloak was picked up in the way he had run—I am quite sure he is the person—he had got three or four yards from the shop when I saw him.</p>

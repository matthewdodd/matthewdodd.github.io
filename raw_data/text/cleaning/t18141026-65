            . A quarrel with my father threw me upon the world eight or nine years ago. I held a menial situation with Mr. Townend. Mr. Townend said he observed somethind in my manner far superior to my then situation. He desired to enter into my history. I gave it him; he promised he would put me forward in the world. My brother died; my family took me by the hand, and Mrs. Townend and I corresponded for nine years. I married Miss Savory in the year 1803. I entered into his majesty's service, and after being separated from Miss Savory seven years, I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260043"></xptr>into England. On my return home I found Mr. Townend was dead. In consequence of a correspondence that originated between Mrs. Townend and me, I went down to York, and was in the habit of dining with her three or four weeks previous to our marriage. I have sent down the deed to Mrs. Townend, and I trust my service for my country thirteen years; although I may have erred in this, yet I hope that will be taken into consideration.</p>

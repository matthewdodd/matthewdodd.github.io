                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Cartwright-place, East Smithfield. On 8th Nov. I was at the Three Nuns public house—I had a quarrel there with a person named Matthew Carley—we fought together—while I was struggling with Carley, the prisoner came up to me to interfere—I went to strike him, to shove him back—I did not strike him—he ran back—Carley ran away from me—I ran after him, and, while I was running after him, the prisoner came behind me, and stabbed me—I found that I was losing blood, and was taken to the hospital—I had not known the prisoner before—I never had any quarrel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, in Wentworth-street. On the night of 10th Nov. I was passing near the Three Nuns public house—I saw the prosecutor and another man fighting—the other one was down on the ground—the prosecutor was standing up, in a fighting position, telling him to get up and fight again—he was not doing anything to the man while he was on the ground—I saw the prisoner come out of the Three Nuns—he first struck the prosecutor a blow in the face with his fist—the prosecutor was in the act of pursuing the man whom he was fighting with, and the prisoner stabbed him in the back with a dagger—he then placed the dagger in his breast, or some part of his person, took the arm of a friend, and deliberately walked down There Nuns-yard—I followed him, and gave information to the police.</p>

I saw these things safe, about an hour before they were stolen - they were locked in a box, in the two pair back room. The prisoners were entire strangers. On Saturday, the 20th of July, between two and four o'clock, a neighbour came, and told me something - I went up stairs, and double locked the bed room door. I saw the two prisoners going backwards and forwards in Shoe-lane; I lost sight of Hobdell, and kept my eye on Roberts, who stood by St. Bride's workhouse gate. I watched him for half an hour; he went quickly by the house into Fleet-street, and went back again - I kept watching him. I saw Hobdell come out of the private door of the house, and run with him, and give him the bundle - I pursued them both into Fleet-street; they both ran towards Fleet-market, but on opposite sides of the street. I took Roberts just by Bride-lane, with the bundle - I brought him back, and sent for a constable. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, all of which I know to be mine. I went to my lodging, examined my box, and found the whole room ransacked; the lock had been opened by a key. On the Tuesday following I saw Hobdell, and am quite sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You live in a room in Buncombe's house - A. Yes; he lives in the house. I know his name is John, because I sent to him to know, and he gave me a receipt for rent in that name. I saw the prisoners in my tap together, about a week before the robbery. I watched them for an hour and a half before the robbery, and can swear to both of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HOBDELL. Q. Was I dressed the same when you took me as before - A. No; he had a long brown coat on at the time of the robbery.</p>

            . I live opposite the tap in Shoe-lane, and am a shoemaker. I have known Roberts eight years, and Hobdell two. On the 20th of July, about half-past one o'clock, I saw Hobdell pass my shop window; I went to the door to watch, and saw Roberts coming; on seeing me he crossed the way; they joined at the bottom of the lane, by Fleet-street, and had some conversation - Hobdell left Roberts, and went into the private door, of No. 113, where the prosecutor lodged - he came out in half a minute without anything, and joined Roberts seven or eight doors off. I saw them talking together - I went and told Chappell; he went up to fasten his door, and in about an hour and a half, I saw Hobdell going towards Fleet-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110047"></xptr>with a bundle, and beckoning to Roberts, who was watching at the corner of a passage; he followed him very fast, and when they got a few doors down Fleet-street, Hobdell handed the bundle to him. I pursued Roberts, and stopped him at the corner of Bride-lane, and Chappell came up. I saw the bundle opened; it contained clothes. On the Tuesday following, I saw Hobdell in custody, and am positive of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROBERTS. Q. Are you certain you saw me following Hobdell - A. I am. He took the bundle on this side of Fleet-street, and ran across.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew Hobdell before - A. Yes. I did not know where he lived at the time. I believe Buncombe's name is Benjamin. I went to fetch his name, and saw him write it - the first letter was B.</p>

At first I wonder'd where about I was, and what was become of my Shoes and Stockings, my Blue Apron, and my Hat. But at last I bethought my self, that some Body had found me a-sleep in the Street, and had undress'd me, so I went barefooted as I was towards the Watch-house, to enquire if any idle Person had been taken up; but I could hear nothing of my Cloaths, till about 9 that Saturday Morning, when a Friend told me that Mr. Ludlow, a Goldsmith, in Upper-Shadwell, had stopp'd the Prisoner upon her offering to sell him a pair of Silver Buckles which proved to be mine. She was carried before the Justice, and committed to Bridewell, before I saw her, and when

            . Watchman in Upper-Shadwell. As I was beating my Rounds at one a Clock, I saw the Prisoner sitting at a Door in West-Garden, with a vine Hat in her Lap. What dost thee do here? says I. Why I want a Dram, says she, will you give me one? Where didst thee get such a vine Hat? says I. Why it is my Husband's Hat, says she again. So I goes home, and she comes to my House, and calls vor a Dram. Well, says I, however thee didst come by this Hat, or where thee didst get'n, the Devil don't know; but sure thy Husband never had such a one to his Back. Why, zays she, I have got his Zhoes and Ztockings too in my Apron, and I will leave 'em all with you till by and by. Zo she pull'd'n out, and I took'n and throwd'n by, but I thought they hardly did belong to she. Zo, when she came again vor 'em about 2 a-Clock, zays I, thee must tell me how thee didst come by'n bevore I let thee have'n again. After this I zee a Man coming along bare-vooted, and bare-leg'd, and without a Hat. Hoy! hoy! says I, what a Plague beest thee, that thee runs naked a that'n; but I did not think that the Things that Prisoner lest at my House did belong to he.</p>

            . About 8 o'Clock o' Saturday Morning. The Prisoner offer'd to sell me these Buckles; I ask'd her how she came by 'em, and she said, a Man gave 'em her to lie with her. I suspected she had stol'n 'em, and sent for a Headborough, who carried her before a Justice, by whom she was committed to Bridewell. The Prosecutor came about an Hour after, and claimed the Buckles.

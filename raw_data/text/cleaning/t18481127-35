                  </hi>. I live at Devenport-mews, Bayswater, and am a groom out of a situation. About eight in the evening of 30th Oct. I was with a friend in Westminster, and met a young woman called Emma; I do not know her other name—I went with her to No. 1, Duck-lane, Westminster, and had some gin and beer with her and Eke—while there I missed a handkerchief out of my coat-pocket, but I did not take any particular notice of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270023"></xptr>
               <p>that—Eke went out of the room three or four times while I was there—after she came in the last time the prisoner Johnson and a boy came in—Eke asked me in Johnson's presence to stand some drink—there was no light in the room at that time—there had been a candle, but it was out—there was no fire—I told my friend I had no more money, and asked him to go out and fetch some drink—he went—the prisoners remained in the room—Eke came and caught hold of my left arm and felt me—I thought she was after my watch, and I broke my guard and put the watch into my right hand coat-pocket, keeping it in my hand—she said to Johnson, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, the watch is in his coat-pocket"—I immediately took it out and put it into my right trowsers-pocket—Johnson came up and tore my pocket—he got hold of my hand—I bit Eke's fingers as she had got hold of my left arm—Johnson bit my thumb and made me leave go of my watch, and got it away after twisting me about the room—the seals were broken off, and fell on the floor—he escaped with the watch—Eke pulled me back on the bed and held me there till the man escaped—she then escaped herself—I locked the door till the policeman came, and called, "Police!" and "Murder!"—when the policeman came I saw him pick up the seals close against the door and the guard at the other end of the room—I was sober—I know Johnson to be the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Edward-street, Dorset-square. I was with Hembrow on the evening of 30th Oct., about eight o'clock, and met a female called Emma, who lives with Eke—I went with her to 1, Duck-lane, and there saw Eke—we remained there till nearly eleven—a knock came—to the door while I was in the room, and a man and a boy came in—they remained about two or three minutes—I then went out for some ale—I had not been gone two or three minutes when I heard my friend hallooing "Murder!" and "Police!"—I got a policeman and went with him back to the house in about five minutes after I had left it—the man and boy were then gone—we found Eke there—I could not recog<lb></lb>nise the features of the man that was in the room—it was in the dark—I know that Hembrow had his watch when he went into the house.</p>

From information I received, I went in search of Johnson on Thursday, 2nd Nov., and found him at the White Horse, Orchard-street, Westminster, with ten or twelve others, several of whom I knew—I called him out of the tap-room, and told him he was charged, with a female, with stealing a watch from 1, Duck-lane—he said he knew nothing about it, it was d—d hard to suffer for other people—I think he said he had not been to the house where the robbery was committed since Sunday—I had seen him before—he is called <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—I have never seen him with whiskers—another man has been apprehended since—both the prisoners said that was the person—I believe his name is <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, but as soon as the pro<lb></lb>secutor saw him he said he was not the man—he had very small whiskers—I am not aware that he lived in the house; Johnson's brother did.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Williams. I am in the habit of going to the house in Frith street every night after the workmen had done their work.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from. - A. From No. 21, Church-street, to No. 32, Frith-street. I went on the 28th of April; I had fastened the doors before the robbery, and the windows; the house was all fastened. I left the house at half past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark. - A. It was not dark when I left it, between eight and nine o'clock. There was an alarm at 21, Church-street that a man had broke into the house in Frith-street. When I went the door was not locked, there was a lead pipe, a stink trap, and a copper was taken down from the kitchen. I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Do you live with the prosecutor as a servant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the place open the lamps were lighted. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you fastened the house the lamps were not lit. - A. No.</p>

            . I live in Frith-street. On Tuesday the 28th of April, a little after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light. - A. It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the face of a man. - A. I could not see the face of a man. Being at my window I saw a man knock at Mr. Williams' door; after the man had knocked he crossed over opposite of my window; I could not swear to the man, he was about the height of the prisoner. About ten minutes afterwards I come down and stood at my door; I then saw two men at Mr. Williams' door, one with his face towards the lock, as if he was doing something to it with his hands, and the other with his back towards the door, with a view of watching any thing that might occur. When the man with his back towards the door saw me, he touched the other man, meaning as I suppose that he saw me. I then went into the shop and told Mr. Wilkins, my husband; on our return they were gone. I kept watching, and about a quarter of an hour more,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130012"></xptr> seeing the door open from within side, and I saw a light through the crevice of the door, and a man coming out with something on his back; being dark I could not discern what it was. I immediately gave the alarm to Mrs. Williams the lady of the house at No. 21, Church-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. When you saw the person crossing the street you say you could not distinctly see his features. - A. No, I was at my dining room window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you met a man in the street you could have seen his features distinctly. - A. To be sure I could.</p>
               <p>- MOODY. I live opposite Mr. Williams' house in Frith-street. On the 28th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I came to the street door, there was an alarm of thieves at No. 32, I saw a man climb-over from the inside of the railing at Mr. Williams' door, I immediately made my way for him, but was too late to pursue him; he went off. On looking down the area I distinctly saw another man. I took him as he was scaling the iron railings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is he. - A. The prisoner now in question. I secured him fast, my master was in the house at the time; I called out to him, and Mr. Williams came down to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that the prisoner was attempting to get away. - A. Yes, I do; he, the prisoner, was pulling me from one side of the street to the other, struggling to get away; we brought him to No. 32, and from thence took him to the watchhouse.</p>

I saw no violence on the door; they must have got in by false keys, or picking the lock.</p>

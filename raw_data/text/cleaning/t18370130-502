                  </hi>. I am a City officer. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. Hair's, in Wailing-street, on Monday, the 16th of January—I took the prisoner, whom I found there, into a private room, and said, "You have been robbing your master?"—he denied it—I said, "You have, and conveyed the property to a lad named Caudell," which he still denied—he said he lived at No. 18, Sadler's-buildings, Goswell street—I went there with Mr. Mair (leaving the prisoner at the warehouse) and found a silk handkerchief in the room he occupied—he had but one room—the rooms are on a landing, round the repository—I saw a woman there who repre<lb></lb>sent herself to be his wife, and whom I have seen with, him since—I found these handkerchiefs, and took them to Mr. Mair's warehouse—they were produced to the prisoner—they are not the property named in this indict<lb></lb>ment—Mr. Mair asked the prisoner to account for the possession of this property—he cried, and seemed very much hurt—Mr. Mair, said "How many pieces of handkerchiefs have you robbed me of?"—He then said, "Only two."</p>

The prisoner was in the habit of coming to the Rose and Crown where I used to job—I had a piece of seven handkerchiefs from him two of three months ago—he asked if I could dispose of them—I was to give him half-a-crown a piece for them, and what I made over that I was to keep—I sold this one to Francis for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had had many of the prisoner before a man named Kibble had two off another piece—I did not receive the two pieces at the same time.</p>

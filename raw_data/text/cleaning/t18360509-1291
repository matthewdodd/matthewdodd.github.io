I keep the Ball and Crown, in Kingsland-road On the afternoon of the 29th of April, the prisoner was in the tap-room—he had two or three penny-worths of gin—I was coming across the bar—I turned my head, and saw him come down stairs from the first-floor room—I asked him what business he had up-stairs—he said he had been up to speak to a little boy belonging to a lodger in the house—he did not know that lodger—I observed his coat was buttoned, and asked what he had got there—I unbuttoned his coat, and he pulled the sheet out himself—I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in St. Giles's; last Saturday, a little before nine in the morning, the prisoner brought me this watch; I am sure it was her; I have known her these six or seven years; she asked me if I wanted one; she said she had found it on the Thursday night, in great Russel-street, facing Drury-lane, Playhouse; I thought proper to stop it but not the woman; I sent information of it to Justice Walker, and the woman was taken; this is the watch.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Are you sure that the prisoner is the woman that went with you into the stable? - She is very like the woman, but I will not swear positively to her.</p>

I am positive he is the man. He laid hold of my watch-ribbon, and immediately drew my watch from me - I felt it go - both my arms were engaged in supporting my brother officer, who was intoxicated. I left him, and seized the prisoner, whom I never lost sight of. He was secured, but the watch was not found on him. I was quite sober.</p>

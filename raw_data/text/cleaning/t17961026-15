Gould, Penny, West, and Gould; I laid several lengths of goods down on the Friday, between five and six in the evening; on the Monday following, about seven o'clock in the morning, I missed two pieces of quiltings, and half a piece of dimity, they ran nearly twenty-five yards a-piece, and the half piece of dimity about twenty-five yards; the whole piece of dimity was about fifty-two yards; in consequence of missing them, I acquainted my master the ground had been robbed, and we went to search if we could find the goods hid any where near the place; upon searching before breakfast, we could find nothing; after breakfast, we went to search again, and going up a blind lane, we found them in a ditch covered with brambles, which grew up on one side and the other, so that they met from one hedge to the other; in that ditch, I found a bag, containing two pieces of quilting, and half a piece of dimity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two pieces make fifty yards? - A. Yes, and the half piece-about twenty-five; I sent a man to acquaint my master, and Mr. Penny and another man came, there was a man set to watch, and I left it.</p>
               <p>Q.What is his name? - A. I believe the first watch was Allen; the man that was there at the time the bag was found was Hollis; I took the goods out of the bag on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the goods you took from the bag? - A. In the ditch; they lay there all Monday night; I took them out between ten and eleven o'clock, and went and fetched blankets and wrappers nearly of the same size, and the same weight, and put in the bag, and put it in the same place, as near as I could guess; I took the others out, because they were in a state of spoiling, they smelt very strong; I left it in the same place, and left

               <p>Q. Was this any thing like a thoroughfare, where the bag was deposited? - A. No, it had been a throughfare; it was entirely over-grown with brambles, you cannot get at it without tearing yourself, I could not get to the bag without crawling under the bushes.</p>

               <p>Q. A person might get through? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods were first left under the care of Allen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday, you took the goods out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Whereabouts were you placed to watch? - A. I had an old bit of a sword, with two edges; I cut a hole in the bushes, and hid myself in the hole, about four or five yards from the things.</p>

               <p>Q.Tell us the whole that you observed? - A. As I was waiting there, I saw the prisoner go along the path the outside of the lane, the man was singing; there were two men with me; after the man was gone by, he went past the hedge where I was, and was going from me; I stooped down; after he passed me, I went up the lane to see if I could see any thing of them, and I saw the prisoner in the field; I told one of the men to go and get his supper, and come at twelve o'clock to relieve me; I went down into the bushes again, and saw the prisoner came back, and go down into the lane; the man looked sharp about him, to see if there was any body in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. By the man you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes; he made a bit of a stoop at the hole, but did not stop; he went up the lane, and went to where the bag was; he took the bag and threw it out, he then went and took it on his shoulder; I then told him he was a dead man, if he went any further; I had a pistol in my hand, and the sword; the prisoner dropped the bag from his shoulder, and turned round and faced me, and asked what he had done; I told him he must go with me to my master; he said for what; he kept looking up and down the lane; I told him he must follow me; I got him to follow me about ten yards, and then he stopped again, and parlied with me, and attempted to close in with me; I told him to keep off, or I would cut him down; he said he was not afraid of me; I said, not I of him; I called Allen, I thought he might be within hearing; he said, I had got no Allen; I said, I had got him, and would take care he should not go away; he then ran from, me; I told him to stop, or I would fire upon him; I attempted to fire, and the pistol slashed in the pan; he kept running on; I told him again I would fire upon him, if he did not stop; I pulled out the other pistol, and fired upon him; he kept on; I told him again I would fire upon him; he then turned round and parlied with me; I followed him till Falkner came up, and then we secured him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I come up to sales to London, and I carry the goods I buy to Queen-street, in the Borough; and leave them till I can pack them up; and I carry these straps for the purpose; when I go to Portsmouth, which I often do, I carry the straps always to carry goods.</p>

               <p>JOHN WATSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the Cheeqners, Isleworth, the 13th of September; there was a conversation in the taproom, of the calico-ground being robbed, and a watch was supposed to be set in the field; I was going to Hounslow, they desired me not to go that way, for fear I should be stopped; I went across the common field to Hounslow; just at the top of the lane, I met a man, and bid him a good evening; it is the lane going to Hounslow-heath.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the premises of Mess. Gould? - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the man was? - A. No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the prisoner? - A. I understand it was since.</p>

               <p>I live at Isleworth: I know it is a common foot path for any body, to go from Isleworth to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the place where the bag was found? - A. By what I heard say, it was close by the foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the lane where these things were found? - A. I know the lane perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that lane a common foot path? - A. If a person chose to go in it he might, there is only a little thick hedge.</p>

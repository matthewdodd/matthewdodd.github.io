               <p>Howell's defence. I saw these two sailors get down from the top of the coach; I was standing looking at the coach, and these two sailors asked me where to get something to drink, and they swore and d-d their eyes and limbs that I should go with them, and have something to drink; then Peters took us to a hatter's shop, and bought a hat, and gave me his old one; then he took us to a barber's shop, and he was very drunk, and dropped some money there, under the grate; then we went to a house in Fleet-market, and he called for a pot of egg flip; then he said he wanted something to eat, and we got some steaks; then he went right up Field-lane, into the Castle, and I went away to work; when I came in the evening, Mrs. Gibbons said the man was robbed, and the constable should be sent for; and then I told her I would not stir till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Thomas's defence. When we got to Fleet-market, he asked me to go and drink; I told him I wanted to see my relations in the Hackney-road; I was very much in liquor, and I went with him to the Castle; I thought if I staid much longer, and drank any more, I should not get home, and being in liquor I happened to leave that bundle behind me; I am very innocent of it; when I got off the stage I bid him good-by, and did not want to go with him at all.</p>

I am a sailor, and belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Phenix.</hi> On the 13th of May I was at a public-house near the Tower—I met the prisoner and another soldier there named Davis—Davis was in the public-house before me, and the prisoner came in after me—I had not known either of them before—we sat down and drank together—we remained there about half an hour—I had a watch, a chain, and a key in my waistcoat pocket, and a guard round my neck—I was perfectly sober—while I was there I took out my watch to see the time—we left the public-house together, and Davis made some observation, and said, "We will go into the Tower," and we went in—Davis said he could show me the battlements, and he could show me the crown, but it was too late—we went into the Chain tavern in the Tower, and were there half-an-hour—the prisoner and I then, came out, and left Davis there—I told the prisoner I wished to go home—he said I should not, I should go in again—I said I would not—he pulled me by the arm, and said I must, and as he pulled me by the arm, he pulled my watch out of my pocket—he took it by force, pulled it, and broke it off by the swivel, and ran off—I ran after him—he ran up a stair-case, and it was so dark I could not see him—I went to the sergeant—we went to the canteen, and found the prisoner—I have no doubt that he is the man—he said, "Was it me?" and said he had not seen me, or something to that effect—I said, "Yes, it was you"—I was not then perfectly sober, but knew what I was about quite well—I went home, leaving the prisoner at the door of the public-house—I went next morning to the sergeant-major, and told him about it—I swear the prisoner is the person—I do not recollect that 1 ever told any body that he was not the man.</p>

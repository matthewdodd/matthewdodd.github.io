In coming from Lower Shadwell I had missed my turning, and enquired my way; I thought I had been directed wrong, and was leaning against an iron post; the prisoner came up and put her hand into my pocket - she took out a key and six sovereigns: I desired her to put me in the right way, but when she took the money she ran off. I tried to take hold of her, but she got away; I pursued, and took her within thirty or forty yards of the spot; four sovereigns and the key were found upon her. I do not know what became of the other two. We both fell down on the pavement; the watchman came and pulled me off her. Her mother has since made me a present of two sovereigns.</p>

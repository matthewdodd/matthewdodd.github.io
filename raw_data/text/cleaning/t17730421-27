            . About half after six o'clock a lad belonging to Mr. Elling of Hounslow, called me, and I saw near a hovel of Mr. Elling's some feathers of ducks, which occasioned suspicion. Two men were in the hovel; I asked them if they had any poultry to sell; they said they had; the four ducks and two geese were produced; seeing them, and suspecting the quantity of poultry were not come honestly by, I offered to secure them, but they ran away; the ducks and geese were seized and led to Brentford; they were delivered to one Gatfield, a constable. I went before Mr. Drinkwater, a justice of the peace; he ordered them to be left in the custody of Mr. Lewis at Brentford.</p>

            . I live near Mr. Smith: I lost a great deal of poultry. From the alarm of a man's being taken under suspicious circumstances, I came to look at the poultry, when they were in the possession of Mr. Lewis, and when Burgess was there. I saw them ducks and geese left in the possession of Lewis; the prisoner said he bought them at Maidenhead; afterwards he said he had them at Berry, a village four miles of.</p>

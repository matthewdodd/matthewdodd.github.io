                  </hi>. I live at Milton, near Newport Pagnell, in Buck<lb></lb>inghamshire. I have a brother, who lives at Charlton, named Jonas—we are both farmers and graziers, and are in the habit of sending stock to Smithfield market—I know a drover called Thomas Horton—Allcock has the care of my beasts at the market—on the 15th of December I and my brother had beasts for sale at Smithfield—I disposed of my stock before him, and then assisted him—the practice of dealing is this: we trust a beast to Allcock, at Smithfield—Horton is the man who attends to sell<lb></lb>ling the beast, which we leave in Allcock's care—he is to deliver them, when sold—there are bankers in Smithfield—if an ox is bought by me, I must go to the drover and say, "I want the bullock of such and such a per<lb></lb>son"—having made a bargain with the owner first, the purchaser of his drover should go to the seller's drover and state he wants the ox—Allcock, the drover, should then go to the banker, and see that the ox is paid for; and, according to his information, he delivers it or not—it is the invariable course to pay for beasts before delivery—we expect it, we look to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker, and live in Smithfield. I have a customer named Jonas Payne—on Monday, the 15th of December, I settled an account with him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the book</hi>) this 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., if written short—Mr. Payne debited the bullock to Mr. Peachey—I made that entry by Mr. Payne's direction—he found one bullock he had sold for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not paid for—it sometimes happens that a person purchasing a bullock, does not pay for it at the moment—I should pay that money to the grazier, and afterwards deduct it if not paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a slaughterhouse at Lambeth. On the 15th of December, Stribblehill was in my employ—a bullock was slaugh<lb></lb>tered there—I was not at home when it was brought—on my return home he was dressing it, and in the course of a few minutes the prisoner came in—I said, "Is that your bullock?"—he said, "Yes"—I saw him again that night—the bullock was then finished—he said he was going to send it to market to-morrow morning, and would I let his porters have it in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I said I would, and I delivered it to them in the morning—I asked him who was to have the hide—he said a man named Kelly, who would call on Wednesday for it, but somebody called before that (on Wednesday), and had it away—he brought it back again the same day—I am certain it was the same hide—in the course of the Wednesday evening, in consequence of what I heard, I waited about, and saw the prisoner in Lambeth-walk—I called him into a master butcher's shop, and said, "Young man, about this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183501050048"></xptr>
               <p>hide"—he said, "Mr. Kelly will call for it in the morning"—I said, "I am not satisfied about it, for I have heard you have not come fairly by the bullock"—he said he had bought it fairly, and paid for it to Mr. Jones, 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not know his name at that time, and asked him his name—he said it was Hooker—I said, "How came you to mark it with a 'P?'—it ought to have been marked with 'H'"—he said he bought it with a man in the name of Peachey, and they were to have the profits between them when it was carcassed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Abrahams, a butcher, in Lambeth-walk. I was at Mr. Rudderford's slaughterhouse on Monday, the 15th of December—I know the prisoner very well—I saw him there—he had an ox—it was just knocked down as I got there—I saw him next evening in Lambeth-walk, and in consequence of what I heard from Rudderford, I asked the prisoner why he took the ox away so soon, because I thought it was a pity it should be cut down so soon, as it would injure the meat very much—it would not look so well—he made answer that it was on the <hi rend="italic">mall</hi>, and he was afraid they would be after him—I did not understand what he meant, but I supposed he meant it was got away without being paid for—I told master of this in the course of half an hour.</p>

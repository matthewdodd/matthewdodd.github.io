I left my Goods and Maid at the same time about two Months ago. The Toad has been the Ruin of me. I went after her; I spent a great deal of Time and Money, and offer'd a Reward for taking her. But by good luck, in about a Fortnight, going to a Bawdy-house, not far from my House, on the Backside of Drury-Lane, I met with her. She was lock'd up in a Room, and they denied her to me at first; but when I told them, and stood stifly to it (as well I might, for it was nothing but the Truth) that I had seen her through the Window, I gained Admittance, and there was my Gentlewoman, drest up, I'll warrnt ye, like one of the tip top Madams of the Hundreds. I asked her what she had done with such and such Goods and Money. She said, truly, that she knew nothing of my Money, or my Silver-hilted Sword; but as for the rest of the Things she confest that she had taken them, and pawn'd them to Mr. Hamlin at the Corner of Cole-Yard in Drury-Lane, and some at other Pawn-brokers; and I found them accordingly.</p>

This is my Wife, says he, pointing to the Prisoner, and her Name is Mary Wheeler. So I brings out the Goods, and then truly they told me the Goods were stolen - Now I can't swear that the Goods were pawn'd by the Prisoner, tho' it's true they were pawned in the Name of Mary Wheeler, and I don't know how it should be she, because I don't know her, and we take in Goods of no Strangers.</p>

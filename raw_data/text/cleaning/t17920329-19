               <p>I am nurse to Mr. Baron's child. My master lost a silver salt about nine o'clock on Sunday morning; it was on the sideboard that morning, in the front parlour. The prisoner came from Mr. Burgess, No. 3, Upper Brook-street, Grosvenor-square, with his compliments to my master, and desired to meet him before twelve o'clock that morning: this was about nine o'clock: my master was in bed: I left the prisoner in the passage; and when I went up stairs the parlour door was not shut; when I came down the prisoner was still in the passage; there were dirt marks of feet in the passage, and between the oil-cloth and the carpet in the parlour; I asked him what business he had there: I had just before cleaned the passage and parlour: I complained of his dirting the passage, and he said it was the dog's marks; I said those marks were very different from dogs mark's; I then let him out of the door, and on returning into the parlour I missed the salt; I pursued him into Chenie's-mews: he was taken there: he was walking: on searching him the salt was found upon him;

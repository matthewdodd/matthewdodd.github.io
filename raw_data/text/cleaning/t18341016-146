I was on duty, and heard the prosecutor giving an alarm - I followed the prisoner till I took him into custody - he said, "What do you want with me?" - I said, "You have done something wrong, or why did you run away?" - he said he had done nothing wrong, but he ran because the man was running after him - he then said he was running to the fire, but the fire was southward, and he was running northward - I found nothing on him, but some persons heard him jink some money on the pavement - they got lights, and found two sovereigns.</p>

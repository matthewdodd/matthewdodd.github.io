                  </hi>. I live at Eden House, Albany-road, Camberwell, in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, and am the wife of Richard George Fletcher. On Tuesday, the 29th of August, the prisoners came after my apartments—I showed them to them—they approved of them very much, and came down stairs, and said they should wish to return to measure the room for a carpet—I am sure they are the person—I showed them the back bedroom up stairs—they came down, and wished to go up again to measure the room—they both went up with me to measure the corner of the room, to see if it would take a large chest—I took hold of one end of the string, and Saunders took hold of the other end—while I was doing so, the tallest prisoner (Thomson) went out of that room into the other room, belonging to Mr. Houston, who lodged with us—they then came down stairs, and wished to see the way about down stairs—I showed them which way the garden went, and then they went out, and said they would come the next day, but they did not—I saw them again at Lambeth –street Office in custody—I saw the watch in the front room while they were talking to me—there was a silver guard-chain to it—Thompson went into the front room—I missed it directly they were gone—the guard-chain was shown to me at the office.</p>

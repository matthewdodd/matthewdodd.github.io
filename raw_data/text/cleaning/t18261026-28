I saw the prisoner in company with another, and watched them, crossing from Skinner-street towards Holborn-hill; I saw Mr. Pearey, arm-in-arm with a gentleman - I saw the prisoner twist up Pearey's pocket; the other then came up close to his side; I saw the prisoner take his right hand out of Mr. Pearey's pocket, with the handkerchief, and put it under his left arm - I was close behind, and received the handkerchief from his hand, as he was putting it under his arm, to hand it to his companion - I took hold of them both, shoved towards the prosecutor, and tapped him on the shoulder - a third person shoved me against the wall, and both the prisoners got away, in different directions; I pursued Sullivan, and stopped him about a hundred yards off, without losing sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on duty? A. No - I had not my coat on; the shops were open - it was light; a great many people were passing; it might take three or four minutes.</p>

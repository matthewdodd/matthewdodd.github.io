                  </hi>. I am a dyer. On the 22nd of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock in the morning I met a female in Whitechapel-road, who I believe was the prisoner—I was only with her a few minutes—I lost a purse containing two half-crowns, two shillings, and one farthing—this is my purse, I am quite certain—the prisoner put her hand round me, and asked me to go home with her—I declined—she walked a few yards—I had occasion to stop, and she went away.</p>

I said, "That is what I have got," and I gave it to him; in going along to the station, the prosecutor fell down, and the policeman picked him up; he did not want to go to the station; he only wanted his money.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the Brickfields. I know the prisoner—I have seen his wife: I knew her by sight—on Saturday night, 10th Sept, about half past 11 o'clock, I was standing with the witness, George, near the Stuart's Arms—the prisoner and his wife were standing, looking in the shop window, in Shepherd's-market when I first saw them—I heard the woman ask the prisoner to go home—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and knocked her down—the blow was about the body, but I could not say whereabouts—she got up, and he knocked her down a second time—she then ran behind me and George for protection—I told her to get away, as I thought perhaps her husband might think I was harbouring her—I saw him kick at her, and he said he would kick her b—brains out; and when she was running away, be said, "I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you;" that was when she was running away from behind me—she ran towards Mrs. Steele's, the Queen's Arms—I did not see anything more of them that night—there were a few people in the market; there might be twenty or thirty, or perhaps more; I cannot say the number exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say five years—he is a bricklayer's labourer—there are brickfields in the immediate neighbourhood of Shepherd's-bush—there are not many Irish brickmakers—the brickmakers are generally called <hi rend="italic">brickeys</hi>—a great number of persons are employed there in the brickfield—I had not known the deceased for any length of time—I knew her when she used to bring his dinner—that may be two years ago, I dare say—I dare say I have known her for two years—I have never seen her in liquor—I only knew her by sight, no further than bringing his dinner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARDGEORGE</hi>. I am a brickmaker. I have known the prisoner about five years, and his wife about eighteen months, or from that to twenty—on Saturday night, 10th Sept., I was in Shepherd's-bush market with Taylor, near the Stuart's Arms—I saw the prisoner and his wife together—I saw him knock his wife down—she got up, and he knocked her on to the ground again—she got up a second time, and walked behind Taylor and me—we were about six or seven yards from the spot where she was knocked down—the prisoner came behind me and Taylor for his wife, and she walked away from us, and they went away together, Hayes saying that he would kick her b—y brains out—I saw him kick at her, but I cannot say whether he kicked her or no; it was while he was kicking at her that he said those words—she then went away towards Mrs. Steele's—I did not see her go that way, but Taylor did—I could not say whether they went away separately or together after he said he would kick her brains out—I saw them again a few minutes after, I should say it might be ten minutes, walking gently up the market, Mrs. Hayes before him—he might be fourteen or fifteen yards after her, following after her—that was all I saw of them—she appeared perfectly sober that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it because you were afraid of the Irish people that were there that you did not interfere to protect this woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not on that account; but I did not think any other violence would occur afterwards—this took place in the street—there were about six or seven per<lb></lb>sons in the street at the time, most of them females—they were close to Mrs. Hayes—there were several Irish bricklayers standing on the path.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what did you mean by saying there were but six or seven persons in the street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six or seven stood along with me and Taylor—they were mostly females—some of them were Irish—they were standing at a distance from us, near the doctor's shop—a few yards off, standing round.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the reason why you did not attempt to protect this woman because you were afraid of the people who were engaged in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they had not been quarrelling with Mrs. Hayes in my sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had not Mrs. Hayes been engaged in the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> that night, and was not that the reason why you were afraid to protect her when her husband struck her, for fear of the Irish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Shirley, of No. 3, Back-gardens, Shepherd's-bush. On Saturday evening, 10th Sept., I was coming home between 10 and 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner in the market—I had known him before—I saw him knock a woman down—she got up again, and went down the market—I did not see any more of her then—I stopped with my husband at the top of the maket—about an hour and a half afterwards, as I was going home, I saw the woman again—that was near 1 o'clock, about half past 12 o'clock I should think it was—it was the same woman I had seen knocked down by the prisoner—she was going round by the Royal Hotel, down the island—there is a place called Robinson's-gate at the end of the island—the Royal Hotel and Robinson's-gate are on opposite sides of the road—the island does not run out of the turnpike road, it runs alongside the market—the Royal Hotel is at the corner of the island, nearer the turnpike road—the island is also called Shepherd's-bush Back-gardens—you go down the island in order to get to Robinson's-gate—when I got past the Royal Hotel the woman and I came together to Robinson's-gate, and just past the gate I saw the prisoner standing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 69). My beat is at Shepherd's-bush, in the parish of Hammersmith. On Sunday evening, 11th Sept., I was on duty at the top of Shepherd's-bush market, near the Royal Hotel, about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—there are some unfinished buildings at the other side of the turnpike-road—I heard a scrambling across the road—I could not see, as it was very foggy, and thinking that it was a brother constable, I crossed over—there are some railings which separate the ground where the buildings are from the road—I waited about two minutes, heard no further sound, and then stooped under the railings—I walked ten or twelve yards further on the building ground, with my light turned on, listened for a moment, but did not hear any thing—when I had gone about twenty-eight yards inside the railings, I saw the prisoner standing in front of me—it was a very dense fog, and I could not see two yards from me—I was standing close to the prisoner when I saw him—I asked him what he did there—he said, "What the b—h—is that to do with you?"—he appeared in a very trembling state—he appeared stupefied, and I thought he was under the influence of drink—I told him he had better follow me into the road, thinking he had lost himself; and I went three or four yards, thinking he was following me; but he did not—I went back again, and found him nearly in the same spot, but about six yards nearer to the spot where the deceased was afterwards found—I requested him to come away, and told him if he did not choose to do so, I should be compelled to take him up—he said it was all right; he had stepped off the road, it being foggy, and bad lost himself—he remained in the position in which he was two or three minutes, and then unbuttoned his trowsers, and gazed on the spot which has since been pointed out to me—I turned myself round, and stood by the side of him for about a couple of minutes, and then told him again, if he did not follow me, I should be compelled to lock him up, as he had no business there whatever—he followed me into the road, after stooping under the rail, and then said to me, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> I thought I knew you"—I said, "You don't know roe, and I don't know you; by that <hi rend="italic">means go</hi> away"—his reply was, "If you don't know roe, J wonder at your speaking to such a character as I am"—after that he went away, and I followed him to Norland turnpike-gate, about twenty yards from there, in the direction of Shepherd's-bush; that was all I saw of him that night—I then went back to the spot we had come out from, and remained there some time; but he did not return, as 1 thought he might.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Sunday morning, 11th Sept., at 7 o'clock, I was sent for to the station house, and found a female very ill, totally insensible—she was very much bruised about the face—her right eye was swollen very much from a blow, and was very livid—there was also a severe bruise on the lower jaw—the left side of her face was as if she bad been struck with some gravel, as if it had been <hi rend="italic">sliped</hi> down with gravel—by "<hi rend="italic">sliped down</hi>" I mean, that it was as if she had been dragged over some gravel—I saw her again at 10 o'clock—she was then in a more sinking state, and totally insensible—5 o'clock was the last time I saw her alive—on the Monday week afterwards I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, there was a great effusion of blood on the substance of the brain, underneath the second covering, and also in both ventricles of the brain—there was about two drachms in one ventricle, and a few ounces in the other—the other organs of the body were generally healthy, except the heart, which was very flabby, and had thin walls—I have no doubt that death was caused by the quantity of blood effused on, and in, the ventricles of the brain—a blow or blows would be likely to produce that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that the immediate cause of the death of the deceased was the effusion of blood on and in the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would gradually produce death—I attribute death to that state of the parts which I discovered—I say decidedly that that effusion of blood may have been caused by a blow or blows—a fall might do it, too—it must be a very great degree of excitement indeed to do it—I never met with a case in which it has been done by a high degree of intoxication—in that case it is doubtful if you would have blood in the ventricles—I think you would not, but you would if the concussion was caused by a blow or a fall—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, particularly of the brain—I made an incision into the brain—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240072"></xptr>
               <p>the small vessels which ramify the brain were not in a congested state—the substance of the brain was free from any effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a body is examined a day or two after death, do not you find that part which is next to the substance on which it was lying gorgedswith blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The skin is; a portion of the blood follows the laws of gravitation, and goes to the lowest part—it would depend on the state of the weather whether I should find structural change in a body after the lapse of a week after death—in the present case, I think it made no difference—I should prefer making the examination within two days, of course—I examined the meningeal artery—it was in a sound state—no portion of the brain was lacerated—the chief source of effusion of blood, in cases of fulness in the brain, is not caused at all times by a rupture of the meningeal artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this statement correct of Professor Taylor: "The chief source of the effusion of blood to the head arises from a rupture of the meningeal artery, and this may occur from the mere shock or concussion, with or without a frac<lb></lb>ture of its bony canal?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is; concussion of the brain, and effusion of blood, may be occasioned in the brain without any marks of ex<lb></lb>ternal violence—the most severe bruises I discovered were on the right eye and the right jaw—what I have stated was, that there was great effusion on, not <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, the substance of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you coincide with this remark of Professor Taylor, "When the marks of violence are slight, a witness must exercise great caution before be alleges that the extravasation was produced by a blow, especially when it ii found that the deceased was of intemperate habits?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I consider that is correct, scientifically speaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give your assent to this: "If a man, excited by passion and intoxication, is struck on the head, and the blow is very slight, such as an unaffected person would have sustained without injury; yet, if insensibility and death follow, and on examination a quantity of blood is found extravasated in the substance of the brain, can it be a matter of doubt with the practitioner that the extravasation was chiefly due to the excitement under which the deceased was labouring?<hi rend="italic">" A.</hi> I should think that would be the case, generally speaking—I think a blow on the eye, to produce the effect which was produced, would be quite sufficient to cause effusion of blood into the brain—it must knock a person down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the case of a person falling, in a state of intoxication, and being previously much excited, might not concussion and effusion have been the result, independently of any blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather doubt it myself—if a person fell a distance of four or five feet, having been previously drinking and in an excited state, I think there would be external marks to corroborate it—I have known cases of concussion and effusion, and death supervening, without any external mark—I have even known fracture of the skull without external marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say, supposing a person to fall five or six feet, who was in a state of excitement from liquor, that the mere fall would not account for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for the quantity of blood which I found in the ventricles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you dissent from this opinion of Dr. Taylor, that extravasation may occur from violence, with or without fracture, and it may take place without any external marks of injury to the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extrava<lb></lb>sation might, but that would be in a different place—this was in the ventri<lb></lb>cles as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said the small vessels which ramify through the brain were not in a congested state; if the person had been in a drunken</p>

               <p>state, would they have been congested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think they would have been fuller than they were—I saw the woman at 7 o'clock on Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing—she did not vomit at the station, but there was some food just inside her mouth—I am not able to say whether she had or had not been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You examined the heart, and you say that the walls of it were flabby; do you mean the auricles or the ventricles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ven<lb></lb>tricles—they were thinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say there were, or were not, any appearances which enabled you to connect the effusion of blood with the appearance of any external bruise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not any—I think the external bruise must have been caused by a blow, because there were no scratches, or anything of that kind—the skin was not abraded—I have seen the excava<lb></lb>tion, and I do not think that the appearances which I found, and which caused death, could be accounted for by the woman falling down there—I think, if she had fallen on her head, there must have been some external bruise, and I do not think the shock would be sufficient to cause those appearances, supposing she was in a state of excitement, unless she did fall on her head, I have a confident opinion of that, nor could it be produced by her falling on any other part of her body—if she had fallen on brickbats, at the bottom of the excavation, that would not be reconcilable with the appearances I found on her eye, because the skin would have been cut by the sharp edge—I opened the head first, and under the scalp above the right eye I found a small mark—it was on the temple, and was as if she had fallen on a small piece of brick or gravel, which was not sufficiently large to cut through the skin, but to mark it underneath—the mortal appearances could not have arisen from that at all.</p>

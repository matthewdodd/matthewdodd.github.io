I asked her to set down and wait for the gentlemen, which she did; after she had set some time, she said, the gentlemen had disappointed her twice, and she went out. I had some mistrust of her, for I saw her hovering about the window. I was serving a gentleman with some stockings; she came in again and asked the gentlemen were come. I had seen her waiting about the door all the time. She staid some time whilst a many people came into the shop; there were two pair of stockings on the other side of the shop; I missed one and a parcel from the opposite counter. I went up to her; I pushed back her cloak and found the bundle of stockings, which were seven pair; she was then in the middle of the shop; she ran away to the end of the compter, and dropped a pair of mixed thread stockings.</p>

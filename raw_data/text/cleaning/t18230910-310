            . I was in company with Mrs. Rigby, walking on his left side - he was carrying the child. I noticed a man following us, and looked round several times, thinking he knew us - he was alone. At the corner of North-street, he came behind us and gave Mr. Rigby a shove on the left shoulder, I did not see him snatch the watch - he ran down North-street; an alarm was given. Mr. Rigby ran after him - I took the child from him, and another person came behind and threw him down - I saw the prisoner in custody on the 22d - there was a gas light from the shop, and one from the corner - I believe him to be the man, and am sure that he is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never knew him before - A. No; I never fixed on any other - I was coming out of a friend's house in North-street, and Mr. Rigby said,</p>
               <p>"This looks like the man who tripped me up." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is not him, for he was a great deal taller." I described him to the officers, and when I saw the prisoner, I was certain of him.</p>

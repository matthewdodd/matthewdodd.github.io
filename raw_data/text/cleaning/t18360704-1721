                  </hi>. I live at Twickenham. The prisoner is a labourer, and lived at Whitton—I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock on Sunday night, on the 4th of October—my wife is not here—I was alarmed between eleven and twelve o'clock in the night by Mrs. Marriott and her servant, who keeps a public-house next door—I got up, came down-stairs and unfastened my door—I found my rabbit-hutches broken open, and five rabbits taken away—they had pulled the front of the hutches out—the front of it was broken—it stands in a shed adjoining my dwelling-house—you cannot go out of doors without going through the shed, to my garden—the outer door of the shed was bolted inside—part of the shed is of wood and part bricks—they could get in by pulling down a piece of plank which went into the ground, and was fastened at the top by a nail—it is a part of the building, and was all safe the night before—the rabbits were found six or seven days afterwards, but not by me—the person who found them is now dead—the prisoner was taken into custody last Monday week—I got a warrant against him on the 5th of October, and delivered it to the constable, but the prisoner was not to be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at the White Hart, which is next door to the prosecutor's. I was just going to-bed, between eleven and twelve o'clock on the 4th of October, and heard some boards cracking—I went to my bed-room, and saw the prisoner and Henry Coster getting into Mr. Gib<lb></lb>son's shed—I could see the shed from my window—it was a moonlight night—I knew the prisoner before, and swear he was one of them—next morning I told Mr. Gibson who the parties were—I saw the rabbits in Coster's hand—I do not know what has become of him—I have not seen him since.</p>

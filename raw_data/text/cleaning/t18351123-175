                  </hi>. I live in Minerva-terrace, Brixton-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—I keep the house, and am a gentleman. On the 31st of October, I saw my coats and a hat hanging in my hall—I saw them there about one o'clock I think—I missed them about three o'clock—I had not been out in the meantime—It was in consequence of information from my servant that I missed them—I went out immediately, and saw the prisoner in the Vassall-road, which is about thirty yards from my house—he had what I thought were my coats on his arm—I called "Stop thief"—he ran, I followed as fast as I was able—he was stopped—I did not see him stopped, but I came up a minute after—he had nothing then—I saw my three coats at the end of Cowley-road—he jumped over a fence, and there I lost sight of him, but he was brought back to me, and before I took him into custody he said, "Forgive me this time, and I will never do so any more.

In October last, I was playing on the terrace with my master's little boy—I had left the door of the house open—I had seen the prisoner about by Mr. Silvester's, next door to master's—I saw him going away, as if from my master's door—he had nothing with him—he was passing by the door—I saw him afterwards, with three coats on his shoulder—I went into master's passage, and the coats were gone—I had seen them hanging there before—I went into the parlour, and told master—I did not know the prisoner before, but I am quite sure he is the person—I ran after him, and said, "You have got my master's costs"—he said, he was going to take them to be mended, and that I might go and tell my mistress if I liked.</p>

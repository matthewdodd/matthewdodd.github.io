            . I am a silk dyer, and live in James-street, Bethnal-green. Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening of the 22d of September, I was sitting at my door, and heard a cry of thieves and murder from a female voice. I looked out and saw the prisoner running, about six yards off, the prosecutrix was close at his heels - I came up with him - he threw something away as he ran, it appeared to be a bundle. I secured him in a moment - the street was clear - there was nobody but him and the prosecutrix. My wife picked it up.</p>

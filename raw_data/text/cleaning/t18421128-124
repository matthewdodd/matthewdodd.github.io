                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joshua Lydamont, and live in High-street, Stoke Newington. The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 28th of March, and continued till the 1st of Oct.—while she was with me I missed my child's coral necklace, a black Thibet shawl, and a brooch—I missed the brooch on the 24th of Aug.—I told her I had lost it—she said she knew no<lb></lb>thing about it—this is it—I have bad it twenty-five years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Burgess, a pawnbroker in the Kingsland-road.

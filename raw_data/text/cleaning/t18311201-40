             is the owner of the house - this copper was fixed secure on the 3rd of November; I was at home, about eleven o'clock in the day, in the front kitchen, where I lodge and work - my wife went into the back kitchen, and she said, "Bill, here is a man with the copper in his hand, run up the front way" -(we have an entrance from the street to our kitchen) - I ran up, and took the prisoner at the door; he had dropped the copper into its place again, when my wife saw him: we had used it ourselves every week; I held him till the officer came - he was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was there any water in the copper when you saw it last? A. Yes, between three and four pails; I did not see you in the back kitchen - it was regularly fixed; you had emptied part of the water out with a large baking-dish, lifted the rest out in the copper, and poured the water out.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I had used the copper on the Friday before, and when I went into the back kitchen on the day stated, the prisoner had the copper out, and was pouring the water about the kitchen - I ran back, and told my husband; he went out with me - the prisoner placed the copper loosely in its place, and my husband stopped him in the passage; the copper was fixed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010043"></xptr>near my door, but my child was crying, and I did not hear it taken out; our street door is open, but not the back kitchen - it is only for the use of the lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent to the house, to a tailor named Conner, to tell him to call on a person about a coat- I met a person coming out; I asked if Conner was at home - they said they did not know, but I had better go up stairs; I went up, and left my message, and when I came down I was stopped on suspicion of stealing this copper; but I would ask if it were possible for an individual like me to remove a copper with four pails of water in it? and again, it was a very dark place; the woman could not distinguish my person.</p>

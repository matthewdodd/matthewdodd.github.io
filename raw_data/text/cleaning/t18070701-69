On Tuesday the 17th of February, about a quarter after seven in the evening, the prisoner Grant came to my shop, in company with a woman; he had a quill wheel, which is used in the silk manufactory; he put it down on the floor, and told me he wanted half a crown upon it; I told him I did not take them kind of articles in; while I was talking to him, my young man asked me if there was not a gown hanging opposite to him, I said yes; I got over the counter, and opened the door to see if I could see any body, I could see no one; the prisoner was in the shop all the time; I turned round to the prisoner, and desired him to take up his wheel and be off; he replied to me, do you think I have stole your gown; I told him if he had not stole it, those that came with him had. In the course of the evening I received information where the gown was pledged. The woman prisoner was not the woman that came into my shop with him; she was seen to carry something along from my door. The next morning I went to Mr. French, and describing the parties and the property; they produced it me.</p>

I told him that I came there, knowing that he took in working tools; he said no, be off about your business; I then said, I will be off. The man that was behind the counter, he said he saw two men come in, and one of them he believed had taken it; he went out to see, when he ordered me out, I said I will not go till your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010056"></xptr> man comes back.

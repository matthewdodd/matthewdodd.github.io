On the 30th of November, about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I was seeing a lady home from my father's, I had a cotton handkerchief in my inside coat-pocket - my coat was buttoned; I did not see the prisoner near me, or miss it till I got to <placeName id="t18281204-63-crimeloc321">Holborn-bridge</placeName>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Gibson, of Goswell-street. I was coming down Holborn-hill, and saw Mr. Foster with a lady - I was walking quite fast, and saw the prisoner, with two others behind him, walking behind Mr. Foster - I saw the prisoner's hand in Mr. Foster's pocket; the tail of his coat was lifted entirely up in his hand; the other two were walking quite quick up to him; I saw him take the handkerchief out; I said to Day, who was with me,"Lay hold of him, and I will go and tell the gentleman;" as Day laid hold of him, the other two ran away across the road - they were lads; the prisoner finding himself taken, threw the handkerchief down immediately; I saw him throw it down, and shewed it to Mr. Foster, who claimed it, when I brought him up to the prisoner - a woman picked it up, and said it belonged to the gentleman - she gave it to me; I took the prisoner to the watch-house with it.</p>

On the first of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop; I was in my back-room; I came out immediately; she had her hands upon some japan tea pots; the tea pots were standing on a shelf; she asked me the price of one that she had in her hand. I told her the price was six shillings; she said it was a great deal of money; I told her it was very cheap for those who wanted to purchase. I immediately missed two out of the five that were placed there. I told her I could sell her one in her handkerchief for much less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her handkerchief at the time. - A. She had it before her; it was a bundle handkerchief. She said what do you mean; I told her she had got my property in her handkerchief. I put my hand upon the handkerchief, and felt the tea-pots; I then attempted to take the handkerchief; she resisted; I took it from her, and sent for a constable; she was taken into custody; the tea pots were taken before a magistrate, and deposited in the constable's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see her put these into her handkerchief. - A. No, I did not see her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tea pots were there on the shelf -

            There were three left; two were missing; I had placed five there in the morning. I gave the handkerchief, containing the two pots to my daughter; she placed them on the counter; the handkerchief was not opened till the constable came, and the tea pots were delivered to him.</p>

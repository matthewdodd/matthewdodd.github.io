I went on a pace or two and put my hand in my pocket, and missed my pocket book, and the same time I turned round, and saw the prisoner cross over the road, I pursued him, he went through Pope's head-alley, across Cornhill, to the Exchange. I came up with him, and looked him in the face; he let the pocket book fall. I saw the pocket-book fall; I picked the pocket book up, and secured the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable I took the prisoner in custody. I received this pocket-book of Mr. Price.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price. That is my pocket-book, it contained a two pound note, and ten one's, and other papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury. On Friday, the 17th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, I was passing the Royal Exchange, and having occasion to cross to go to the piazza's over the way; the prosecutor came up to me; he said he must seize me; I said I would retire to a coffee-house; he sent for an officer; I was examined before the Lord Mayor, and being searched, no property was found on me, but my watch, which is my own. I am perfectly innocent of the felony. I am a young man, twenty-five years of age, eight years I have been in the sea-service. I am convinced that should conviction follow I shall bow with due submission. - Should I meet with an acquittal I am determined to go to sea again. - But it convicted, I trust you may in your wisdom think fit to grant that I may serve his Majesty at sea.</p>

               <p>I was going to Harrow: they lay in a barn in the way; two men came in; they were laughing about the plunder they had got; they talked to one another about the dog, whether they were afraid of it; the other said no, he knew him, he was not afraid; they went away and left them, thinking they would be acceptable to my children, who had no victuals to eat; I took them intending to carry them home.</p>

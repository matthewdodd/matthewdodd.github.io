            . I am a constable. I was in South Audley-street, saw the prisoners, and watched them for near half an hour. I saw them go up to Smith; Jones leant his left hand against his right arm, and with his right hand took the watch out, and gave it to Bunn. I stepped over and told Smith his watch was gone, and to follow me. I ran and seized Bunn, he had his left hand in his breeches pocket. I pulled it out, seized it with the watch in it, and took it from him - several desperate characters tried to rescue him - we kept him at the risk of our lives, and at last got him to the watch-house. Smith assisted in securing Jones; one of them struck me over the head, and said nobody should take him.</p>

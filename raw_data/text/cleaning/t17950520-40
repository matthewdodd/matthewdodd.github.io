               <p>I am a neighbour of Mr. Brookes. On the 2d of May, in the morning, about half after seven, I heard the cry of stop thief! I come to my own door, I see a woman; turn out of the gate of Mr. Brookes's house, about ten yards from my own house; the house shuts in with a gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How far may this gate be from the house? - I suppose it may be about half a dozen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was she that woman? - Yes, she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person before? -Never, to my knowledge. I went out to my own door, and by then I got to the corner, where Mr. Brooke's lives, I see her drop the clothes on the ground, two coats, loose. She was going to run through a passage to get away into Hoxton-square, and she was stopped; I cannot say that I see her stopped, but I see the man bringing her back again from where he took her out of this passage.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner were you robbed? Did you lose a brass candlestick at any time? - The brass candlestick was knocked off the box, I was not robbed of that, I lost the two coats. I cannot say any thing at all about the thief. I see the two coats about ten minutes before they were lost, before the outcry of thief was called, in my bed room where I slept. I have the first floor there, and I went into the other room to breakfast. I have nothing more to say then to swear to my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How many lodgers are there in this house? - Only that family,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200124"></xptr>a man and his wife, and I believe three children.</p>

               <p>Q. By way of security? - Yes. I did not expect any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lodgers in the house at the time? - I don't know nothing about that, they have a right to conduct themselves as they please.</p>

               <p>Q.Was the house broke open? - No, the street door was open, and she went up stairs and unlocked the door, and took the property out. I was at work in the house; I heard an alarm of stop thief; I ran down stairs immediately to give my assistance. When I got down stairs the prisoner had got the property in the street, and she dropped the property. I did not see her drop it; the first thing I see, I see her running away when she had dropped the property, running from the house. I pursued her; she ran through a passage in Paul's-alley, which is a throughfare into Jewin street. I stopped her; but she had jumped over some railings.</p>
               <p>Q. You had her committed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the property that she dropped, picked up? - No, I did not see it picked up. I see it in Charlotte Pike's hands; she is not here; one was a great coat, and the other was a close bodied one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Charlotte Pike is not here? - No, she is not.</p>
               <p>Q.You told my lord that the prisoner went up stairs, and that she must have unlocked the door, you did not see her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are talking what you might suppose on the business; you did not see her drop the things? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you did not know so much about the business as you supposed.</p>

               <p>Q. To Price. Can you say that these are the coats that were dropped by the prisoner? - I believe them to be such.</p>
               <p>Q. To Headbury. Were those the coats that you saw at the woman's feet? - The top coat looks very much like the colour, and the other coat was a blue one, I believe them to be the same.</p>

               <p>Court to Brookes. Are those the coats that you saw in Mrs. Pike's hands? - I will swear they are the coats.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to all the property that belongs to Mr. Catman? -Why I think I could, but these I am certainly able to swear to. My father is a taylor.</p>
               <p>Catman. They are my property; I paid for them both. I suppose I have wore them above half a year.</p>

               <p>Q. Any of the same colours? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any injury done to the house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure that you turned that lock? - I am perfectly sure that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, when a person's life depends on it? - I will swear that I turned the key, and left it in the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You see this woman's life depends on the turn of a key? - That is more than I know. I will swear that I turned the key, and I left the key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always turn the key of that room? - Always.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you to forget it? - I don't know that it has upon my oath. I may have left the key, but however, I have locked it.</p>

               <p>Q.Been over at the public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Been over to the Rose? - Yes; but what does that signify my sentiments are always the same.</p>

               <p>Q. How much have you drank in the course of this afternoon? - What is that material?</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How much have you been drinking? - I never stipulate, I think as you think, that it is strange nonsense.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, what liquor have you been drinking at the public house? -What have I been drinking; why sir, I have had some rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? - What is that to you?</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been drinking freely, or have you not? - Rather too free, more that I ought to have done.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very indecent in you to be getting into liquor, when a woman's life is at stake.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave her a good character, said she was a lace maker, and came out of the west country.</p>

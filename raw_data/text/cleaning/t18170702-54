            . I am a constable. On the 27th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming along Skinner-street, and observed the two prisoners lurking about the door of an oil-shop, which made me watch them. They came into Newgate-street; Mr. Gaulter came out of a pastrycook's shop. They passed the door before he came out, and returned again. Wright came back, and left Evans standing towards Cheapside. Immediately as Mr. Gaulter passed, Wright turned round and fellowed him. Evans came up to him-they walked together, and Wright put his hand into Mr. Gaulter's coat-pocket, took out the handkerchief, and gave it to Evans. I seized Evans with it in his hand-Wright turned up towards Giltspur-street Compter. I called out stop thief! - He was secured immediately. Evans got from me; he was stopped immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Isaac Lawrence, of Nos. 4 and 5, Watling-street. The warehouse is part of the dwelling-house—I do not live there, but I am there in the daytime—it is in the parish of St. Augustine—Mr. Lawrence has two partners—they are Scotch and Manchester warehousemen—last Monday week, the 29th of December, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I was reading the newspaper—I heard the warehouse door open—I looked round, and saw the prisoner take up a few prints on his shoulder, and walk out with them—I had not seen him come in—I saw him taking them on his shoulder, and walk off</p>

            . I live in Stone-cutter-street, and am a horse-keeper; I had three guineas, three half-guineas, a French half-crown, and twenty-one half-crowns, besides some small money in a little box, in a corn-bin in the stable; it was taken out, I suspected the prisoner, he being used to be in the stable; he lived with Mr. Cushee a a corn-chandler in Shoe-lane, I had lent him a stock, and took it out of the place where the money was, and put it about his neck on the 19th of January, then he saw the money, it was in a little white purse in the box. I took him up on suspicion, and had him to Guild-hall, he confessed there before several people that he had taken the money out of the box; he then took three guineas out of his shoe, and a French half-crown, which was all he had left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the very words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Panson. He owned he had got the money and the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner in order to induce him to a confession?</p>
               <p>Panson. No, I did not; he called to me and said he was very sorry it should happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you mentioned money at that time?</p>
               <p>Panson. I had, and he owned he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the sum ?</p>
               <p>Panson. He owned all the particulars, as I mentioned them to him at several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cushee. He produced a French half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Do you know this piece? look at it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the very piece that was with my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular mark to it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a black spot on the smooth side of it, by which I know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there were a number of French half-crowns all mixed together, could you know that very piece from the rest?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I could.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you pick that out from the rest?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I could because of the mark, the spot of dirt.</p>

            . On the Sunday-morning I found the prisoner asleep in my bed when I came from my duty; I am a watchman; I shook him very much before I could awake him, when I did he shook his head, and asked me where he was? I said he was in Gray's-inn-lane; he asked me if I could get any thing to warm him? I said there was a house up, which was the Green-dragon, I took him there, he called for a pint of purl, and drank it all up, and called for another; then he pulled out his money to pay for it, among which I saw some guineas and a piece something like a half-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that piece again was you to see it?</p>

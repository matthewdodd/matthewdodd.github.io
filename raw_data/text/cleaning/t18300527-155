             BILLETT. I live at Richmond, Surrey. On the 18th of May I was looking in at a picture-shop at the corner of <placeName id="t18300527-155-crimeloc847">St. Paul's church-yard</placeName>

            . I am a constable of Portsoken ward. I was in St. Paul's church-yard about twenty minutes to six o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another one with him - I had seen them together a little time before this happened; they stopped at Harris' window, then went to Ludgate-hill - I went and stopped at the window myself; they came back - the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand pocket; there was nothing there - he then made a motion to his companion, who put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and pulled the handkerchief a little way out; then the prisoner put his apron up, and they took it quite out between them; I called to the prosecutor and caught hold of the prisoner; he dropped the handkerchief from his apron - I caught hold of the other, but he got away; Mr. Billett owned the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is most all false that he has said.</p>
               <p>MR. BILLETT. The handkerchief corresponds in pattern and appearance with mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Is there not more handkerchiefs than one alike? I was passing this picture-shop and saw a mob looking at the books and things, and had not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270076"></xptr>there a minute before the constable caught hold of me by the shoulder: another young man stood by my side, but I knew nothing of him - a handkerchief laid on the ground; he took hold of the young man, and let go of him instantly; he walked away, and he never called Stop thief! after him or any thing.</p>

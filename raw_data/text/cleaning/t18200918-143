The prisoner accosted me by putting her hand round my waist, and wished me to go with her, I refused; she went away in a short time, abusing and swearing at me. I had my hand in my breeches-pocket just before she came up, I had four 1 l. notes there - as soon as she left I missed them. I had not lost sight of her. I came up with her about twenty yards off, took hold of her, and said she had robbed me of four 1 l. notes, and if she did not return them I would charge the watch with her - she denied it; I called the watch. Some man immediately came up and knocked me down - he was a perfect stranger to me. He said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, who are you giving in charge?" The watchman then came up; he ran away, and the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. She was searched, and almost stripped, but they could not find the notes. I said I was positive she had them. I saw her convey her hand to her mouth - I forced my finger into her mouth, and took them from under her tongue.</p>

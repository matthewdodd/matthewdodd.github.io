                  </hi>. I am a tailor and clothes-salesman, and live at Nos. 36 and 37, Brook-street, Holborn, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Sunday, the 29th of March, about six o'clock in the, evening, I was in my back parlour, and saw a bag hanging there—it contained the articles stated, which are worth altogether about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is a bag Which I use in my business—I buy clothes—I bad been out the day before—about nine o'clock there came a ring at the bell, my niece went to open the door, and discovered a light in the back parlour—in consequence of that I went into the back parlour, and missed the bag—the door was left open into the passage—if they had gone out of the back parlour by that door, they would have got out of the front door—the front door was shut, they could not have got in by any other means except by keys—there was, no<lb></lb>body in the back parlour when I went in—I found my bag in the course of the same night—the policeman came to ask me about It—there was a candle burning in the back parlour when I went In—there Were two candles left on the Saturday night, and they had lit one of them—It was not lighted when I left my bag there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's niece, and live with him. I called my uncle, and went into the back-parlour—one of the candles was lighted—it appeared to have been lighted some time—it was almost burnt out, and had a very long snuff—it had been a large-sized candle—I do not think it was a mould—it was much shorter than the other—it was about nine o'clock, or a little after, when I discovered it.</p>

I was going off with it, when he said, "Stop, you may as well carry these with you;" and he put something into my pocket, but I did not know what it was at the time.

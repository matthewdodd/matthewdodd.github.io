               <p>Mr. Garrow to Hawkins. What condition was the prisoner in, when you found him? - I did not see he was any way in liquor.</p>
               <p>He was walking on publickly, like any body else, that had been to protect property from the ravages of those that meant to steal it? - I did not perceive any thing of the kind, he said, he was carrying them to the Three Kings, in the Minories; I did not go to that house, but I afterwards understood he had been drinking there, till he went to assist at the fire.</p>

               <p>What sort of a box was it? - It was a sort of reddish trunk, I would not have given a penny for it, it was tied up with a sort of lace or pin case, as I could think at that time, the man took it under his arm first, and put it on his shoulder; I said to him, Mr. Allen, what fetches you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150079"></xptr> here at this time, I knew him before; she followed him as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the prisoner any thing else in his hand? - She seemed to reach him the trunk, and I do not know what she was going to give him besides.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing in either of their hands? - Nothing in the world; she asked him to carry it into Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called five more witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Who has the custody of the key of the cellar. - A. It is always kept by Mrs. Hart or myself; on the second of October I counted the bottles of rum, seventy-four in number; I then locked the cellar door, and locked up the key of the cellar in a cupboard, in my parlour, where it usually had been kept. I placed the key upon the shelf in the closet, with the ring of the key flat on the shelf, and marked the precise spot where the key was with a pen strait line where the ring of the key was, in order to ascertain whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010035"></xptr>cellar was opened by a false key, or the closet, I left town on the third, and returned again on the sixth. On my return, I went to the closet and found the key had been removed from the position. It was out of the marks, I put it in, and the ring of the key laid upwards, It had been moved, I was convinced that the access to the cellar was not by a false key; yesterday on examining it, I found the mahogany slab had been wrenched up, and by inserting a hand into the closet, the key might be taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit your cellar afterwards. - A. I did, I can speak positively to one bottle of rum being gone.</p>

I then said it was very strange that a young man should be in her bed, she said it was her bed, but not the bed that she slept in, I said, I am satisfied in this bed two people have slept in, I will search all the beds, Wood searched the man, and I the woman, we went down into the kitchen, and on searching the pantry, we found part of a bottle of rum, I asked the woman how she got that rum, she said she purchased it, it was more than an hour before we had done searching, I found a number of keys, we were trying to see if we could unlock any of the locks in the house, and after I had finished the search, I said, Cook, as you purchased the rum, you can tell me the person you bought it of, Oh! no, said she, it was given me. The man and woman was left there, I took the rum away, and went to Mr. Witton's to get a servant to take care of the house, I returned, and the man I took in custody first, the woman afterwards. The man said, he could have made his exit from the house the week before, for Mrs. Hart had told the cook that there were two officers coming to search the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of October I went to Mr. Hart's house, in company with Trott, we went up to the garret, and there Radley was laying in bed, I searched the garret, there were some of his own wearing apparel, there, I searched the drawer in the kitchen, there were two coats, some fiddle strings, and two fiddles laying upon the dresser, which he owned, Mrs. Witton's cook took possession of the house, and was left in care of the woman, the man was taken on that day,

               <p>Q. In consequence of any application made to you, did you attend upon the prisoners - A, I attended upon both the prisoners, in consequence of an application made by the prisoners to Mr. Hart, respecting their clothes; I asked both the prisoners whether I should deliver their clothes to them, or to the person who made application to Mr. Hart for them. Both the prisoners said I was to deliver them to the person that was with me, their friend, he was present at that time; I believe he is here. There were some conversation passed between Radley and me about the two shirts, that were found in the prisoner Smith's box. I asked him if he knew who he had them off. He said that he had them of a gentleman that was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver up to them the property that was found in the prisoner Smith's box - A. Yes, all except the two shirts I delivered to the person they called their friend.</p>

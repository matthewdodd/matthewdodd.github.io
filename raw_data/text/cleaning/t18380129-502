                  </hi>. I am assistant to a surgeon, and live at No. 74, Sun-street, Bishopsgate. On the night of Saturday, the 6th of January, I was in Whitechapel, between nine and ten o'clock—I was passing the shop of Messrs. Pace's, and saw the prisoner deliberately break a pane of glass then introduce his hand, and run away—(<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am certain it was past nine o'clock)—I thought, from the way in which he introduced his hand a second time, that he had taken something—I instantly pursued him, feeling con<lb></lb>vinced that he had stolen something—I overtook him about forty or fifty yards off, and laid hold of him—I charged him with the theft—he made no reply—I held him for some time—several persons surrounded me when I took him—a policeman came up—the persons in treated me to let him go, and he would no doubt have effected his escape had not the policeman come up—I then gave him in charge—I am positive I secured the persone who put his hand into the shop-window—I went back with him to the shop—I do not recollect hearing him say any thing there—be was searched</p>

On Saturday, greater f January, I was attending to a customer, just before ten o'clock, and heard a pane of glass broken—it wanted about ten minutes or a quarter to ten o'clock—we have watches and clocks in the shop—I immediately ran to the window, and saw a man's hand introduced through the broken glass and take up the watch—the watch was produced to me a week after by the officer—it is worth sixteen guineas, and is the property of my masters—it a the watch I saw taken.</p>

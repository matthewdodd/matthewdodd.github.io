            . The prisoner was entrusted to receive money for me till the 1st of June. Mr. Parsons owed me 7s. for a sack of salt, delivered on the 4th of May. I have never received the money from the prisoner - he made a minute of what he received; I checked it off in the book - he paid me some money on the 12th of May. I had given him a receipt for Parson's; he brought it back, and said it was not convenient to pay it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that his master having had to pay a fine for his not paying the turnpike, and had stopped 2l. 17s. 9d. of the prisoner's wages, and that he took this cash to provide for his family.</p>
               <p>JOHN MOORE. This is false; I paid him 2l. 1s. 8d. on the 1st of June - I was fined 2l. 16s., but never stopped it out of his wages. It is entirely false.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. I went to Mr. Booth's on Monday the 16th of January, about six o'clock—I took Hor<lb></lb>ton and Crosby into custody—I searched Crosby in the shop, and found two duplicates on him—and one duplicate on Horton for a pair of trowsers pawned for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in the name of Crosby—while I was about taking the duplicate out of Horton's pocket, he said it referred to his own property—when I saw the name of Crosby on it, he said that Crosby had pawned them for him—they said this pair of trowsers was given them by a man outside in a corduroy dress—I went out immediately, but could see no such person—but I saw Stiles about ten yards from the door—I went out after Booth—Stiles then wore the jacket which Horton now wears—I asked Stiles to step into the shop—I said I was a constable, and would take the liberty of searching him—he gave his name as Watts, belong<lb></lb>ing to Greenwich—the other prisoners denied all knowledge of him when I brought him in—not finding any thing on him, I did not detain him—conveyed the other two prisoners to the shop of Messrs. Davis, and there the property was identified—I afterwards took Stiles in Powis-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich.</p>

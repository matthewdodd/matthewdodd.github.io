             sworn. - I went by the order of Mr. Graham, to pick some hay-bands, in doing of which, I found a small parcel, which I gave to Mr. Graham, he opened it, and seeing the contents, he placed it as it was before; Mr. Graham desired me to take notice if any one carried it away, but not to speak to any body; in about ten minutes, the prisoner came up, under pretence of searching for a knife, which he said he had dropped a few days before; I perceived him put his hand towards his pocket; in a few minutes afterwards he went down stairs; immediately after for my own curiosity, I turned up the straw to see if the opium remained there or not, and found it was gone, and according to Mr. Graham's directions, I staid there till he came, and I informed him that the prisoner had been there; Mr. Graham did not know, I believe, at the time, where the man's re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200047"></xptr>sidence was, and his warehouseman, who had the only knowledge of it, was gone over the water; I waited there with Mr. Graham and the constable, till the prisoner returned; Mr. Graham and I went with the constable to his lodgings, and in searching his wife, he found it in her pocket; the prisoner had told me, that it was in a drawer in his apartments, but when we had searched and could not find it, we searched the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man lived with you? - A. Upwards of twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave? - A. He behaved in general well, but a great number of thefts have been committed in the house since he came to it.(Abraham Bone, the constable, produced the opium, which was deposed to by Mr. Graham).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife has been very ill for a long time; I took it home, with intention to take a little bit of it for her, intending to take the rest back again.</p>

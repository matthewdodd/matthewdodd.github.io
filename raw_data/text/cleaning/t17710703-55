            . I live in the Old Change. I have known Mrs. Hirst from her birth: her husband is a hackney coachman; she did live in Compton-street, Soho; I never heard any thing amiss of her character before this affair; we were next door neighbours in Oxfordshire. I saw her in London last summer.</p>

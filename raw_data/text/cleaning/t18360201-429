                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Hereford-street, Lisson-grove. I am in the habit of going to the shop of Mr. Symes, a grocer, in Edgeware road, to assist in his business. On the 9th of January I was there—the prisoner was also in the habit of assisting him, and was there that night—I recollect a female coming, and asking for a quarter of of a pound of coffee—the prisoner served her—she paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he put the sixpence into the till, and I saw him at the same time take half-a-crown out, and put it inside the cuff of his coat—I informed Mr. Symes what I had seen—and officer was brought—Mr. Symes called me and the prisoner into the parlour—White was present—Mr. Symes asked me where I saw Bay<lb></lb>ley put the half crown—I said, "He put it in the cuff of his coat"—he said, "Where?" and I touched to the cuff, and felt it there—the prisoner said nothing, but went away fainting like—Mr. Symes said. "Have you got any more money about you?"—he said, "Yes," and took out eight shillings, and put them on the table—Mr. Symes called in White, and told him to take the money out of the cuff of his coat—he said, "Pray forgive me"—there were five half crowns and eleven shillings found in one cuff of his coat, and he took eight shillings out of one of his pockets—he said that was his own—he did not claim the rest.</p>

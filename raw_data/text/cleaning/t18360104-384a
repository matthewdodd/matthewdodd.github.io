                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Geach—he is a solicitor, and lives at Ponty-Pool, in Monmouthshire. I knew the prisoner about four years—he lived at Ponty-Pool—he was a shopman and shop-keeper there—he had many transactions with Mr. Geach, which would enable him to become acquainted with his hand-writing—I believe the whole of this bill to be the prisoner's hand-writing. but I am sure the acceptance is—I have seen him write many times—these three letters I believe to be the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—the signature to this cheque on Messrs. Robarts, I also believe to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, living at Ponty-Pool. I know the prisoner at the bar—I have had many transactions with him—I never authorized him to accept bills of exchange for me—no part of this bill is written by me, or by my authority—I think it is the hand-writing of the prisoner—these letters I believe are his writing also—he has had re<lb></lb>peated opportunities of becoming acquainted with my hand-writing—the acceptance is an imitation of mine.</p>

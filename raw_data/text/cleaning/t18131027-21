I clapped my hand, and missed my pocket-book; I instantly looked round, and saw the prisoner among others near me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. Two or three; I could not describe them; a number of persons were passing at the time. The prisoner crossed the way, and went on towards London-stone-church; I kept an eye upon him, and while I was considering whether it was not possible that I might have left the book at Lloyd's coffee-house, he looked round over his shoulder, and mended his pace; I immediately holloaed out stop thief; he was pursued by several persons; he crossed down towards Bush-lane; when I came up to Bush-lane, I found him in possession of two persons; they told me that he threw my pocket-book, down Jefferson and Lewis's area of the warehouse; one of Jeffersons's men shortly after produced it to me.</p>

            . I keep an eating-house; I was coming up Cannon-street a little after three o'clock, I met the prisoner running; Molley was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270020"></xptr>calling stop thief. I took him by the collar. He had the pocket-book in his left hand. I saw him slide it down his thigh, through the bars, into the area of a warehouse, into the cellar. I held him until the pocket-book was brought, and an officer. The prisoner is lame on his hip, or something; he can go pretty quick with his limbs.</p>
               <p>NORTHWAY. I took charge of the prisoner, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the pocket-book; the Lord Mayor desired me to take the bills of exchange out of the book. I have the stamp receipts and bills of exchange in my pocket now. They are all mine. They were in this pocket-book when I lost it, and I am sure this book is mine.</p>

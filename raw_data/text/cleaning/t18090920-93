When I came home, she was still in a fit; I got a man to hold her while I went up to make the bed; I found the sheets were gone off the bed, I called down to my husband, and said, do you know any thing of the sheets; he said, no, the man that was with her, said, what have you done with the sheets; she said, that she had laid them on the window bench; she came up stairs; my husband said, look round, and see what is become of the children's things; I then missed all the articles in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her of taking all these things - A. Because I put them into her hands, as I do of every Thursday, a neighbour called a watchman, and I gave charge of her; she said she knew nothing about them; my husband said, if you have made away with them I will take them out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first see Cuffey about these matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The beginning of it was after he was my class-leader, about a fortnight after I joined—I had seen him many times before that—I made the application to be put under him—I was ambitious of being one of his officers—I was a private—I expected promotion—if the thing; succeeded, I was to be made a general, or something of that—I was not to be made King—I expected to be made President of the Commonwealth—I was a Chartist before I joined the Association—I was at work at that time—I have not been in any difficulty to speak of—I bad been locked up merely for getting drunk—I was had up once, seven or eight years ago—I was waiting for a companion of mine in Whitehall-gardens, to go to Putney races, and was standing looking at James I., it being my trade to cast those figures, and I was looking to see whereabouts it was put together, when a constable came up to me, and said I had no business to stand there, and desired me to move on—I thought he exceeded his duty, and did not like his manner of speakiag to me, and thought I would be obstinate, and there I stood all day from nine in the morning till five in the evening, when I was taken up, and taken to the station in Gardener's-lane—I was taken to Bow-street, it was too late, so they took me back again—I was not charged with picking any One's pocket—they searched me, I suppose to see what they could find—I was ordered to find bail for six months—I did so—I remained in prison three weeks—I am sure that is the only time I have been in prison—I have been in a court of justice, merely as a witness, not for the police, but on a private affair—I have been working at my own trade.</p>

               <p>go on with them as regards moral force, but not to have any movement in the physical force, because I thought it was not a right thing—I should think the gunpowder cartridges and ginger-beer bottles were for physical force—I did not fill any of the ginger-beer bottles—I reminded Cuffey of them, because another man told me of them; it was not Powell, it was a man named Peter Cashel—I merely told Cuffey about it to see what he would say, I whether there were any fresh orders coming—he might not have told me without—it led him on to think I was sincere—I was not sincere in the phy<lb></lb>sical force movement—I meant to stop the progress of it, if any attempt was made—I did not mention to Cuffey the way in which the ginger-beer bottles were to be used—Cuffey said they were very good things for their wives to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> out of the windows on the police—I did offer to sharpen the pike—head—I did that from the same motive—it was not to lead him on, and then to betray him; that was not leading him on—I meant to stop the physical force movement, that was why I offered to sharpen the pike—head—I was in com<lb></lb>munication with the officers of the Government—I was not employed by them—I first communicated with them about a month after I joined the Chartists, some time in June—it was after that that I offered to sharpen the pike—head—it was said, merely to see what I could get out of him, to see what movements were on—it was not to see how far I could get him to go—I could not get him to go at all myself—he had orders from the wardens who were above him—from time to time during June I communicated what was going on—I was not associated with Powell—I did not know him till I saw him on this trial—I did not know he was employed—there was nobody associated with me—I do not expect to get anything for this—I do it for the good of the public, and likewise of myself—if they succeeded in burning houses they would stop trade and put me out of work, and I have a wife and family—they were to set fire to people's houses, and if anybody opposed them they were to knock them on the head—that would of course stop trade, and cause me to loose my work—that was the good I contemplated to myself by turn<lb></lb>ing spy and informer—I swear that—I was not examined before the Magi<lb></lb>strate—I was not examined at all till Saturday, on Dowling's trial—I heard of Cuffey's being taken into custody when I went to his house, about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not know he was to be taken—he was taken on the evening I went to his house—I had been before he was taken, and I went after—I went alone the first time—I did not go into his room, I might if I liked—he lives in a garret—I never noticed that there was a cock<lb></lb>loft there, or a loft at all—I now know there is one from what I have heard—I did not know it before—I have been into his room several times—about twenty-four times—I never noticed a trap-door there—I did not know there was one—I did not put the pole into it—I merely went to the house to get information from Cuffey—I did not know he was apprehended till I went the second time—I did not get the information I wanted—I knew he was taken, because I saw his son at the door of his house—I believe it to be his son—he is about twenty-seven years of age—I ascertained from him that he was taken—I was not in communication with West, the policeman, at that time, I did not know him then—I am now living by my work; that is the only mode I have no other means—I am in regular work with Mr. Martin, of 18, Grezert-street—I get 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, sometimes less sometimes more—I have been working for him off and on thirteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. Shortly after the 10th of April I joined the Cripplegate locality of the Chartist Confederation—I was appointed one of the Council—our place of meeting was the front long-room, at Cart<lb></lb>wright's coffee-shop, Redcross-street, Cripplegate—I was a member down to Aug.—I attended meetings of the same body at other places, and made notes of what occurred, sometimes the next day, and sometimes the day after, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180105"></xptr>
               <p>on one or two occasions, if not three, immediately I got home—they are very short—I speak principally from my memory (<hi rend="italic">looking at his notes</hi>)—the first meeting Fay was at, was on Friday, July 28th, at Hopkinson's coffee-shop, Saffron-hill—(it was held by adjournment from a former meeting at the same place—I was present at the adjournment)—on 28th, fourteen persons were present—Ferdinando, Mr. Page, from Tothill-street, Westminster locality; Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Payne, myself, Hopkinson, an Irish Confederate,: Mr. Home, (his first appearance,) Flannagan, Fay, and others—a return was given in of the number of fighting men, and the feeling of the members of the respective localities, by the new delegates that came there on that evening from localities in the metropolis—I was then acting as a delegate for Cripplegate locality—I cannot say bow many fighting men they returned—Mr. Payne was chairman, but Mullins was spokesman—a resolution was passed that each member should bring 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as soon as possible, to defray the expenses incurred by the committee—the meeting was adjourned to meet at Cart-wright's, on Sunday afternoon, July 30th—Payne, Dowling, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, (his first appearance,) Stevenson, myself, Ferdinando, Fay, and others, were present, twenty-eight in all—I got there between three and half-past three o'clock—returns were given in, the same as before, by the new delegates, and the ulterior committee resigned—that consisted of five—there was some conversation about increasing them to the number of nine, and some charge was brought against Mullins and Rose, two of the five, as being spies—Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Dowling, were elected—it was confined to five, but a resolution was passed that four others should be elected at the next meeting—I never was proposed—I said I bad heard that some charge had been brought against Rose and Mullins, and I thought it was better to set aside such trash, and have nothing more to do with it; and they were elected—I also made some remark that it was impossible for them to do anything in our movement, unless they could produce a spirit of subordination among the members—I believe that was after the allegation made against the two men as spies—it was resolved that they should meet at Cartwright's, at six on the following Monday evening, if necessary, but there was no meeting—they met next at the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane. Fleet-street, on 1st Aug.—Rose, Mullins, Brewster, Dowling, Thompson, Donovan, Lynch, Warry, and others, thirty-four in all, were present—Payne was in the chair—Fay was there—I do not remember seeing the other prisoners—Bezer was there, it was his first appearance—he gave in a report of fifty fighting men from Cartwright's, for which locality he was secretary—he was not a delegate—there were other returns made—Fay, Thompson, Lynch, and Donovan, four Irishmen, were elected on the committee—their club belonged to the Irish Confederates at one time, but they altered the name to the Irish Felon-club—I am not certain which it was called at this time—Fay was secretary—they used to meet at Cartwright's—the reason given for adding four Irishmen to the committee was, that a feeling of jealousy existed—the whole of the four spoke that evening, and stated that they thought there was not a sufficient number of Irishmen on the committee, and in consequence of that they were added—there was some discussion on the propriety of dis<lb></lb>patching a party to Limerick or Cork—I forget who brought that forward; it was discussed, and lost, at the voting—(<hi rend="italic">The witness here requested that every witness subpoenaed to speak against his character might be ordered out of Court</hi>)—during the discussion it was said that it would be a waste of money, and there would be no possibility of getting a correct account of the state of affairs in Ireland; that was said by both sides—a report was given in from the</p>

               <p>delegates the same as before—nothing more was said about the Irish mes<lb></lb>senger—Dowling moved that there should be a demonstration on the following Sunday, 6th Aug., at two o'clock, on Primrose-hill, of Chartists and Confederates, to ascertain their number and strength; that was lost by a majority of five—a resolution was passed that every delegate should return to his locality, and ascertain how the members were prepared for regularity of preparation, and ready to be called out at an hour's notice, and to bring friends to the committee on Friday, Aug. 4th—Mullins stated that he had seen Mr. Kydd that day, and that Mr. Kydd, if the people came out for physical force, would not be backward in heading them; but that Mr. Kydd had entered on the executive only as a moral force man, and that he took the office on that ground—Kydd was one of the executive of the National Convention—the executive had to pay attention to the localities, to look after them, and receive names from them—they were in connection with the localities—that communication was received with a degree of satisfaction and surprise by the delegates—the meeting then adjourned to meet at Cartwright's on Aug. 4th—I attended—there were thirty-two present—Payne was in the chair on all occasions—Cuffey was there for the first tide, and Rose, Brewster, Gurney, Mullins, Bassett, (his second time,) Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, myself, Thompson, and others—I have not Fay's name-there were new delegates present; they gave in a report of the number of fight<lb></lb>ing men; I have no numbers—money was paid by the new delegates, and by some of the old, to Rose, as secretary—there was a discussion about what scarfs were to be worn, as signs of leadership, and it was decided that they should be red calico sashes—there was a conversation in committee between Payne, Bassett, and Mullins, about a communication that had been received from Kydd, and of a circular he had received, desiring to know how far the dele<lb></lb>gates then sitting in London, were desirous of sending a delegate to Manchester—I believe Bassett communicated that to the meeting—Payne made some remarks about his sleeping two or three nights at Lacey's house, and Lacey was proposed as a proper person to go to Manchester as a delegate, and it was agreed to—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey, who was not present, on the subject, and Mullins gave him money for the purpose—he went off, and I saw no more of him that evening—a resolution was passed by the general body of delegates that they should submit to the determination of the ulterior committee, the committee of nine—it was resolved that the delegates should call on their respective members to meet at half-past two on the following Sunday, at their localities, and they were not, by any means, to leave there, or visit Kennington-common that day—there had been a meeting at Kennington-common advertised in the newspapers, which was not called by any of the Chartist or Confederate bodies, and they were not to go for fear of coming into collision with the police and the authorities—a resolution was passed that every delegate should select four men, or more, for the purpose of placing them as telegraphs from the Dispatch coffee-house, Bride-lane, to Kennington-common, to communicate information to the delegates sittings the Dispatch coffee-house—it was resolved that they should meet at the Dispatch coffee-house, at half-past two o'clock on the following Sunday—I attended there, and was appointed as one to see the persons stationed as tele<lb></lb>graphs—I returned to the meeting of delegates just at its close, and found Payne, Brewster, Mullins, and others, there—I have no names—Cuffey was there when I returned, and 1 saw him there before the business commenced—the resolution as to stationing persons was carried out—I saw every man placed—the meeting separated about a quarter of an hour after I returned—I</p>

               <p>have no note of what took place, but my memory furnishes me—when I returned, Page, of Tothill-street, Westminster, was speaking on the subject of giving Mr. Bund Hughes, the Government reporter, a sound thrashing for what he had been doing—Page was a delegate—they met again on Monday night, 7th Aug., at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials—there were thirty persons present; Cuffey, myself, Brewster, Mullins, Rose, Allnutt, Donovan, Dowling, Fay. Lynch, Thompson, Bassett, Ritchie, and others—the Ulterior Committee resigned that night, in consequence of the rumours of Smith O'Brien's arrest, and partly from a want of confidence that five of the committee had in the new four that had been added, and the four new ones complained that they had not seen the plans of the other five, and the five gave a similar explanation of not seeing the plans of the others—a new committee was appointed, consisting of five only, Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Brewster—it was arranged, after some discussion, that there should be a visionary president, and that one of the committee who had the lowest votes should withdraw to make room for him when he entered on the seat of presidentship, some one asked who this person was, and one of the delegates said he was neither in London, nor out of London, and that was my meaning in saying a "visionary president"—Bassett had the lowest amount of votes—it was resolved that each member of every locality was to pay three farthings a head, as a salary for the president—each delegate was to make that known, and was to collect it—Payne, who was in the chair, read a letter, which he said he had received from Lacey, and part of it was in these words, "Trade is very good, and you will soon receive a very good order"—that was received by the meeting with satisfaction—we then adjourned, to meet on the following Wednesday, Aug. 9th, at the Lord Denman beer-shop, Suffolk-street, Borough—I attended—there were Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, myself, Gurney, Donovan, Bassett, and others, in all twenty-eight present—as I was going in, I met Cuffey in the passage, going away—the meeting had begun before I got there—I shook hands with Cuffey, and asked him bow be was—after I arrived reports were given in of the feeling of the members of the loca<lb></lb>lities, and also a return of fighting men—Gurney gave in his return, either 100 or 120, but I think it was 100, from our locality—Gurney was formerly in the Artillery—his duty, as wardsman, was to look after his 100 men—each wardsman had 100 men under him, and each class-leader had nine under him, I often heard that said at Cartwright's—I do not remember the numbers mentioned by anybody else that night—a resolution was passed that each delegate should be called on to declare his allegiance, and determination to abide by the decision of the Ulterior Committee, and they stated, all except one, that they would abide by the determination of the committee—I am not sure who that one was—I think his name was Horne—he gave a reason for it, but I forget it—he came in nearly at the close of the business—Payne read an<lb></lb>other Utter from Lacey, and, in answer to some questions, he stated that Lacey was still at Manchester—some of the delegates present asked how long he was going to continue there, and Payne replied, as long as was necessary—I think, but am not sure, that there was a return given in at that meeting of the number of cartridges that were prepared—I have no note of it, I go from memory—a resolution was passed that they should meet at Perry's coffee-house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, on Friday, Aug. 11th, at eight o'clock—I went, and found no meeting—when I entered the coffee-room, I saw a person busy in packing up some chairs—he knew me, and said there was no meeting; that it was all <hi rend="italic">up;</hi> that the police had been to Rose's house, and seized his papers—</p>

               <p>the same person who told me that had been stationed on the Sunday as one of the telegraphs—the next meeting 1 attended was at the Orange Tree Orange-street, Red Lion-square, on Monday night, 14th—I went up stairs—I have not kept a memorandum of the persons who attended, but, to the best of my belief, there were twenty-five persons there—they were Mullins Brewster, Payne, Gurney, Fay, Ritchie, Scurry, Cuffey, and others, whose faces I knew, but not their names—a report was given in from some new delegates of the state of their localities, and of the number of fighting men the number of ball-cartridges that each delegate himself had prepared, and also the members of his locality—the number was 5000 fighting men of Chartists alone, and the number of cartridges was between 500 and 600—a question was asked about the number of Irish Confederates, and Mullins said they were about the same number as the Chartists—a resolution was proposed, I think by Mullins, and carried, that a deputation of two, Ritchie and Scurry, should wait on the North-western Railway engineers, to ascertain what were their feelings, and how far they were disposed to come over ad join the Chartists in their movement—they were to ascertain that if pos<lb></lb>sible, and they were requested by no means to give them the least ides what was their purpose in going there to wait on them—it was men<lb></lb>tioned that there was a dispute between the company and the men—I did not know of that till that evening—Mullins proposed, and it was resolved, that each delegate should select four or six men, or as many as he could get, men whom he could depend on, that would do anything and every<lb></lb>thing—some one asked what purpose they were for; and Cuffey said, to fire houses, railway premises, trains, or anything—Mullins then looked up as the gas. which was burning at the time, and said, "If I look up at the gas you will all know what I mean"—neither Ritchie or Scurry were present when that was resolved—they had left on their deputation, and the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been voted to defray their expenses in the way of refreshments—I am not certain it was put to the vote, but I know 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid—they were not present when the last part of this occurred—Cuffey was secretary to the Ulterior Committee at this time—he stated so himself that evening—Brew<lb></lb>ster's conduct was not altogether becoming, and Cuffey said, "As secretary I have a right to rebuke you," or something to that effect—the meets; adjourned to the Lord Denman on the next evening—I went about eight or a little before, accompanied by Gurney—Payne, Mullins, Brewster, Cuffey, Dowling, Allnut, Fay, Gurney, Lacey, Ritchie, Page, Ferdinando, and others in all about forty were present—I saw some new faces, and I believe tier were delegates, and there were one or two that I knew were not delegates—Lacey stood with others near a window, and he began to tell us about the people in the country—he said that the men of Birmingham and Manchester, and I think he said Liverpool, were up and doing, or would be doing that night—that he had been watched all day by the police, and that on coming out of the door a boy came up to him and told him that he had been watched by the police for two or three hours, and he said he had given them the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> and reached the place in safety—I had never seen him before—I asked him his name, and he said Lacey—about half an hour afterwards Brewster distri-buted coloured wristbands, exactly such a one as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me—Mullins was present, and I also think he distributed some—Brewster—said they were for the delegates to wear on their left wrists that their members might know them—about half an hour after the distribution, as far as my memory furnishes me, Fay came in and brought a person of the name of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180109"></xptr>
               <p>Donaldson, a member of our locality, who had no right to be there—I believe Fay had not been there before on that evening—Donaldson not being a dele<lb></lb>gate, had no right to be present—he went by the name of Donaldson—he bad not been long seated before they called for a pint of porter—some of the ulterior Committee, I believe Cuffey and Payne, came in shortly after—I had not seen them before—before Fay came in there was a question asked where the Committee should retire to, as the room up stairs was occupied by singing—that was after the distribution of colours—there was a talk of the Com<lb></lb>mittee going somewhere else, and Lacey said, "There is a neighbouring coffee-shop, kept by a person I know; I will go and see if we can have the room"—he left for that purpose—he came back directly, and said he had engaged the room—Payne, Brewster, Mullins, Cuffey, and Lacey then went—they were away half or three-quarters of an hour—Lacey did not return with them—I did not see him again that evening—they returned after Fay had come into the room—Mullins acted as chairman and spokesman—Cuffey said to him, "Now, Mr. Chairman, you had better give the instructions"—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, as you are aware the Committee have retired and come to certain resolutions and decisions; they have requested me to give you the following instructions. Our friend Mr. Lacey has informed us that the men of Birming<lb></lb>ham and Manchester are up and doing, or will be doing to-night, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, therefore, Gentlemen, to-mor<lb></lb>row night you must come out to fight, and strike the blow: it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey said, "My time is short, my men are waiting; I take the western division; you had better put it round the room one by one, and let them answer yes or no"—Mullins then asked the man on ray right, "Will you come out to fight?"—he said, "Yes"—he-appealed to me, and I said, "Yes"—he then went round and put the question to every delegate till he came to Ferdinando, who stood up and spoke, and gave some reason why he would not come out—he said, "No"—the companion delegate to Allnutt, whose name I do not know, also answered, "No"—he did not give any reason—those were the only two exceptions—at this time all those I have named were present except Lacey—Mullins then said, "We shall take up four positions: Clerkenwell-green; the Tower Hamlets; Broadway, Westminster; and the Seven Dials"—Brewster was to take Clerkenwell-green, Payne the Tower Hamlets, and Mullins and Bassett the Broadway and Seven Dials, but which each was to take of the two I cannot say—Mullins then said, "Gentlemen, every delegate must assemble the members of his locality armed at their localities at eight o'clock to-morrow night precisely"—some delegate asked how they were to get there with their pikes—Mullins said, "I can only say get them there the best way you can, and every delegate must be with his members at their respective positions at twenty minutes past nine to a second"—he then went on to say that the different localities that were divided into different districts were to meet each of the four leaders, who were to have charge of the four districts—Brewster was to have Clerkenwell; and the City, Cripplegate, and Finsbury localities were to meet Brewster at Clerkenwell-green—there were different districts assigned to the four positions—Mullins, I believe, proposed Ritchie to be the man to superintend and direct the four or six men for firing that I have spoken of before—that was carried—I think Mullins mentioned firing that evening, because there were some new delegates came in, that did not understand—they were to meet at the Orange Tree, at five o'clock the next evening—the number of firing-men amounted to forty-six altogether, and they were to meet Ritchie at the Orange Tree—a question was asked how they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184809180110"></xptr>
               <p>would know Ritchie without a pass-word, and some delegate proposed the words "Frost and Mitchell," as a pass-word—Allnutt proposed the word, "Justice" instead—that was carried; and when each man went and opened the door at the Orange Tree, Ritchie was to ask him, "Who do you want? what do you want?" and the answer was to be the word "Justice," and by that Ritchie would know them—I was asked among the others how many firing-men I could bring, and I said I had spoken to two, one of those was included in the number forty-six—Gurney said, "Oh, nonsense, you can find six or eight, I can find more."—I was rather struck with his taking me up so soon and I said, "I know best"—I knew I can only speak to these two men—I did not mention their names—the others were asked the same question—the delegates had put the colours in their pockets I suppose, there might have been colours given to those who came in subsequently, but I did not see any—I received one that night—I kept it till I gave it up to the party I was in communication with—I showed it to a person in authority about two hours after I left the Lord Denman—I remember attending a meeting on 20th July last, at the Black Last or Jack, I am not certain which, in sow street in Lincoln's-inn-square—I do not know the name of the street—it is a house that lies rather in the corner of some street—I can hardly describe it—I do not think I have been in the neighbourhood before or since—when I attended on the 20th, there were fourteen people present, Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, a delegate from Greenwich, myself, Battice, another confederate, Allnutt, and one or two strangers—I do not know the name of the delegate from Greenwich—his name was mentioned, but it has escaped my memory, it was his first time of attendance—the meeting commenced about nine o'clock in the evening, or it might be a little later—it lasted until twelve, or ten minutes past—it was in a longish room, with a very high ceiling ornamented at both ends with a sort of canopy—it had the appear-ance of a club-room—that was the first meeting of delegates I attended—I was asked for credentials, and produced the leaf of a book which Bezer had given me—when he gave it me he made a statement—I gave the leaf to Payne, who was chairman—he compared it with his book, and then said, "That will do "—there was no writing on it—it appeared to match with what was left in the book—at that meeting a Committee of five was ap<lb></lb>pointed, to draw up five plans of action; Fay, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, and Dowling—I attended a meeting on 23rd July at Dennis's coffee-house, Great St. Andrew-street, Seven Dials—Dowling, Brewster, Rose, and Mullins, were there, and Payne accompanied me there—there was on that day a meeting of the Committee before the meeting of the general body of delegates—some plans were produced—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the very identical plan that Mullins produced—Dowling said he thought he should not be able to under<lb></lb>take the management of the Seven Dials—the Seven Dials is shown in this plan—I afterwards saw Mullins put this plan into his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket—before that it was handed to three or four of them—I noticed there was something spoken about barricades—these lines where the crosses are were pointed out as barricades—Brewster said that to buss barricades you must build them halfway down the street—this was matter of conversation among us—there was no decision come to—a map of London was produced—they each had papers in their hands, but I did not see what they were—this is the one that was discussed and talked about—after the meeting of the Committee the delegates were admitted—there were ten per<lb></lb>sons present—Payne took the chair—he made a statement previous to the delegates coming in.—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>for the last eleven years—before that I was a bed-pillar carver—I have been connected with the turf, and been rather a sporting man, as a pedestrian—it was then I was called the <hi rend="italic">Welch Novice</hi>—I am a descendant of Welchmen—I ran a race; I did not lose it or win it—I did not get persons to back me—I went out for my own amusement to the place, and I was asked to run to amuse the party; it was merely for a <hi rend="italic">draw</hi> to a public-house—that was not the only sporting matter in which I have been concerned—it was announced in the paper by a party who I knew nothing of, that there was to be a cele<lb></lb>brated runner—I went there out of curiosity; it was only done to draw custom to the house—I professed then to be a bit of a runner, and I profess to be so now—I was not a celebrated runner—I was also at Wimbledon once for the same purpose—the other was at Hounslow—I have also run at Croydon, still as the <hi rend="italic">Welch Novice</hi>—that was merely for a day's amusement, and for which I was well remunerated—I believe those are all the sporting matters in which I have been engaged—I know what <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> means—I was never in that line; I swear that—I was never with a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> table at races; I have looked on at a table—I do not exactly know what a <hi rend="italic">decoy</hi> is—I have played at a table—I neither won nor lost—I was paid so much a day for playing at the table; it was not at a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig</hi> table, but a marquee-table, where they play with balls—I expected you would ask me about this, and I am willing to state everything, and all I know of the affair—that was the only time I was ever at such a place—I received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it was on account of my master that I went there—it was to stand at the table, take the money, and pretend to bet—I was young, and quite ignorant of the nature of these proceedings—it was just before I was out of my time; I was nearly twenty-one—I went more for a holiday—my master had a relation named Durdon, and my master's brother was in the habit of attending the races with Durdon, and my master said to me, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how would you like a holiday?"—I said, "Very well, master"—he said, "Well, I can get you one if you like to go, you must not let the old man know anything of it; if you like to go with Durdon to the races, you can, and you shall be paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your time, and your expenses," and with that I went with my master's brother, who was a door-keeper; and that was the only time in my life that I ever did anything of the sort—I knew that I was not in reality betting—I did not consider myself a cheat—of course I was pretending to bet, in order to deceive people—I do not deny that—I never swindled persons—I never had a farthing—I do not know who did—I do not know whether there was any money won or lost—I swear that—I do not think I was in there the whole three days—it was a three day's race—it was at Ascot races—I kept running in and out of the marquee to see the races more than to stop there, and there was a great disturbance with one of the parties about my going out—I was never at any other <hi rend="italic">rovlette-table</hi> than that—I never played at a <hi rend="italic">thimble-rig-</hi> table, and never associated with those sort of men—I know Richard Pennell—I never told him that I had walked a match against Townsend, the peder<lb></lb>trian, and <hi rend="italic">sold</hi> the parties who backed me, because I could get more money on the other side—I never walked for any money, I am certain of that, merely to draw custom to the house—I was once a witness at this Court, about eight years ago, in the case of a party for picking a gentleman's pocket.—I happened to see it—I never said to any one on that occasion, that I Was frightened about being asked about my <hi rend="italic">thimble-rigging</hi>—my father is dead—I have been in the employment of my brother-in-law, Mr. Smith—I have only been engaged a week for another party within the last eleven years—Smith keeps many men—I do not think those men knew that 1 was at all connected with this matter—I never persuaded a man to join it—they are quite capable</p>

I have a much right as that man," pointing to another individual; and there was great confusion at the time, and astonishment at his impudence, in wanting to she there, without being a member of the locality—he came into the secret meeting—anybody could come in, if they liked to have the impudence to come, through Cartwright's back place—he was a man that had impudence enough to come, and he was turned out by force; in fact, it was with some difficulty they got him down stairs—that was not in April—if you will lend me my book I will give you the date—I think I can refer to the very meeting (<hi rend="italic">referring to his book</hi>); it was on Sunday afternoon, 30th July—I swear 1 had no such conversation with him in April as you have referred to—I do not know George Thurston by name—there are many persons whose faces I know, but not their names—I do not know this, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>); I never saw it before, it is not my drawing—I do not know Westmoreland—I never gave such a thing as this to anybody, and never drew a thing like it—I have drawn plans, to ascertain what the plans were which I heard of among the different members of the locality—I heard that there was a secret meeting sitting, and that there was a plan they were going to operate upon, and I drew out a plan for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was plan of the kind—I believe that was about June or July—I drew a plan of one circle—I had heard that there were to be four or five mock meetings and sham demonstrations at Bishop Bonner's-fields; and, hearing of that, and also that there was to be an assassination of the police in the night, I was deter<lb></lb>mined to try and find out what this secret meeting was, and what plan it was they had got in operation—that was why I drew the plan—I showed it to person named Mayne, and tore it up by his direction—he said, "I would not have you get yourself into danger, you had better tear it up"—he is a person who is frequently at Cartwright's—it was not before the affair in Bishop Bonner's-fields that I showed it him; that was the only one, and that I showed to three or four at Cartwright's, on purpose to ascertain what was going on—I do not remember saying to anybody that I should want him, and that he must bring something with him—I had a pair of pistols—I did have them on 13th Aug.—I exchanged them for another pair in Holborn, or the Strand, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I forget when—(<hi rend="italic">George Thurslon was here called in</hi>)—I do not know that man by name, I know him by sight—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of asking him if he was a Chartist—I will not swear I did not—I do not think I ever offered to sell him a pair of pistols for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I will not <hi rend="italic">swear</hi> I did not—I swear I did not offer to do so on 13th Aug.—I do not believe I offered to do so some time in Aug.—I will not swear I did not—I swear not offer them to him after 13th Aug., because I think I had not had then for two months before that time—I did not offer that if he would buy the pistols, I would give him half-a-pound of powder into the bargain—I never offered him any powder, or any one; and never gave or offered any one any</p>

               <p>coffee-house, Saffron-hill—the last meeting I attended there was on the Sunday morning before the apprehension of the parties—there were not many delegates present—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Fuzzon, Allnutt, Ritchie, and others, were there; I did not see Johnson—I had received a letter from Mullins on the Saturday, calling the meeting—a resolution was moved by Jluliins that the meeting should be adjourned till the afternoon—a few of us had a consultation down stairs, and they invited us up to the locality meeting, which was held every Sunday morning—when I went in there was a motion on, whether the district of Clerkenwell should turn out for physical force or not—it was put to the vote and carried that they should turn out—mention was made that a person of the name of Meriman had made a report that two nen at the head of the movement were in the pay of the Government, and communicated to the police the whole of the proceedings—there was a long discussion upon it, and two delegates were appointed to wait on Meriman, to know the truth or falsehood of the statement; but I understood they could not get an interview with him—the meeting adjourned till three in the after<lb></lb>noon, and met at Breadon's beer-shop, in Shouldham-street—there were about thirty present—Cuffey was there, and was appointed secretary to the sub<lb></lb>committee at that meeting—there was a letter read from Lacey. I understood, from Manchester, stating that trade was very brisk there, and he was surprised that he had not received the order that he sent down, which we inferred meant the money that he had written for; trade was very good, and he expected a very large order—an order was wanted to be sent down by the Monday night, by the last train—the letter did not mention when he expected to be in town—a stranger, whose name I do not know, and—who I never saw before, stated that the Irish brigade in St. Giles's had provided themselves with a musket each, and so many rounds of cartridge, and were willing to assist in whatever resolu<lb></lb>tion the Chartists might come to—the meeting broke up between five and six—I remember going to attend a meeting at Perry's coffee-house, Shoreditch, and no meeting took place, because the police had seized some papers from Rose's at eight the same morning, (Friday); some persons there told me so, I do not know their names, one was Donnovan; a person who was there purposely appointed, told me so—they were playing at cards down stairs—I did not go up—I went away with Pedley, to Rose's house, to ascertain if it was true, I found it was so—the meeting that I attended before that was either at the Lord Denman or the Orange Tree—I think it was on the Tuesday or Wed<lb></lb>nesday before—Wednesday was the 9th—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, Cuffey, Nash, Rose, Pedley, Johnson, Donnovan, Fuzzon, and Allnutt, were there—something was said about M'Douall, but it was a private conversation—Rose is a carrier by trade, and was secretary to the sub-committee—Mullins was treasurer—they in general inquired whether anybody had brought any funds, and the delegates made reports of the state of their localities, and how many men they could depend on that would turn out to fight in case of an outbreak they did not do that at all the meetings, but at three or four of them—I think the number was mentioned as 1500 at one meeting, and above 2000 at another—they reckoned that the aggregate number mustered about 3000, and Mullins remarked that it was not those they depended on; they did not depend on the organised Chartists, but they reckoned there were about 30000 thieves and vagabonds about London who would co-operate with and assist them—on the Sunday morning before that, we met at Dennis's coffee-jouse, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials—Mullins, Payne, Brewster, ttose, and Thompson, were there—I know Lynch; I will not be certain whether</p>

               <p>he was there, and I will not ho certain whether Fay was there—there were not above nine—I do not believe Cuffey was there—it was proposed, I think at that meeting that each delegate should bring up 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to form a fund—I was present at a meeting when the committee resigned, and a fresh committee was appointed—I think that was on Monday evening, the 7th, at Dennis coffee-house—the committee consisted of Fay, Mullins, Bassett, Donnovan Payne, Brewster, Lynch, and Dowling; I do not think Cuffey was a member—there were three Irish on it beside Dowling; Lynch, Fay, and Donnovan—they resigned on account of the news coming from Ireland that the rebels had been defeated, and there was some remark about Smith O'Brien, bull forget it—the Irishmen had been added to the committee in order that the; Confederates should be fairly represented as well as the Chartists—a new committee of four was then formed, with ore prospective, who was to be president—his name was not mentioned, but it was understood from Mullies that it was Churchill, who was then in France—the four were Brewster Mullins, Payne, and I will not be certain about the other; but 1 think it Cuffey—I know Bassett, the president, was to take the command of the whole committee; and it was proposed, by a person named Warry, that a farthing should be paid by each person in each locality to support the president—at the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house, Dowling made a motion that the Confederate's and all the Chartist's localities should meet on Primrose—the Sunday; but when it came to the vote it was not carried: they hthougt it was premature—there was a meeting previous to this at the Dispatch coffee-house, I think, on the Wednesday—the Sunday meeting was at two in it afternoon—I think it was at the latter end of July—there was a meed; proposed to be held on Kennington-common on that same Sunday—we held a meeting that day at the Dispatch coffee-house, and had messengers from there to Kennington-common, to communicate any outbreak that might place—it was to be passed along on a bit of paper, written in pencil—persons were stationed every two hundred yards—it was supposed to be a meeting of Chartists; it was called by advertisement, by a person named Dwaine, of Cartwright's locality—the men were stationed between the common and the coffee-house; that had been agreed on before—I do not know who was employed to superintend them—Johnson was very busy over them-a meeting did take place at Kennington-common, but there was only a politic! sermon preached, I believe—there were reports that everything was quiet, except that two or three policemen in plain clothes were attempting to get up a disturbance—nothing further was done, that I am aware of—I forget at what place we met before that Sunday—I was taken so suddenly in coming forward to give evidence that I cannot recollect, for I did not think of comb; forward to give evidence in this ease up to ten this morning—I have only just come from Greenwich—I attended several other meetings before that—there was one meeting at Hopkinson's coffee-house, and I saw plans, and like weeks a map of London there—I think Payne had possession of them, and Hose, Mullins, Brewster, Thompson, and myself, were there together—I cannottd. when that was; it was before the meetings I have poken of; it was is forepart of the evening when the plans were produced—Johnson was there afterwards—those plans were just marked out, similar to a map on a piece oi paper—they were rather small—Mullins explained it, and pointed out thati. was to erect barricades from Clerkenwell down to Seven Dials, and from Seven Dials down Drury-lane to St. Mary's Church, in the Strand, by Somerset-house, and right along the Strand to Temple-bar; that would form</p>

               <p>Westminster-road—we found the class-leaders of the Lambeth district thera—a person named Pedley, a delegate belonging to the council of the Lambeth locality, was there—I was there that evening about two hours and a half—Pedley said there was a delegate coming from Manchester, and that they were up and doing in Manchester and the North of England—Pedley told us all to sit down, and he asked us all if we were prepared to fight—one man smiled, and said, "You don't mean it?" and Pedley said, "We do mean it;" and then he said, "Then we are ready to come out"—he told us to tell our men to come there the next night, at eight o'clock, with arms, and those who had not arms would be put in the way to get them—we were to meet at the Broadway, Westminster, where we should meet the Dean-street locality—we were to come to the Peacock first—he mentioned that the other loca<lb></lb>lities were to meet at the Seven-dials, Clerkenwell-green, and at the east end of the town—in pursuance of those directions, I went, about one o'clock, next day, and spoke to six of my men, I think—Conway, whowas taken at the Angel, was one, and Prowton another—I told them what Pedley had said—I went to the Peacock by myself, I believe, at eight o'clock, and met Morgan, Pedley, Con<lb></lb>way, Chester a class-leader, and Winspere, there—Pedley brought a paper, with some coloured ribbons in it, which he said the delegates were to wear, that tie men might know them; and another paper with some powder, with which he filled up some ball-cartridges—I had a pike—head, and I afterwards fetched my pistol—Pedley gave me a ball-cartridge to load the pistol—this is one of the ribbons (<hi rend="italic">the one produced</hi>)—in consequence of something that the landlady said, I went to the Angel, in Webber-street—I left Pedley behind, but he came afterwards—he left about three minutes before the police came—I had given information to the police between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—I saw Pedley load a pistol at the Angel for a man, whose name I forget—he did not take it away.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in consequence of your knowledge of Powell's character that you were asked to say what you knew of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw the statement which I made reduced to writing by the master shoemaker, and I put my name to it—I afterwards saw it in the <hi rend="italic">Northern star</hi>—that was a statement of all I knew of the character and conduct of Powell except about his being the murderer of his father, but I always thought it was robbery—the conversation about the Scriptures has occurred scores of times. not a day in the week but he would bring it up, but I only saw him burn a portion once—Carr was present once when he said Jesus Christ was a thief and has been there scores of times when he used such expressions—the person who came to me with the card was in Mr. Smith's employ, and a member of the Trades society—I saw by the papers that Powell was a witness—I can not mention half the shopmates that have heard him speak so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was the book kept that was torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was part of the New Testament—it was kept in his chest, in the shop—he was not much in the habit of reading the Scriptures—on rhis occasion lie merely took hold of a leaf and said, "See, here is a history of Christ," and so on—I only saw him do it once, but he broke out several portions on the same occasion but when he came to Judas, that betrayed Christ, he would not bum that—sometimes read the Testament of a Sunday, but generally read the newspaper</p>

               <p>on a working day—he took out several parts of one leaf, or it may be another leaf—I cannot say how many leaves he broke—he broke up a number of pieces but whether all out of one leaf I cannot say.</p>

I am a Chartist—I know Powell—I remember a meeting held on Sunday, 23rd April last, at Birdcage-iralk, Bonner's-fields—I saw Powell there—I was in conversation with two other gentlemen, I believe two weavers, and Powell came and asked me whether I was provided to obtain my rights—I asked what he meant—he asked whether I was possessed of arms—I told him I was not possessed of any except what I had on my body—Powell then said I had no right to speak a word about the Charter, unless I was possessed of arms, and deter<lb></lb>mined to maintain my rights—he asked me if I had got a pistol first, and then if I had a sword—I said I had not—he then asked where my residence was—I did not tell him—he said, "You are not worth a d----as a Chartist, unless you have got arms"—I told him if he said anything more to me about those sort of arms, I would get out of the society altogether—he then left me—I did not see him go among the crowd—I saw no more of him that day.</p>

Davis had a room a my house six or seven years ago, as near as I can recollect—about twelve months ago, he asked me to join a Chartist club—he showed me some guns which he said he had brought from London, and was going to take to the Druids' Arms—he had pistols at one time, and afterwards a gun—is said he was in the habit of going to London, and purchasing arms to supply the Chartists with—I said to him that no sensible man would talk in the way—he advised me to go to the Druids' Arms, where I should hear arguments to convince me—after the birth of Her Majesty's last child, Davis something disrespectful in reference to its birth—about six days before 16th Aug., the 11th as near as 1 can recollect, he said to me, "Now you will soon see what we can do; we shall soon all be ready "—he said he was a Chartist. and asked me to join them—I am not one—I refused, and ridiculed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons have you in your employ? A. Six besides the prisoner, but the others do not sell goods - they only make them up and get them ready, under his orders; our business is more particularly retail - we have a counter: the till is formed of the prisoner's desk - he puts the money into it; no one sells goods but the prisoner while he is there - when he is not, one of the men do, and give him an account; some trifling entries may possibly have been omitted, but that is provided for by his putting down sundries, if he has more money than is accounted for - on the day after the 25th of August, he appears by the book to have received 12s. 1d.; I am not aware he has ever forgotten something on one day and put it down the next - I should have told him to put the date against it, if he had mentioned it to me; people often buy things and pay for them without a receipt - it depends partly on him and partly on the persons who come, whether he gives a receipt or not - he has a family, and his wife has lately been confined.</p>

               <p>Re-examined. Q. How soon after did you attend at the Police-office? A. About a fortnight; they were both paid within a month of that time.</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Sarah Ellis. On 2nd Feb., at seven o'clock in the evening, I put eight trusses of hay of hers in a shed in the market, at Marylebone—next morning one was gone—I have compared the truss produced with the other seven, and believe it is the same as the others.</p>

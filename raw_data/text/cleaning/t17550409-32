            . I had occasion to land at Black-friars on Monday the 17th of March about eight at night, there lay a wherry and some sacks in it marked Truss; I knowing the sacks to be Mr. Truss's property, I suspected them to have been stolen; I made it my business to inquire who owned the boat, no body would own it; I found the sacks had malt in them, as full as commonly sacks are. I went to Queenhithe and found Mr. Truss, and had ordered the boat to be brought there, he came down with a lanthorn and looked at the sacks and owned them, but said he did not know any thing of the malt; I found the owner of the boat when I had got her to Queenhithe, the person that lets the boat out, told me the man who hired the boat of him, was standing amongst the other watermen at Black-friars, when I inquired whose boat it was, when none of them would own the boat, the malt was put into a warehouse till farther inquiry could be made. In a day or two after we found the man that worked the boat, who declared the prisoner at the bar was one of the men that hired him to take the malt out of Mr. Truss's barge to carry it to black-friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when you landed at Black-friars?</p>

               <p>Sherret.

               <p>Truss. No, he did not, but he came up with another; I had two barges up.</p>
               <p>Q. How much malt was in that barge?</p>
               <p>Truss. Between five and six hundred quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any malt missing of that in the barge?</p>

            . I am a turner - I came up from Guildhall-yard; there was a crowd at the end of King-street; I saw the prisoner and two others with him pushing very hard, which induced me to watch - I told one of them he had better be off, and I directly saw a blue handkerchief pass from Peckitt's coat, and put into the prisoner's pocket. I told Peckitt, and took it from his pocket. A young man took one of the others, but he was discharged. The prisoner said somebody else must have put it into his pocket; he was nearest to Peckitt - I am certain one of the two took it.</p>

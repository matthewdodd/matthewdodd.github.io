About twelve o'clock, I believe; Mr. Rye paid eleven shillings and sixpence for them; the prisoner told me that was the price, and asked me whether I had brought the 11 s. 6 d. with me; I told him no.

            , he prisoner, receive a five shilling piece, two or three shillings, and some odd halfpence, of Mr. Rye; he had a quartern of shrub and a glass of peppermint, and left sixpence for Matthews. The prisoner asked me if I would go to the top of the street with him. I was going out for oil for Mr. Gill's lamps; I went with him; I heard Mr. Rye say, this is the money for the bottles; I saw Matthews fetch the bottles away in a basket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BARTLETT. I lived in the family for six months; I live with Mr. Noble now; the prisoner had all the plate in his care; he went away on Thursday night the 20th of February; we missed these articles after he was gone; one dozen and eleven forks, two dozen table spoons, two large gravy spoons, two salts, and one sauce spoon; and none of them had been seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner. - A. Yes; some time before he went, he said there was a method of disposing of plate that had a crest upon it; he said there was a shop in the city; whoever made off with plate, there was a hole you put it down, and it was melted off; and when the plate was weighed you go in and receive the money. We missed the plate about three hours after he was gone; he went out on Thursday night, and came on Friday morning, and stopped till between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You never told any body of this conversation between the prisoner and you till after he was taken up. - A. No, I never mentioned it till Mrs. Noble asked me if I had heard him mention any thing of disposing of things at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. He came again on the Friday morning. - A. Yes, on the morning he asked me to go into the pantry with him, to see that he took nothing but his own.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know then but that he was going away. - A. I did not know but what he was coming back again, as he had not received his wages. He took a pair of gloves out of the pantry, and his razors; he locked the cupboard-door and the door of the pantry, and left both the keys on the dressers of the kitchen; then he went out.</p>
               <p>MARTHA GREAVES. I brought the keys down from Mrs. Noble's dressing-room, to give them to Carey. I carried them up to my mistress the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you usually done so. - A. No, I have never done so before; I locked up the cupboard-door that night; I did not see whether there was any plate there. I saw a few dirty forks there the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had he been paid his wages at the time that he eloped from your service. - No; he ran off to Bath, where he was apprehended about ten days after he eloped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any plate in the cupboard in which the dirty plate was not kept. - A. He had a separate cupboard and a trunk with lock and key to keep the clean plate in, not in the pantry. It was in a cupboard in my dressing-room; he had always the key of that in his possession; he left that key behind him. In the morning when I got up, I made a search after the plate; I had an inventory of the plate that I gave to him when I hired him.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen any of that plate which you found upon examination missing - A. About two months before they were in the house; I had a good deal of company; I found no defalcation then; about two months before I think the plate was all in the house; there was missing one dozen and eleven silver forks, worth twenty pounds at least, two dozen silver table spoons, two large gravy spoons, two sauce spoons, and two salts; I value them at thirty-one pounds; all was gone from that cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the removal of any part of this place from the house of Mr. Gill - A. No; I thought it was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know till the next morning that he had been out that night - A. The maid told me that night that he was then out; I believe it was about eleven o'clock; I intended to discharge him; he had been so beastly drunk that night. I expected him to return the next morning to receive his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martha Greaves. Did your mistress discharge him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she threaten to discharge him - A. Yes. On the Thursday night Mrs Noble bid him go to bed: he said he would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds, to prosecutor. I think you say about two months ago you had this party, you saw all this plate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was all there you do not know - A. I saw salts and spoons sufficient for fourteen people.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one separate article of these silver things that is worth more than forty shillings - A. No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he had been so of a mind he might take these things one at a time - A. He might; I cannot say he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Mr. Gill's house had you - A. The first floor, a drawing room, and a dressing room, and in the dressing room there was a closet, in which closet there was a chest that kept this place; this man had always the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gill and his wife keeps a fancy dress maker's shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and Mrs. Noble went out you did not lock the door did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an opportunity if persons went to Mrs. Gill they might go up stairs - A. It was not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the rest of the servants know that the plate was kept there - A. They might; both the women witnesses say they did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you looked at the lock did it appear to have been forced - A. No, not at all forced; it was locked and opened as usual. All the plate was not gone; a silver tea-pot was left, and a silver coffee-pot, and a plated tea-urn, and there were some spoons left; he had three dozen forks, he took one dozen and eleven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of the plate that I am accused of. At half past eleven o'clock, when I took up Mr. Noble's supper I found Mrs. Noble in the pantry, she said, you wretch, I shall take the key away, you have broke all my china. The bottles that I am accused of, they did not belong to Mr. Noble, the bottles belonged to me and Mr. Gill's lodgers. I have lived there two years and a half, there were several bottles sent me while I was there, and a few of the bottles, some families that were there, they left them, and my friends sent me a bottle of rum and a bottle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110008"></xptr>blacking.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you miss any bottles - A. I did; bottles and wine, and they were particular bottles; I had some port wine from Ireland; they are smaller than English bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guineas were due to the prisoner - A. I suppose between five and six guineas.</p>

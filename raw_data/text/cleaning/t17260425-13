             thus depos'd, I am a Beadle, I was along with some Constables. At the Feathers Tavern in Drury-lane, we heard a Man and some Women of the Town in the next Room, and thereupon we went in, and found the Prisoner with a Couple of Whores. He was very much in Drink, and we found a great deal of Money, Spoons and Snuff-boxes about him. We carry'd him out to the Bear-Inn, and desired the Keeper of the Tap-house, to take care of him till he was sober, and not let the Whores come near him, for fear they should plunder him; but he would not take any Charge of him, till we had taken an Account of what Money, and other Things the Prisoner had about him, which we did, and left him there.</p>
               <p>The Keeper of the Tap thus deposed. The Morning after the Prisoner was left to my Care, he pretended that he was come away from his Father, without his Consent, and said, that he would stay still the Evening, and then go and lye at the Bell-Savage-Inn on Ludgate-hill, that he might be ready to go out with the Coach in the Morning, for he intended to go to a Relation of his in the Country; but in the mean Time, his Master the Prosecutor found him out, and I delivered to him the two Broad-pieces, the Gold Rings, and other Things that I had in Charge.</p>

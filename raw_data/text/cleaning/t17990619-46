             sworn. - I am a surveyor, and live in Long-lane: On Wednesday about a quarter before one o'clock, as I came down Holhorn-hill, I saw three men, whom I remembered, one of which was Barnett; I have known him for five years, and the other I remembered, as I had seen them about Smithfield; Kemp, and another not taken, was on one side, and the other close behind; he went a little way out of the path, and Barnett came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them accost Webber? - A. They appeared to be talking to him; he was not quite at the bottom of Holborn-hill so far as the Market, he was going towards Smithfield, just by the post; his left-hand pocket was a little bit open, and I saw Barnett's hand go into it; I saw the motion of his hand come out of it, I could not see what he took out, but he put it into his pocket, and it laid star, like a book; before he put his hand into his pocket, he touched a bundle which Webber had under his arm, and he put up his hand to adjust it, and at that instant I saw Barnett's hand go into his pocket; Immediately Barnett went away, and coughed; one of them followed, and coughed also; the third turned round and looked, giving a cough, he walked on two or three doors further, and then he left them; two of them went down Fleet-market, the third I did not see go; Barnett put his hand in the pocket, but it was either Kemp or the other that had the conversation; I went immediately to Webber, and asked him if he had lost any thing; I told him he had been robbed, and I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190046"></xptr>with him to Hatton-garden, and described the persons; I was out of town on Thursday, but I found them in custody on Friday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. (Counsel for Kemp.) Q. It was Barnett's hand in the pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was the other prisoner, or a person near the place, that coughed you don't know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was about one o'clock? - A. A quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Q. That part is narrow, is it not? - A. Yes; and not free of passengers.</p>
               <p>Q.Would it not be as well to take hold of the collar when a person fees a robbery? - A. I was not near enough.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you off? - A. About seven yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Any persons between you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Possibly the hand that was put into the pocket might be some other persons; his back was towards you? - A. Yes; I know him as well as I know my child, but I never had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you did not collar him? - A. No; I went to the man, and asked him if he had lost any thing; I only saw the hand go into the pocket, and take it out, and put something into the side-pocket, button his coat, and walk away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I had purchased 25 quarter casks of butter, part of which I had away—on the 11th of November I sent Peacock to Brewer's Quay for 15 quarter casks, with a horse and cart—it was Mecklenburg Keil butter, which is a butter of a peculiar flavour—I saw my horse and cart again next day at a livery stable, in the neighbourhood of Sun Tavern-fields—on the 17th of November I went to Coxson's shop in Rosemary-lane, and saw some butter in a Sligo keg and a Leer firkin, of exactly the same quality as I lost—I tasted it—Mecklenburg butter is more expensive than Sligo, and would not be put in a Sligo cask—it appeared as if it had been very hastily packed.</p>

On the 11th of November Mr. Webb sent me to Brewer's Quay, with a horse and cart, to fetch some butter, about two o'clock or a little after—I drove it to Billingsgate, when a man came up to me, and in consequence of what he said I returned to Brewers Quay—when I came back, the horse and cart, which I had left at Billings<lb></lb>gate,</p>

                  </hi>. On the 11th of November I lived in the house of stebbings, in Cable-street, leading out of Rosemary-lane—about half-past four o'clock that afternoon, the prisoner came there along with Collins, (who was convicted last sessions)—I have known the prisoner for eight years—he said, "I understand you have a horse and cart to let"—Stebbings said, "The cart is out"—the prisoner said, "Do you know where I can get one?"—Stebbings said, "Two or three doors off"—the prisoner and Collins then went away—they came back in about three minutes, and said they could not get one—Stebbings said, "My partnet's van is in the stable, if that will do you can have it"—they said that would do, and Stebbings went away with them—he was away about a quarter of an hour—about two hours and a half after, I saw Potter's van and Steb<lb></lb>bings's horse going up Rosemary-lane—the van seemed full of butter firkins—the prisoner and Collins were with it—I was going out at the time—it stopped at the corner of Cartwright-street, by Coxson's door—I saw the prisoner come to the van, take one cask out, and take it into Coxson's—Collins was standing by the hone's head, on the pavement—the prisoner then came and took another in, and was coming to the van again for more, when Coxson stopped him, and said, "I won't have any more, as you have brought the van to the door, or else I would have had four."</p>

                  </hi>. On the 11th of November I lived in Harrod's-alley, Wellclose-square. On the afternoon of that day I was waiting for my master, Mr. Potter, who keeps a van, and saw Stebbings, Collins, and the prisoner come up the horse-ride together—Stebbings wrenched the padlock off the stable-door, where his own hone and master's were kept, and said to me, "Now I want the cart, I suppose I cannot have it"—he said to the prisoner and Collins, "Will a van do?" they answered "Yes"—with that, Stebbings opened the gate where the van was kept, and drew it out—I held up the shafts—he harnessed the horse in a great hurry, and</p>

               <p>put the breeching on wrong—Collins jumped up into the van, and laid hold of the reins—I said to Stebbings, "There is no whip at home, master has it out; here is only this old piece of stick"—he said, "Let us have it"—he handed it to Collins, up in the van, and Collins drove off—the prisoner and Stebbings walked on the pavement, facing the van, keeping up to it—this was about half-past three o'clock.</p>

On the evening of that day, I saw a horse and cart drive through the gate about six o'clock I believe; it was getting dusk, but I did not look at any clock—I have since seen the hone and cart at the Thames police, it was Mr. Webb's—when it passed through the gate, the bottom of it was full of tubs, and three were on the top of the copse—the prisoner and Collins were with it—the prisoner staid behind and paid me the toll—he stood with me four or five minutes—we had a few words together concerning the toll—it is a new gate put up—he said, "I have paid toll here many a day, but never paid at this gate"—the cart was going to wards Sun Tavern-fields.</p>

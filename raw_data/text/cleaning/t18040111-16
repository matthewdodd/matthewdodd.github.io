             sworn. - I am a Marshalman: I went with a search-warrant with Mr. Smith to No. 8, Silk-street, Grub-street, where the prisoner lodged; the prisoner was not at home; Mr. Smith, went into his room, and in a box in that room, which the landlord said was the prisoner's, I found these tools, (producing them.) I then went to Old-street-square, where the prisoner worked; I went into the work-shop where he was at work, and informed him I wanted him to come to see his master that he had just left; he asked me what it was about; I told him his master was below, and would inform him; when we came out of the house, Mr. Smith was in the square, and he said let me go and speak to my master; I told him it was a charge of felony, and he must go before the Magistrate; he placed his back against the wall, and swore he would not, and forced himself from us, but we caught him again.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 8, Silk-street, Cripplegate; the prisoner lodged in my house, he slept with another young man, he had part of a bed; I shewed the officer the room and the box belonging to the prisoner; it was my box, which my wife lent him; the other young man was a shopman in the jewellery line; I had known him some years, he had lodged with me near a twelve-month, and a very respectable character he is; the prisoner had lodged with me five weeks, he kept very regular hours, but I can swear to his bringing this hammer into my house.</p>
               <p>Smith. This is my hammer, and the other articles are mine.</p>
               <p>Jones. I never saw any thing but what was very honest in him.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Smith was very badly off for tools, and I took my own tools, and his apprentices worked with them as well as myself; Mr. Smith and I had a dispute about the sort of work he gave me to do, and I left him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house painter. Last Monday morning, about three o'clock, I was somewhere about Marylebone-lane, but I do not know the street—I was coming home from seeing some friends, and was not the worse for liquor—I called in at a public-house to have a glass of</p>

I took the prisoner—the prosecutor accused her of stealing some money—after we had gone a few steps, he said he had been robbed of a half-sovereign and some silver—the prisoner said nearly a dozen times that she had not got any gold about her, but she had got a quantity of silver, which had been given her during the night—when I got to the station-house I said she must be searched, and she said she would give me up all the money she had—she pulled from her bosom two half-crowns, a half-sovereign, five shillings, and one sixpence.</p>

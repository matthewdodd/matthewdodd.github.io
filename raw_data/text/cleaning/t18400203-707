                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 2nd of Febru<lb></lb>ary, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Broad-street, St. Giles's, with a bundle—I said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Only some things which my father gave me last night"—I said, "What does it consist of?"—he said "Lead"—he threw it down, and tried to get away—I took him into custody, took him to the station-house, and found this knife in his pocket—it appears to have been used to cut lead—Etheridge took up the lead—I made inquiry, and found it came from the roof of Grout's lodging-house, at the corner of Lawrence-lane, Church-street, St. Giles's—the whole of the roof had been stripped—Etheridge compared the lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in company with Restieaux when he took the prisoner—I afterwards went with Grout and fitted the lead to the roof of the house, and it tallied in all respects—the prisoner's clothes and shoes were all covered with white from the brick-work.</p>

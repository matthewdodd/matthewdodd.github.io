               <p>I found this marble on Saturday the 7th of September, on the premises of the last witness; some in the kitchen and some in the yard; I had the prisoner in custody before that time; when this gentleman (Mr. Charlton) came, and said there is some of my property at such and such a place, and I went and found it and he owned it.</p>

               <p>The biggest piece I cut from the block, and after I had cut this slab off I carried it and put it up in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What is the length of it? - A. I believe near two feet eleven inches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the Justice, that it was eight feet four.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you able to swear that that is the same you had in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any other piece you know? - A. Yes; this long narrow piece; I know it by seeing it stand in the shop alongside of this polished just as it is, and I know it by its being cut crooked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the Justice he said, he sawed it off the block four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Charlton.) When was your shop broke open? - A. On a Saturday; I lost an amazing quantity of statuary; this is nothing at all to what I lost; this piece that is not cut strait I am very sure is mine, and the other I know to be mine; I know the others perfectly well; it is damaged stuff, cracked at the back; I put them together upon very bad lining, which is full of holes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That piece that Mr. Charlton says he lined with his own hand, I did with my own hand; those other pieces were my father's.(The prisoner called Polesham, who gave him a very good character.)</p>

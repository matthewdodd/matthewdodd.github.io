About twelve o'clock, on the 13th of March, I was in my pig-sty, and saw the prisoner come up the lane, with something under his round frock—he came and tried my gate—he did not see me—I was just going to tell him the gate was locked, and to go round, but before I could speak, this bag was thrown over the gate into my yard, and he walked back—I got out of the pig-sty, and went to the bag—I put my hand in it and felt the feathers—I opened the bag and found this fowl—I put it in the bag again, and took it in doors—in about five minutes the prisoner came and looked over the gate after the bag—he then looked over the pig-sty, then came and knocked at my door, and asked me if I had picked any thing up, I said, I had—he said, "Give it to me"—I said, "I shall not, many</p>

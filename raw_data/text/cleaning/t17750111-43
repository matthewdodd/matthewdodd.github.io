I was at work at Mr. Birkley's on the 20th of December, I saw the prisoner make towards the dresser, and then go out pretty sharp, I thought I saw him put something under his coat, we pursued him to the Crown at Mim's Wash, we found him standing at the fire, we charged him with taking the shirt and handkerchief, he confessed taking them, we found the shirt under his coat, we were informed at another public house, that he had sold the handkerchief for three-pence.</p>

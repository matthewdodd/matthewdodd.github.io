                  </hi> I am warehouseman to Mr. Edmund Ronalds, of 109, Upper Thames-street. On the 19th of Aug. there was a quantity of bacon at the warehouse, placed next a window leading to Old Swan-pier—the police<lb></lb>man gave information, and I missed some—I have seen this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and have no doubt of its being my master's—it is of the same shilling—there is no mark on it—there was room to take it out between the bars of the window.</p>

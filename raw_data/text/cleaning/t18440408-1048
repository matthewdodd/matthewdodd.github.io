"On the 28th of Feb., from in<lb></lb>formation I received, I went to a house in Green-court, Brick-lane, St. Luke's, with Hull, Redman, and Cole—I entered at the front door, went up stair to the door of the first floor room, found the door fast, and proceeded to force it open—I succeeded in forcing the upper part open sufficiently to be able to we into the room, and saw the prisoners there—Edmeads was sitting with his face towards me, and Burton was sitting sideways, Edmeads holding some<lb></lb>thing white in his hand, and Burton holding a large spoon close to that white</p>

               <p>substance in Edmeads's hand, with a pail between them—directly the door was broken open they saw me, and both put their hands out as if flinging something into the nice clear fire which was burning—I did not see any thing pass from their hands—I then noticed Edmeads put something white into his mouth—it was the same white thing as I had seen in his hand—Burton went towards a cupboard in the room, then came to the door, and put his shoulder against the door and resisted us very much as we were still trying to force the other part of the door—at last, with the assistance of the officers, I forced the door open, seized Edmeads by the throat, and four pieces of plaster of Paris came from his mouth—I looked at the pail, and noticed some melted white metal in it—Edmeads resisted very much—there was some plaster in the pail besides and water—I went to the cupboard I had seen Burton go to, and found two moulds, which I produce—when I first entered the room I asked Edmeads what he meant by this—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said to Burton, "What game do you call this?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—we took them into custody, and took possession of the things I now produce.</p>

                  </hi>, I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. This is a plaster of Paris mould, intended to cast half-crowns—it bears the impression of both sides of a William IV. half-crown—it appears to have been used very much—here is another plaster of Paris mould for shillings of George III., 1816, which appears to have been very much used, and has both sides of the impression—here are three counterfeit half-crowns, all of which have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—two of them are finished, and one unfinished, as it comes from the mould—here are portions of two broken white metal spoons, of similar metal to the half-crowns—here is some more metal, which has been recently fused, and here are portions of counterfeit half-crowns, attached to it, as if thrown into the fused metal while hot—all these half-crowns have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—scissors are generally used to separate the get from coin—this file has white metal in the teeth—it is generally used to remove any surplus metal—this iron spoon has been used to lade the metal from the pipkin—it has metal in it now—the pipkin contains similar metal—I do not know anything of this box of composition—here is some plaster of Paris, the material of which the moulds are composed—these four pieces of white produced by Brannan, as coming from Edmeads' mouth are plaster of Paris in a solid state, but have no impression on them—a pail of water could be used to immerse the moulds into immediately, in cast of alarm, to destroy the impression, which would be done in a very short time—here is part of a mould, for fourpenny-pieces, but the impression is nearly obliterated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It is necessary the metal should be in a fused state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they must be near enough to reach the fire to make the half-crowns—this mould is made from a good half-crown—nothing more than the articles produced is requisite to make the coin.</p>

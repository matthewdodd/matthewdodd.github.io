             sworn. - I live at No. 9, Thomas-street, Whitechapel: On Saturday, the 24th of September, about a quarter before seven, I went out, as I returned, about ten minutes after seven, I saw the prisoner Palmer standing at No. 1, and another man standing opposite; I cast my eye up to the window over the door, and saw a light in the room, which appeared to me to come light and dark; sometimes I saw it, and sometimes I did not; I went to my own door, and then walked back again, and saw the men had changed their position; Palmer was on the opposite side of the way, and Bentley was on Barrett's, not many yards from his house; I saw Mr. Harrison at the Grasshopper door, and told him my suspicions; we went back to the house, and when we came there, Bentley was standing at No. 3, and Palmer right opposite Barrett's window; Harrison knocked at Barrett's door, and Bentley came past me and stood against the garden wall of the public-house; Harrison knocked a second time, and then a man jumped out of Barrett's window which I saw open; I was about four or five yards behind Harrison, and just saw the face of the person as he rose up and run away, and have not the least doubt that Kennedy is the man; it was between light and dark; I just saw his face, and knew him again directly, and pointed him out two days after in custody; as he jumped out, he fell on all fours; Mr. Harrison laid hold of him, but Palmer and Bentley rescued him, and they all ran away together; I ran after them, and secured Palmer, the others run away; I can also swear to Bentley.</p>
               <p>- HARRISON sworn. - On the 24th of September I was standing at the public-house door, at about a quarter past seven o'clock; Mitchell and I went up the street to Barrett's house, and I saw Palmer standing opposite to Barrett's, and Bentley at No. 3; I knocked twice at Barrett's door, and a man jumped out at the window; in jumping out, he cried, Halloa! halloa! what is the matter? I said I would let him know, and made a snatch at him, and instantly got him on the ground; Palmer and Bentley then came up, and rescued him from me; I halloaed out stop thief, and they repeated it; Mitchell caught hold of Palmer, and I proceeded after the others, but could not take them; I cannot say who the man was that jumped out, because, as he lay upon the ground, and I had hold of him, they rushed in; I can swear Bentley was the man that was standing there, and helped to rescue the other.

               <p>Kennedy's defence. I know nothing of it; I was going to bed, and was half undressed when I was taken.</p>

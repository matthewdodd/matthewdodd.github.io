                  </hi>. I am shopman to Henry Squire and Eliza<lb></lb>beth Oldham, grocers and tallow-chandlers, in Thomas-street, Hackney-road. I locked up the house on Christmas evening, the 25th of December—I took the key with me—I left every thing safe about six o'clock—it is the sleeping-house of Mr. Henry Squires and his partner, and in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—I gave the key of the shop to Ewins, to go and do his horses—I afterwards went to the house, and saw my master pick up some coppers in a handkerchief from behind the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">PHILIP EWINS</hi>. I got the key from Dubois, and went to the house in Thomas-street—I got there about half-past seven o'clock—I pat the key in the door, turned the lock, and pushed the door very hard to get it open—I heard a man's footsteps, and heard him go on the stairs—I put my hand on his arm, and drew back, put the door to, and went into the street for assistance—the man pushed the door to, and bolted the bot<lb></lb>tom bolt—I stood about a minute, and heard a man in the next yard but one—I ran to the yard, saw the prisoner, collared him, and held him</p>

               <p>till the policeman came—as he was going to the station, J saw him put his hand to his pocket, but I did not see what he took from it—after he got to the station, we took a dark lantern, three sovereigns, and some matches from him—we returned to Thomas's-street, and my master was then knocking at the door—I had to push the bottom bolt off to get in—the back-door of the house was opened, which would lead the prisoner to the place where he was found.</p>

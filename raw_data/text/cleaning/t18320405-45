I took forty, which I had marked, out of my pocket, and laid them before him; he said there were none which would suit him - I watched him, but did not see him take any; I counted them, and missed three of them - he went into my tap-room; I counted my sixpences, and missed twenty-two - he called for some ale and rum, and gave me one of my marked sixpences in payment; he then came out, as if to go, but said he must have another drop of rum, which he did, and he gave me another of my sixpences - the officer, whom I had sent for, then came in; I gave charge of the prisoner: he denied having any silver of mine on him - he was taken to the station, and my three shillings and twenty sixpences were found on him; two of the sixpences he had paid to me.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was sent for, and took the prisoner to the station; he denied having any money of the prosecutor's - when he was at the station he said that what money he had about him was what he had received of the prosecutor on the Wednesday before - he took the silver out of his right-hand breeches pocket, and he had no more silver there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What else did you find on him? A. Two buttons, which are what he calls his trade, as a button-maker - another officer afterwards found a sovereign on him.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. This is my money; I know it by the marks on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner take out his purse at the tap that morning? A. No, not that I saw -I watched him closely, but did not see him take any thing; I put sixty sixpences before him; I said I had more silver up stairs, because he asked me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We looked over the silver together, and I would have given him the sovereign if he had given me the rest of the silver for it - I have changed many a sovereign with him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. He never changed but one in his life - he looked over this silver, I did not; he used frequently to take home a pint of rum in a bottle with him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 24th of October, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, I was going home, and saw the prosecutor with the prisoner in Lower Seymour-street - he was rather tipsy, and I suspected she would rob him - they were arm-in-arm; I followed them as far as Baker-street chapel; I then saw him turn round, and get from her; he crossed over to my side of the way, passed me, and turned up George-street; a young man then went up and spoke to the prisoner, and they then both ran after the prosecutor; the prisoner overtook him, and took his arm till he got to the corner of <placeName id="t18271025-49-crimeloc313">Charles-street</placeName>

I brought her into King-street, and met the prosecutor, who asked her for his watch; she denied it, and in the middle of the road in the mews, on the very spot where I apprehended her, I found the watch.</p>

The prisoner came up, and asked me to take a walk with her - I said I wished to have nothing to do with her, and told her to let go of my arm; I got from her opposite the chapel; she overtook me again at the corner of Charles-street, and laid hold of me all in a moment, round the waist, and snatched my watch; I did not miss it till Kilbey came, and asked if I had lost it; he went to King-street-mews, and found it; I had not been in the mews that night at all - I was intoxicated.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an optician. On the 12th of June, I met the prisoner in Holborn—she got into conversation with me, and asked me to give her something to drink, as she was very dry—I treated her with two pints of half-and-half—when we left the public-house we went up Hatton-garden, and turned round Bleeding Heart-yard—in bidding her good night I put my hand into my fob, and missed my watch—I said, she deserved to be charged with the police, and if there was one near I would do so—she began to give me very abusive language, which caused a police<lb></lb>man to come forward, and I gave her in charge—I took the watch out of her right hand—nothing improper had passed between us.</p>

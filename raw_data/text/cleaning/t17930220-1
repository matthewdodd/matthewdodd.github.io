When I went out I left my wife and my family, two children at home, my wife is here. I went out at one o'clock as usual, I had not been home between one and seven. I can swear to the articles, to the spoons by the initials of my name; I know the tea tongs by the cyphers of the same, the table spoon the same as the tea tongs; I leave speaking of the rest to my wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him whether the place was broke open or not, as I am indicted for a burglary.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is your landlord? - I rent the house of Mr. Copeland, in St. Martin's-lane, a carpenter; I let all the rest of the house out furnished or unfurnished, except those two apartments; I pay the rent of the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the house broke open; did there appear to be any violence about the house? - There was no other violence than about the flap of the bureau, that had been attempted to be broke; the linen and cloak was taken out of the drawer underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to any part of your house? - There did not seem to be any violence as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you apprehend they got in? - At the door, I imagine.</p>
               <p>- MOSCRIP sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I was not at home when my property was taken; the last time I went out was about two o'clock, I have two children, a girl and a boy, and I took them both out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200004"></xptr>with me; I left nobody in my apartments when I went out; I left the outer door on the latch, because there was lodgers in the house; my husband first discovered the house had been robbed; I was sent for and came home after the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How are your rooms situated? - The one goes into the other from the kitchen into the parlour; when you come to the street door, there is a passage and the two rooms lay on the left hand, one behind the other; the parlour is nearest the street door, you pass by the parlour and come to the kitchen door; when I went out at two o'clock I locked the kitchen room door, but left the parlour door open, I gave the key of the kitchen to a lodger, all this property was taken from the parlour; there was no violence done to the parlour at all; the door was left open, there is no entrance into the parlour but through the kitchen; I missed all the articles in the indictment; the shirts and cloak were in the top drawer, the plate was in a cupboard in the parlour; that cupboard was left open, there is no communication from the parlour to the passage, I knew they could not come into the parlour but by breaking into the kitchen, I can swear all the things to be mine; I know the shirts to be my husbands, by the marks made by myself, and I examined and I found so many were missing; I had had the cloak eight or nine years, I particularly know it by the lace, it is a broad lace and a thing that I commonly wore in turn; the tea spoons I might sell for 6 s. the tea tongs for 7 s. the silver table spoons for 10 s. the five shirts for 12 s. and the cloak for 14 s. I saw the whole of the plate taken from the prisoner by the officer Cook, the same as my husband spoke to, I have kept the linen and the cloak from that time to this, the officer has the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think I heard her say she saw the property taken from me. - I did, I saw the plate taken from him.</p>
               <p>EVANS LOGGARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a lodger with Mr. Moscrip, that day I went home from my work about half after five from Craven-street, in the Strand, where I have worked eleven months; going home I went up two pair of stairs to get the key of one of Mr. Moscrip's lodgers, I gets the key and went down, and set by the fire about an hour, in this kitchen that leads into the parlour where the things were taken from, I used to use the kitchen; leaving the kitchen I cannot be sure whether I left the door on the latch or open, I went up to my lodging room, I know I did not lock the door, I went to put a lock on to a tea caddy in my own room, whilst I was up stairs I heard the landlord call for assistance, and I ran down to his assistance; going down to the kitchen I saw the landlord had hold of the prisoner, the prisoner was at that time in the kitchen near the parlour door, I saw the plate taken from him, I did not see the bundle in his hand; the prisoner had dropped the linen and the cloak at the door, I did not see him drop it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are your sure that you latched the door? - I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure the latch was down of the outer door? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You was the last person that came in before the prisoner was found, how was the street door? - I cannot be positive whether I shut it or left it open.</p>

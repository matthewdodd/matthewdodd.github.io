A fire broke out in the house a little after eight o'clock - I was out at the time, and only know that these things were on the second floor at the time. On the Saturday following I found the prisoner in custody at Marlborough-street with them.</p>

            . I am a beadle of St. Giles's. A watchman brought the prisoner to the watch-house in Smart's Buildings, on the night of the fire, about eleven o'clock, with a bundle containing a waistcoat and four books; I asked what he had there - he said it was his own; before it was untied, I asked what was in it - he then said somebody gave it him in Holborn. I took him to Marlborough-street. The prosecutor claimed them, I found other things in the bundle, which were lost at the fire; he could not tell what was in it; he had a coat on his back which he said was given him at the same time - but he could not tell who by.</p>

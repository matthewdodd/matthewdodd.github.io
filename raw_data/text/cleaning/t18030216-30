               <p>Q. That was at the Seven Stairs? - A. Yes; he shewed me some white linen cloth, which he said was cambric; he said it was worth 18s. a yard; he would sell it for any thing; he was distressed for money; I bought two pieces of him, five yards each, at 4s. 6d. a yard, which amounted to 45s. he shewed me some waistcoat pieces afterwards; he wanted 12s. 6d. a piece; I bought five at 10s. each, which was 50s. I gave him two two-pound notes and a one-pound, and a seven-shilling piece; he said the things were worth four times the money; if I was dissatisfied, I might come the next day, and he would take the things back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160023"></xptr>again; I I went and left him, and carried the things to a public-house I use in Catherine-street, when I came there, I found the things were not worth thirty shillings:</p>
               <p>Q.Was the room so dark you could not see the quality of the things? - A. Yes; I found I had miscounted, the goods came to four pounds sixteen shillings, I gave him five pounds and a seven-shilling-piece; the next day, I went up Cheapside, and bought twenty yards of lace, at six shillings a yard, and twenty-two yards, at five and sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any lace with you when you were with the prisoner the day before? - A. Yes, he looked at it, it was in a handkerchief, not this lace; I bought six pair of silk stockings, ten shillings a pair, in the same shop, four pair of white, and four pair of black; as I was going home, I went to see if I could find the prisoner, to ask him if he would take his things back again; when I came into Whitechapel, I saw the prisoner go into the Seven-Stars, and another man in a brown coat stopped me in the street, exactly the same as the prisoner did the day before; he said, he had some goods to dispose of; I told him I would not buy any thing of them, I was cheated the day before by another such; he wanted to take me into the same dark room, I would not go in there, but went into the parlour, and sat down; when I had been in about two minutes, the prisoner came into the parlour to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had seen your before you went in? - A. I think he did; I had seen him; the prisoner came in, and said, that man is my boatswain, he has failed with me six years; they both asked me several questions, if I would buy any of their articles; I said, I would not buy any; they asked me, if I had any thing to sell, I said, I had nothing to sell, but what I bought to day; I asked the prisoner if he would take his things back, and offered him half-a-guinea, at last I offered him a guinea to take them back; I told him I had not them with me, but I would go and fetch them; he did not agree to take them back, but his boatswain went and fetched a glass of grog, and asked me five or six times to drink with him, I would not at first, but at last I did; they took my handkerchief on the table, and would look at the lace.</p>
               <p>Q.Which of them? - A.Both; the things were on the table; they asked me to let them look at them; I told them they were welcome to look at it, but I would not sell it; they took one piece out of the handkerchief, to see how many yards there were of it, and asked me how much I had paid for it; I told them, one piece cost six shillings a yard, the other six shillings and sixpence; have you any receipts to shew for it, says the boatswain; I took my pocket-book out to shew the receipts, they said it was a cheap bargain; they said, they would give me sixteen pounds for it; I said, the amount was fifteen pounds one shilling; I told them, I would not fell it; the prisoner had a false check of twenty-one pounds seventeen shillings, and wanted me to give him the difference; he asked, if I would give him four or five pounds difference; I said, I had not so much money about me, I would not agree to any thing; they took me to the bar to drink grog; the prisoner took the handkerchief off the table, and carried it to the bar; we drank a glass at the bar between three of us; I took my handkerchief from the prisoner, and walked away into the street, and the boatswain followed me; they walked both behind me, and talked French between them; I did not know what they said; the prisoner then spoke to the boatswain in English, and desired him to go on board, and tell the boys to take care of every thing on board till he came; the prisoner walked close to me about five or six houses further, and his boatswain behind him; the prisoner snatched the handkerchief out of my hand, and gave it to the boatswain, who ran away with it towards Whitechapel-road; the prisoner held me by my arm, and stopped me from going after the boatswain, there was a thick crowd of people, and I soon lost sight of him; I told the prisoner, you are a pretty captain of a ship, when you could not buy the goods you want to rob me; he said, he was a gentleman, and desired me to go over to Mr. Jones, and enquire his character; I went and enquired, but nobody knew him; he then said, when he got change for his draft, he would pay me; we went into five or six public-houses; he then said, have you any demand upon me, I want to be rid of your company; he went afterwards into the George, in Shoreditch, where he had several acquaintances, and I sent for a constable, but the people pushed and dragged me about, and he got out into the street before the constable came; he was taken four days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he was taken up? - A. Yes, at his own house, No. 29, Huntingdon-street, Kingsland-road; when he was apprehended, he said, I know nothing of the man, but when he was in prison, he produced the duplicate of the things, they were found in pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him produce it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the things were found? - A. Yes; the officer and I went together to Mr. Barber's, in the Borough, and found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You agreed for the sale of this lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink together? - A. Two sixpenny worths.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more? - A. No more in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any where else? - A. No.</p>

In the course of the day, he said the things were pawned, and he thought he could find where the duplicate was; he sent his little boy over into the Borough, as he said, to see if he could find the person that bought the duplicate.</p>

The next morning, a letter was delivered to him in the Office; I had the duplicate before, given to me by a friend of his at the Flying Horse; the prisoner was not present when he gave it me; but he saw it afterwards at the Office; he gave me a letter to give to the Magistrate on his examination.

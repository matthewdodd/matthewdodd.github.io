                  </hi>. I am a clock-case maker, and live at No. 60, Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell. On the 13th of May I gave Drury a clock-case to take to Mr. Payne, of Bond-street—he returned soon after, and gave me information—on the following Wednesday the prisoner was brought to my premises in custody, I sent for a policeman, and he was taken to the station-house—I appeared at Hatton-garden in the evening, and on my entering the office he called me aside, and asked the price of the clock—I case which was lost—I said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or three guineas—he said, "If you and the policeman will walk with me, I will get you the three guineas"—I de<lb></lb>clined that.</p>

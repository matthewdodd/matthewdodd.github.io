On Monday night, at half-past. eight o'clock, I was walking through Finsbury-square with Mayhew—I saw Mr. Kenworthy's waggon coming from Crown-street—I saw five or six persons there, and I saw the prisoner come from the off side of the waggon, and join the parties who had passed us—I watched them—three of them left the party, and went to the waggon—one got in and handed the parcel to the prisoner—he went towards the rails with it—I went and seized him, and told him to drop it—I kept him till the waggoner and the policeman came up—when he dropped the parcel—he fell down, and I then took him.</p>

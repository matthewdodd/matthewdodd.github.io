When the shirts were missing I charged the prisoner. She denied taking them. I promised I would forgive her; then she confessed she took them; after that I missed the other things; she owned she took them, and said the coffee-pot was pawned at Mr. Brown's, on Snow-Hill, the sheets and blankets at the corner of Hosier-Lane, and the handkerchiefs at a pawnbroker's in Chick-Lane. She confessed the same before my Lord-mayor, and that she did it to pay her debts, being much in debt.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I am pretty sure this is mine. I can't swear to the shirts. The prisoner told me they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wilson. Where had you these things?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I had them of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not my master lend me the things ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know that she had them till she told me so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I wanted some money, and my master lent me these things because he would not give me money. (I wanted money to buy my child some things) My mistress was jealous, and he, to convince her there was no cause for it, prosecutes me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is all false.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I take your money? A. Yes, you pulled your hand out of my pocket with the money, and called for two glasses of gin; I had one and the prisoner the other - I objected to pay for it, and told the prisoner to pay, but I did not see any money in her hand; the bar-maid came out, and asked me to pay for it - I was not five minutes in the house; I was not with any other female.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and found on her two half-crowns, four shillings, two sixpences, and one halfpenny - she claimed it all; I returned one half-crown to her at the office - she said it was the change of a sovereign, that she had bought a pair of shoes, and treated one and another.</p>

             GARDE. I am a Police-serjeant. On the morning of 20th of October I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner walking in King David-lane - she had her right-arm round his waist; I said to him, "Do you know what company you are in? he careful, you will be robbed; she is an incorrigible thief;" he made no answer, but went on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had slept with a sailor at Mr. Clark's the night before; he gave me the sovereign, and all I had out of it was this hand round my waist, and a pair of shoes- 1 spent about 2s. 6d. in liquor.</p>

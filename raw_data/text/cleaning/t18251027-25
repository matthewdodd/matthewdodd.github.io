            . I am a chemist and druggist, and live opposite to Mr. Offley - he has the cellars under my house. On the evening of the 4th of October, I saw the female prisoner and Tandy's wife, near the house - Tandy put a basket, which I considered full, out of the cellar, on the flap, between the two women - Tandy's wife took it up and they both went away toward Bedford-court, in the direction of St. Martin's-lane; I then saw Tandy follow<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270014"></xptr>them with a bottle in each hand, which he delivered to the female prisoner, in Mary's-buildings; he then went away, and I lost sight of him; I went up to the women and pushed them into a shoemaker's shop, when I got an officer; I looked at the basket, while it was in the shop, and it contained nine pint bottles of ale and four of stout; I then saw each of the women take two quart bottles of stout from the front of their dress, which they put down by the side of the basket - I asked the women what they had got - they said beer - I said they had got it from Offley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were these bottles put up from the cellar in the usual way? A. No, they generally open the whole flap.</p>

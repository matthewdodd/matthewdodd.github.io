               <p>PHILIP REYNOLDS BISHOPS. I live at Mr. Langstaff's. I saw this lady in the shop, with the child at the door - I saw the prisoner pass the shop two or three times; the last time she passed she took hold of the child with one hand, and put her other hand to the child's back - she went round the corner; I rather suspected she was going to do something with it - she crossed behind a coal waggon, with the child in her arms; I came back to the shop, and found Mrs. Goddard had missed the child - I then ran out again, and Mrs. Goddard after me; I ran on; we saw the prisoner, with the child, in Earl's-court - I heard the child say to her, "What are you going to do with me? I don't belong to you;" I took the woman, and Mrs. Goddard took the child.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never said any such thing. I had been to Westminster, and was coming back; my father and mother lived at No. 4, King-street, close in that neighbourhood; I saw this child near the coal waggon, took it up, and said, "Where do you live?" I thought she lived at some house in the court, and I had not time to inquire before the man came, and took me - I walked back; I am innocent of stealing any thing - I had the misfortune to be here once; the man who stands there took me - he could speak of my bad qualities, but he would not speak of his own.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard Smith call for the watch - he had hold of the prisoner by her arms, and gave charge of her; he appeared to me to be sober. I took her to the watch-house, and she kept the pin in her mouth till she got there; the prosecutor said it was in her mouth - she gave it to me out of her mouth: as we were going along she swore she would swallow it; she acknowledged that she took it.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with stealing the pin - the prosecutor appeared to be perfectly sober; as soon as the prisoner came to the watch-house she put her left hand to her mouth, and in giving it to me she said "I acknowledge that I took the pin;" immediately afterwards she said he gave it to her.</p>

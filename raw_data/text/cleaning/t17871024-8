               <p>I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner; I carried him to the Rotation-Office, and searched him, and found upon him, this purse; (producing a purse,) this purse I took at the Theatre from him; I saw the prisoner, and five or six more very busy there; I took particular notice of the prisoner, and presently, I saw the prisoner draw his hand, and I saw him very busy shoving about with some more with him; I laid hold of him, and took this purse from him with the assistance of the officer; the purse has been in my possession ever since, and the same things in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What pocket was the purse in? - I took it out of his right hand coat pocket; I saw the purse in his hand, and I laid hold of him by his arm.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I mean to swear it; he called me a rascal.</p>

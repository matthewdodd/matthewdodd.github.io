On the 24th of October I was standing at our door; I saw the prisoner another man, and two little boys were looking at their window; the prisoner went by and stood at the prosecutor's door, talking to another man, and the little boy looked out, and said, "Is that you father?" the little boy ran down stairs, and they asked him whether his name was Ford; he said Yes - they said "Where is your father?" he said out; they said, "Is he gone to the public-house?" he said he did not know - they asked if he was gone to the watch-house; he said he did not know - they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010107"></xptr>took him as far as the corner of the street; the other man then went up stairs with the boy - the prisoner staid at the door about a minute, and then he went in and shut the door; the prisoner went up stairs; I heard the hobbins fall on the floor - the little boy screamed out murder, and said, "Pray don't, I shall be murdered when my father comes home" - I called my father down, and said there were two men robbing Mr. Ford; he ran down, and saw the other man run away - he ran, but could not catch him; I saw the prisoner come out, and cried out Stop thief! and the patrol stopped him six or seven doors from the prosecutor's house.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I saw the prisoner and another man come into my father's room, one Monday night; I was looking out at my father's window, and said, "Is that you father?" the prisoner said, "I am not your father, but I want to speak to you;" I went as far as the end of the street, and then I said, "I must not go any farther;" we came back, and they both went up stairs; the other man pretended to be looking at my cap, and he went behind my father's shelf, and filled his pockets with shute; the prisoner then came up - they whispered together, and this prisoner put the bobbins in his hat, with silk on them - then he took a handkerchief out of his pocket, put shute into it, and tied them up; I said, "Oh, don't take my father's shute, I shall get murdered" - he said, "The more you halloo, the more I'll take;" I said, "Murder! thieves! thieves! murder! they have got my father shute;" they then run away - when the prisoner had got two or three doors off, I saw the officer take him; the bobbins were found at the foot of the stairs.</p>

             FORD. I am the witness' father. I went out on the 24th of November, but I left my work safe, and when I came home I missed nine bobbins of shute; I found three of them at the foot of the stairs, at the bottom of the passage - the other six are lost; they are worth 24s. or 25s. - if the thief had not been found I should have lost my character for ever.</p>

I am a medical student at St. Bartholomew Hospital and live in Whitmore-cottages, Old Hoxton, On the night of the 22nd of October, I was going up the City-road, and saw an unusually large teles<lb></lb>cope in the street—I staid a few moments to took at it, and thought I felt something—I put my hand to my pocket, and at that moment a person said, "You have lost your handkerchief, Sir"—on looking round, I saw the prisoner Brown secured by the witness, and the officer, and saw my handkerchief on the ground—this is it.</p>

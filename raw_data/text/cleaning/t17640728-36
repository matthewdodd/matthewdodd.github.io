            . On a Wednesday night, about three weeks ago, I went along with the two lads at the bar, to Mr. Pullein's house, with twelve or thirteen handkerchiefs to sell; there were three silk ones among them; he gave us 12 s. for them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the day time to sell them?</p>
               <p>Hussey. No, it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night; and sold them to him in the back part of the shop: there is a curtain divides the shop, and we sold them behind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever sold him any before?</p>
               <p>Hussey. Yes, I went two or three times before; he never made no scruple; he always bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by them?</p>

            . I live in the house of Mr. Pullein, and have done, so before he came to it. I wash for him as a servant: I used to see these boys come to the house and sell handkerchiefs: the last time I saw them there, was about three weeks ago; they came between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs might they sell that time.</p>
               <p>Fross. I believe there were about twelve; he gave 12 s. for them: I came down while the boys were selling them; he never minded my seeing him; there were two or three silk ones, some cotton, and some linen. I have seen these boys several times come on nights; he never refused any.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times may you have seen these boys with handkerchiefs there?</p>

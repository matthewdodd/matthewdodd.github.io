A gentleman said, you have lost your handkerchief - on feeling, I missed it, and immediately I saw the prisoner running up the street - I followed and overtook him about thirty yards off - Bidgood stopped him and asked him for the gentleman's handkerchief - he pulled it from under his waistcoat.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was in Church-street, and saw the prisoner sitting at a public-house door, with two others - Mr. Slater passed, wiping his face; they immediately got up and followed him - I saw Mr. Slater return his handkerchief into his pocket; they followed him, and the prisoner took it out; the others were by - I called,</p>
               <p>"Stop him." I ran as hard as I could, and stopped him. I asked him for the handkerchief, and he gave it me from under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not running - I had had the typhus fever, and had only been eight days out of bed. I did take the handkerchief, but it was in Greek-street, not Church-street.</p>

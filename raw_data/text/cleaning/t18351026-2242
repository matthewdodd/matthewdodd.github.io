                  </hi>. I live in Morgan-street, and work for a person in Charlotte-court, Charlotte-street: she works at jackets and trowsers. On Saturday night she had paid me half-a-crown—that was all I had to take that week—I went with Clayworth to buy a paper of pins, at Mr. Jones's, boot and shoe shop—we heard the prisoner and another singing, "Five needles and a bodkin for a halfpenny"—I bought one, and gave the prisoner the half-crown, as I had no halfpence—my companion bought one too—I looked at my case, and it contained only one needle and one bodkin—I had given the prisoner the half-crown, and he asked the other young man to give him change; he pulled out some halfpence, but did not give him change—I then looked at my needles—I turned to get my money, and they had both run away—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday following, in the Commercial-road, singing the same song—I called the policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

On Saturday night, the 17th, the witness came to me and stated that on the previous Saturday she went to Whitechapel, to buy a paper of pins, and saw these two young men singing a song, that she bought one and gave the prisoner half-a-crown—I took the prisoner—he said he knew nothing of it—while conveying him to the station-house, he admitted that he remembered the prosecutrix having</p>

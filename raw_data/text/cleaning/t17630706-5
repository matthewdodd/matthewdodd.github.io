On the 18th of May, about 6 in the evening, I was going into the park, the two prisoners passed me; a woman came and told me they had picked my pocket of a handkerchief; I ran and took Price, and found my handkerchief and four others of different colours upon him, (produced in court) they were in his pocket by the side of his coat, seemingly made on purpose. He confessed the other prisoner took them with him, and the other confessed his taking them, and more.</p>

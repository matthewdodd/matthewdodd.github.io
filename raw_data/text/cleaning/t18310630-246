            . I met a boy and the prisoner in company, coming up the Strand, and having received information from the shop-boy, I went back, and watched; the shop-boy, was opening the shop, and the prisoner walked to and fro - he went in, and came out again without any thing; he waited a bit, then went into the shop, and came out with three hats, walked towards Charing-cross with them, and was taken by the Police.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That witness met me on Friday night, and told me he was going to bring six hats out on the Saturday night; he agreed to go with me to fetch them out, and to pay me 4s. for my trouble. Was you not in my company on Friday night? Witness. Yes - you said you was going on Saturday morning, and I agreed to go with you.</p>

             came for Cannon's cloaths that he had left behind him; we did not let him take the things as he had no authority there. Cannon came for his cloaths; and when he went I saw Siday stand at the corner of the street. The night before he went away he wanted me to let him go out to stay all night after the family were gone to bed; he came in about eleven o'clock. I was not to let my master know if I let him out.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Stratford; when I got up on the twelfth of January, I was some time before I got into the room; I looked about and saw the press burst open; the mustard castor was split; and I thought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200024"></xptr> cats were got in. I remember I lock'd up all safe the night before. I took the key out and found the lock was broke open. I missed the plate. I was much surprised and went into the street hall. I saw Mr. Stratford's closet door; I believe he always keeps the key; I saw the hall door open; I shut the door; I saw the housekeeper's door open, and the plate chest was burst open; the window in the area had the sash burst open and the cords were hanging to it; the hinges on one side of the shutter were broke; when I came down I saw some specks of wax about the hall. and some dirt, which had not been there over night. I had been there but ten or eleven days when this affair happened. I had the care of the press in the hall; I had two pint silver cups, four salts, four shovels, two castors, a sugar and mustard castor, a bread basket, half a dozen table spoons, a large scallop bowl, a soup spoon, and a long spoon, two small hand waiters, and two candlesticks, French plate; what were taken out of the housekeeper's room I don't know.</p>

When this man came down and alarmed the house, I found it as he expressed; they had not been in the kitchen; I found every thing in my room but the plate; the plate were, as near as I can recollect, a coffee pot, two pair of candlesticks, two cases of knifes, and there was a great deal more plate.

I endeavoured to save my wife and the women servants; the maid servant went down stairs. I followed her soon after. I found my door was forced open and every thing of consequence was gone; I set forth a number of things in the indictment upon recollection, but I have lost many other articles that I cannot recollect (all the articles in the indictment severally read, which Mr. Stratford deposed to.) I took the prisoner Cannon into my service at Bath: he seemed very desirous to come to live with me for fear of being pressed. I discharged him at London on the second of January, I think; he came in very much flushed with liquor; I never keep a servant that does so; therefore I discharged him immediately. He hired himself to me by the name of John; I have heard his real name is Luke.</p>

               <p>Levi. Saunders came and said, if I wanted two or three hundred pounds he would give it me; he would lay it out for me; I was a little in liquor; I went with this man to a public house; he was to shew me some diamond buckles, and all the while they were nothing but paste. I went to a public house; he told me to stop there for a moment; when I came back from the public house Cannon and Siday would not give me the buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this Saunders?</p>
               <p>Levi. I don't see him here.</p>

               <p>Levi. I told Saunders, and he discovered me. I never saw the diamond buckles; I saw the rings; they shewed me one pair of paste, which they said were diamond buckles, and three diamond rings; I believe there were nine in all.</p>

               <p>Levi. Four shillings an ounce.</p>

               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>

               <p>Levi. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen them?</p>

On Wednesday the sixteenth of January, about seven in the evening, I was sent for out of this court by one Saunders a Jew; I had been speaking to him of Mr. Stratford's robbery a little before; I told him there was in particular a large diamond ring; he said he had just been offered the diamond ring; he took me to a public house in the Old Bailey; I went and stood at the corner of the house whilst he went in; he came out with

On Friday the 18th of July, the day after Mr. Stratford was robbed, Mr. Stratford called, and desired Mr. Turner, who is partners with the prisoner Glannon, might be enquired of by Sir John, to see if he could find any of Mr. Stratford's property. From Mr. Turner's account, it appeared that his partner Glannon was the principal acquaintance of Cannon. Mr. Glannon was sent for; he said he had left a box there. Sir John sent me with Glannon to his house: he carried me through the shop into a kind of back warehouse close by the door: he scratched up the earth (the place had no flooring) to about five or six inches, and then took out this box (producing a box sealed up.) It is now sealed with my seal. He had told Sir John that there was a box; and he told me, I think, as we were going along, that there was a pair of buckles ( Opens the box, and produces a pair of diamond buckles and a drop.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Stratford. These are mine; the buckles contain just the same number of stones that I had given notice of.</p>

             to enquire of Turner; who is he?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Partner with Glannon. Turner was sent for, and he said he had a very slight acquaintance with Cannon, which was merely by his partner, who had formerly been in partnership with Cannon.</p>
               <p>Q. Glannon came voluntarily, without a warrant?</p>
               <p>Leigh. There was no warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. And mentioned these buckles at once?</p>
               <p>Leigh. I can't tell exactly: he told Sir John, Cannon had been there either on Sunday or Tuesday, or both: I don't recollect whether he said one or both; and he said he had left a box there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything of Cannon's having taken a lodging at his house?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No; he mentioned him with a kind of indignation. He said, that when they were partners before, Cannon went from him, and owed him money. He spoke at first of Cannon as being an unworthy man, that he did not chuse to have connection with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he was coming to give information to Sir John, if he had not been sent for?</p>
               <p>Leigh. I did not hear any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say he said he was present when the buckles were hid?</p>
               <p>Leigh. He said, Cannon and he hid them. He said, as to the knee-buckles, Cannon had made him a present of them for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how long they had been had?</p>
               <p>Leigh. Either on the Sunday or the Tuesday: it was on Friday that Mr. Stratford was robbed. Cannon came there on Sunday or Tuesday, and then they hid these buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell Sir John he was then coming to give information?</p>
               <p>Leigh. No.</p>

            . I found these things the Friday after Mr. Leigh was at our house. I went to see Glannon in prison; he told me where there was a breast-buckle in the back shop; I went and found it according to his directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it laid?</p>
               <p>Turner. On the top of some bricks, against the wall.</p>

               <p>Turner. No.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and undertaker. On the day that Mr. Stratford came to town, I was sent for to put some window-curtains up. On the 26th of December, I saw Cannon in the house then, for the first time. I was in the kitchen at Mr. Stratford's. His late coachman and another man were going down to Tothil Fields Bridewell. I was going that way, and said I would walk with them. We all three went in and enquired for Cannon. Cannon was in the kitchen. We sat down with him, and called for some beer. Cannon drank with us. One word brought up another. Mr. Stratford's coachman was talking with Cannon, and Cannon told him several things that he asked him. He asked him what time they came in that morning; Cannon said, about two o'clock. He asked him how long they were in the house; Cannon said, they did not come out till almost seven. The coachman asked how many there might be in the house; he said, six, and every man had a loaded pistol. He said, it was a happy affair that Mr. Stratford's people were not alarmed; for if they had, they must have been all murdered. He said, that if Mr. Stratford would admit him principal evidence, he could impeach sixteen or more that were in the gang, and tell where every thing was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the coachman, or any body, persuade him to tell this?</p>
               <p>Grant. Tomlin said, You may as well tell the truth; and if you can be admitted an evidence, you shall.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you should not have made use of it, it is not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Cannon had said nothing about this robbery before the coachman had advised him to be an evidence?</p>
               <p>Grant. He did not say he was in the house when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Siday's Defence.</p>
               <p>One Sunday, I can't justly tell the day of the month, my brother, and two more young men, came up to me before I was out of bed. I got up, and let them in. They brought in some things: they told me they had been helping a young man to move that was afraid of having his goods seized. He asked me to let him leave them: being my brother, I let him put them into the closet. The next day he brought out the things, and asked me to buy them: he said it was plate: I said I would. I weighed it with the weights and scales that are in court. The Jew came up to me; I asked him if he would buy it of me; he said, Yes. I sold it to him; he paid me the money for the plate and the cloaths. He asked me if I woul d sell him the diamonds; I told him, Yes. I asked him four hundred pounds for them; he said he would give it me. He brought Sir John's men, and took me to goal. Mr. Glannon knew nothing at all about it.</p>

Siday told me they were going to look for a room, and asked me if I knew any body that had a room to let; I said an acquaintance of mine had. I went with them to New-street, Covent-Garden; to Glannon's house: they gave him the box. At the same time he said he had four rooms to let backwards: I told him I had two friends with me that wanted a room or two. Glannon and they and I went backwards; nobody else was in the shop. They looked at the rooms, and agreed to give him 4 s. 6 d. a week for the two rooms. Somebody knock'd at the shop; Glannon came down, and we staid up behind. Upon our coming down, this Siday goes into the shed that is backwards; he was to have the use of it. Siday and his brother and I went in, I came out before them, and then they put the buckles, I suppose, in that place. That very night I came home to Siday's house; I was in liquor; he persuaded me to lie down upon his bed. I took off my coat and waistcoat, and laid down upon his bed. I had nothing upon my head, though Mr. Bond says I had a night cap. I slept two or three hours before Sir

On the Friday following I had a boy came to me from Newgate with a letter to acquaint me that there was a shirt buckle wrapped up in a piece of paper on a shelf, and desired me to send for it. Accordingly the next time I saw Mr. Turner, I acquainted him that I had such intelligence, and bid him see if he could find it, to take it to Sir John's; and if he could not find an owner for it, to bring it to me.

             on the 14th of January; last Monday was five weeks. I was at his house between eight and nine in the morning. I saw a lot of wearing apparel on the 11th of January in Marybone: I could not buy it myself; I had not money. I went to Lazarus Jacobs on Sunday, and told him of it; he said if I would call in the morning he would give me money, or go with me. Lazarus Jacobs was out, so Jacob Jacobs went with me: he said he must not trust me with the money, but must go with me, and lay the money out. He went with me to Castle street, and laid out twelve guineas for me. From there we went to an eating house in Chandois-street, St. Martin's lane, a cook's shop. We got there about two o'clock, or a little after two. We staid there till between five and six. First I eat my dinner, and then we ripped off the lace, and sorted the clothes. I saw

               <p>Callinger. No; I only was known to Levi.</p>
               <p>Q. Levi says he did not know the Christian there: did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I cannot tell whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be subpoena'd?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Because I was in company.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they know that?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not somebody talk to you, and ask you whether you was in company there or no?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Myers asked me whether I remembered the day; and Myers told me the day I was there with him.</p>
               <p>Q. So you did not remember the day Myers bid you bring that receipt?</p>
               <p>Callinger. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that receipt?</p>
               <p>Callinger. In a book at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with Myers about it?</p>
               <p>Callinger. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the subpoena?</p>
               <p>Callinger. A young man gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody you did not know?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the subpoena given you?</p>
               <p>Callinger. On Wednesday last.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell what you was to appear for?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I was subpoena'd to appear here.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you guess how they came to subpoena you?</p>
               <p>Callinger. It struck in my head directly: Myers told me before that I should be subpoena'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the last receipt you had?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. It was an eating-house you say?</p>
               <p>Callinger. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they eating of?</p>
               <p>Callinger? Roast beef and potatoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they drinking?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I did not mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not mind what they were drinking?</p>
               <p>Callinger. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they with them?</p>
               <p>Callinger. A bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. In what?</p>
               <p>Callinger. A bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What do they sell at that house besides eating: do they sell liquor?</p>
               <p>Callinger. No.</p>

            . I am a chapman in Rosemary-lane. I was at an eating-house in Chandois-street on the fourteenth of January. Mr. Callinger and I had a little bananas together; and; and we had a mouthful of something to eat. I went in about two o'clock. I said till ale o five. I saw Jacobs and Levi there. I was sitting at the table, and had a bit of soft beet and potatoes. They had two bags with them. I did not see what was in them. I left them there. Mr. Callinger and I went away, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they for dinner?</p>
               <p>Myers. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure they had the same?</p>
               <p>Myers. They had some stewed meat, with balls, and some roast beef too, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sit?</p>
               <p>Myers. At the same table.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what they had to drink?</p>
               <p>Myers. We had some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they?</p>
               <p>Myers. Some beer too.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did they go to dinner?</p>
               <p>Myers. We were there till five o'clock. The dinner was ready at half an hour after I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't know whether it was roast beef or no?</p>
               <p>Myers. I can't tell. I don't love to say a thing I don't know. We eat and drank together.</p>
               <p>Q. But the beef, or stewed meat, or whatever it was, did not stay upon the table from three till half an hour after five?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it might stay half an hour?</p>
               <p>Myers. Three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does Callinger live?</p>
               <p>Myers. In Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived there?</p>
               <p>Myers. Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Court. Has he never been out of that shop?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How far does he live from you?</p>
               <p>Myers. About fourteen or fifteen houses higher than the White Swan.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the business between you?</p>
               <p>Myers. In our way of dealing; in buying and selling.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177102200034"></xptr>Court. In buying or selling?</p>
               <p>Myers. We had bought a parcel together.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this meeting about something you two were buying together?</p>
               <p>Myers. Yes. We could not agree.</p>
               <p>Court. What was it?</p>
               <p>Myers. It was a pawnbroker's stock. We did not buy them, because they were too dear.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no money paid by you to him?</p>
               <p>Myers. There was a little bill, but it was not paid the same day.</p>
               <p>Court. So neither of you received any money at all?</p>
               <p>Myers. No.</p>
               <p>Court. So it was not business between you two, but about buying this pawnbroker's parcel?</p>
               <p>Myers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When the victuals were taken away, you all four sat drinking, for half an hour together?</p>

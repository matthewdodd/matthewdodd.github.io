I was in my back room, and heard footsteps in the parlour, I opened the door, and saw the prisoner, Baker, with the boots in his hand - He was a stranger to me. I told him he was robbing me - He snatched the shawl off the chair, and went off immediately; I called out stop thief!-Mathews was walking with him - They both went away together.</p>
               <p>REBECCA PORTER. I live four doors from the prosecutrix. On the 14th of November, I saw Baker come out of Cartwright-street, with the boots, the other prisoner was about six yards behind him; several of the neighbours threw up their windows, and said the prosecutrix had been robbed. I knew the prisoners very well by sight. On the Monday following I was told Bly had taken them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoners, on the Monday after the robbery, together, in the same house; I saw them on the day of the robbery, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030048"></xptr>the boots, but did not know they were stolen. I observed that Mathews had a handkerchief with something in it, under his arm; I asked him what it was, he gave it me with the boots, and said they were his. I asked him where he got them, he said, from Judd-it was about eight o'clock in the morning when I took them; he said he had returned the boots to Judd-Baker heard him.</p>
               <p>BAKER'S Defence. Judd gave them to me - I returned them to him.</p>

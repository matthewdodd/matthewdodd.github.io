               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How did you pay him? A. By a commission on every subscriber he obtained; and he was occasionally employed in writing for me; I considered him as my servant; he received the money at the time he obtained the signatures and was then to have his commission, that was, before he delivered the plans - I have no recollection of having described him as my agent; there was not a debtor and creditor account between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever call on him to become a witness for you at any trial? A. I wished him to become a witness about a fortnight before I made this discovery; which was on the 28th of March, and not before; he was to be witness about a dozen of these plans, which he had delivered to a shopkeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he refuse to become a witness? A. The case never came on; he refused by engaging to go to Wales - I knew he was going before that - he was examined four times on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, after the first examination, apply to make it up? A. No: I should have been glad to have done it, and was applied to about it by Mr. Morley; I advanced him money from time to time, as he stated that he was very poor.</p>

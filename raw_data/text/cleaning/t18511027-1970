                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Edward Newland, at 5, York<lb></lb>terrace, Trinity Church-row, St. Mary Newington. In the night of Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 8th Oct., I was sleeping in the front-kitchen—I was awoke about half-past 2 o'clock in the morning—I saw two men in the room—I am quite sure the prisoner was one—he had a candle in his hand—I laid quite quiet, and took no notice of them—I watched them for a quarter of an hour—the prisoner went two or three times to my master's bureau, and put his fingers to try if it could be opened—it lifts up—while I was appearing to be asleep the prisoner came with the candle, and held it over my face—he did that several times, and I took the opportunity of looking at him—I saw him quite plainly—I looked at him often—during that time the other man was at the cupboard-door—he had nothing in his hand that I could see—he then turned to my master's box, and took a long thing from under his coat, and broke it open—I screamed out—the prisoner threw the candle at me; it fell on my dress—the prisoner and the other man went out of the kitchen; they stopped in the back-kitchen a little while—I heard my master's voice asking me what was the matter—the prisoner and the other man got away—my master came down, and on looking at the house, I found the back-kitchen window was open—I am quite sure it was closed when I went to bed about 12—I had fastened it with a catch—the box of the lock of the kitchen-door was unscrewed in the morning, and the door was open—the box was not unscrewed the night before—I locked the door myself—in the garden I found a shawl and a night-dress of mine—I had left them in the back-kitchen when I went to bed—the prisoner had a brown coat, corduroy trowsers, and a cap—he had whiskers under his chin, the same as he has now—I am quite sure he is the man who held the candle.</p>

I was awoke early in the morning on 8th Oct. by the scream of my servant—I learnt there were two men in her room—I gave an alarm to the police—they came, and I went down, and found the house broken open—a bundle was found in the garden, and different articles were strewed about the room.</p>

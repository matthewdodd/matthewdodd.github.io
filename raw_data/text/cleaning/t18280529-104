On the morning of the 15th of April, about five o'clock, I saw the three prisoners in the garden ground of Mr. Oakham - I told them they had better be off; I walked on about twenty yards - two of them disappeared, and I saw the third, which was Halls, putting something under the hedge; I looked, and perceived it was a copper - I went to him, and said I should take him; I called to a man who was passing, but he would not come - I jumped over the hedge to take the copper; Halls got away - I did not pursue him because I had some goods of my own, which I was afraid of losing; I took the copper home, and soon after I met the prosecutor's son and told him of it - he said, "If it is my mother's copper there is a little hole stopped up with putty" - which is the case.</p>

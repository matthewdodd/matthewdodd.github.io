On the night of the 27th of May I saw the prisoner crossing Charles-street, Hatton-garden; I followed him from there to Saffron-hill, and from there to West-street - he had a large bundle; I came up with him in West-street, about two o'clock in the morning - I asked what he had in the bundle; he said his own property - I asked what it was, and he could not tell me - I took him to the station; I found a sovereign and a 5s. piece, in a purse in his fob - also half a crown and some halfpence, and in the bundle was a soldier's discharge, which it seems he has purchased for 20l.; some of these articles were wrapped round his body, and the rest were in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you a man gave it him to carry? A. No, he said it was his own - I was an officer then, but I am now dismissed; I was fatigued, and not fit for duty, and the inspector thought me in liquor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where was this property? A. On the table in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the officer took me there was a man and woman with me; I had seen them before, and the man said to me, "I have just left my mother, and am going with this woman to Saffron-hill;" I went with them to a house of ill-fame, and he told me to take care of this bundle, which I did - we came out together, and I was going to return the property to the man, when the officer came and said whose was it; I said mine while I had it - he then took me, and the man and woman decamped; the officer mentioned the man's name. and I believe he knew him perfectly well - he stated at the office that he was a country man of his.</p>

            . I am waiter at the house. I let the prisoner out - I held the candle while the door was opened; he had no bundle - he could not have had such a bundle as this without my seeing it; I am positive he had no bulky appearance - our house is visited by hawkers and others.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What time did he come? A. I cannot say - two persons went out just after him; they were the last three that went out - they all went out before I closed the door; they went out together, within a minute or two - I did not rub them down; none of them had any bulky appearance - none of them had a bundle of this dimension, but the things might he divided; I looked at them all as they passed - I do not know whether the prisoner had been drinking with them; I have tap-room, parlour, and all to attend to - it was about twelve o'clock when they went: it was not later - I can swear they did not go out in company.</p>

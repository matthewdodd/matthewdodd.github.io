            . I am a Thames Police-officer. I saw three chaps walking from the corner of Thames-street, up Tower-hill, following the prosecutor, and in Tower-street he took his handkerchief out to use, and put it in again; the prisoner directly took hold of his coat, with his left hand and took the handkerchief out with the right - all three hustled together and ran across the way; I called the gentleman - he pursued the other two, took one of them, and the other ran away; the prisoner had run down Mark-lane - I let the other go, and presently the prisoner came right in my face, and I took him; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said at Guildhall, that I took it and gave it to one of the others; that he took one, but could not find it on him - now if he had seen me take it, why not stop me at the time? or if I gave it to any one, why not take him? If I gave it away, why did he search me?</p>

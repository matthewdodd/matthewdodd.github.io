Whilst these two was there, my iron was in the fire; observation was made that they were going to prayers; one of them said, that makes no difference, we can go to work; so they went on the top of the church again.</p>

When I came back to do my work, he was out, and was gone from twelve to one; the prisoner came to my door and asked me for that key to go out; I told him I would not. From curiosity I went up to see what way the church was made; and I saw a chopper like a sugar chopper, and looked about for the prisoner, but could not see him there; on Sunday week following I heard there was four hundred pounds weight of lead gone.</p>

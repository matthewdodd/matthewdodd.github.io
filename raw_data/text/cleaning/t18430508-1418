                  </hi>. I am assistant-inspector of letter-carriers at the Post Office. The prisoner was a letter-carrier in the Dorset-square district, Regent's-park—in consequence of complaints at the Office, I made up a letter on the 17th of April, and addressed it to "Mr. Midlam, bread and biscuit baker, No. 6, Dorset-place, London"—I put two penny adhesive stamps on it, and next morning, Tuesday, the 18th, I put into the letter one sovereign, in the presence of Mr. Russell—we each put a private mark on the sovereign—I now produce that sovereign, and am quite sure it is the identical one I put into the letter on the 18th—here is both my mark and Mr. Russell's—I noticed also that it was the coinage of Victoria, 1843, which this is—the paper had a yellowish cast, not the usual colour of letter paper, and the letter was rather large—I sealed it, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Brodie, a clerk in the superintending president's room, to take the address—I afterwards went to one of the windows in the hall, and gave it into his hands at the window—he put the obliterating stamp on it, and the day of the month—he then brought it back to me, in the superintending president's room, and I took it into the inspector's room, and gave it to Mr. Russell, who had seen me make it up—he sent for Henry Rice, a sorter, and gave it to him—this was about</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-inspector of letter-carriers. On the 18th of April I saw Mr. Playle inclose a sovereign in a letter, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning, directed to "Mr. Midlam, bread and biscuit baker, No. 6, Dorset-place, London"—a sovereign was fastened into it by a piece of card—I had marked the sovereign, and saw Mr. Playle mark it—I noticed that it was the reign of Victoria, 1843—that produced is it—Mr. Playle sealed the letter—I shortly after saw it in Mr. Playle's hands—it had then received two post-office stamps—Rice was called up, and directed to put it among the Dorset-place division, with Davis's letters—about a quarter past eight o'clock that morning I saw the letter again on the prisoner's seat, having passed through the first sorting, and put up in one of the divisions of letters, as is the custom, to be delivered in different streets—the letters are first sorted by a sub-sorter into divisions, and afterwards into walks—they are then brought out into another office, and placed on the seats of the respective letter-carriers who have to deliver them—they are brought out in a tray, and placed on the carriers' seats—they then arrange them for delivery—I saw this letter after it had been arranged for delivery—that it done by the carrier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you tell it was after it was arranged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are first placed flat on the desk, but afterwards placed upon two shelves, and stand upon one end—this being a larger letter than common, and of a peculiar yellow tint, and what is rather unusual, two stamps, that satisfied me it was the same letter—I saw the two stamps and the colour of the paper—it was rather a large letter, but I think not to large as to project so much as it did—I did not see the prisoner leave the office that morning—I saw him with his hat on, and he came into the private office where I was, preparing to go out—I think it was a little after eight—I was present next morning when Hipp brought the charges into what we call the inquiry room—Mr. Playle was there—we both began to open the different charges—Mr. Playle opened Davis's, when it came to its turn, and put it on one side, without speaking, for me to look; at, which I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know it was Davis's charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew that afterwards—here is the paper with Davis's name at the bottom of the amount, in his handwriting—there was six sovereigns and one shilling in it, and among them was the sovereign which he bad marked—the prisoner was called in that morning, and placed in charge of Tyrrell, the officer—he remained in his custody an hour or two before he was examined by Mr. Peacock.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe it has turned out once or twice that the wrong man has been suspected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—Mr. Playle detected a relation or his own</p>

               <p>in that way after giving another man into custody—I was concerned with Mr. Playle in'getting up that plan—I noticed the date of the sovereign at Mr. Playle's suggestion—anybody into whose hands this paper came, might open it and change the money—there is no seal—it has the pri<lb></lb>soner's signature to it, showing that for two days his letters came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. all but 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I made a dent on the sovereign with a brad-awl, on the shield side, between the stems of the wreath—Hipp has been seven or eight years, I think, in the Post-office—his situation is the same kind as the prisoner's—I saw Mr. Playle put the wax on the letter in the superintending president's room, and saw him leave with it—I saw the letter afterwards—I do not know whether I had it in my hand, but am pretty certain I handed it over to Rice, but do not exactly recollect—the prisoner's is the fifteenth division—I do not know how many letter-carriers there are in it—there are a great many—if a letter is given to a carrier, whose division it does not belong to, he would not be fined if he does not carry it out, that I am aware of—the carriers' seats are divided by a partition—each man has a seat to himself—I did not put the letter on the prisoner's seat, nor see it put on—on the division of his seat that I saw this letter, there were about twenty—they varied in size—Mr. Playle selected the paper for the letter, and directed it, by Mr. Kelly's direction—I saw Mr. Playle mark the sovereign at the end of the curl of the Queen's hair—it was an indentation of the same brad-awl—I was not acquainted with Midlam—I have since found there is a person of that name—the prisoner's ordinary weekly payment was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at the General Post-office. It was part of my duty to receive from the letter-carriers of fifteen divisions their pay-lists. On the 19th of April I received a pay-list from the prisoner—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it contained money—I put it into my pocket, and took it into the room to Mr. Playle—I received lists from all the other car<lb></lb>riers that morning—I put them all into my pocket, and delivered them to Mr. Playle, in Mr. Kelly's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time you received these pay-lists till you delivered them up, had they been broken open, or the money at all mixed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; each man's money was wrapped in his own pay-list—I delivered it exactly in the same condition as I received it from the prisoner—I marked one of the coins which was taken out of it by desire of Mr. Russell—I had seen it taken out—it was in the paper at the time I received it from the prisoner—that now produced is it—I put my name on it.</p>

I was in the inspec<lb></lb>tor's room on the morning of the 19th of April—Mr. Playle, Mr. Peacock, Mr. Russell, and, I think, Mr. Kelly, who belongs to the Post-office, were there—the prisoner was with me—I was called, and brought him into the inspector's room, and he was delivered into my custody—I had had him in my custody for some time before—this paper was opened by Mr. Playle, who looked at one sovereign in particular, and identified it—the prisoner was then asked how he accounted for the sovereigns—he said he had received one the day before, (the Tuesday) from the bar-maid of the Alsop Arms, New-road; two he had received from the same house on the Monday, and he received the other three on the Friday previous—he was asked to look at the sovereign which Mr. Playle had previously identified, and he said he believed that to be the sove<lb></lb>reign he had received from the bar-maid, as the one he had received was a new one—Mr. Peacock said a letter directed to Mr. Midlam, baker, No. 6, Dorset-place, London, on his walk, had never been delivered—the prisoner was asked if he had seen it, and said he had seen no such a letter, for he knew No. 6 was a Mr. Robinson's, a surgeon—I have inquired, and found there is a Mr. Robinson at No. 6.</p>

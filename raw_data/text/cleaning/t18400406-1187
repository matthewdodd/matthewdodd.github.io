On Saturday week last I saw the prisoner come down a turning with two white bats in his hand, and a bag of seed under his arm—he took them in-doors, and next morning I saw him with a bag of seeds, containing scarlet beans and two sorts of French beans—that was about 300 yards from the prosecutor's—on the next day the prisoner's brother was thrown out of a cart—he was carried home, and the prisoner came to the door with the bag in his hand which the seeds had been in.</p>

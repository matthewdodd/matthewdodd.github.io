                  </hi>. I am a mariner. On Sunday night, the 27th of December, I met the prisoner in Twine-court, Shadwell—she took me by the hand and led me to her room—I sent for a pot of beer, and then for some gin, and while she was gone I counted my money, and put it into my trowsers' pocket—I had thirteen sovereigns and some loose silver—I had a pocket-book, and a 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advance-note in it—when the gin came, we were about an hour sitting by the fire and drinking—she then said we must go to bed—I saw the room-door bolted—I put my trowsers under my pillow under my head—she said, "What do you do so for? don't be afraid, nobody ever comes here"—I said, "I always do"—she then said, "You must spread your coat over the bed"—which I did—my pocket-book was in my coat-pocket—about twelve o'clock I heard the prisoner shut the door—I awoke up as soon as I heard it, and found my trowsers were partly drawn from under the pillow—I put them on as quick as I could, and found the money was gone from them—I put my coat on, and my pocket-book was gone from it—I am sure the door was bolted at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep Nos. 1 and 2, in Twine-court. On the evening of the 27th of December, the prosecutor brought another female to the house first—he sent out for gin and tobacco—he then went out, and about eight o'clock the prisoner came and said she would take the prosecutor home with her, and if she got a few shillings she would spend them in the morning—she took him home—she came to me again for a pot of porter, she then came in again—about twelve I heard her go past the door</p>

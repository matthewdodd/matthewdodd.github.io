               <p>Court to prisoner. Your case has been considered by all the Judges, and they are of opinion that even if you cannot hear, you ought to be tried; therefore it is my duty to tell you (on a supposition that you can hear) that it will be in vain for you to pretend to be deaf, because you will only lose the opportunity of asking proper questions, but it will not prevent your trial coming on, for I shall certainly try you, whether you can hear or no.</p>

               <p>I am a shoemaker, I have known the prisoner by sight, three or four years, to the best of my knowledge; I cannot tell in what particular way of life she has been; I have seen her about Chick-lane and at that part of the town, I never had any particular conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she is deaf or no?</p>
               <p>I really cannot tell; I have talked to her, but I know one time of day she could hear as well as another person, she has answered me half a year ago, I do not remember the month, it was when she was at large.</p>
               <p>Was it in the course of this year? - I cannot bring it to memory; I have been with her in goal; she asked me questions, and I answered her, but I do not recollect she gave me answers to what I told her; she said she was very glad I was not at the Old Bailey, when she was arraigned at the bar; I told her I had no business there, whether she heard me or no, I cannot say; she asked me who the woman belonged to that attended the Old Bailey every sessions, and I told her it was my brother's wife; I was once in the chapel in Newgate, two or three months ago, and she saw me there, and called me, and asked me to come down to speak to her at the gate, and I came, and she told me she was done for seven years, but she thought she should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240018"></xptr>never go abroad; so I gave her a penny, and came away.</p>

               <p>Was she any way deaf before she was committed? - Never that I know of.</p>

               <p>I never saw the prisoner but once; I went with Mr. Mills to see her in Newgate once; she was called down, and when she came down, Mr. Mills asked her how she did; she shook her head; then he said, I was here last sessions, Betty; there was no more said for a good while; I stood in the street, on the right hand, she did not see me; when he spoke, she bowed, but she never spoke; she gave a sign that she understood him; I heard her say to Mills, she was very glad that he was not at the Old Bailey when she was arraigned; she never answered him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akarman. I have heard her speak, but I never could make it out that she heard.</p>
               <p>Jury. We do no doubt her speaking, we doubt her hearing.</p>

               <p>What o'clock was it? - Between nine and ten in the evening; I pulled out my watch, she said, d - n my eyes, I will have it; I went along with that man there. (N. B. Mills, who gave evidence about her deafness.)</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you and the prisoner? - I did not want this woman, it was the other woman I wanted; there was another woman and Mills.</p>
               <p>In what manner was it taken? - She thrust her hand into my breeches pocket, where I had a shilling and two sixpences, I endeavoured to prevent her; then she snatched my watch out, and ran out of the room and ran off; she went out of another door, I went after her with that man, and asked him where she was gone; I saw her about an hour after, about eleven in Catharine-wheel alley.</p>
               <p>Are you sure she is the woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find your watch? - I never saw the watch since; it was a silver watch, No. III.</p>
               <p>Did you charge her with taking your watch? - Yes.</p>

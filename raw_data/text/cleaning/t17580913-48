            . On the 22d of August, at night, the prisoner came to a public-house that I use, I knew him by his using that house, he is not one of our countrymen, he is a Barbarian.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a Barbarian ?</p>
               <p>Mee. That is, he is a man from Barbadoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was this at?</p>

               <p>Mee. At the Bishop's-head in Ratcliff highway, he asked to be trusted for a pint of beer, and brought this tea-chest under his arm; said he I have got this to put my money in, I am to go on board a ship with a shipmate of mine, and if you will let me leave this chest here, I will call again for it in half an hour's time, so he left it.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade are you?</p>
               <p>Mee. I am a baker by trade, but I am a gravedigger at present; when I came to look into it. I found four silver tea-spoons in it, they were marked E. R. When he came again I found he knew nothing of the spoons, they were in a private drawer. I charged him with stealing it, and he confessed that he and another man were going along, that the other man went in and took it out, and he received it at the door. He took us to the house where he had it, which was the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had the chest of a young man that is gone to sea, and I carried it for him, and left it at that man's house.</p>

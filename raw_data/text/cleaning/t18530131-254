                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living in Upper Weymouth-street. On 24th Jan., about half past 11 o'clock at night—I was near Field-lane, going up Holborn—I stood still—I had not been drinking—two females came up to me, and asked me to go with them into Plough-court—I went there—one of them left, and the other remained with me—that was the prisoner—I am certain of her—while we were in the court talking I felt a <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> at my watch—I put my hand up, and my watch was gone—the chain went round my neck—I had looked at my watch a quarter of an hour before—the prisoner ran away, and said, "I will be back in a minute," or something of that sort</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301310023"></xptr>
               <p>—I ran after her—she went into a house in Plough-court—I followed her—she went into the parlour, and the door was shut in my face—I called a policeman, and with his assistance got into the parlour, and saw that there was a door into Field-lane, which was wide open—we searched the rest of the house, but did not find the prisoner—in consequence of something which passed between me and the policeman, I went next evening in disguise, and stood against a lamp post at the comer of Farringdon-street and the bottom of Holborn—the prisoner came up to me, and then said, "I beg your pardon, I made a mistake," and was going away—I spoke to her, and she came back, and asked me if I would stand treat—I said I did not care if I did—she wanted to cross over to Field-lane again, but I said, "No, I will go up this way"—we walked till we got opposite St. Andrew's Church, where I met a policeman, and gave her into custody—I am sure she is the same woman.</p>

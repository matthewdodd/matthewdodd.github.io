            . I live on the forest. The prosecutrix keeps the Green Man public-house, at Laytonstone. I saw the two prisoners take the pigs from the bottom of our garden, which is about a quarter of a mile from her premises, on Wednesday, the 7th of November; I saw them driving them among the bushes: some persons were coming up, and they left them - they returned again, took the pigs out, and drove them away, across Wanstead-flat, towards the Rabbits public-house, in the Ilford-road; they then crossed the road, and went on to Plaistow; I followed them, and in Plaistow I got an officer, and gave charge of them - they were both driving the pigs.</p>

            . I am an officer. Hatchard spoke to me, and I went and overtook the prisoners; Brown was then driving the pigs; Flynn was walking on the pavement, just abreast of him; I went up to Brown, and asked if they were his pigs - he said No; I asked if they were for sale; he said No, but that was his master (pointing to Flynn), who had employed him to drive them. I then asked Flynn if they were his pigs - he said, "Yes, Sir;" I said, "Are they for sale?" he said No: I said, "I suppose you are driving them to town?" he said, "Not quite to town;" he then made a stop at a shop, and pointed to something, as if inquiring the price - he came out again, and crossed the road; I crossed too, but he did not see me: he then went on, and turned up a street. I then went and took them. There was a sow and two store pigs, which Mrs. Hargrave claimed.</p>

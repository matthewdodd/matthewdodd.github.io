               <p>On Tuesday the 20th of November, I went into Mr. Enoch's shop, I had a little business with him, the prisoner at the bar at that time was in the back parlour trying on breeches, after he pulled on his own breeches, and returning out of the shop, there was some conversation took place, between the prisoner and Mr. Enoch, Mr. Enoch said, that he believed he rather came with an intent to steal a pair of breeches more than to buy, with that the prisoner seemed very much affronted; Mr. Enoch told him, he would shew him no more, and wished never to see him there any more; the prisoner said, he never would come there any more; after that the prisoner had buttoned up his breeches, and returned out of the shop; I cannot pretend to say, I perceived it before or after he had got out of the shop door; I perceived one knee hanging out of the hind part of the skirt of his coat, five or six inches; he was out of the shop and passing by the window; on seeing this, I went after him, he perceived that somebody was after him, he began to run, he just turned the corner of Mr. Enoch's shop; I caught hold of the hind part of the skirts of his coat, collars him and accused him of the theft; I suppose he was about a dozen or fourteen yards from the shop; with that other assistance came up, and we took him to Bow-street, in an hackney coach; he was examined by the sitting magistrate and committed to Newgate; Mr. Enoch permitted the breeches to be taken out in the coach, going to Bow-street; when I saw the prisoner go by the window, I followed him to the door, but I did not see the breeches till I was at the door.</p>

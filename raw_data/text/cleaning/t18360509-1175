                  </hi>. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, at No.41, Wych-street, Strand, about a fortnight after the robbery, (last Sunday fortnight, the 24th of April)—I had a key, which I found behind the water<lb></lb>butt in the cellar, at No.41, Wych-street—that was the Key of the office at the White Horse—I told the prisoner I wanted him—he said, so he had heard—before I said any thing to him about the money he said, "I had none of the money"—I told him that I supposed he had heard all about it—he said "Yes"—I told him if he had anything to say, to say it before a Magistrate, not to say it to me, as perhaps it would be evidence against him—his father was sitting in the room at the time—he said no more till I was coming down Fleet-street—I asked him if he had seen Fallon, he said, "No"—I then said, "Fallon said that you had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money"—he said, "No, I had but 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so"—he said Duncan had brought the parcels and the Key to No. 41, Wych-street, to his house—that he was in bed—that Duncan opened the parcels and burnt the paper over the candle—he then went down into the cellar with Duncan, and Duncan put the money in a pot in the brick wall, and he himself had put the Key behind the water-butt—the next day, after being at the office, on taking him to the Compter, he said, "I did not tell Fallon that I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, I had one sove<lb></lb>reign and two new shillings, which I took off the table myself," that was all he said, except that he had been into the country to look for employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you begin to question him, was it that you might draw something out of him, after you told him not to say any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely asked him if he saw Fallon, because Fallon said that he had not seen him at all—I was not alone, my brother officer was with me—he said he had not seen him—I asked him that question in the house as well as out—I said, Fallon says you had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money"—my fellow-officer's name is Nunns—I can give no reason why he is not here—he heard it—Fallon had told the Magistrate that the prisoner had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—I took Fallon from the court here after the trial last sessions—he had been tried and acquitted—he was in custody after he gave his evidence—I saw Nunns this morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I know nothing about it—Fallon told me to go away—I told him I would not have any thing to do with it—he said he would, we should only get three months a-piece, and that would do us good.</p>
               <p>(John Smith, a boot-marker of Wych-street, and Mr. Greenwood, a whip<lb></lb>marker, of Wych-street, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

Kealey, 3, Elm-conr, Temple," and I wrote that address on the check, and likewise his address, "Mr. Whalley, 26, Red Lion-court, Holborn "—he put his name at the bank of it—I went, on Monday morning, to the Joint-Stock Bank, and did not get it paid—I afterwards found the prisoner, and asked how he came to get hold of a forged check, and rob me of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said if I chose to present it at Elm-court.

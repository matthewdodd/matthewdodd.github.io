            . I am servant to the prosecutor - my brother and Thornton called on me that evening - I took them into the kitchen - I and my brother went out, and he gave me a shilling to get change, and to get a pennyworth of gin - I left the watch safe when I went out - when we returned, Thornton was standing at the door; my brother did not go into the kitchen, but he went away with her - I went into the kitchen, and missed the watch in about twenty minutes after they were gone; no one else had been in the kitchen that I know of; Thornton came back the same evening for my brother's pen-knife; I gave it to her, and told her the watch was gone; I asked her if any one came while we were out - she said, "Yes; some man came down into the kitchen, that she said, "What do you please to want?" and he said, "What is that to you?" and he went out of the kitchen - and she said to me, "Do not say we have been here, or we shall be caught;" my brother was very much in liquor.</p>

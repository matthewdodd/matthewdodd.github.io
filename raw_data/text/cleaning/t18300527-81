               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is there any internal communication between the warehouse and the prisoner's house? A. No; Mr. Farmer sells a great many nails, but we do not sell one bag of this sort in twelve months - they are of a superior description; I know Freeman - I do not know whether he sells nails; we have sold him bar-iron - the only thing I can swear I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270040"></xptr>saw on the 17th was this bag of nails, it has our mark on it, and this ticket, stating the description of nails - if we had sold a bag of this description the ticket would have remained on it; this chopping-knife has our private mark on it, as all the articles in our shop have - I was using this hammer about a month before, and can swear to it; I never saw one of this description before - I heard the prisoner say that no other person lodged in his house.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th I went with the witness, and found the articles.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FARMER. I believe these articles are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; I do not know what way of life the prisoner is in - I have missed property like this; I am certain the bag of nails had not been sold; I do not suppose I have sold half a dozen scythes within the last twelve months - we sell very few now; that hammer could not have been sold - it is an old one; I do not know the hand-writing of Mr. Freeman - he has never bought nails of me; I have discharged a shopman lately who I suspected had robbed my till.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>- CLARK. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Northampton-street. I sold the prisoner a lot of goods some time back, and among them was a small hammer, similar to this - it was broken, but I think not so much as this; I should claim this as mine - I think it was about three months ago; I sold him goods to the amount of about 8l. - there were some axes and other things.</p>

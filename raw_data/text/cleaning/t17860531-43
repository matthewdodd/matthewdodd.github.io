               <p>- NELKIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the prisoner Warmsley going over the common with the coat under his arm; I told my brother to secure him; he is not here; I came to him, and he had hid the coat in a hole upon the common; this coat was about ten or a dozen yards from where he was taken; I observed the lining of it, which appeared to be red, and gave me a suspicion it was a livery coat; he was taken in ten or a dozen minutes after; I came up in a minute, and pursued him.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Simpson? - No; I only saw them together the day before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Last Tuesday week, in the evening, a little after five, I saw two men walking on Hampstead Heath, and I saw one throw a bundle into a gravel-hole, but what it was, I do not know; it was the two prisoners, they were together.</p>
               <p>Were they walking or running? - I saw the prisoner Simpson get into a hole, and the other prisoner stood by the hole till he came out; in about half a minute after Simpson came out of the hole, I saw them walk up the hill both together a quarter of a mile; they were taken in a minute; I went up to them after they were taken; I saw the coachman coming on horseback over the heath, as hard as he could ride; he met me; I said, have you lost a coat? he said, yes; I then said, I know where it is; I shewed him the hole that Simpson came out of, and there was the coat almost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310069"></xptr> covered over with gravel; this is the coat; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>(The coat deposed to)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was the distance of four or five hundred yards? - Yes; I was digging of gravel; I was looking round me, resting myself; I stood over a pit; I was some yards nearer than the coachman was when he set out first.</p>
               <p>PRISONER SIMPSON'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Last Wednesday was a week, I walked up to Hampstead; I met the prisoner by me promiscuously on Hampstead Heath; I know nothing of the coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Simpson called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WARMSLEY'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was running after a rabbit with this man, and we tried to catch it; I never saw the coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Warmsley called one witness to his character.</p>

I am sure my handkerchief was in my outside coat pocket. I did not feel it taken, but a person pulled me on the arm; I turned round and saw a gentleman, who had hold of Tate, right behind me; he produced a handkerchief, and asked if it was mine; I looked, and found my name in full upon it; we took him to Guildhall, in company with Summers, whom somebody had secured; I had not observed them near me before; Tate denied it, and said the person who took him had knocked him down, and that the handkerchief fell from my pocket.</p>

On the 25th of July, between twelve and one o'clock, I was coming out of the Court of Chancery, Lincoln's Inn, and coming down Chancery-lane towards Fleet-street, a gentleman pointed the prisoners out to me; they were close behind Mr. Lukens, and were in company; in Chancery-lane Tate put his hand into Mr. Lukens' pocket, and Summers came up close to him to conceal him; he did not succeed at the first, second, or third attempt; Mr. Lukens got within a few<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150098"></xptr>yards of Temple-bar; I kept close behind them; Tate then drew the handkerchief out; Summers was close by his side; a gentleman; who was in my company collared Tate, and I seized Summers; the moment my friend collared Tate he dropped the handkerchief; the officer picked it up; my friend immediately told Mr. Lukens, who claimed the handkerchief; I never lost sight of them.</p>

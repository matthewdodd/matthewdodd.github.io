                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper and dairyman, at Dodd's Farm, Cambridge-road. On 2nd Jane, about five minutes to 11 o'clock at night, I saw my mare and pony in my stable, which is inside the cow-house, the door of which I secured with a chain and padlock, and went to bed—I got up next morning about a quarter to 4, and while at my window saw the mare standing in the street, and my man at the door—I went down imme<lb></lb>diately—the stable-door was open, and the pony in it loose, and the chain on the cow-house door broken—the mare was worth sixteen or twenty guineas, and the pony about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found a bricklayer's hammer in the yard.</p>

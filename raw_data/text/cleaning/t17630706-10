She delivered it to my wife about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

            . My husband wanted a pocket-handkerchief, and gave the prisoner the key to go up for it. When he missed the money, he called me up; I called the prisoner up and charged her with it, she flew and tore and said, she would take us before my Lord Mayor for scandalizing her. She cried murder. The young man, that had recommended her to us, was below, he came up, and struck my husband, and got her down stairs before him. While my husband was talking to him below, the prisoner got up into a back room, I went to her and desired she would let me have the money again; she fell down on her knees and said, will you let me go if I tell you were it is? I said I would; then she took up one of the feet of the bed and took up a paper and gave it me, in which was one guinea and six half guineas, and the next day I found she had changed a half guinea.</p>

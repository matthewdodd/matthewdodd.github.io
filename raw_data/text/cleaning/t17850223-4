               <p>Court. You had intrusted him before? - Many times; and he took away a hat, which I had lent to another of my servants, and a waistcoat, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by banking? - I do business for gentlemen in the country, charging them an half per cent.</p>

               <p>What banker's? - I do not recollect, I do business with almost every banker in Lombard-street; it was the 19th of October, after four o'clock, I went to the farm which I have in the country the same afternoon; and the next morning very early, a messenger came to the farm, to inform me the prisoner was not returned, and the Notary public had called with the bill; I came to town, and went to Bow-street, and got some hand-bills printed, I then took my phaeton, and went down to Chatham, and distributed hose bills, and about ten days after the prisoner was taken upon suspicion; and being informed by a runner from East Smithfield office, that he answered my advertisement, I went there and found him at a public house; he had the waistcoat on, but I did not know it then, I know it was because I saw it before the Magistrate, on the Monday and Thursday.</p>
               <p>Did you know into be your's? - I never wore the waistcoat, but it was my property, my wife told me it was mine, but my wife had promised him a waistcoat; I am sure the stockings are mine, I saw them in a handkerchief; the hat was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know your wife did not give him the stockings? - She has since told me, that if he had behaved well, she would give him this waistcoat, she declared she did not give him the stockings; he had only eight shillings left when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Where were these stockings taken from, do you know? - From a bureau drawer in one of the bars, I saw them about two or three days before, but I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. So you keep a banking? - Yes, I keep the Bull and Gate Inn.</p>
               <p>I believe it is or house of civil protection for the goddenes that patrol Holborn, and preside over the fate of drunken men? - I should be glad you would explain yourself, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is it not a house of protection for women of the town? - I neither keep nor procure any such.</p>
               <p>Your's is an inn, is not it? - Yes, it is, three hundred guineas a year.</p>
               <p>But such women may come in? - I have no business to ask them whether they are married or not, it is open for every body, provided they pay their way.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, you should not have commenced this prosecution, but at the instance of your wife? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, that you had prosecuted for things that were not your property? - As to the waistcoat, after I came to know that.</p>
               <p>Did not you say your wife made you bring the prosecution? - My wife does not rule me, I rule my wife.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time say, your wife induced you to do this, or to do wrong? - Only touching the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>- SADLER sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of October, I was sent to take the prisoner on a charge of robbing the prosecutor of two ten pounds bank-notes, and ten pounds in ash. I took him to prison, the next day he had his examination before the Magistrate and the Magistrate did not think it was a felony, he was discharged of that then Mr. Blick laid a charge of felony for robbing him of a waistcoat and hat he had the waistcoat on his back, I took it off him, and Mr. Blick swore it was his property; have is the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about stockings? - Not to my knowledge, I know nothing of the hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. All that you found upon him was the waistcoat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor did not charge him with these stockings and waistcoat till he understood from the magistrate, that going off with the notes and money was no felony? - He charged him at first only with the notes and money.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say any thing before the Magistrate, in the hearing of the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230027"></xptr> as to the reason of this prosecution? - I heard no other than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have no further to say, than I came from sea two years ago; I used this house and spent a great deal of money, I lent the prosecutor twenty or thirty pounds, and I was induced to be his waiter, the waistcoat was given me, and the hat likewise; as to the stockings I know nothing about, they are in that bundle that I came away with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt to Prosecutor. In what capacity was this boy in your house? - As a waiter, I do not pay them any wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. We have only what we get.</p>

               <p>Did you receive him on account of his friends? - I will tell you the real truth, as soon as his money was gone, I desired him to get into a ship, for I had so much loss by officers.</p>
               <p>Was he a customer to your house before he became your servant? - He was very ill when he came, he spent seven pounds in all; I suffered him to remain in the house, his place was worth a hundred pounds a year, he was a customer about four months.</p>
               <p>Is it customary when men have laid out their little property, to make them servants? - There was another that I arrested him by his own consent, and he was of a good family; this young man's bill was at that time about eight pounds; he came and put forty pounds into my hands, and he drew it out in less than two months.</p>
               <p>Did you let him remain in your house as a customer, or under the idea of servitude? - As a servant, the very same as all servants I ever had, I gave him that place that he might get his money up again, he assented to it and waited on all company that ever came.</p>

               <p>But what were they worth? - I suppose they might be worth a couple of shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How long was it from the time you suspected the stockings were stole, before you saw them? - I said before I am not clear, I have two dozen pair of stockings, I do not know when I saw them last, till I saw them in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court. You say nothing with respect to the bank-notes and money.</p>

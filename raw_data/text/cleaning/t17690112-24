            . On Monday the 19th of Dec. I was coming from Hampstead to go to Islington, between five and six in the evening. I was stopped in the <placeName id="t17690112-24-crimeloc139">corner of a field, joining Pancras-Wash</placeName>

I told him I had but little; I had but one shilling in my pocket. He said, Then give it me. I put my hand in my pocket, and could not find it, being a little flurried; he said, I must not tell him lies; I told him, if he would not believe me, he might search. He said, No, I knew best myself what I had done with it. I felt again, but could not find it. In the mean tine, there was a coach coming up Pancras-Wash; I knew it must come very near us. As it came past us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176901120058"></xptr> he held the pistol down by his coat; I then bid him a good night, and better luck than he had with me, and left him. He said he should have better luck, or he would meet with me again. I imagined he went after the coach. It was quite a moon-shiny night. I had about five minutes conversation with him. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I went away to Sir

            . When we came to the end of King-Street, I said to the prosecutor, Let you and I go together, and the other two to come behind at about twenty yards distance. When the prisoner appeared, the prosecutor said, I believe that is the man. I said, Do not charge any man wrongfully, let him come up to us; the prisoner came past us on the left-hand, the prosecutor whispered to me, and said, That is the man: then the prisoner was between us and the other two men that came behind us. I turned and laid hold of him, and took this pistol from out of the lining of his coat: it was loaded with a large ball.</p>

I rent the house—In October last I had a young man named Stewart in my employ, as errand-boy—he had been only a week in my service, and is fourteen or fifteen years old—he dd not sleep in my house—I have a shop which is closed by outside shutters—on Thursday, the 5th of November, I wanted to use my writing-desk, which used to stand in the parlour window, behind the shop, and it was miss<lb></lb>ing—this was about ten o'clock, or half-past ten—I told Stewart what I wanted—I went to the station-house, and brought an officer—my desk con<lb></lb>tained the property stated in the indictment—the prisoner was never in my employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday afternoon, on the 5th of November, I went with Stewart to No. 7, Kelso-place, Paddington, where the prisoner lodged—Stewart pointed it out to me—the prisoner was not at home—I went to Peter-street, Saffron-hill, and saw the prisoner—Stewart pointed him out to me, and he immediately ran into the Bull's Head public-house—I followed him, and found him seated there behind the bar-door—I told him I wanted him for robbing Mr. Bailey—he said he knew nothing at all about the robbery—I searched him, and found sixteen sovereigns in his watch-fob, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in his waistcoat pocket—I asked him if he knew the boy who was with me—he said he knew nothing at all about him—I then asked him how he became possessed of the property which I found on him—he said he had picked it up in the street that morning—I took him to the station-house, and as we went, he said it would be all <hi rend="italic">goose</hi> with him this time—I have heard that phrase many a time, and understood him to mean he should be transported, and shortly after he told me he did not think Stewart knew so much of him as he did—he had said before, that he had never seen him—he had got on a new pair of shoes and stockings at the time, and a silk handkerchief—I asked him when he bought the shoes—he said about a week before—I ap<lb></lb>prehended two girls on suspicion of the same robbery, and when he was in the lock-up place he heard their voices, and hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Eggy,</hi> is it you?"—she answered, "Yes, me and <hi rend="italic">Flash Bet, nailed</hi> for your concern"—he then told them to keep it all <hi rend="italic">dark,</hi> and not to <hi rend="italic">come it,</hi> and he would get them <hi rend="italic">turned up.</hi>

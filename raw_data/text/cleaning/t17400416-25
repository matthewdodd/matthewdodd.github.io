The Glasses were hung, one on each side this Gentleman's Shop Door: the Prisoner and I took them away, and sold them to one Mrs Barefoot, in Norman's Court , in Cable-street, near Well-Close-Square, for half a Guinea. I am positive the Prisoner was concerned with me, in this Robbery; and there was another young Man (one Irish Jack,) with us, at the same Time. Irish Jack, (who was a big Fellow,) took down one of the Glasses, and gave it me, to carry home; and while I was carrying it home, Irish Jack and the Prisoner brought the other Glass after me. I was just got in with the one Glass, when they came in with the other. I did not see them take the other Glass, but I saw them bring it home after me, and we were all concerned together. They themselves asked me to go out a-thieving with them. <rs id="t17400416-25-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

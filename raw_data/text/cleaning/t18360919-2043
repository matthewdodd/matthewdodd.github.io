                  </hi>. I am a breeches-maker, in partnership with Richard James of Clifford-street, Bond-street. On the evening of the 24th of August I was in my shop, and heard a footstep, and saw the prisoner leaving the shop—I watched her, to see which way she went, but being alone, I returned, and called the servant maid to mind the shop; and on looking to my left, where the clothes generally hung on a brass-rail. I ob<lb></lb>served the rail was bare, and missed the articles stated in the indictment—I overtook the prisoner, and passed her—I observed what she had got under her arm—I stopped them—some people came round—one went for the policeman, and we gave her in charge—these are the goods which we missed, and which were found on the pavement.</p>

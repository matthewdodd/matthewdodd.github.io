                  </hi>. I live in New Church-street, Padding ton. In Sept. last I was employed as agent to let a house at No. 45, Bedford-place, near Bayswater—Davis saw me on the subject in the early part of Sept.—I let him the house by the year—the rent was 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, to commence on the 29th of Sept.—I had a man near the spot, who had the key, and who gave it to him—he described himself as an artist, and referred me to Mr. Hubbert, No. 12, George-yard—I went there, and saw a person who called himself Hubbert.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and carry on business with George Rogers, in St. George's-place, Hyde-park. On the 19th of Sept. Davis ordered some goods to be sent to No. 45, Bedford-place—he gave me his card, and said he had taken the house on a five years' lease; his wife was in York-shire; but in the course of a week he would bring her to select some more goods—in consequence of what he said, I sent some carpets into the house on the 22nd, and on the 28th I sent a glass there by Triphook, in consequence of a message brought to me by Sharman—it was a stock glass, used as a patten—it was only to show the style of it—there was no price or bill of parcels sent—I saw it next on the 5th of Oct., at Mr. King's, in Holborn—I got the duplicate from a woman, who went by the name of Waddilove, at No. 1, Chapel-place, Borough—it was a very small house, one story above and one below, a very different house to that in Bedford-place—I went there on Tuesday, the 5th of Oct.—this is my glass.</p>

I received directions from my master to go to No. 45, Bedford-place—it was a respectable-looking house—I saw a servant, called William—after that I was putting down some carpets, and Davis desired me to measure the chimney-piece, to have a glass put in hand for it—I measured it, and brought the order home for it—my master had not a glass of the size ordered—I went next day to complete the laying down of the carpets—I saw Davis there, Waddilove, William, and a female called Mary—William invited me down stairs to take something—when I got to the kitchen I found Mary and Waddi-love—Waddilove said he had come to invite Mary, his sister-in-law, to a christening—Mary said she could not go, she expected her young mistress home from Yorkshire, but they could come to her on Sunday, and if her mis<lb></lb>tress had not come home, they could come into the house, and spend the evening there—William said his master had just married a young lady, worth 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether Waddilove heard it, but he was there—he was tipsy at the time—William said there would be furniture wanted for the drawing-room—in consequence of what passed, I desired to know from Davis, through William, whether it would be desirable to look at a pattern glass—he appeared to go up, and come down—he said Mr. Davis would wait at home till half-past nine o'clock to-morrow morning—Davis then had a fine head of black hair—whether it was a wig or not I cannot say—it appeared to be kept in very good order.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Dear—we are upholster<lb></lb>ers. We received an order from Davis—on the 30th of Sept. I went to No. 45, Bedford-place—the house was shut—I could not get in—there was a bill up to let it, and it appeared to me to be empty—on the 4th of Oct. I went with a policeman to a small house in Chapel-place, Borough, with two rooms, no<lb></lb>thing like the house in Bedford-place—I knocked at the door, and Waddilove appeared—I said, "I believe Mr. Davis is here; I want to see him on a charge of taking a looking-glass of mine"—Waddilove said, "He is not here, and you shan't come in"—I put one foot in the door to prevent its being shut—he tried to shut me in between the door and door-post, but, with the assistance of a policeman, I forced myself in—I said I would search the house for Davis, as I believed him to be there—Waddilove said, "By God, nobody shall go up stairs"—we had a very severe scuffle together—he tried to get me by* the throat—I forced his hand from there—he seized my coat, tore it, struck me on my breast, and broke my watch glass—I forced my way from him, got up stairs, and saw Davis—I called to the officer that Davit was there, and begged him to come and take him—Waddilove had the tongs in his hand, trying to strike the policemen with them, and they were holding him at the time—he said, "Davis is my master, I will protect him to the last moment of my existence"—he said he had never been to No. 45, Bedford-place, Bays water, and did not know where it was—I saw Mrs. Waddilove there—I saw Davis pass something small over to her.</p>

I went to the door, and saw nobody: I went to see if the till was safe, and it was gone; then I desired a neighbour to call stop thief, he did, and the prisoner was taken in about a quarter of an hour, and brought to my shop by

            . On Monday night, the 20th of January, I was walking along Addle-street, at the end of Philip-lane, I saw the prisoner and another man running together, the other man had the till, or drawer; I looked very earnestly at him as he passed me: there came a little boy, and said they had stole a till; they turned up on the left hand, one went one way, the other another. I followed the prisoner, he went up Frying-pan alley, I took him in Staining-lane, and brought him back to Mrs. Dunbar. The other was a young fellow with his hair tied behind.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was going on duty at half-past six o'clock on Sunday morning, and saw about twenty-five people about the Crown, making a disturbance - I went up to them, and saw the prisoner with this hat just stuck on his head; it did not seem to fit - I took it off, and asked where he got it; he said, "What is that to you?" I asked the maker's name, and the colour of the lining; he said he could not tell - I was taking him to the station; he ran away - another Policeman took him; he was dressed in a flannel jacket.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been all night at a wake - a man came and asked me to buy a hat; I gave him 4s. for it.</p>

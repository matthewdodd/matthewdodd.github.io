On the 23rd of April, about five or ten minutes before four o'clock in the morning, I saw Cavannah and Matthew Pearson standing in White's-alley, within a yard of No. 6—about ten minutes afterwards I saw Cavannah come out of the next door with a bundle under his arm—there is a passage leading to the back of No. 6, and he came out of that passage—he saw me and threw down the things, and made his escape—I had frequently seen him loitering about the same spot, and know him to be the man—I returned, and took up the articles he bad thrown down—I afterwards went to fetch Mrs. Collins from another house, and she went with me to No. 6—the street door was fastened and we could not get in—we got in in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, by pulling down the shutter—I went to the room on the first floor and found the lock broken right off—in the course of the morning I saw Margaret Pearson coming out of her lodging in a court close by—she had got a gown under her apron—I followed and took her into custody—I had seen her hand a gown to her mother in Little White's-alley—on the 25th I apprehended Matthew Pearson at Scott's coffee-house, but found nothing on him—on the 1st of May I apprehended Cavannah in Gray's Inn-lane—I have the bundle which I had seen him drop—I have seen the prisoners in company several times, and knew them to be acquainted—Pearson lives about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor—I had teen nothing of Margaret Pearson that night—it was about half-past twelve o'clock when I saw her give the gown to her mother.</p>

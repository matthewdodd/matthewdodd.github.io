            . I lodge at the Crown and Sceptre public-house. On the morning of the 2d of September I was in Mr. Thacey's garden. I saw the prisoner and another person in a garden adjoining the prosecutor's - one of them had a bundle in his arm, but I am not certain which; for as soon as they saw me they both ran off - they left the bundle in Mr. Saul's garden - I saw the prisoner's back, so as to know him again - they got over a fence and a gate - the other got over it, but the prisoner broke it down - I was not then above three feet from him - I had kept my eye on him from the first moment I saw him till he got to the gate, except in going round a corner - I opened a gate which led into East-street, and saw him running very fast - Adams stopped him - we took him to the watch-house, and I took the watchman to the place where I first saw him, where we found the bundle which is here produced - it appeared to be the same which I had seen the man first carrying.</p>

In consequence of information last March, I went to Mr. Duggin's house at Cork, and found the prisoner in the first-floor room there—I asked her name—she said, "Maria Williams"—I told her to consider herself my prisoner, and to be cautious what she said, for if she said any thing to criminate herself, I should have to state it—there was a large box, and a small trunk on the floor—I asked if they were hers—she said, "Yes"—I asked if what they contained was hers—she said "Yes"—I asked for the key—she gave it me—I opened one—I found three gold chains, a gold key, three gold rings, a gold brooch, a pair of ear-rings, some silver spoons, a reticule, eight shawls, a gold watch and case, and a variety of other articles—I asked if she bad got a watch—she said she had a brass one, and produced it from her bosom—I also found some parts of tea spoons, with the initials T. A. B., which have been filed—I told her I should fetch a woman to search her—she said she had no money—I put my hand in her pocket, and found 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Bank of Ireland notes—I took her to the station—I showed all the pro<lb></lb>perty to the prosecutor—I found a quantity of plate at Mr. Bennet's, in Grafton-street, which Mr. Holden claimed—I took her to Dublin—on the way, she asked me whether it would be better for her to plead guilty or not—I told her I should give her no advice on that subject.</p>

I was obliged <hi rend="italic">to go</hi> up the country for a few days, and during that time I left the key of my room with the landlady of the house, in Cross-street, Cork, and on my return, I found one of my trunks opened, and the other had every thing removed; and the piece of paper alluded to, respecting Mr. Bennett, was in my box, but not with my putting. Mr. Holden, likewise, accuses me with being his servant for three months, and that I had warning to quit; I never was his nor any other gentleman's servant in my life. In July, I went from London to Cork, by the boat called the <hi rend="italic">Mermaid,</hi> from Black water Stairs; returned in the latter end of August by the same boat; on the 26th of November, from St. James's Stairs, Wapping, back to Cork again, in the <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> boat, Captain Warters, com<lb></lb>mander; in March returned to London, in the <hi rend="italic">Devonshire,</hi> Captain Hig<lb></lb>gen, commander, and back again by the same boat, and the same captain to Dublin, and changed two thirty shillings notes, the change given to me by the steward of the boat, in the presence of Mr. Burns. I arrived at Dublin at ten o'clock at night, and Mr. Burnes, the mate of the vessel, recommended me to a lodging at the house of Mr. Jones, opposite the quay where the boat stopped; I remained there for a few days, until the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi> was going to Cork, by which vessel I went. Respecting the Irish constable's statement, the confession, he says, that I made to him, it is quite false, for I well remember every word that I said to him."</p>

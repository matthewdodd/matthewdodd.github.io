               <p>I am a watchman; I saw the two prisoners and another in Brick-street, on the 26th of January, a little after two in the morning; it was a very moon-light morning; these men were putting this window-guard into a cellar, and ran away, and a woman said, you are catched, you are catched; they said, no, it was only the watchman; they should make it up with the watchman: it was a little distance from the prosecutor's house; they ran away from the iron, seeing me, and they came back again; they were all together, near this woman's house; I did not see them put the iron down; I saw an iron window-guard after they ran away; I think there were half a dozen bars in it; I took it up, and put it against the side of a house; and they all three came back, and asked me what I was going to do with it; and the two prisoners took it from the side of the house, whilst I had one part in my hand, and they threw it on the dunghill, and said it was theirs; they then asked me to have some beer; and he that is not present, laid hold of my hand, and told me, if I made any noise, they should fall out with me; and Lichfield gave 6 d. to that person to give to me, and I would not have it; Penny followed me, and I laid hold of him; and he swore he would run his knife into my guts; I then saw Lichfield coming towards him, and I let him go, and took the iron and ran on, and they followed me; I sprang my rattle, and they ran away; I knew the prisoners before.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand you that you was going home, did you go back again? - I walked a little way out of the way for home while she was telling her story; when she robbed me I was just standing still, I was talking to her; this was in Holborn.</p>

I have been under the doctor's hands ever since I have been in Newgate; likewise the prosecutor struck me before I struck him; I knew him about five or six months before.</p>

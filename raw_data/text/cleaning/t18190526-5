            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 14th of May, Claxton informed me of the robbery, and said he had lost his trunk - the prisoner's husband kept the house. She denied all knowledge of it; she said he had taken his chest and trunk away in a coach. I was sent for to the house again soon after, and the trunk was produced on the table - Claxton had a plane in his hand and a bunch of keys; he unlocked the trunk and missed the 10 l. note; I took the prisoner into another room, and told her that I must search her very particularly. She then took a 10 l. note from her pocket, and said it was a 1 l. note which she had found in the room the night before; it was No. 4953, dated April 22, 1819.</p>

             re-examined. I had taken my chest away in the morning, but left my trunk behind. Before I fetched Haines, I asked her for my trunk - she said I had taken it away; after Haines left, she herself produced the trunk to me; I had left a plane in it, which I found in a woman's hand in the house. The prisoner had a bunch of keys in her hand; I took them from her, and found that one of them opened my trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I had been drinking a little, but was not intoxicated - I did not open my trunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was drunk the night before, opened his trunk, and then threw all his things into the middle of the room.</p>

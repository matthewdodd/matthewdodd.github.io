I was sent for the same night; I found the desk broken open, and my things taken away; the packages were not as I had left them. - I have found every thing but the seal.

I have the care of the upper part, over Mr. Haigh's warehouse, and keep the keys; I go there every evening to see that all is secure, and to fasten the outer door. I went there on the 25th of November, about half-past ten o'clock - I was going to open the door, but there seemed an obstruction inside; I tried to open it three times; hearing a noise in the passage I turned the latchkey down, to prevent anybody coming out, and then called, through the key-hole, "Is anybody inside?" I received no answer - nobody sleeps there. I then called the watchman three times; Willsher, the officer, came over, and waited outside - I got several persons to assist; I entered the house at the private door, with two or three officers; Willsher stood at the private door - I heard glass break, and when I got in I saw Mr. Haigh's warehouse-door open - it ought to have been shut; the first-floor window was open, and four panes of glass were broken in the sky-light, which is under it - they were quite safe that morning; the leads by the sky-light lead from the window to a small yard of the house - persons could let themselves down from those leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How high are those leads? A. As high as the first-floor, but there is a projection where they could have rested.</p>

            . I am an officer of Cheap Ward, and live in Little Bell-alley, Coleman-street. On the 25th of November, between ten and half-past ten o'clock, I heard Watkins give an alarm; I immediately went to the door of No. 12, Bucklersbury, listened, and heard persons in the passage - I went to the warehouse door, and held it fast; I found it shake - they were endeavouring to get out there; I went over to the Green Man public-house, and called Hawkins to assist, and then went to the watch-house, for further assistance, returned, and heard two distinct smashes of glass; Hawkins went to the door of No. 11, and got admission; the prisoners were taken - their hands were cut, as if by glass - I went into the premises, and found Mr. Haigh's door was broken open by great force - I found a bag there, containing four shawls, with printed borders, and two pieces of cotton print - the desk and a trunk were also broken open, and I found a phoshorus box, a dark-lantern, and a jemmy or crow-bar.</p>

I pulled Jones through the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You live at the dining-room? A. Yes. Nos. 10 and 11 are both dining-rooms - there is no communication to the yard from No. 10. I suppose we dine one hundred and seventy persons every day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect either of the prisoners dining there? A. No; Jones' hands were dirty and bleeding - he said, "See what a condition I am in;" the window I drew him through was not broken. I did not go into the yard to see if any glass was broken.</p>

The skylight is on the leads, and there were marks on the wall, down the leads, of plaster having been scraped off, as if persons had let themselves down into the yard.

I got up and found a cabinet in the parlour broke open, and the things mentioned in the indictment missing. I went to see which way they got into the house, and found by scratches on the inside of the wall, a person had got over that, and down a funnel where I put my coals into the cellar, and from thence into the house. I immediately sent my sister to the prisoner's lodgings to enquire whether she was at home; she returned and said she had been informed there she came in at about four in the morning. I got a warrant, and had her before Justice Lediard; she could not give an account where she had been, but at first denied knowing of the things; she was committed for farther examination. On the Sunday my sister went to her lodging to see if she had hid any of the things; she is here and will give an account of it. The prisoner was re-examined and was shewed the things mentioned, except the gold case of the watch and a handkerchief. (The goods produced in court and deposed to.) Then the prisoner confessed taking them, and that the gold case was in a closet in the room where she lodged: the constable, I, and others, went there and found it as she had said; she gave me the key of her box, in which she said was a gause handkerchief, which I found accordingly; she said she was alone in it, that she got a chairman's horse on which they carry their goods, from whence she got over the wall, and down the funnel into the house, and took the things.</p>

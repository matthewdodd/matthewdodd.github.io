                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. William Cater, a master, living at Ware, in Hertfordshire. His barges go to Wick's wharf, on the rivet Lea, once or twice a week—he sends up his corn to London, through Wick's wharf, and from thence it is sent out in sacks—Truman and Callow were employed there—the waggons are loaded from the barges late at night sometimes, and it remains on the wharf all night—we do not have any body on the wharf to watch it—it goes away in the morning, sometimes by four or five o'clock—it would be the duty of Truman and Callow to go with it to shoot it out—they live near the wharf—during April and March we sent from Ware to Lea Bridge many quarters of malt—we had recently before that purchased 600 new sack—they were warked was on the top, and a dot resembling a star, but it did not fill up well On the 13th of March, we had occasion to bring 600 quarters of malt to Messrs. Barclay's, the brewers—and after the sacks had returned, we had them counted, and missed five of them, and we have the same, number now, we still miss five;—Truman and Callow were working at Wick's at the time the sacks were returned—I have since seen five sacks in possession of the officer; they are my master's—they are marked as master's, and they were tied with a hank knot—I have examined these five sacks; they have been untied and tied again—the malt very much resembles my master's.</p>

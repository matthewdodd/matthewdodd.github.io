            . (policeman). On the evening of the 12th of November, I met the two prisoners in Upper Seymour-street; they both had bundles; it was about ten minutes before ten o'clock - Preston went up to a door in Seymour-street and said to Hannibell, "This is No. 47;" I crossed over on the other side, and followed them down the street, into Portman-street; one went on one side of the street, and the other on the other; when they came to Oxford-street, Hannibell kept on the left hand, and Preston went on the right; I saw McLean speak to him; I then crossed over and asked Hannibell where he had come from? he said, "From Notting-hill;" Mrs. Savage's house is at Notting-hill; I asked where he was going to - he said, "To the Tower," - I asked if he knew the young man who was with him just now with the bundle - he said, he did and called out "George"- I said, we would go over to him, and not call him over; we went over to him and McLean had him in custody; we took them down to the watch-house, and in the way to the watch-house, I asked Hannibell what he had got there - he said, he did not know - I asked where he got them from - he said, he found them in Edgware-road; I had not then opened the bundles; when I got to the watch-house, I opened the bundles and found one counterpane in a handkerchief, and a counterpane in an apron in Hannibell's bundle; there was nothing else in his bundle; I found a flint steel, a match, and two keys on Hannibell; one of them was a latch key, the other a common box key; I also found on him a bag; it dropped from under his clothes, while I was searching him; there was nothing in it - that is all I found on him - I saw the other bundle opened - there was a reticule in it, also two waistcoats, a counterpane, a pair of small clothes, a piece of figured silk, a shirt, and the skirt of a merino gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of night was it? A. Very foggy; I do not remember whether it had been wet; the roads were not dry - there was a damp from the fog - there were a number of link-boys in Oxford-street; I did not go further; I believe it was such a fog a man might have been one hundred yards off with a link and I not see him - I do not know what parish the house is in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what Mrs. Savage's husband was? A. A physician; the house in Berner's-street is the house they used to live in when Dr. Savage was living; she has never lived there since he died; she lived at her mother's - there were two bills put up to let the house in Holland-park.</p>
               <p>Hannibell's Defence. On the 12th of November, we were lighting a gentleman's horse and chaise, down Notting-hill. I kicked against the bundle. I said to Preston, "George, here is a bundle;" we looked about and found another bundle, and four forks.</p>

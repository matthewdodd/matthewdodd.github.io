            , the prisoner's brother; he was tried here for bigamy. The prisoner was present at the marriage; he gave his brother away at my father's house, in marriage to my sister, at Cashel. They were married by a Catholic priest; my sister is a Catholic.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you came to this country - A. I came last May. I believe I am about nineteen years old; my birth-day is some time in 
               <persName id="t18220911-135-person1301">August. My</persName>
             parents tell me that is about my age.</p>
               <p>Q. The marriage took place in 1815 - you were then about twelve years old - A. Twelve, or upwards. The marriage was in June, in the afternoon, after dinner, about dusk - we generally dine about five. I do not think the priest dined there - he lived in the same street. I generally go to bed about ten o'clock. There was no feast, only our own family were present. There was a party next night, my sister Eliza and Mrs. Conden were present - she is rather older than

             I cannot mention every body who was present; my father was there - he is dead; my two sisters; my brother-in-law O'Carney - he is dead; and there was Mrs. Stapleton, a cousin of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Why could you not as well have told us at first that your cousin Stapleton was present - A. I did not recollect it. I have not given the subject much consideration, except that I want to get home; it is with the greatest reluctance that I appear here.</p>
               <p>Q. What claim have you and your sister put in for your expences on this and the last trial - is it not upwards of 300 l. - A. I believe it is, travelling expences, the voyage, loss of time, and all; I have been detained here since May; I mind my mother's business at home; she is in the wine and spirit trade, and deals in hides; we also retail spirits. The most respectable houses in Ireland sell retail. We were not in the public line at the time of the marriage. There was wine and punch drank. I went to bed, and the marriage was much more than an hour before that.

Mrs. Stapleton was not asked to come over here; I believe her age was about twenty at the time; she lives at Tipperary. I did not dine at the table - I might run in and out at dinner time. I do not think the priest dined there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect any remuneration for what you have done here? - A. I expect the amount of my bill.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The second wife's father agreed to pay the expences of you and your sister's coming here - A. Yes; we do not expect to be paid for giving evidence. My mother constantly keeps one man servant, and sometimes has five or ten employed in the gardens. I was in and out of the room at the time of the marriage; and what has happened since it took place I cannot say.</p>

We went into the front room; we missed three yards and a half of new cloth out of the window; we missed from the sofa two gowns, a buff shawl, and a pink frock; we had seen them all there about an hour before.

            . I am servant to Mr. Pike. I was making my mistresses bed on the Wednesday, I heard somebody come in at the street door; I asked who was there; Mrs. Welch answered me; the girl came into the two pair, where I was; she asked for the name of Mrs. Cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come into the room where you was - A. No; she came into the passage; I met her in the passage; I told her no Mrs. Cotton lived there; I went into the room and finished making the beds. In about five minutes afterwards I went down stairs; I missed the belcher handkerchief off the stairs; I called to Mrs. Welch and asked her whether she had taken it; she said no; I went into the first floor; I missed the cloth out of the window, and I missed a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw the gown - A. Yes; on Saturday, in my mistress's stall.</p>
               <p>- I was headborough of the parish of Christ's Church at the time this transaction took place. On the 7th of May, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for by Mr. Pike to take the prisoners into custody; I conducted them to the watchhouse; when I got them to the watchhouse I took the gown and handkerchief off the elder prisoner; I asked her where she got them from; she said that the daughter told her a bargain was to be bought in Wentworth-street, of a woman of the the name of Mrs. Wells; I went from one end of Wentworth street to the other, no such person could be found; I took also two boxes from the prisoner, containing thirty duplicates, nine leading to this property. At the prisoners lodgings I found another gown and shawl; the elder prisoner told me this gown and shawl belonged to the servant of the prosecutor, I should find it there; she told me she had bought them of Mrs. Wells for ten shillings. The mother said she had been drawn in by the child recommending her to the bargain.</p>

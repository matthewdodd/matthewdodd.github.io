On Easter Sunday Morning I missed about nine feet long and two feet wide, of a lead gutter, affixed to my workshop, called a melting-house; at nine o'clock on Saturday night, I saw it was all safe; when I was first before the Justice, I could not positively swear to it, but it was brought up the next day, and I saw it fitted, and I am now very well satisfied it is my property.</p>

               <p>On Easter Sunday morning the 24th of April, I was going up Vine-street, Clerkenwell, and I saw the prisoner with a bag on his shoulder; I suspected him, and followed him to Turnmill-street, and got up to him in Turnmill-street, and said to him, my friend, what have you got on your shoulder? and he would not answer me just then; then I spoke to the person that was in company with me to open that bag; he did; his name is

               <p>Had it the appearance of lead that belonged to a gutter? - Yes, I was up on the place, and tried it, and it exactly agreed; and I think it was positively taken from that building.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what day was these copper staken. - A. On the 22nd of May I had seen them there; three or four days before they were in a fixed state; one was in the back kitchen and the other was in the front kitchen; about seven o'clock on Friday morning I heard a noise in No. 20; it being an empty house I took the keys to go and see that every thing was right; I tried the latch, I heard that unfasten, but the lock would not open; I am certain that four or five days before I fastened the house, and nobody had been in but me; finding I could not get in I went back to No. 21, I went of a short message into St. Alban's street, I got a few yards from the house, I saw the prisoner with the two coppers upon his right shoulder; in the other hand he had got a basket, which contained a crow and a small saw, and some pick lock keys; I turned round and stopped him; I asked him where he was going with these coppers, he said he was going home with them, his master had sent him for them; I told him he must go back with me, I was confident they belonged to our house; he neither told me who was his master, nor where he was going to take them to, nor did I ask him. After I turned him round he put the two coppers on the second step of No. 20, the house they were taken from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had taken them from. - A. No, nor did I ask him; he kept the basket in his hand. I took him into the passage of No. 21.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master at home then. - A. He was; I told him that I had stopped the prisoner with two coppers belonging to No. 20.</p>

By no means; he acknowledged that he had taken them from that house; he said if I would forgive him he would send for one of the best workmen, and put them up in the tastiest way I could wish; I said nothing more to him, than that if he moved from the place I would shoot him.</p>

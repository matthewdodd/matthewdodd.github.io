On the 13th of September he left my master, and went to Hammersmith; the day following I missed my money; I went to enquire after him at Hammersmith, and heard he was gone to London in the coach. On the 15th I went to London after him, and met with him accidentally in Oxford street, in the Worcester stage; I took him and brought him to Mr. Shear's, the turnpike house at Kensington Gravel Pits, and sent for my master; my master came and asked him what he had done with my money; he said he had bought some clothes with part of it; the rest he had in his pocket; he gave what money he had about him to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that?</p>
               <p>Toy. About twenty-two pounds; he said before the Justice the boot was tumbled down and he took it out of the room; the clothes he had bought with part of the money he had on; he had a hat, a thickset coat, and a pair of breeches all new, and a pair of silver shoe buckles, and a watch; he owned they were all bought with part of my money. I can swear to one of the half crowns that was found upon him. I have had it in my care fifteen years; it has a stroke like an eye on the head side. (He points it out.)</p>

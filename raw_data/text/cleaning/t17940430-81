On the 24th of last April, I happened to meet the prisoner accidentally in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner before you traced any of your things? - I did. I met her in Monmouth-street carrying some liquor, she lived then at the Yorkshire Grey, in Little White Lion-street, Seven Dials; a public house; when I met her, I followed her up to the door and asked her, where do you live now? she made answer and said, who are you? I said I will go home with you; she said she would not go home; I then took her to Bow-street, and there she denied that she knew me, or any thing of me; I I went home, and my wife came, and two or three of the customers, and they knew her likewise; there was some of the property on her when she was searched. a handkerchief about her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silk handkerchief or a muslin? - I am not a judge, but the property is in court.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thomas. It is a muslin handkerchief</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Thomas. Was any thing else found on her besides this muslin handkerchief? - Not of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. She lived with you some time; have you any doubt at all about her person? - Not the least at all; for the other things there is a person that the magistrates thought proper to commit as a receiver, but we could not get the indictment this sessions.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of last month being Thursday, Mr. Thomas put the prisoner at the bar into my charge, on account of that I searched the prisoner and found this handkerchief on her neck, which Mr. Thomas owns as his property.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thomas. Here is my name on it.</p>
               <p>Delafontaine. I had orders to go to different people, inconsequenceof that, the girl told me that Fishbourn was her father, but he denied that, I requested to know what duplicates Fishbourn had got about him? I found about two hundred, but he informed me of this girl and told me that he was not her father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with Mr. Thomas about six weeks, when I lived there this young woman came to me and asked me if I could let her have any money? I said I could not; she asked me if I had any thing that I could make any money of? I told her no; and then she asked me if I had got any thing that I could pawn for her, I told her no; and if I had I did not know how I should get it out again; and she urged me for something to make up two shillings to get out something that she had pawned of a young man's, this was Monday, and she got this silk handkerchief of me on Wednesday, and promised to get it out again on Saturday. My master and mistress and I, had a few words, and I slipt over to this girl's house and asked her if she could not get that handkerchief out that she had to pawn? she said she could not get it me; I asked her what it was in for? she said three shillings, and I offered her part of the money to get the handkerchief out if she would but replace it, she said she had none but she would see what she could do, she did not get it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy, in the employ of Mr. Slinn, boot and shoemaker, 103, High Holborn. On Monday, 15th Oct., about nine o'clock at night, I left my master's shop to take out some work—I left the door quite secure and locked—I left no one in the shop—I returned about a quarter to ten, and found the door open—I pushed it wide open, and two young men came out—the prisoner is one—he said, "Is your master at home?"—I said, "No"—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand, hit me a blow in the chest, and ran up Hatton-garden—the other man ran down Holborn-hill—I ran after the prisoner towards Hatton-garden, crying out, "Stop thief! "and Williams came up and stopped him about 100 yards from my master's shop—I then went back to the shop with Cagford, and found this black bag (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), with boots in it, just inside the shop door—I then went to the station, returned again, and found this white bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) very nearly under the window, inside the shop—the bags were opened at the station—the black one contained twelve pairs of boots and one odd one, eight pairs of shoes and one odd one; and in the white bag there were eleven pairs of boots and one odd one—they all belong to the master—when I left the shop the window was full of boots, and when I came back it was all cleared out—I found a parcel on the counter containing leather, of the same kind as my master had, and which was hanging on the nails when I went out—I had no light—there are lights in the street, and next door there is a public-house where there are two lamps.</p>

I was four or five yards from Mr. Sunn's shop, and saw the two men come out of the shop—I am sure the prisoner is one of them—I did not see him strike Shirley—he ran up Hatton-garden—I ran after him, stopped him, and Adams came up immediately.</p>

             (Police-constable N 63). The prosecutor called me to his house on the 1st of August - I found the prisoner and his brother there; I took charge of them; in going along, I said to the prisoner, that it was a pity - he said he knew he had robbed his father, and he would do so again, for he ought to keep him.</p>

I came home from work, and there was nobody at home; I went by Mr. Barrows' beershop, and saw my father in the bar - I then went past again, and Mrs. Barrows said to me, "Nathaniel, your father is asleep in our room;" I then went and took a walk, and when I came back, he was asleep on the step of the door; I shook him, but he did not awake; I went and took a walk again till eleven o'clock - my father had just then gone in doors - I went to go in, but he shoved me out, and shut the door in my face; he is not worthy the name of a father.</p>

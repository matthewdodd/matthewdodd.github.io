On Sunday, the 15th of September, I was at Bunhill-row station-house on duty, I received information, and went with Mr. Murch, the prosecutrix's brother-in-law, into Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner going along the street - I knew her from a description I had of her, and secured her - I took this box from under her right arm; there was nothing in it then. On searching her, I found these articles in her bosom - she was better than a mile from Percival-street - I thought she might be there, having been told her friends were Irish people - it was about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

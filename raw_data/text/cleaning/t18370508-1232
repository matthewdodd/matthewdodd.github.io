I had a blue bag with grocery in it—I placed it on a cask in the shop at the door—when I had been in a short time and was coming out I missed my bag—it con<lb></lb>tained the articles stated in the indictment—the cask was inside the shop, not near the door—I got information from a boy, and went down Cow<lb></lb>cross-street, and the prisoner was taken in a public-house, about a stone's throw off—the value of the contents of the bag was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father in Peter and Key-court, Peter-lane, Cow-cross. On Friday, the 7th. of April, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Russell's shop, with along coat down, on to his knees, and no bag—he came out with a blue bag in his hand, and the string in his mouth—he ran into Three Horse-Shoe-court, went into a house, and came down again with another coat on, and had left the bag—he returned in about five minutes—I did not speak to him—he came down and caught hold of a boy by the nose, and turned him round—we were all standing together, about four yards from Mr. Russell's shop—he then went down Cow-cross, and then I saw Mr. Parrett look at the door—I said, "Have you lost anything?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "There is the boy"—the pri<lb></lb>soner ran through Sharp's-alley, into a public-house in West-street—I am sure he is the person.</p>

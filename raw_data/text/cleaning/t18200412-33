On Wednesday night, the 29th of March, about a quarter before eight o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see a gold seal; I was alone, and refused to shew them any. They then asked to look at some gold keys? and I shewed them four; they took them up, and asked the price of them? put them down, and drew a brooch towards them, which laid by me, and asked me the price of it? I said it was not for sale. They then reached farther across to a pair of garnet ear-rings; I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't touch them, they are not what you asked for" - they then snatched up two gold keys, a brooch, and the ear-rings, and ran out. I followed them out, and there was a cry of Stop thief! but they got away; I am certain Stodhart is one, and believe Bassett to be the other, but am afraid to swear to him. They were apprehended next evening.</p>

I saw him throw the duplicate of a gold key away, which was pledged that day in the name of Bassett. I apprehended Bassett at the barracks near Buckingham Gate - he belongs to the 3d regiment of Guards. I told him that I took him on a charge of felony. He said,</p>

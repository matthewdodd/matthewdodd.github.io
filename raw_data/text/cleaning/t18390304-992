                  </hi>. I am a policeman, stationed at Staines. On Satur<lb></lb>day evening, the 16th of February, in consequence of information from Spelling's, I paid particular attention to the flock of Mr. Goring, in the Lammas-field—I went out, about half-past ten o'clock that night, with Lee—Taylor, our inspector, had given directions to Mr. Goring to have his sheep counted—about eleven o'clock that night I saw Giblett go into the White Lion, which is a quarter of a mile from Church-street, and saw him come out about ten minutes after eleven o'clock, with Frake, Duffin, and three others—Frake and Duffin saw me, and began to whisper together—they afterwards parted, and Frake called out to somebody, "Half-past eight in the morning"—they made answer, "It's all right," and parted—Frake crossed the road towards me, in the town—Giblett kept on the other side of the way, and went up the town, the same way as I did—Duffin went quite the contrary way—I watched Frake up the town—he went down Tilley's-lane, leading to where he lives—that is in a direction from London to Staines, leading towards Church-street, and so to Colebrook-lane—I walked about the end of Tilley's-lane, and waited there a few minutes, expecting he would come up again—he came up, and by that time Duffin had got up, and met him at the top of the lane—they went on, I followed them along to the end of Church-street, to High-street, that is in a straight line to Lammas-field, and about a quarter of a mile from it—I met Taylor, and told him what I had seen—I and Lee went the back way to the Lammas ground, and waited there for Taylor—we found out where the sheep were in the field, and watched them until a quarter past one o'clock—they were at that time in an undisturbed state—at a quarter past one o'clock we came away, and Lee went home—I went up the town with Taylor, and remained in the town a little time to see that ell was quiet—about two o'clock we went back again, and found the sheep as we had left them, all quiet, and in the same place—we returned again to the town, went back about half-past three o'clock, and then found that the sheep had been driven a considerable way from where they had been, across the road into another field—it is an open common there—we searched round the field, but could see nobody—we then went towards Giblett's house, at the corner of Black Boy-lane, which comes into Clarence-street and Church-street—I waited about by Giblett's house till about twilight, and at ten minutes after six o'clock, I saw Frake and Giblett coming together up Church-street, as if from the Lammas-field—Taylor was with me—we observed that Giblett had something under his coat, under his right arm—when he saw us, he seemed to try to avoid us, by going across the lane—the moment they saw us, they moved off, and tried to avoid us—when Giblett came to where he should turn to go to his own house, he went quite in a contrary direction, along the Laleham-road, and Frake went down the town, towards his own house—I went</p>

               <p>down the Laleham-road after Giblett—I lost sight of him for a second, in consequence of a projection in the road by a school—I followed, and when I got sight of him again, I found he was further a-head of me than before, he must have quickened his pace—I came up with him about a quarter of a mile down the lane—he had passed by the school-house, and by the orchard—I called, "Giblett" after him—he said, "Hollo"—I said, "Where are you going to?"—he said, "To get turnip-greens"—I said, "Do you stop out all night to get turnip-greens?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You have been out all night"—he said he had not—I said, "What were you doing in Church-street with Frake?"—he said he had not seen Frake—I then asked him what that was he had under his arm—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You had something"—he said, "You may search me if you like"—I felt down his coat, and could not find any thing—I asked him if he had got a knife—he said, "No"—I said, "What were you doing with Frake in Church-street?"—he said he had not seen Frake—I said, "I am sure I saw you come down Church-street"—he said, "You night see me, but I have not seen Frake, I came down on the moor to get turnip-greens"—I said, "Turnip-greens don't grow on the moor"—I told him to come up into the town with me, which he did—he held his hands down by the side of his coat—I said, "What is the matter with your hands?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let me look"—he put up his right-hand, and it was all over blood, back and front; the inside, and round the outside of the finger nails—the blood was quite damp, as if it had been fresh, and between the fingers also—I asked him to show me the other hand, that was all over blood also, but not so bad—I asked how he accounted for it—he said he had been dressing a sheep's head over night—I asked him where he bought the sheep's head"—he said he did not know, for his wife always went to market—I then told him I strongly suspected he had stolen one of Mr. Goring's sheep, and I should lock him up till I ascertained it, which I did—this was about ten minutes after six o'clock in the morning, between the lights—I afterwards went with Taylor to Giblett's house—I did not see Giblett's wife—I found no sheep's head there—Taylor and I then went to Frake's—we found him at home with his shoes off—I observed blood on his hands, which appeared fresh—it was noticed to him, and he laughed at it—we took him into custody, and gave information to Mr. Goring—I was present about seven o'clock that morning, when a sheep-skin, the feet, and part of the entrails was found in the Thames, which joins the Lammas-field—they had been tied toge<lb></lb>ther with string, and thrown in—a sheep's head was left with me by a young man named Denyer—I took it to Mr. Goring's, about ten o'clock that morning, and saw it compared with the skin, which was taken out of the Thames—the lip of the sheep, where there had been no wool, had been starred down—part of the flesh remained on the lip, and part on the skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Staines. On Saturday night, the 16th of February, my father had sixty-four sheep in the Lammas-field—I had been cautioned by the officers to count than—on Sunday morning, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, they were counted again, and there was one missing, which had a bell round its neck—I afterwards saw a skin found in the river—on examining it I found on it the marks by which we distinguish our sheep—I afterwards saw that compared with a head produced by Brown, a cow<lb></lb>boy—in my judgment the head had been taken from that skin—the Lam<lb></lb>mas-field is in Middlesex—there is a ditch separating the two fields, which it the division in Middlesex—it is called Shear Ditch—I afterwards found the carcase buried in a duns heap, about five hundred yards off the county—I compared it with the skin, and fitted the head on—I have not a doubt that it all corresponded—the sheep belonged to my father, John Goring—there it a deep bank to the ditch between the Lammas-field and the next field—it is impossible to get over it, but there is a gate which is not kept locked—there would be no difficulty in getting the sheep through or over that, and taking it into the field where the carcase was found—we traced the sheep by the wool all along to the gate—sheep are in the habit of remain<lb></lb>ing in the same place all night—I have no interest in the business.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you go and tell the Magistrate of this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, this is the first time I have given evidence on oath—I am a native of Staines—I had been in the public-house about four hours on the Saturday night—I left at a quarter to eleven o'clock—I was not drinking all the while.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you saw Giblett and me there on Friday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, on the Sunday morning after Simmons's sheep was lost, not Mr. Going's—I said, If you would go down in the country with me, you could go on the Monday and bring things back—I did that to keep in with you, and to know when you were going to do the deed—I never told you so but once—I have not been offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to come here—I never told any body so, or any thing of the sort.</p>

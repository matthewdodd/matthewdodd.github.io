            . I was going to the Westminster sessions a little before ten o'clock in the morning of the 22d of October; the prisoner passed me with these books in Belton-street, Long-acre; I overtook him again in Broker's-alley, and asked him where he got them; he said he bought them for 1 l. in Paternoster-row. Mr. Wright afterwards claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he purchased them of a person in the street? A. No; not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him I had some books which I had bought of a licensed hawker of books, coming from Paternoster-row; to bind, and send to a friend in the country, as a present. I told him I gave 30 s. for them, which is the full value.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. He did not say any thing of the kind - he told me and Mr. Wright that he bought them in Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>MR. WRIGHT. He only said he bought them in Pater-noster-row; I said there was not time to have brought them from there. When he got to the office he changed his story, and said of a person coming from Paternoster-row.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Toone. On Saturday the 18th of March, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to look at some ribbons, I had one customer in the shop serving with lace; I took out the ribbon drawer and put it before the prisoner, the other customer desired me to cut off some lace; in the mean time I turned my head I saw the prisoner take her hand from the drawer, and put some ribbons into her pocket; I cut her off about three quarters of a yard at three-pence halfpenny a yard and gave it to her, she paid for it, another customer came into the shop, I called out for Mr. Toone, who was in the back parlour and desired her to give me the ribbon which she had put into her pocket, she said she had no ribbon, she immediately put her hand into her right hand pocket and threw the ribbons behind her, I saw her take them out of her pocket and likewise saw her throw them down, Mr. Toone picked them up, the ribbons were given to Sapwell.</p>

            . I am a night inspector. On the 16th of September, at ten minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Bethnal-green, going towards Dog-row, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; they were driving a sow and two pigs - each of them driving; one had a stick, the other a piece of iron; I watched them for a quarter of a mile, and in Three Coltlane I went up and collared Smith - I said "Where are you going to take the pigs to, and where have you got them from?" he told me he was going to take them to Spitalfields, but he did not know where there, nor the man's name he got them from; the other prisoner heard all this; Smith said the man was to give him half a crown, but he had not given it to him; I took Smith to the watch-house, and in his right-hand pocket I found this piece of a poker; I left the pigs safe, and found the owner; Simpson did not say any thing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoners driving the pigs, and I watched them; I saw them taken, and heard the conversation which has been stated; I had seen them first, and I asked Simpson the price of them: he said they were not for sale; I followed them till I met Greenwood, and got him to assist me; I took Simpson - he said he would not be collared, and would not go with me; I said he must; he tried to resist - I saw him throw away something that looked to me like a piece of iron.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. It was I he asked if they were for sale, and now he says it was Simpson. Witness. Yes, it was him; I mistook the name - I thought he was Simpson.</p>

            . I am cook and housekeeper to Mr. Salisbury; the prisoner was in the same service; soon after he came into the service, he asked me if master had not been accused of an unnatural crime - I told him the report had been so, but I did not believe it; he said he had heard many such reports, and if he offered such a thing to him, he would make him repent it - he would make him pay for it; he said more than once, that he would make him pay for it; before he came into the service, which was on the 7th of July, (I think,) master had broken his arm, and went out of town in consequence of the accident; this conversation took place before he left town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did this conversation take place? A. I think three or four days after the prisoner came into the house - I am sure he did not come into the service before July; he remained in master's service till the 10th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did he go out of town in company with the prosecutor? A. I do not know - I have been with master nearly three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him at the time of the present charge? A. No - I lived with him four years, two years ago. and then left him - I returned in July, the prisoner and I both came the same night - I was aware such a charge had been previously made against master - I had left on account of ill-health - I did not inform master, or any body, of the conversation I had with the prisoner - I was first told to come here and give evidence, the day before yesterday - I know nothing of the bill being found in September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a word from your master, or any body, about your coming here, before last Tuesday? A. Not positively; master broke his arm on the 11th of June, I believe - I called there a few days after accidentally; and heard he wanted a servant - I had called many times since I had left him, and he had spoken to me about coming again, but I was in service; when he left town I do not know where he went; he left town with the prisoner more than once - I cannot say how many times: my master first told me I was to come here - I have not been examined by his attorney.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you not examined by some gentleman previous to coming here? A. I was asked a few questions - I do not know whether it was taken down.</p>
               <p>RICHARD ANTHONY SALISBURY. I am in the sixty-eighth year of my age, and live at No. 18, Queen-street, Edgware-road. Some years ago I was accused by a person of an attempt to commit an unnatural offence upon him - I was not brought to trial; the man's name was Tomes. About the middle of June last I broke my arm in three places, and crushed my hip - I could not turn in bed for some weeks - I keep two men servants, but at that time I had but one; he was going to leave, and I wanted additional assistance - I had seen the prisoner repeatedly before that, working in the garden of Mr. Jenkins, in the New-road, where I was in the habit of buying plants: knowing the prisoner there, I engaged him; he brought me a written character, which I knew to be true, from other circumstances; he had before that applied to me, to recommend him to another situation, and, in consequence of my accident, I engaged him for four months positively, and said, if the situation suited him, I would do something more for him - I was labouring under the effects of my indisposition all this time, and required the constant attendance of a man servant, and now I can put on my braces, but cannot button them, or my shirt, my nerves are so paralysed - I shall never have the full use of my hands again - I left town, and took the prisoner with me, not only for assistance for myself, but for recreation for him, and to introduce him to the gardens - I went to Maldon Wells, to the Well's House, which is an hotel; the prisoner went with me; this was in September. On Sunday morning, the 9th of September, I went up into my bed-room, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and to my surprise, I found him dressed for travelling, when I expected to find him in his usual morning jacket - I expressed my surprise, and he said, "Sir, to be plain with you, I must be off; if you will give me 50l. I will go off to Liverpool, and never give you any more trouble, but if you do not, I will accuse you of an unnatural crime."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain, whether Liverpool was the end of his journey? A. Not at that time; I told him he was a villain, to go to hell, and leave my presence; he immediately left the room - I was sick, and a full hour before I recovered myself - I then went down, and inquired after him; he was not to be found; I sent all my servants to seek him - I did not see him again at Maldon - I was at that time in my usual morning dress: when I put on my coat and waistcoat I found a letter in my waistcoat pocket (looking at one) - this is it; it was in the pocket of my dinner dress clothes - I can swear it is his handwriting - I had opportunities of seeing him write before - I travelled post all night, and arrived in town on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060062"></xptr>- I drove to an hotel, and next day went to my residence in town, but I went to consult my attorney as soon as I came to town - I did not sleep at home till next night; my servant presented me with this letter (looking at it) the morning after I slept in town; the direction does not look like the prisoner's writing, but the contents I have no doubt are his; I had gone to my house early on Tuesday morning, and laid down, and got up at eight o'clock; I went to Bow-street on Monday night, about the letter I received at Maldon, and then again on Tuesday, about this other letter. I remember going home on Wednesday night, the 12th of September, in company with my servant Scott; when we got to Queen-street, the watchman was going past ten o'clock; I told Scott to stop and get something, which he did; and, while I was walking by myself, I saw the prisoner; he came over the street to me, and immediately said, "Will you give me the 50l.?" I said, "Go along with you, villain! I will hold no converse with you"- I was alarmed, and the watchman was at a distance - I retreated, and saw Scott coming - I then went on, wishing to get into my own house - the prisoner came up again, and said, "If you will not give me the 50l. I will accuse you of an unnatural crime; but if you will, I will be off to Dublin, and you shall hear no more of it" - he said this in a very loud, menacing, passionate tone, the last time, but not the first - Scott was close behind me the last time, and there was a man named Smith there, I did not know him at that time, but he was coming the other way - I think he must have heard the words Morton uttered - he might have been heard across the street - I said I would give him in charge; he took to his heels, and ran down Seymour-place, and I rushed into my own house - I afterwards consulted Mr. Adams; he thought fit to get an indictment, and we went and got the bill - Mr. Smith left his address; we wrote to him, but he was not to be found then; we had a warrant against the prisoner before this: I employed people to search diligently for him; I left the business with my attorney - he was taken a long time afterwards. I had a letter from an attorney, named Woolley before he was taken. I attended at Bow-street on Saturday, the 10th of October, to identify the prisoner, but he was not there - I attended again on a Monday, in November, and saw him - I had in the mean time been in communication with the Magistrates at Bow-street, as so to attend them if I was wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say the prisoner was taken a long time after you obtained the warrant; on your oath, was he taken at all, or did he surrender? A. He did not surrender; Smith took him into custody; he is an officer, and got the warrant from the other officers - I found the bill in September - I had a warrant before that; and another after finding the bill - the Magistrate gave it to Taunton, and he let Smith have it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know the warrant never was executed? A. No; I did not desire it should not be executed - I know he was taken on the Monday - I do not believe that he voluntarily surrendered to the charge - there was an appointment made by Woolley, his attorney, to meet me there, but whether he came in custody I do not know - I did not see him come - I believe he was there before me - I did not see him till he was in the office - I believe he was in custody, but I do not know the forms of the place - I went to the Portugal hotel, Fleet-street, on coming to town - I did not sleep there, or sleep at all, I was so agitated - I passed the night partly at the hotel and partly walking up and down, and at five o'clock in the morning I got home - I had not spent much time at the hotel - I went to Bow-street on the Monday evening; I got to town about twelve o'clock on Monday morning, then went to consult my attorney, and went to Bow-street at seven o'clock in the evening, when they met - I staid there an hour at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to from Bow-street office? A. I am not certain; I went to a public-house opposite - I do not know the sign - I am a gentleman, living on my fortune - I have some times been in a common public-house- I took some coffee, and remained there perhaps half an hour - Scott was with me; he did not take coffee with me; I will not swear that - I walked homeward after that - I continued to walk homewards till twelve o'clock; it might be nine before I left the public-house - I walked up and down Portman-square - I had my reasons for not going home; I was unhappy, and walking relieved me; I was relieved in some degree at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go home at twelve o'clock? A. I did not choose it - I was unhappy, and went meditating; I was in a nervous frame of mind: that is the only reason I give for not returning home - I felt no inclination to go home - Portman-square is near my residence, but I walked up and down Edgware-road till five o'clock, and then went home - I was better at five o'clock, but not much - Scott left me in the street, I cannot recollect the precise place, probably near some of the streets turning from Oxford-street, before I got to Portman-square - he might leave me about nine o'clock, I cannot say - I paced the square several times - I got home at five o'clock; I have always the key of the area-gate - all my servants were in bed when I got home - Scott and the female servant were in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go home then? A. Because I chose; my mind was materially relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not directed by your attorney to go home as fast as you could? A. He might - the prisoner came into my service early in July - I once told him when I saw him at Jenkins' nursery, that I knew a situation that would suit him - I do not recollect telling him what situation it was - I had seen him at the nursery frequently before I told him this, and he had applied to me two or three times before I hired him, for a gardener's place - I swear that he was not an acquaintance of mine - I had seen him there, and I have recommended gardeners to some of the best places in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he introduced himself to you? A. He had come and asked me the name of plants repeatedly - he was told I was a botanist - all the men at Jenkins' know that; when he asked me to get him a situation, I said I would if I could, and about a fortnight before I hired him myself, I told him I knew of a situation which would just suit him - I do not know that I told him whose place it was; on the 6th of July I went to Jenkins', and told him I would take him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that was the situation you spoke of? A. No, but I had seen him a handy clever fellow. I said he would have to take care of the plants in my courtyard, and do a great deal in the house besides, and I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060063"></xptr>give him all the instruction in my power; that his wages would be 40l. a year, and if he behaved well, they should be 50l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, that after your decease, he would be provided for? A. I told him, at my decease, all my servants would have a sum left them, if they had continued a year with me, which, by my will they are entitled to; he told me he was in a destitute situation. I said he should have 5l. in advance, and he had a sovereign of it. I cannot recollect telling him he should have 5l. that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you had a woman making a silk waistcoat for him? A. That was afterwards. I did tell him so - he wished to have one like mine; it was soon after he came, because he had not clothes to appear in - he had clothes of every description made for him. I ordered a blue coat for him when he came into my service, He brought some plants home to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he brought them into your parlour, did you not tell him to try on the silk waistcoat? A. I cannot tell - there were two silk waistcoats; which do you mean?</p>
               <p>Q. Which did he try on when he came to you with plants, as the servant of a market-gardener? A. That was the blue one.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion did you give him 5l.? A. I believe I might. I do not know whether I gave him the first or second - he had 10l. in advance. I have no garden at my house - there are between two and three hundred plants in pots; every upper servant I have had used to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the name of one? A. The last man I had turned out insane; James Crawley, who is now with Lord Foley used to take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of July, did you give the prisoner a brooch? A. Yes, a very handsome one, similar to one I have here - they are called diamonds, but I believe they are not. I did not give him a chain, seals, and key - they were to be deducted from his wages - the brooch was a gift. I let him have an old coat of mine in July - it was too small, but he wore it a few days till another was made for him. I went to Seven Oaks in company with him, in my own carriage, as my servant and companion, his behaviour was such, I treated him with uncommon kindness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not pass him off at Seven Oaks as your intimate friend? A. No; but he was a very amusing man; he would tell several stories like Denisan, in the Arabian Nights; that was not entirely the reason I took him in my carriage, for he had the tooth-ache very bad, and he is an incomparable mimic, he can take you or any body off; he said, "Will you allow me to amuse you, by seeing how I can behave myself like a gentleman." I took him to the Duke of Dorset's garden, and took his arm there, as I was lame, and wanted assistance; we did not go into the gardens - we walked round. I wanted assistance to walk up the hills in the Duke's park.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he equally serviceable to drink punch with you? A. Yes; I passed him off as my friend at the Crown Inn - we slept in a double bedded room there, at his particular desire - no infirmity of mine made it necessary; the reason he assigned was, that he should be ready to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken, (it is my duty to ask), after taking your tea and punch, and retiring at that inn, did you not ask him to come into your bed? A. Never, never, nothing like it. I never said any thing about*****, nor had we any conversation about women on that journey, I am quite sure; he was particularly delicate with me, and never talked on any b-w-dy subject, nor did I to him - it is all an invention of his own. I missed some rings when I arrived in London, in August, and wrote to him on the subject. I addressed him "J. Morton, Esq." to indulge his whim and frolic, at his request, and because I had represented him as my intimate friend. I have repented it but once since. I do not recollect telling him I had made an Esquire of him, and would do more for him yet; I believe I did take him to the Bank with me in August - he might go. I did not tell him he was to do all my business for me. I said he might have to do business - we went to Blackwall together - I fed him on white-bait, and we had punch together. I bought him a gold ring - I do not recollect whether it was the same day, or what I gave for it. I told him at first that I would make him look like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 4th of September, order him to come to town to buy a gold keeper? A. Yes; I went to Mr. Walker's, but could not get one. I bought silk stockings and gloves. I do not recollect whether he went arm-in-arm with me. I went to Worcester with him about the 5th of September; the carriage was at my door at nine o'clock, and the prisoner was told to get up behind, and he got inside at Kensington - it was his wish. I did not take Scott that day as he was ill, and thought he might be unwell on the road - his going was talked of. I do not know whether I told him why I did not take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that occasion give the prisoner 25l.? A. Yes, to pay for the journey. I do not recollect how much it was - I will not swear it was not 25l. I did not tell him the cheaper he travelled, the better, as he should have the rest when he got there, or that if he got off a large portion of the expences, I would put the rest in the Saving-bank for him. I travelled on to Oxford, and met Dr. Williams, a professor of botany - I did not introduce the prisoner to him as a young gentleman fond of botany, but as a young man fond of gardening and botany; I do not believe I introduced him as a gentleman - I might, I will not swear I did not. I did tell Dr. Williams I and my companion were on a botanical tour; we had a double bedded room at Woodstock, at his desire. I got a medical mixture for him at the next house, and it relieved him; he said he had an eruption in his shoulder - I told him he must rub it - I did not see him do it; I was in the same room, but the curtain was drawn - I swear I did not see him use it; he was in the arm-chair by the side of his bed - I was on the other side of the room, and in bed. I did not see him naked - he always saw me in bed before he undressed - I had supper and punch with him. I never went by a different name on my travels with him - I know nothing of the name of Malcolm - my family name is Markham; I had 10,000l. to change it, and have the King's sign manuel to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the landlady your name was Markham? A. He wished it to be done. I am acquainted with the classics - I have read Virgil, in Latin, and Homer, in Greek - I recited passages to him, and he began to learn Latin; I have heard him lessons. I have been charged with a similar offence before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the oath you have taken, before your Ma<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060064"></xptr>ker, and as you shall answer it before your Maker, did you ever, at Woodstock, Oxford, or any other place, take any indecent liberties with the prisoner, when you slept in a double bedded room? A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he to be your servant out of livery? A. Yes - I let him have these things because he was not fit to be seen; the clothes were to be deducted from his wages. I made him these presents at his desire; he wished to appear a gentleman, and to dress like me; I never introduced him to any individual as my companion, nor took him to any party of friends, as my equal; he always waited on me as my servant, but when we were alone this familiarity took place. On our journey to Seven Oaks and Maldon I had 250l. about me, and he said it would be safer by sleeping in a double bedded room, and he wanted me to buy pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you walked the street in great agitation - had you not been out of bed two nights? A. Yes - I went in at five o'clock, and went to bed. I left the warrants to my attorney, and left word with the Magistrate where I might be found at any time. I was never out of the way, but was always ready to meet this, and the former charge. I went to Bow-street, expecting to meet the prisoner and Woolley.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often had you seen him write? A. Repeatedly, in the house - he has written copies and bills, and several verses, which he took down; I swear both letters are his writing - part of the second letter is in pencil, but it is all his.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were any proceedings taken against you, on the receipt of the first letter? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there never any proceedings from any person on his behalf? A. Yes, from a man named Barton - that was shortly after the receipt of the first letter.</p>
               <p>The letters being read were as follows: -(First Letter.) Holywell House, September 9, 1827.</p>
               <p>SIR - I have to let you know that, owing to the treatment I have received from you since I left London, I am compelied to take an opportunity of vindicating my character, and declaring your guilt to the world at large. I leave here with the intention of proceeding to London, and from thence to a gentleman's residence, who will vindicate my cause; you may depend on hearing from me, by letter, on your arrival in London, until which time I intend to exercise my faculties to the utmost, in making an appeal to the tribunal of justice of my country, where I doubt not I shall have justice done me. As I cannot consent to s-d-y being committed on my person, I find it useless stopping longer in your service.</p>
               <p>I am your injured Servant, J. MORTON.</p>
               <p>N. B. I intend to prosecute as far as the law of my country will allow, so that you have very little to expect, and the sooner you proceed to London the better for you.(Second Letter.)</p>
               <p>SIR - If you will send a certain person 50l. as soon as you return, he will go directly to Dublin: you will repent if you do not. Your sincere Friend.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Salisbury, and have been so from the 5th of August - the prisoner was there before me; he and master went to Maldon. On Monday, the 10th of September, I saw the prisoner, when he returned - I did not expect to see him alone; I went to him afterwards, (in consequence of a person calling on me,) to a public-house opposite our house, and saw him; I said I was surprised to see him, and asked where master was; he said he had left him at Worcester; I said, "How so?" he said, master intended to discharge him as soon as he came to London, and he thought he would take the opportunity first, so he had written a letter, and left him; he then gave me his address, and told me if master gave me any money, I should know where to bring it to him, but I was not to let master, or any body else, know his address. On Tuesday morning, the 11th, I went into the front area, and picked up a letter, which I took to master, and he read it; I went to the milkman's in two or three hours, and saw the prisoner there, taking brandy and water with the milkman; he told me he was very sorry for what he had done, and did I think master would take him back again - I said I did not know, he had better see master himself; master went to get a warrant against him that night; I saw master in the street on the Wednesday night, and saw the prisoner there: master was at the Portugal hotel - I went to meet him. I was returning with him, about ten o'clock - I was a few yards behind him, and saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the house; I recollect seeing the witness Smith; the prisoner went up to master, and asked him for 50l.; master said, "Go along you villain - I will have nothing to do with you;" the prisoner went away a few yards and came up again, and said, "If you don't give me 50l. I will charge you with an unnatural crime; and not leave you a feather in you cap, and if you give me the money I will be off to Liverpool, and you shall hear no more of me;" my master called out Watch! and the prisoner made his escape down Seymour-place, and I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What, did your master go to the Portugal hotel on the 12th? A. Yes; that was not the night he came home; I went home the night he came home; I did not go to the office with him on the 1st instant - it was Tuesday night - he went home after he had been to the Police-office; I do not know what time he left the office - he went straight home - I was with him, and walked home with him; I cannot tell what time he got home; I think I was at home by ten o'clock; I am certain we were at home before twelve - I went in at the area gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you were not in bed and asleep when your master came home? A. Yes; we went to no public-house, or coffee-shop, as we went home - we did not take tea or coffee together that night, I am sure. The milkman's name is Webber; When I went into master's service, his arm was broken, and in a sling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he capable of walking for eight hours, without being fatigued? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner after his return, did not he say his master had taken indecent liberties with him? A. No; nor did he say so at the milkman's - I do not recollect his saying any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never heard of such a thing before? A. No farther than what the prisoner said when he came, and what the housekeeper said. I gave evidence at Bow-street - I do not recollect when I was told to come here.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. When you first saw your master, what time was it? A. About the middle of the day, on Tuesday.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live at No. 33, Mitre-street, New-cut. On the evening of the 12th of September I was in Queen-street. I saw three persons in a scuffle, as I imagined, and heard Watch! called - it was about the middle of the street; I crossed, and saw a man run away, saying at the same time, "If you don't give me the money, you shall repent it:" this was a little after ten o'clock; I should not know the man; I went up, and saw Mr. Salisbury was one of the persons there; the observation appeared to be addressed to him - I did not know him before - he went into No. 18; I have had no intercourse in the way of trade with him; I left my address, as I was requested; I was not before the Grand Jury, as I was absent, and the bill was found before I returned. I called at Mr. Salisbury's, and received a subpoena to attend last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far were you from the person? A. Within two or three yards - I had not seen the prisoner before; my address was asked of me by the footman.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what age and appearance was the person who ran away? A. About the size and appearance of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I never saw Smith till to-night, and never wrote a letter to extort money from Mr. Salisbury, or for any other purpose. Smith is a false witness.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 25.</p>

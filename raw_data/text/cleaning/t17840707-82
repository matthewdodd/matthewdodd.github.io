               <p>Mr. Peatt Prisoner's Counsel. Is it cotton or linen? - Cotton.</p>

               <p>There are other gowns of that pattern? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I saw a bundle lay in Brick-court, I picked it up and went along Fleet-street with it, and that gentleman stopped me, I told him I had found it, I run after him, instead of running away from him, I never saw the young woman nor was in the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you will acquit him of the capital part of the charge as it was light enough to see a man's face, without the help of the candle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, I humbly submit, on the part of the prisoner, that the indictment which charges the burglary to have been committed in the parish of St. Clements Danes, in the county of Middlesex, is erroneous. I understand that part of Brick-court, in which Mr. Morris lives, is within a liberty of the County-Palatine of Lancaster. In a civil process this description would not be sufficiently accurate, I therefore trust the Court will be of opinion, that in a case so highly penal, the description ought to be in conformity to the fact, and allow the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the same parish and county, and being a mere matter of description is not necessary.</p>

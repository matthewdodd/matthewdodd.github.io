The prisoner came to lodge with us on the 22nd of October, with her husband; they hired a furnished room, and left on the 14th of November: I went up to the room, and found it locked - I looked through the key-hole, and missed the chimney-ornaments; I then went in, and missed the blankets, sheet, and pillow, which were part of the bedding let to the prisoner with the room - the shirts I had to make for a gentleman, and gave them to her to mark; she and her husband went away together -I never authorized her to pawn any thing for me; they left a small box behind them, containing some implements for printing; I found the prisoner in Holborn the next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Monday morning I asked her to lend me a shilling - she said she had no money, but I might take four of the shirts, and pawn them for 7s., and if they were wanted, and I could not get them out she would help me - I did so, and took her a half-crown's-worth of halfpence, and she returned me 6d. of it. Witness. It is false - I never allowed her to pawn any thing, and she never brought me any thing as the produce of what she had pawned; she was constantly borrowing money of me.</p>

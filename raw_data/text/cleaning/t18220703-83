            . I am an officer of St. Luke's. On the 5th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Golden-lane with the copper on his head; I followed him into a marine store shop in Playhouse-yard with it, and asked where he got it; he said he knew nothing at all about it. I asked the woman of the shop if it was hers - she hesitated a long while, and wanted to fetch her husband. I said I would have an answer; and at last she said it did. I told her to be very careful what she was about, as she knew me - her name is Hulmer; she then said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you the truth, it does not." I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found the padlock in his coat pocket; he said he picked it up a morning or two ago, but did not say where. I found two keys and a knife on him, which appear to have been used at brickwork; and in his inner coat pocket I found a skeleton key. We advertised and found out Mr. Gough.</p>

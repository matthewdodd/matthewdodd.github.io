            . I am servant to Mr. Newman. On the 21st of May, this rabbit was safe in a hutch in an outhouse in the yard at five o'clock; the hutch was shut, but not locked - I missed it at six the same night; it was found at Southgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure it was in a hutch? A. Yes, it was not running about; I saw the prisoner there that afternoon - but I cannot say how long; I saw him in what we call the old tap; I do not know what he was doing - it is not usual for persons to be there; it is the place where our men sleep - he was standing inside the door; he was not drinking - his uncle is a watchman in Mr. Newman's employ.</p>

I met the prisoner with this rabbit; he offered it to me for sale, on the 21st of May, at half-past seven o'clock at night - I had not seen him before; he asked half a crown for it -I said I would buy it if my father approved of it; my father was talking to him when the prosecutor came up, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is that from the prosecutor's? A. About four miles; he did not appear intoxicated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner? A. No, my boy brought it to me, and said he had agreed to buy it for half a crown; I asked the prisoner where he got it - he said he bought it of a man coming across the fields; Newman then came up, and gave him into my custody - I never said to the prisoner,"You have stolen it, and you had better say you have," and he never said that, in consequence of his having a wife and family, he would say he had stolen it.</p>

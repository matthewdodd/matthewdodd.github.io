               <p>it was—Bird went and sold the coat—I afterwards saw a pair of copper card-plates in his hand—I am no scholar, and could not read what was on them—they were engraved—Paradise asked Bird to give him the plates; he gave them to him, and afterwards he said, "Well, I do not see what I is the use of them; what are you going to do with them?"—Paradise said, "I do not see what I can do better than heave them down the privy "—I was sitting at breakfast, and said, "It is nonsense to throw them away they will fetch 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, for old copper"—he said, "Will you give a penny for them? "which I did—a man who was sitting next to me read the engraving, and in consequence of what he read, I went and took the plates to Mr. Luntley—only Bird and Paradise were present when this passed—Bird said they would go down there again at night, at there was a pair of scales, a saw, and an iron chest, which he dare say had some money in it, and they could break it open; and if there was nothing in it, there was the scales and the saw—I took the plates to Mr. Luntley, as the man next to me said he would be bound to say the man who lost them, would not lose them for a trifle; and as I heard them talk of going there again, I thought it right to take them to Mr. Luntley, to let him know, that he might guard his premises; I took the plates to Mr. Luntley—when I came home, Bird asked me what I had done with the plates—I said I had sold them—he asked what I had got for them—I said, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bird asked me if I would go with them in the afternoon, and they would put a good job in my way—the whole three were together then—he would not say what it was.</p>

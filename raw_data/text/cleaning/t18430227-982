                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Nott, who keeps a lace shop in Upper-street, Islington. About four o'clock on the 16th of Feb. the prisoner and another woman came into the shop—the other woman asked me to show them some quilling net, and I showed it them in a box—I cut off a yard and a half at one price, and three yards at a halfpenny a yard—the boxes were then put away—the other woman then asked to look at some lace—I showed them a variety of lace—the prisoner and the other both looked at it, but none of it suited—while they were deciding, the prisoner took some lace—I saw her make a movement, and put it under her shawl—l am sure I saw the lace under her shawl, and I missed three cards of it, but I said no<lb></lb>thing—the other woman then decided on one, and bought a yard and a half at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I then cleared all away, and the other woman offered me a sovereign to give her change, and take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for what she had bought—there was not sufficient change in the till, and I gave it out of my pocket—the prisoner remarking that she had nothing but notes and gold about her, or she would lend the other a small sum—after I had made up the parcel, and given the change, I desired the lad to take the three cards of lace from under the prisoner's shawl, and I saw him do so—the prisoner said, "I humbly beg your pardon, Miss," and then I let them go—she had taken the cards of lace from the counter—she had a bad hand—it was wrapped up in a handkerchief—she leaned that on the counter, and her shawl was over that hand—she made a movement and took them—if the cards had been knocked down ac<lb></lb>cidentally they would have fallen—they remained under her shawl about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner begging about our neighbourhood, at times, for about 3-qrs. of a year. She used to sit near an empty house, where my children used to pass as they went to school. I saw my children go out to go to school, they had their stays and things on as usual, and they came home late without their stays.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your children's names ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The eldest her name is Elizabeth, she is about seven years of age; the other's name is Sarah. I know nothing of the robbery but what the children told me. I advertised the things on the Monday following, and stuck up bills; the prisoner was taken on the 28th of October; she was charged with taking the cloaths off the children, she own'd she did, and had pawn'd one pair of stays for a shilling, and sold the other stays for 21 d. My wife went to the pawnbroker she mentioned, and return'd and said, that the pawnbroker said he knew nothing of the prisoner. Then I went and got a search warrant from Sir

            . On the 24th of October I sent my children to school, dressed as usual, with their stays on; they were brought home about five in the evening without their stays, and some other of their things. I asked them where they had been; they said the woman that used to sit begging in the street had taken their cloaths from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Elizabeth lose?</p>
               <p>E. Bailey. She had lost her stays, her under petticoat, her cap, ribbon, and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>E. Bailey. She was seven years of age last Midsummer, the other five in May last. The prisoner was taken up on the 28th. I went to her at the Black Horse in Mill yard where she was in custody; they put her in a room with a dozen women. I had put my children in at a neighbour's house; I went and fetched my youngest child first, and asked her if she knew the woman that took her stays; she ran to the prisoner directly, and said, This is her, and clap'd her hand on her knee; the prisoner said, you are mistaken, it was not me; the child said, yes, it was you, and this is your child, (which was the child the prisoner held in her arms.) After that my eldest child was brought in, and she insisted upon it the prisoner was the woman, the same as the other did. The prisoner still denied it, but before Sir

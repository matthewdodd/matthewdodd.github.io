            . I live at Highgate; I was at work for a gentleman, the prisoner came along the foot path with something in a sack; he went into the field and down into a ditch; then he came out and up to me, and asked me what o'clock it was; I said it might be about a quarter after seven; he went and got half way over the stile, and got back again; that gave me a suspicion he had put something in the ditch; I went to the place and found a sheep-skin, it was warm; I took it to my work, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, but could not hear of him. The next day I believe I shewed it to Mr. Parker; I found the prisoner one evening at Highgate; I let him pass me forty or fifty yards, then I followed him and collared him, and told him what for; he offered me a shilling to let him go; we had two or three ups and downs; there was an Irishman desired me to let him get up; I did, and he got away; I never saw him after till before Sir

            . I am a house-keeper at No 8, White Hart-court, Long-lane; I am a clog-maker, he was a lodger in my house twelve months; he behaved like an honest man, I never heard he was accused of sheep-stealing.</p>
               <p>- Mills. I was foreman to Mr. English; the prisoner worked under me between thirteen and fourteen months, in that time he behaved well; he was gone from me two or three months before I heard of his being charged with sheep-stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Wheeler. How did he behave when he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. He did not behave like an honest man; Baxter and his wife used to come there and stay till one or two in the morning, and eat pork and mutton, and what they could get; the first I saw of this was a carcase of a sheep lying on the floor one morning; I asked the prisoner's wife how it came there; she came to my room and said, for God's sake, never mention it; I saw two lambs at a time there; they melted sat till they set the chimney on fire, there were forced to be two engines to put it out, or I had been burnt down; I desired them to go out of my house, and they would not, till at last they went away in a clandestine manner, and did not pay me; since that I have had some money; Baxter said to me here I shall not go home alive.</p>

               <p>Clayton. Mrs. Wheeler was standing talking to me, Baxter shook his head at her and said, you wicked woman, you never will go alive home, them were his words; Mrs. Wheeler has been at my house, and given me information against the prisoner, and told me there were things brought in at unseasonable hours when the prisoner lodged there; she has desired me to go and search, saying there was a carcase in the house, but one thing or other hindered my going; we have watched about the house to see if any thing was brought in; I see since it was a great fault that I did not go and search.</p>

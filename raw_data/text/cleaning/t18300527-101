            . I met the prisoner on the 21st of April in the London-fields, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and went to several public-houses with her; we then went to an empty house - I went to sleep, and when I awoke I missed my watch; the prisoner was gone, and the front window was open - I went home, and went to bed; when I got up in the morning I went with Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270047"></xptr>Waters, to where the prisoner said she lived - I found her getting up, and charged her with having my watch; she denied it: Mr. Waters said he would pull the house down, but what he would have it - she then said she wanted to go out; he said he would go with her - she went to the door, and said it was under the tiles of the house; she gave him this watch, which is mine - I was a little the worse for liquor that night, and cannot say whether I gave her any money.</p>

            . I am an officer. What the witness has stated is correct; we found the prisoner - Later said she had stolen his watch, and she denied knowing any thing about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had promised her 4s., and not having any money he gave her the watch to keep instead, and that she gave him her address.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Will you swear you did not tell her she might take the watch, as you had no money? A. Yes - I had about 6s. in money left the next morning; I had had about 18s. 6d. that evening - I did not take off my clothes in the house we went to; I had asked her address in the evening, and she said No. 6, Cooper's-gardens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, and work with Mr. Gifford, of Brook-street, Holbom. On the 5th of February I met Calvert in Farringdon-street, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening—I went home with her—I saw Hide in the front parlour as soon as I went into the house—I had one sovereign, five shillings, and one half-crown—I put the money in my purse, and put it into my right-hand trowsers pocket—I then laid down on the bed—Calvert got up and went to the door, and I saw her pass something to a person outside the door—I think it was a man—I saw the hand perfectly, and something passed—the hand was dirty—I then put my hand into my pocket, and found my purse open, and only one half-crown remaining—one sovereign and five shillings were gone—Hide did not come into the room between the time my money was safe and my losing it—when I lost it I immediately taxed Calvert with taking it—she denied it—Hide came in directly after I missed my money—I kept her and Calvert in the place—the policeman came in about ten minutes, and I gave Calvert in charge.</p>

I heard a noise on the stairs - I opened the door leading to the passage, and saw the prisoner just going out at the street door - I could not see whether he had any thing - he pulled the door after him - I opened it and ran out, calling Stop thief - he was stopped - I came up directly - I only lost sight of him while he turned into Rood-lane - he went at a quick pace - I took him back to the house, but found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see his features sufficient to swear to him? A. Yes, as he turned from the door I had a side view of him and his dress - he was stopped in less than a minute after he left the door.</p>

            . On the 4th of February, between five and six o'clock, I was passing from the parlour to the kitchen in the prosecutor's house, and saw some one gliding up stairs - I said, "Who is that?" twice or thrice, but received no answer - the prisoner came down at last and said, "Do you know Mrs. Cooper?" I looked at him and said, "You know she does not live here, you are a thief," and at that moment I saw the spoons in his hand - he struck me and ran down stairs. I hallooed out, and in a short time I heard he was taken. I went into the shop and saw him, and said, "You should not have struck me," he said he did not strike me. I heard him drop one spoon on the stairs. I am sure he is the man - the light of the kitchen fire shone in his face.</p>

On Saturday, the 18th of November, I had gone to bed about eleven o'clock—I believe the servants were the last up—my father was gone to bed—I got up about eight o'clock in the morning—I did not hear any thing in the night myself—when I came down I went into the kitchen, as the servant called us—my father, myself, and two servants, went down into the kitchen, and found every thing strewed about the floor—I saw the servant's trunks open—I missed a pair of my own boots, which had been in the front kitchen the night before—I missed my father's silver watch, which I had seen in a cupboard in the back par<lb></lb>lour the night before, with a seal and key; also two table spoons, four car<lb></lb>ving knives, and a bundle of other knives belonging to my father—there is an empty house within two doors of ours—we found soot about the chimney, and marks of feet—the persons had evidently come down the chim<lb></lb>ney, and gone out by opening a cross door and a back door leading into the yard.</p>

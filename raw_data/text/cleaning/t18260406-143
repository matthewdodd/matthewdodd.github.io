The prisoner slept with me on the night of the 23d of February - he got up first - when I got up I missed the jacket, which I had worn the day before - the pocket-book, and tobacco-pouch were in the pocket - I found him at the Three Crowns public-house, on the afternoon of the 24th- the landlord of my house asked him if he had not slept there the night before - he said he did not, for he had slept near the water-side; he afterwards said he did not sleep any where at all, but had walked the street all night - he then went into the privy, and the landlord watched him - when he came out he was searched, and my tobacco-pouch was found on him; I have never got the pocket-book again; a man of the name of John Cole slept with me - he is gone to sea - I heard him, say in the prisoner's hearing, that he had lost his waistcoat - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it - Cole said he was sure he was the man who slept there - he made no answer to that - I am certain he is the man.</p>

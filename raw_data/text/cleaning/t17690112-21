On the 3d of this instant, I met him coming out of my bar. I asked him what he had been doing? He said, Nothing. I went to the bar, and found the till open, and the bag half out. I put my hand into the prisoner's pocket, and took out thirty-one shillings in silver. We often leave the till unlocked. I took him up into his room, thinking he would confess what he was going to do with it. He would not confess any things. I sent for a constable and took him before Justice Welch; there he owned to it, and said, it was the first time he had done so. He owned he took about twenty shillings, but said the rest of the money was his own.</p>

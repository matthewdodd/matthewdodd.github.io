The prisoner was a patient there—on the 27th of February he assisted in rowing a boat to the Tower—I was in the boat, with Robin<lb></lb>son—I went on shore, leaving the prisoner in the boat, and my jacket, which had belonged to the institution, but I was chargeable for it—when I returned to the boat, the prisoner was gone, and my jacket—I have never seen it since.</p>

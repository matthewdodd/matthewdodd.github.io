I had been there probably a minute, not more. I perceived some persons hand at my right pocket, I turned myself round, and I saw that three women had just passed me; I put my hand into my pocket, my handkerchief was gone, it was a silk handkerchief, I think three minutes before I had used it, I am sure that I had it a short time before. There was no other person near me expect a person reading a book besides these three women, who were apparently in company together. I said to the person that was standing by, that I had my pocket picked; I crossed the street, and I perceived them all three go into a gin shop; I saw the bookseller standing the door, I held up my finger for him to come over to me, he came over; I asked him to procure a constable, I said I had had my pocket picked; he said he would go with me to the gin shop; we went in together, we charged them with one of them picking my pocket, they all denied it, a constable was sent for; before the constable came the prisoner said what a bother you make about your handkerchief, or something to that effect, and took it out of her pocket. Mr. Wright took it from her and gave it to me, I gave the constable charge of her, the others went away; she was afterwards taken before the magistrate, and committed. This is the hand kerchief, it is worth two shillings, its mine.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. On Saturday morning I was standing behind the counter, I heard a gentleman say to my boy that he had his pocket picked by these women that went by; I went immediately to the door; I saw a gentleman crossing the street, he held up his finger to come to him, I went; he asked me to get a constable, I said while I am going for a constable they may escape, I said if you chose I will go into the gin shop with you. On going into the gin shop I charged the three women to produce the handkerchief that they had taken out of the gentleman's pocket. I knew the women by passing my door every day; they all denied it at first; I told them it was of no use denying it, the gentleman had kept his eye upon them since they did it. I clapped my back to the door, and said you shall not go out untill you are searched. The landlord sent his son out for a constable, and being so long before he came, the prisoner produced the handkerchief out of her pocket, and said it was of no use to make such a piece of work, is this it; I took it out of her hand, and immediately Mr. Goodwin claimed it. This woman was detained, and the other women were suffered to go about their business.</p>

On the morning as I was going along Broad Street I met these two women, they asked me if I would have some refreshment; we were walking along to go to the wine-vault's I kicked something before me, I stooped down and picked up a handkerchief, I turned round and saw no one enquiring for it; we went into the wine vault's; a little time after this gentleman came in, he said one of you women have got a handkerchief, presently the other said one of you picked this gentleman's pocket, I made answer I picked up a handkerchief, I do not know who it belongs to; is this the handkerchief, and immediately I handed it to one of the gentlemen.</p>

On the 11th of January I had some in two hampers, across an ass's back, at the Red Lion public-house, at Paddington; while I was in the house the ass went on - I received information, and went after it to the Yorkshire Stingo public-house; on going along I met a boy with a fowl, whom I detained; when I came up to the ass, there were ten fowls missing from the hampers - I have not seen any more of them since; I believe the fowl that the boy had was one of mine, but I had only had them about an hour.</p>

            . I keep the Yorkshire Stingo public-house. On the 11th of January, I saw the ass with two baskets of fowls - I saw some persons round it, and the prisoner took some fowls from the baskets, but I do not know what he did with them, for I was busy. I knew him well, and knew the ass was not his - I did not state in my examination at the office that the prosecutor was by him at the time.</p>

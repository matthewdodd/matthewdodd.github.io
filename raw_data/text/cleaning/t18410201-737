                  </hi>. I am a buyer of hosiery for Messrs. Morrisson, of Fore-street. I made some purchases of Mr. Cotton, a hosier in Notting<lb></lb>ham, and on the 22nd of December I received five hampers in Milton-street, near Fore-street—they contained from 80 to 130 dozen pairs of stockings each—there was no invoice with them—that came by post—the hampers were numbered—among them was one No. 29—it ought to have contained 52 dozen of No. 7, and 69 dozen of No. 8, of women's cotton stockings—there was a deficiency of three dozen in the paper marked No. 8—the woven mark on the stockings was No. 300—I did not ascertain the quantity that was in the hamper till after the policeman came, which was, I should think, about the 25th or 26th of December—I can undertake to swear that the hamper was in the same state when I looked at it as when it came to our house—the hampers were removed, but none of the goods removed from them—these articles were at the top of the hamper, under the lid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stocking manufacturer at Nottingham. In No<lb></lb>vember last I sold some goods to Mr. Chadwick for the house of Morrisson—I put up among other things 69 dozen of women's cotton stockings—the woven number on them was 300—that is to distinguish our own manu<lb></lb>facturing—each manufactory has its own particular number for particular kinds of goods—these stockings were enclosed in a paper parcel marked</p>

Person's—I saw them on the 18th, and they were in good condition—it was part of my business to remark if the packages were disturbed, and I should have marked it in the way-bill—these hampers were sent round to what we call the order warehouses on the 19th—on the 18th they remained on what is called the receiving bank, which is a raised part for goods—the prisoner was in the employ of Messrs. Pickford in the up side, in which things come from the country—those goods which are to be delivered in town are put into the wagon, and the others in the order warehouse—it would be the prisoner's duty to have them sent there, and</p>
               <p>he had access to the warehouse.</p>

I saw the prisoner and two others in company—in consequence of something I observed, I went up to the prisoner—he seemed confused—he had a bundle under his arm—I stopped him, and the other two made off in the direction of Oxford-street—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner what he had got—he said, two coats, which were his own, and had been so for six months; and if I would go to Pitman's-buildings his wife would prove it—I produce the coats—they are old, and appear to have been worn by some gentleman, being of a superior make—one of them is a frock-coat, and the other a close body-coat—I took him to the station, and in his trow<lb></lb>sers I found this packet of stockings—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "They are stockings"—I said, "Is it any use going to your wife?"—he said, "No—she knows nothing at all about it—I found them"—in going to Hatton-garden on the Monday, he said he picked the bundle up in St. Luke's churchyard on Saturday night, the coats tied in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and the stockings tied at the top of the bundle—Saturday night was wet and sloppy, and the bundle was quite clean—I found on him two knives and some papers belonging to Mr. Fickford, which led me to make inquiries.</p>

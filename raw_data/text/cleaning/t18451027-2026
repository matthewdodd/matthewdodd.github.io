On the 21st of Oct., be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I received information—I looked at my window—I found it broken, and two watches had been stolen therefrom—I proceeded after the prisoner, and overtook him at the stone, which the watches were found within six inches of—I did not say anything to him; I waited for Mr. Ralph, to know if the prisoner was the person he saw at my window—he said yes—the prisoner was then watched, and an officer sent for—the watches were found within a quarter of a mile of my house—these are those I lost that evening, and I have the dial belonging to this case here—the window bad been quite whole before.</p>

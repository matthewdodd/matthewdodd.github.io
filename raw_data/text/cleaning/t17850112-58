               <p>Mr. Naylor. I know the waistcoat and breeches, I had the lace made on purpose, and the buttons and the coat I am pretty sure of, I cannot swear to the black breeches; these things were in the out room on the night I went out.</p>
               <p>Where is the hair dresser that you found? - He is gone away, I had no suspicion of the hair dresser at all; Remnant was clerk to Mr. Cracraft, the attorney.</p>
               <p>What is Mason? - He did live with Mr. Cracraft, I believe he is the son of an attorney, and clerk to an attorney; Remnant opened the door, says I, your name is Remnant, and there was a woman there, and I said you are his mother, he said no, upon the duplicates being found upon him, he knew where the shop was, the people at the shop said, they knew him very well, and should have taken a gold watch from him.</p>

               <p>How do you know that? - They have not been brought down since the 25th of October last; I know they are the same waistcoats I took in of Mr. Lee, I have no other waistcoats of the same kind that I know of.</p>
               <p>Were they the same tickets? - The duplicate that is pledged in the name of Mason was found upon Remnant.</p>

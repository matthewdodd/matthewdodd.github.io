             sworn. - I am a watchman, at St. Giles's; it was between twelve and one o'clock when I was called; this gentleman called watchman, and I came immediately up to him, he shewed his pocket, and the place where the money was dropped, and I picked up half-a-guinea, and two six-pences; he shewed me the alley the woman was gone into; he told me that a person went into that house; there was an old woman, and I asked him, if that was the person that he wanted; no, says he; we went up stairs, and he said that was the person, and gave charge of her; she was in bed; I found two shillings and five-pence half-penny upon her.</p>
               <p>JAMES PARRY sworn. - I am a patrol, belonging to St. Giles's parish; I was standing at the watch-box, at the time the prosecutor was crying out watchman, I am robbed, I am robbed! he said he had been robbed by one sat woman; he said that she went down this passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prosecutor charge any body else besides this woman? - A. No, he did not; this woman had a light in her apartment, and the moment we knocked at the door to get in, the light went out immediately; the house is inhabited by unfortunate women.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the prosecutor in my life, until I was apprehended.</p>

The prisoner came to me about seven days after, and said the affair he had been guilty of was discovered, and begg'd I would take the rest of the money and write to his master to be favourable; he then apprehended there was a warrant out against him</p>

            .

I said I do not do that; he said he had lost the bill, and he must have one to shew his master, then I wrote the receipt.</p>

I paid him 7 l. 10 s. for three loads of hay, that is 50 s. a load, I believe it was in the beginning of April, and gave the prisoner the bill and receipt by Mr. Marsh's order; the price of hay the year before was three guineas a load, or something better.

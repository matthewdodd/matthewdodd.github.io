                  </hi>. I make medicine-chests, and live in Duke-street, Little Britain. On 7th July, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, a person came to my shop and accosted me very familiarly, apparently knowing me—in my own mind I believe the prisoner to be the man, but I canuot swear positively to him—I said, "I think you have the advantage of</p>

               <p>me, it is most likely you recollect me at Savory and Moore's, about two years since"—he said he had taken a business at the West-end of the town, late in possession of Mr. Downes, of Duke-street, Manchester-square, and he wished some articles in my line—I knew there was a person named Downes who had died some time before—he introduced this check for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Mr. Williams, and asked if I would pass it through my hankers, it being crossed "and Co."—I rather hesitated from the smallness of the amount, and having nothing to pay in that day; but after some time I said 1 would do it, he having told me he had taken Downes' business, and that he should be a customer of mine, induced me to do it—he asked me to give bim a check, which 1 rather hesi<lb></lb>tated doing—I said it was not exactly business, as we were strangers, but I would pay it in, and if it was paid he might have the money next day if he called on me—he asked if I would give him a check dated the following day—that I objected to do, but said he could have the money if he called on me in the morning, supposing it was paid—he said he thought he should be unable to call, and I, supposing he was in possession of Downes' business, told him my man would be up in the course of the day, and would bring him the money—he left, leaving me the check, having selected some few bottles which were to be sent to bim—I paid the check into my bankers—his "Union Bank" was written by my orders—the same evening I received this note—(<hi rend="italic">read—"Sir, I must request you do not present the crossed cheque I left in your hands, for it will not be paid. I have further to state, that in consequence of my being unable to complete my purchase of the business, I shall not require the bottles I selected.

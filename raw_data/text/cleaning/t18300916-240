On the 8th of February I lost these articles; they were in a back room in which I was sitting - the book was on a table, the gloves behind some glasses, the shawl over a clothes-horse, and the other articles were in my bed-room; the prisoner succeded my sister in a situation, and my sister brought her to see me - she came on the 6th of February, and asked if I could tell her of a situation; I said No, but I could let her sleep there for two nights; on the 8th I was sitting at work, and she said she would go and get her bundle, and go to her place - instead of taking them, she was taking these from me; I have only found the shawl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I bring a bundle of clothes to your room? A. No, only a bundle of grass, which deceived me; I did not say my sister took a silver ring away - you said you were going to live as servant at No. 8, Harley-street.</p>

On the 26th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Broad-street, St. Giles's. I had fourteen 1l. notes in my pocket, which I was going to send to my father in Ireland. I enquired of another woman if she knew of a lodging? the prisoner came up, and said she would show me one. She took me to a house in <placeName id="t18180909-170-crimeloc937">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

I laid on the bed-nobody else was there; she was not to stay with me. I only pulled my coat and shoes off. She said she had other lodgers to come in, and sat down by me. I felt her hand in my pocket where my notes were. I seized her - She got from me; I missed my money, and called out Watch! several persons came in and went out before the watchman came. I told them the prisoner had robbed me. I had been five years saving up the money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I heard the call of Watch! and went to No. 45, Charles-street - one Wallis keeps the house. I found the prosecutor in the parlour; he said he had been robbed of fourteen 1l. notes by the prosecutor. I searched her, but found none on her. I found a tobacco-pouch, 1s. in silver, and 7d. in copper in her pocket. She said the pouch was her own. The landlord of the house was in the room.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. - I am the driver of the Gosport waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose waggon is it? - A.William Knight's; he lives at Alton, thirty miles on this side of Gosport; I set out from the New-Inn, about six o'clock in the morning of the 11th of August, with the waggon; when I came to Turnham-green, a man came to me, I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the man; he wanted to ride; he would be glad if I would give him a list; he said, he was going to Phillmore-hill, ten miles on the other side of Alton; he said, he would satisfy me; he had but a trifle of money, and as we were walking along, I asked him where he came from; he said, out of Essex; I gave him leave to get in the waggon and ride a few miles; and he got in about half way between Turnham-green and Brentford; when we got to Smallbury green gate, he got out; I watered my horses there; we went in and had a pot of beer, and he paid for it; then he walked with me up as far as Hounslow; that was about twelve o'clock; I had a pint of beer at the sign of the Bear, he did not go in then; and when we had got half way through Hounslow, he said, you may get up and ride now, if you like, and I will drive; I got up into the waggon, and fell asleep; I looked out by the Powder-mills, and he was driving along very well; I looked out again, at Bedfont, and he was upon my nag, driving on very well; about three quarters of a mile beyond Bedfont, I heard a cracking in the waggon; there was a crate of bottles in the waggon; I looked up and saw two men at the tail of the waggon, pulling the crate; I then jumped out at the head of the waggon, and ran after them; the prisoner was just by the horses, on the near side; they ran towards Bedfont; I went after them three or four rods, but not farther, because I thought I must not leave the waggon; he was driving the waggon on till I came back; when I came back, I I missed two trusses and a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how those trusses were directed? - A. Yes; Paul, Gosport; I went up to him, says I, friend, I think you are connected with them; he said, no, I am not; I said again, that he was; and he said, he was not; I took the whip out of his hand, and I drove away as hard as I could to Bedfont-gate, that I might get back to look after my goods; the prisoner went on a little way the same way that I did, and then I lost him; I left the waggon at the gate, and came back again upon my horse, to where the two men got out of the waggon, and then I came gently along, and tracked them coming up to a field of barley; I rode up to the gate about a quarter 6f a mile from where the two men jumped out of the waggon, and looking over the gate, I saw a box that I missed out of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road? - A. On the near side; as I was going towards Staines, I tied up my horse, and brought the box out; I went and got some people to assist me; I went over the field of barley, and then over a field of peas, and then over a field of turnips, and then over a field of beans, and there I found one of the trusses.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that close to the side of the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the truss directed? - A. To Paul, at Gosport; I put them into another waggon that was coming up, and took them to my waggon at Bedfont-gate; the other truss was found in another barley field.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And you went on with your waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have told us this man was on the near side of the way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had drove on the left side, would you have trusted him to drive? - A. No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On which side were the trusses found? - A. The near side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your waggon? - A. Near two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, as you had lost something, you searched very closely, to see if there was any thing else gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though he had been in your waggon two hours, you missed nothing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked out two or three times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was driving in a proper manner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These people, I suppose, got in at the tail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they would get in as quietly as they could? - A. I suppose they would.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was your waggon closed so that a person who rode the horse, could see whether you were asleep or not? - A. I was just at the head of the waggon, he could see me plain enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You generally drive pretty near the fore-horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Near the shaft-horse? - A.Sometimes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200067"></xptr>Q.You charged him with being an accomplice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the whip out of his hand not very well pleased, I suppose? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. And you drove away as fast as you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Much faster than he could have walked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. At the time this man leaped out at the tail of the waggon, the prisoner was riding upon your horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a labourer, I live at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Gosport waggon coming through Bedfont, on the 11th of August? - A. Yes; at nearly three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember who was driving for him? - A. Yes; that is the man at the bar; I was sitting at the Black Dog, close to the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a green cart coming up? - A. No; I was not there then; I saw the cart afterwards going towards Ashford from Bedfont, soon after I had heard of the robbery; the road leads from Bedfont to Ashford, and then into the Staines road again; I saw this cart with two men in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the cart? - A. A furlong's length.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they going fast or slow? - A.Middling fast; after the goods were found and picked up, we were looking about, and this cart came up with two men in it, close to the road; they had both snuff-coloured great coats on; they walked the horse along till they came to the place where the first truss was found over the hedge; and then, seeing us, they set off full speed, as hard as they could make their horse go, with whipping and cutting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a field was it? - A. A bean field; we were looking after the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you observe them doing any thing as they walked along? - A. No, only looking over the hedge, as the other walked along.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You saw the man in the cart plain enough? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you observe any writing upon the cart? - A. Yes, but I did not observe what it was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am ostler at the Black Dog, Bedfont: On the 11th of August, two men came in a little green cart to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the cart? - A.Not when I first came in; after they asked me the way to Staines, I looked to see where it came from, and I rubbed off the dirt, and saw, upon a square plate, John Palmore, Kingston, Surrey; it was a good while before I could read it, it was all over dirt; they went into the house, and had something to drink, and they came out again, and said, how far is it to Staines, three miles and a half is not it? and I said, yes Sir; when they first came in, one man had a light coloured great coat, and the other had a dark coat; but I did not observe very particularly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they bait the horse? - A. Yes; they gave him a seed of corn, and went away towards Staines; they left the cart and horse, and returned again, it might be in about half an hour; they came up the road again from towards Staines, and ordered me to put the horse to as fast as possible, and I did; they drank a pot of beer while I harnessed the horse; the mare was a little restive, and I took her by the head and led her out; they went off as fast as they could well trot towards Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the great coats, whether they had them on when they went back? - A. I did not know whether they had or not; but, after the robbery was done, John Teams brought in two great coats, one of which I know was the one the little man had on; the other I am not positive to.</p>

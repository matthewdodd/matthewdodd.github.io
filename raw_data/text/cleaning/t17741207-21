            . In consequence of an information I had received; I went to the house in which I understood the prisoner Day lived; I went first to the back of the house which opens into a Tenter-Ground, but by mistake I went into the wrong house; when I came out again, I saw Day coming out of the back door of the right house, I desired Parker to go after him, which he did, and brought him back, and I found in his hand a key, which key I took from him, and in his breeches-fob a punchin, the use of which is to stamp a die, the reverse of an Irish half-penny; with the key I took from Day, I unlocked a cellar door belonging to the house; in that cellar we found this instrument (producing a large coining engine) it was fixed and ready for working, there were a pair of dies in it, and a halfpenny between the dies; the halfpenny is made in imitation of the copper coin of this realm; there was another halfpenny by the side of the dies, some finished halfpence lying about, and a quantity of blanks ready cut; there was a fire in the cellar, a kettle on the fire, and blanks in the kettle, the blanks are put into a kettle in order to boil off the scurf which is upon copper, and which prevents the impression being made so strong by the instrument as it should be; I found a punchin for a die for the reverse of an English halfpenny, I searched the garret, and in the garret I found a press which may be made use of for the cuting out of round blanks; and there was a blank lodged in this press at the time we found it, and there were a quantity of blanks round it; the prisoner Day's wife was in the kitchen, and the prisoner Bailis, was there with his coat off, and Bailis, wife brought in a seive, which seive is likewise an instrument they do make use of in the process of coining copper-money.</p>

            . I was along with Clarke, Day came out of the house, he ran away, I pursued him, he made a blow at me and missed me, then he said he would surrender, I brought him back, I found Day's wife in the kitchen, Day said he was just cleared from the King's Bench, and that he did it through want, I said to Bailis, are not you an old fool to get into such a scrape as this in your old age? Bailis said, he did it by his master's direction, and we could not hurt him, Bailis was as black as a chimney-sweeper and without his coat. I saw Mr. Clarke take the key from Day which opened the cellar: Day told Mr. Clarke that this was the key of the cellar: I did not go into the cellar with Mr. Clarke at the first time; I kept Day in custody while Mr. Clarke went to see what was in the cellar, afterwards I went into the cellar and saw the instrument fixed with the halfpence and the fire.</p>

               <p>The reason of my being so black and without my coat, was not by having any thing to do with coining, but I had been carrying coals for a person in the neighbourhood; I was only in the passage at the time they found me.</p>

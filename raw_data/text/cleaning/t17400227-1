               <p>John Hughes. On the 26th of January in the Evening I was abroad, but I had left 3 Half-Guineas, and 20 Shillings in the Drawer in the Shop, for Change, if it should be wanted: and I put the Gold into a little Screw-box .</p>

            . I was in the shop that Evening, and when it was almost dark, I went into a Back-room to light a Candle. When I returned, a Gentleman came in, and asked for a Sheet of what we call Double-Penny . I went behind the Counter to serve him, and saw the Prisoner lying down by the side of it, next the Door, with the Till under her Arm. Upon this I called out to my Fellow-Apprentice, and the Prisoner attempted to run away, but he stopped her.</p>

            . On Saturday Evening, the 26th of January. I was sitting by the Fire in a Back-Office belonging to Mr Hughes, where we usually fit to write; and Halton (who was then in the Shop) calling to me, I ran out, and saw the Prisoner crawling towards the Door. Halton had taken the Drawer from her, before I came into the Shop, and she told me a Gentleman had given it to her, to hold for him. <rs id="t17400227-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live in White-Horse-Yard. On the 25th of March, in the evening, the prosecutor came and let me know he had lost the things mentioned. After that the prisoner came and offered two shammy skins, and said he had some dark canvas, or something of that sort. I desired him to bring that. When he was gone, I went and told the prosecutor; he came, and the prisoner was stopt when he came with the Russia drab.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hall. On the 25th of March, the prisoner came with two skins and some Russia drab, and offered them to sale. I had had notice from the prosecutor, that he had lost such. I asked the prisoner the price; he asked 12 d. each for the skins, and 10 d. a yard for the Russia drab. I kept him longer than I should do, expecting the prosecutor. I slipt them behind the counter, and said I would stop him. He attempting to make his escape, I catched hold of the skirt of his coat, but he pulled it off, left that with me, and got away.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 25th of March, about seven in the evening, the prisoner and two men came to our shop, and asked for some blue stuff. I had none. It being dusk, I got a candle. They kept telling me to reach down goods. I feared the y were upon some bad design. The goods mentioned in the indictment were there when they came in, and when they went out they were gone. The prisoner went away first, and said to the other, I will go, and you will come to me.</p>

               <p>Two gentlemen came to my lodgings. I went with them. One of them said to me, he had got some things he wished I would dispose of for him; then he gave me the skins and drab. I took them, and went to sell them for him. I was not in the prosecutor's shop.</p>

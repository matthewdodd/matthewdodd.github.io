                  </hi>. I am a lighterman. On the 27th of April I was, in Brook-street about a quarter past four o'clock—I fell down and broke my ribs—Grady came up, and said, "Have you hurt yourself?"—I said, "Yes, very much"—he took my coat off my arm, and gave it to Sullivan, who was with him, and who went down a court by the Red Lion—he came back, and said, "Let me help you home, if you have hurt yourself"—they then led me home—I said, "I am very much hurt," and one of them said, "Take off his handkerchief"—one of them, but I cannot say which, took off my handkerchief, and I saw Sullivan put it in his bosom with his right hand—my wife went for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I went to the hospital, and did not see any more of the prisoners till Whit-Monday, and I saw Grady, and said, "Will you give me the ticket of my coat?"—he said, "No, we sold it right out, and did not get but 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the b—y articles altoge<lb></lb>ther"—he said, "If you say any more I will stop your b—y wind"—I have not got either the coat or handkerchief again.</p>

            . I live in the Old Swan Yard, Bishopsgate-street. I lost my watch on Monday was seven-night, about one in the morning, at <placeName id="t17690628-33-crimeloc169">Castle-street Bagnio, Leicester-fields</placeName>

I had hung my bags on my horses to let them feed. I shut the door and went to sleep, but the prisoner awaked me by pulling the watch out of my pocket: He turned about, and ran. I jumped out of the coach and followed him. The watchman was crying the hour one. My big coat came between my legs and threw me down. A watchman pursued and he was taken. I know the prisoner is the person that took my watch, for I saw him as I was in the coach. He had a striped waistcoat, and a blue coat on, the same he has on now.</p>

            . I picked up the watch where the prisoner fell. I was standing at my own door in Vine-street and saw him fall. He was no sooner down, but Mr. Churchman, who was pursuing, said, Now I have you. He took him, and carried him to the watch-house, and I carried the watch after him. (The watch produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

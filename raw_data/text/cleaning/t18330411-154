             (Police-constable E 86). I live in Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury. I took the prisoner on the 24th of February. at the Bricklayers' Arms, in Rathbone-place; I said, "Halloo, Dan! I have been looking for you some time?" he said, "I may as well be transported as starved here; I have kept out of the way as long as I can" - I had received notice of the robbery the day it happened; I do not know where the cab No. 112 stood, which was the one the prisoner drove.</p>

            . I live in Worship-street. I employed the prisoner to drive the cab No. 112 - I sent him out on the 18th of December, and he never returned; a strange man brought the cab home, and said the prisoner had met with an accident, and was thrown out at Covent-garden-market; I went there, and found that no such thing had happened.</p>

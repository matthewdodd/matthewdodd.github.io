                  </hi>. I live in the parish of Baling, Middlesex, with Ann Dorchester, my mother, who is a grocer, she keeps the house. In consequence of missing money I gave information to a policeman, and had one watching for three Sundays, and another for two—on returning on Sunday, the 11th of July, I found a policeman there—I heard the prisoner was in custody—he lived next door to us—I had marked some money, and the policeman some, which was in a bureau up stairs, in my mother's bed-room—there was 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the bureau—on the 11th of July 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was missing—I saw 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found on the prisoner, all marked, and which I can swear to, some having been marked by me, and some by the officer in my presence; the money left in the bureau was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making the exact amount left there on Sunday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was ordered to attend at the prosecutrix's house, and remained there till between four and five o'clock on Sunday afternoon, the 11th of July, about twenty minutes before five I saw the prisoner come to the gate of the back-yard—he came up to the window, and with a wooden peg began to push at the screw which fastened the window—he could not get it out far enough—he then took a knife and shaved the peg, then threw up the window, got in, shut it down, and put in the screw as it was before, opened the staircase-door, went up stairs, and came down in a few minutes—I took him into cus<lb></lb>tody, and found six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, ten half-crowns, three shillings, and four sixpences, which I produce—I had noticed him in the yard before he came to the window—I noticed him cutting the peg—I was in the shop, which leads into the room he got into—the door was shut, but I was looking through a large keyhole, and could see right up the yard—he could go up stairs without coming into the shop, as the door is close to the window.</p>

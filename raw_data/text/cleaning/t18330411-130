On the 1st of March I fell in with Lee in Whitecross-street; she asked me whether I would give her any thing to drink; we went to a house in Bunhill-row, and had some gin - she then asked me to go home with her, which I did, to some place adjoining <placeName id="t18330411-130-crimeloc724">Chequer-alley</placeName>

            . I keep a general sale-shop, No. 95, Whitecross-street. On Saturday morning; the 2nd of March, I saw Lee and a number of other girls intoxicated - I suspected something, and about half past ten o'clock, Ryan came and asked to look at a bonnet; she said, "Never mind the price;" I told my wife to get a bonnet down, and said to Ryan "Old girl, you have been in luck" - she said, "Yes, the other girl brought the man home, but I got 25s. 6d. out of it;" she then said, "You little think where my purse is;" she then turned her back to me, and got out a sovereign and 2s. from under her clothes; she then said,"Do you smoke or chew? I got his tobacco as well when I got these, I always clear them out;" I said,"Was he a rich or a poor man?" she said, "All he had on was not worth a shilling," I then told the Policeman, and he brought the prosecutor, who stated he had lost four sovereigns; I said, "Did you lose any tobacco?" he said, "Yes, a quarter of an ounce of pigtail."</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY (Police-constable G 186). I took Lee to the station-house; she took from her stocking 1l. 7s. 6d., and put it into her bosom; I found in her pockets 1s. 5 1/2d. in copper - I then took Ryan; she said she knew nothing of the robbery, but when she came down, Lee said she had got a sovereign and some silver from the prosecutor, and she wished her to get him outside.</p>
               <p>Ryan's Defence. I have got a witness that I showed the sovereign to on the 28th of February.</p>
               <p>BRIDGET KEY. On Thursday, the 27th of February, Ryan came to me, and asked me to mind her child, as she was going to sell some fruit - I said I would, and she showed me a sovereign which she had to buy fruit; I should not know it again.</p>
               <p>Ryan. On the 28th of February I went out to look for a lodging; I met this prisoner, who was a stranger - I asked her for a lodging; she said I might stop with her; which I did for four nights: on the night of the 1st of March she came in with the man - I did not like to stay in the room; I got out of bed, and put on my gown - the man asked me if I would have a drop of ale: he put his hand into his pocket to give me sixpence, and dropped a half-sovereign - I went down to the passage, and Lee came and asked me to get the man out; I said; as she had brought him in I did not like to get him out - she spoke in Irish to me; the prosecutor then sat down on the threshold of the door - I asked him to go home, but he would not; I took him up, and took him down - I was sweeping the room the next morning, and found this tobacco; she had left a bonnet and shawl at Torner's, and on the 2nd of March she gave me 2s. to go for the bonnet; he sent his wife for it; I had the sovereign and two shillings tied in the corner of my handkerchief - he said, "They are all fighting;" I said I knew nothing about it - I got the man down quietly; I did not molest him at all.</p>

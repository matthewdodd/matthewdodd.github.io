On the 20th of February I was in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the sleeping-room, which is one pair of stairs higher than I was then, which is one pair from the street - I paused a little while, and then went up stairs; I looked into the sleeping-room, but saw no one - I then went into my master's bed-room, and as I was coming out I saw the prisoner standing behind the door; I knew him well, as he had been taken into the house by my master out of compassion - I asked him what he did there; he said he had made a mistake - I called up my master, who found the property stated.</p>

On the evening in question I followed Mr. Brown up stairs, and when I got up I saw Mr. Brown pull the articles stated from between the bed and the mattress; he placed them on the table, and said to the prisoner, "You have robbed me of my spoons;" the prisoner said, "No, I have not;" there was nothing found on the prisoner, but Mr. Brown saw him putting the property under the bed - the prisoner afterwards said he had been put up to it by the pot-boy, and he took them; they were both taken to the station.</p>

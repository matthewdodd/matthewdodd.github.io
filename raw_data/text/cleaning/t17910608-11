             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I know nothing of the robbery; I stopped the prisoner on the 21st of May, on Saturday, about eleven o'clock, in Wine-office-court, Fleet-street; I did not see the watch at all. The prisoner is the man I took, he was running along, and upon the alarm of stop thief, I took him prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time was it you first saw me? - About five minutes after eleven.</p>
               <p>Where did you take me? - In Wine-office-court.</p>
               <p>Where did you take me to afterwards? - I surrendered you up to two young men.</p>
               <p>Was not you in Mr. Jones's shop? - I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>You searched me? - Yes, slightly, but I ordered you to be taken to the constable.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe that I had a watch? - You played with your hands, and the watch was found inside the rails the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you conduct me to the watch-house that night? - I helped, aided and assisted.</p>
               <p>Do you know what time the watch was found? - I do not know, only what I was told.</p>
               <p>Was your walk from the corner of Wine-office-court? - It is.</p>
               <p>Did you see any watch there; how long might you stop there? - I suppose I stopped there about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave your walk? - About twenty minutes after four, in broad day-light.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner make any motion with his arms? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Although my poverty has precluded me the benefit of counsel, yet I thank heaven that that misfortune will be supplied by the humanity of the Judge who tries me; the Jury will observe that I call no person to my character, that the case may be reduced to its own merits; theirs is the character I rely upon; not on my own: On their discernment and not on my own I rely. I sent to none of my friends, because I did not wish them to know the disgraceful situation into which I am plunged; my character is lost by the situation itself: Gentlemen, believe me innocent; I lived till this misfortune by an honest trade, that of a stay-maker, and by that trade I hope to maintain myself as usual, by the favour of your verdict, and the recovery of my usual health and spirits.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for ten minutes, and returned with a verdict,</p>

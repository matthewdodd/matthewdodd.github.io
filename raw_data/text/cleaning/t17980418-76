             sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Thomas Lermitte: On Thursday the 29th of March, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and said he came from Mr. Wilkie, in Little Britain, and brought a note, which I have now in my hand, for the article mentioned in the indictment. (The note produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was your master acquainted with Mr. Wilkie? - A. Yes; he was a customer of his; in consequence of that, I let him have the two yards and a half of kerseymere; that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What might be the value of it? - A. One pound five shillings.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.Was he ever your apprentice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he at the time those goods were obtained, your apprentice? - A. No; he was out of his time a twelve-month last Christmas. I gave him no orders to get the kerseymere. (The note shewn him.) I never gave it him; I never saw it till Mr. Lermitte's man shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I allow I am guilty; it has been occasioned through bad company since I have been out of my time, and which has brought me to the state I am in now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkie. He was a very good apprentice when he lived with me.</p>

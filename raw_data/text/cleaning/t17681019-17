            , Esq; I was out of town when this fire happened; I had taken a room in this house, I was informed there was an execution in the house; I came home on the 20th of September, I had gave her notice of my coming 8 days before; when I came she told me my clothes and things were burnt, except what was in the possession of Mr. Bolland; she told me a lamentable story, and seemed very sorry that my things were burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Col. Hamilton. Yes, I found I believe thirty-three shirts and nine waistcoats at two pawnbrokers; I went to Mr. Bolland's the next morning, he gave me reason to think I had not fair play; I went to Sir

            . I was put in possession in the prisoner's house the 5th of September, by a power of attorney which was made from her husband to her to sell the goods, and she did sell them to Mr. Bolland some time before the fire happened; Mr. Bolland sent word he would advertise the goods and sell them, this was I think the Monday before the fire, if she did not let him have the money he had lent upon them; she had said her husband was coming and coming, but before she would have her goods advertised and sold, she would set them on fire and burn them all; I heard her say that more than once or twice, and he that was in possession with me heard her say the same. The morning the house was set on fire between six and seven, she sent the maid out of an errand to Mr. Bolland, and while the maid was gone, she went up and came down again to me in the kitchen; I heard her go up and come down, her room was up two pair of stairs forward; she came down stairs to me, and said I must see and kill her cat, for her cat ran about the house with fire upon her back; then she said her cat was a witch and would haunt her, and I must not kill her; I said, madam, one day we must kill her, and another day we must not, we will kill her by and by; then she found fault with the fluttishness of her maid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard her talk of killing the cat before that day? </p>
               <p>Stainsby. I had, four or five days before the fire, she had mentioned it two or three times before; as she was busy in the kitchen blowing the fire, I took the bellows to blow, she said she believed some body knocked at the door; I went up, there was nobody at the door; I came down again and said, madam, your house is all of a smother; she said, it may be by the people washing at the next house; I said, is it usual to smoke so at such time, she made me no answer; I said I did not think that was the occasion, and I thought my blowing the fire could not make such a smother; she made no answer: soon after some body knocked at the door, and said your house is on fire, the fire comes out at a two pair of stairs window; it broke out in the maid's bed chamber, that was a two pair of stairs room; there had not been any fire in that room since I had been in the house, which was fifteen days; I ran up stairs in order to burst the door open, but I could not get nigh it, the smoke and sulphur came so strong; there was

               <p>Q. How do you know the fire began in the maid's room?</p>
               <p>Stainsby. I saw the smoke come out at the maid's room door, and not out of the prisoner's room door; it could not break out in the prisoner's room first, they are both on the same floor; there was no other fire but in the parlour when I came down about six o'clock; the kitchen fire I light up myself.</p>

            . I was in possession of these goods before the last evidence; I have heard the prisoner say she was afraid the cat would run about the house with fire on her back, and set the house on fire; we were going once to kill the cat, then she desired we would not kill her, saying she was afraid the cat would haunt her, I heard her several times talk thus; I was in bed in the top of the house when the fire happened, I think it was about seven o'clock in the morning; the sulphur came into the room, I opened the door to let it out, thinking the maid was lighting the fire below; I found it began to increase, I just got my clothes on; Stainsby called out fire, I heard the fire crack and saw it smoke more; I got out at a window to go out upon the top, and I could get no farther; I was obliged to come in at the window again, and come down through the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it you heard the cracking in?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then go into your mistress's room?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No, I did not, the doors were both open; they opened one into the other; the doors were always open in the night-time, there was no candle in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find smoke in your house by any thing that was going forward in the next house?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the fire came?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. No, I do not, I left the house very safe when I went out; my mistress had a rush-light burning in her room in the night, but she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176810190012"></xptr> got out of bed between five and six, and put it out, that she said on the Monday morning after the fire; I heard her get out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to mention that?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. I asked her whether it might not come by the watch-light; she said she got out between five and six, and put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it come by the soulness of the chimnies?</p>
               <p>M. Lewis. The kitchen and parlour chimnies were both swept after I came there, it may be two or three months after I came there; I saw part of the shutters of her room open in her room when I went out.</p>

            . I live in the same street, directly opposite the prisoner's house, I used generally to see the windows open in a morning; when I got up that morning, I saw the windows shut about half an hour after seven; as I was putting on my clothes I saw the smoke come out at the two pair of stairs windows, there are two windows, both were shut; she was in general a very early riser, and the windows were generally open.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see the smoke when the shutters were shut?</p>
               <p>F. Parker. It came out at the crevices, they were inside shutters, and it came out between the brickwork; I came down, and told the prisoner, she was very much frighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am quite innocent, I know nothing how it came; Col. Hamilton never took a room of me, I gave him leave for a few days to leave some things with me; that fellow Stainsby has said he would be revenged of me, he smoked tobacco in my house; all this is spite and malice entirely, there is none more cautious of fire than I am, by being dreadfully burnt out before at Wapping wall; this Bolland wanted to arrest my husband, he sent his bailiffs after me, and I was carried to his house; he heard I was going to sell my goods, I let him come and appraise my goods, he put in two fellows; I said to him, Mr. Bolland, take that man out of my house, he smokes so I cannot live in the house; Col. Hamilton desired me to recommend him to a workwoman to make him some stocks, I employed a woman in my house; I did not know he would take the key of the garret away, I had a key of the other garret that opened his room; I did surely make use of his things, but I intended to fetch them again in a few days; I never wronged man, woman, or child in all my days: and now I am upon my trial, by the confusion of my attorney, my witnesses are not here, I should have had 500 to my character, I can prove I have been a woman of an undeniable character, I have the best of characters that any poor woman has; this man has robbed my husband of his goods, and now he wants to take my life away; I know not how the fire came, unless by this cat, she used to be frighted out of the kitchen, and out of the parlour; as she used to lie under the grate, I told them to beat her away; that Stainsby threatened my life, he looks so like a thief I hated him, every word he has said is all false; Dundass said, Bolland offered him 20 l. to swear against me, and he answered he would go to the farthest part of the world before he would.</p>

I live in Rotherhithe, I have known her between two and three years, she was my next door neighbour; she was brought up extremely gay, and was looked upon as a gentlewoman; she was honest and sober to the greatest degree, I believe she was too much of a gentlewoman to do any thing that is mean and piciful by her appearance and character; she lived in a gossiping place, and people of character do not care to be too much connected.</p>

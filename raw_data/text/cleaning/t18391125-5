                  </hi>. I am a stock-broker—my counting-house is in Bank-buildings, City. On Saturday afternoon, the 9th of November, (Lord Mayor's-day,) between four and five o'clock, I was going along Cheapside towards St. Paul's—there came a mob down from the west towards the Mansion-house, and two men arm-in-arm stood before me, evidently to prevent my getting on—they quitted me suddenly—I fancied that my watch and chain were gone, but I felt, and found the chain had broken at the ring connecting it with the watch, and the watch was left In the fob—I said I was robbed, and the persons standing by me said, "Yes, and this is the man that robbed you, sir," taking the prisoner—I lost my gold watch-chain, seals, and key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live in Haman's-row, Holloway. On the 9th of November I was in Cheapside, standing near the prosecutor—I saw a man holding him, and while he was doing so I saw the prisoner tugging at Mr. Sutton's watch twice—I heard' Mr. Sutton say he was robbed—I said, "That is the fellow," and seized the prisoner—I am sure he is the person who was tugging at the chain.</p>

I was standing at the shop-door, and saw the prisoner pressing very much against Mr. Sutton, who called out that he was robbed—I immediately ran out at the side-door, in Queen-street, and at the top of Queen-street the prisoner was being brought to the station-house—I laid hold of him, and assisted in bringing him down, as the mob were trying to rescue him, by pushing against the policeman, and trying to push him away.</p>

Bradley, catch hold of Brooks's arm, and point to a gentleman's pocket, and push him in, covering him. I saw the lad Brooks, draw the handkerchief out; Williams assisted in covering him. I endeavoured to inform the gentleman of the transaction, but could not get up to him; I did not know his name. We did not attempt to meddle with the prisoners until they got right out of the mob. When they had got from among the booths, they all felt into conversation together, and the little one, Brooks, pulled a handkerchief from under his jacket, and they all three caught hold of the corners, and began examining it. I guesed they were looking if there were any marks; I think it was too dark for them to see any, if they were. When we seized on them, the two smallest dropped the corners, and Bradley threw it away. I seized him, and Woodroffe took the other two. I accused Bradley of picking a gentleman's pocket, but he denied it, and said he had never seen the other two prisoners before. I found another handkerchief between his shirt and skin, and an open pen knife in his pocket, very sharp.</p>

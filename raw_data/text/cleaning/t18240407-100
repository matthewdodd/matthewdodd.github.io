On the 22d of March, I had an alarm-bell on my premises; it weighed nearly 2 cwt.; it is made of bell-metal. I missed it in the morning; it was safe the day before; the premises were locked up. I traced the marks of a wheel, about six o'clock in the morning from the premises to his own gate, and in his house I found it; it is worth about 12 l.</p>

            . I am an officer, stationed at Southgate. On Tuesday night, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner wheeling an empty barrow, about one hundred yards from his own house; he said,</p>
               <p>"Good morning Mr. Fitch;" he left the barrow about twenty yards from his house. Next morning I accompanied the prosecutor to where the barrow was, and found a mark in it, which the mouth of the bell, being heavy, had made. I found the bell at his house, covered with sacks. I knew him before.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of March, at Bows-farm, he asked what he had done; I said it was about the bell, stolen from Mr. Gladwin, and which had been found on his premises; he said he left the Cherry-tree public-house, about eleven o'clock, and found the bell in the street, and if he found any thing he thought he had a right to it. The Cherry-tree is about a mile from Southgate.</p>

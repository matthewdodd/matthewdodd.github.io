                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Terry, who lives in Back Church-lane, and is a gunsmith. On the 14th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I went to Mr. Bradley's, a pawnbroker in Cable-street, to redeem two articles I had pledged—when I was entering the door, I took my purse out of my pocket, which contained a sovereign and two duplicates—I took the duplicates out, and replaced the purse with the sovereign in my pocket again—I went towards the counter, and saw the prisoner—she had a kind of red box—she said to me, "This is a very troublesome shop to come to"—I said, "They are all troublesome"—I went to the counter, and offered Mrs. Bradley the two duplicates—I felt some person's hand in my pocket, and a sound to appearance like halfpence and keys which I had in my pocket—I immediately seized the prisoner by the thick part of her arm, while her hand was still in the pocket-hole of my gown—she endeavoured to get from me—a man stood by her, and she held her hand out, and something passed from her to the man—I called out to Mr. Bradley to close the doors, but before he came the man got out, and I lost my sove<lb></lb>reign and purse—I have not seen them since.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 150.) I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, for robbing this woman of a sovereign and a purse—I took her to the station—she was asked her name, and would not give any—I searched her, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on her.</p>

               <p>she never denied it in my presence—she had a knife, and a kind of folding looking-glass, with a kind of red cover—she was remanded twice—the Magistrate asked her how she came to speak to a man in the shop—she stated a man took out two or three parcels, and dropped one, and she gave it him—I cannot say whether Mrs. Terry said she could bring a female who saw her take something from her—I do not recollect—I will not swear she did not—I have seen Mrs. Terry frequently since this—I may have seen her twice in a night—I may have spoken to her a dozen times—I cannot say whether I have spoken on this charge—I was in only one public-house with her—I will not swear I have not been three times—I cannot say whether I have been five times—I do not think I have, I have not drank three times—I have twice I believe, but I will not be positive—I may have drank a drop of porter at her expense—she may have asked me to have a drop of beer—it is half a mile from the public house to the police-office—the public-house is in Back-church-lane—I think I drank once at Mr. Symes's, the Weaver's Arms—that is the house in Back-church-lane—we were not there two minutes—her husband was not there, to my knowledge—I drank—I do not think she did—she never drank with me—the prosecutrix might have given me that drink—that was the only public-house, in Back-church-lane, I ever drank at with her—I have been in a public-house to-day with her—I will not swear, but I do not think I have been in any other except the Weaver's Arms, but I will not be positive—I do not think I have been in three houses—I drank once or twice at her expense—I do not recollect being in any other public-house but the Weaver's Arms—I gave her no instructions what to do in going along—I had not hold of the prisoner all the way—Mrs. Terry did not desire me to do any thing. I do not know that she opened her mouth—she did not desire me to watch her hands for fear she should throw away the purse—there was the sergeant—I believe he was close to me—when we were going down Cable-street, the prisoner made a kind of faint, and I said to my sergeant, "You take one hand and I will take the other"—Mrs. Terry did not desire me to watch her hands—I thought she had the purse—that</p>

He was coming out of the Park, near the statute of the horse at Charing-Cross, about half after three, and the prisoner spoke to him, and he said he would accompany him, they went into a public-house, and drank something; they came out and proceeded some way towards Temple-Bar; and then the prisoner picked up a purse, and told him he would give him his share, and took him to another alehouse, and pulled out the purse, out of which he took a note and a little box; and they went to the Hay-Market to another alehouse, and had some more drink; he took out the purse again, and a ring, and two men joined company with them; and the prisoner said he had no money, but that the prosecutor should give him twenty guineas, and he would give him the whole: there was a ring and a note in the purse; he answered he had no money, but would go and call somebody that could speak English, to settle it: another man said he had money. The prosecutor found a man that could speak <rs id="t17820911-111-viclabel551" type="occupation">Italian</rs>

The prosecutor then went to Temple-Bar, and as he returned, he met the prisoner again; the prisoner called him, and told him if he would have the purse with the things, he should have the money; and the prosecutor told the prisoner he would give two guineas; then this man pulled out his purse to give him the two guineas; and the prisoner snatched his purse out of his hand, and ran away with it, containing fourteen guineas. The prosecutor followed him into a court, and then they searched for about an hour; then they found the prisoner at a house in that court: while they were getting into the first room, the other companion came out of another room; and they found the purse between the bedding and the tick; it is the same purse, he never got any of his money again: he is sure the prisoner is the man who snatched the purse. They had only three pints of ale in the whole, and he had not above half a pint to his share, as they drank none of the last pint, and he was very sober.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my door in Johnson's Court, I keep the Mitre tavern, and the prisoner came and asked me what was the matter, I told him, and he said he would go and see; and he was brought after into our house.</p>
               <p>- GREENOUGH sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the excise. On the 1st of this month I was near Northumberland-house, and I saw this foreigner and another man run up to two men, and he charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110115"></xptr> them with robbing him of fourteen guineas; neither them were the prisoner. While we were finding them, the prisoner came down the court and asked what was the matter: the foreigner laid hold of him, and said he belonged to them. He spoke bad English, and whether he said fourteen or twenty guineas I do not know; he said he had been robbed by them men, first, that they were the persons that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the prosecutor describe it; let him speak it as he did, to the witness? -</p>
               <p>Greenough. He said dey take a de money.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask the prosecutor if he saw that man, Greenough? - Not that he remembers.</p>
               <p>Greenough. Ask him if he does not remember my assisting him to take the men? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I dare say not: I have a great mind to commit this witness; it was impossible for that foreigner to make him understand; I have no doubt but this is one of the gang.</p>
               <p>Constable. My Lord, I detected this witness under the table at the justice's, talking to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. It will be a great justice done him, I believe, to commit him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the prosecutor may be asked if he knows the nature of an oath, and the consequences of taking a false oath? - He says he knows it very well.</p>

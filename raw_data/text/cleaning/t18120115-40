            , at the Bull and Mouth Inn. On this day week, we were delivering some trusses at No. 40, <placeName id="t18120115-40-crimeloc228">Coleman-street</placeName>

When I saw him heaving the box from the bottom of the waggon I attacked him at the time that he had fast hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you loaded the waggon - A. Yes, and he had completely removed it from the bottom where I had packed it; he removed it edgeways; there was a parcel on this side, and that which kept it tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had he only moved it that any part of the trunk remained on the bottom of the waggon - A. No, it did not, it rested upon the other trusses, it was jammed in between the two. I do not think any part of the trunk touched the bottom of the waggon. I seized the prisoner, and held him untill I called my fellow servant; he got an officer, and then I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the country had this come from - A. From Glasgow in Scotland; I was then on the delivery of it.</p>

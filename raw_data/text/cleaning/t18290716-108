            . On the 25th of June, I dined at the Eyre Arms tavern, <placeName id="t18290716-108-crimeloc614">St. John's-wood</placeName>

My wife and some other ladies came to the tavern that evening; I was sober - there were persons passing in and out of the tavern, but this was about six yards from the door: my wife came up to me as he got the watch, and I saw his hand pass, but I did not see the watch go; the deputy-chairman did not join our party till about eight o'clock, when he came down to the garden,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160044"></xptr>where our wives came to have a walk - I went there at half-past two; there were four of us, and we had four bottles of sherry - some of it was left, and some given away; we then took light sherry again - I think not more than four bottles in all - there could not be more than five; the deputy-chairman joined us about seven o'clock, but he sat down while we walked round the gardens.</p>

            , one of our servants, came and told me, on the 28th of June last, that he had seen the prisoner take a parcel of gloves out of one of the presses, and convey them into his counter, where he work'd. I order'd Mr. Figens, our foreman, to wait upon a landing place on the stairs, and I went into a passage and look'd through a hole, to watch his carrying them off. I saw him take them out of the counter and put them into his pocket. He went out with them, and down Fish-Street-Hill. I pursued, and took him in Monument-Yard. I took him back to the door, sent for a constable, and took him to the constable's house, where we took from him twenty-five pair of mens leather gloves. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.) He own'd he took them, and acknowledged them to be our goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Hartley. They cost us 25 s. He was carried before my Lord-mayor, where he confessed he had stole twelve other pair, and sold them to one Dukeshal, in Shoreditch, the Friday before. I got a search warrant, and went to his lodgings in Mint-Street, where I found more gloves of different sorts, one pair of which I can swear to. I went to him since he has been in Newgate, and there he confessed he stole twenty pair from us, and sold them to Dukeshal for 11 d. per pair; and also that he had stole others, and sold them to one Mitchel in Shoreditch</p>
               <p>James Figens. I am foreman to Mess. Warriner and Hartley. On the 28th of June last I saw the prisoner take out these gloves ( taking a parcel in his hand) out of a cupboard in the sore warehouse. He carried them into a back warehouse, where he was at work, and wanted to put them into a cupboard there, but by accident it was lock'd. He open'd a counter, which I heard by a remarkable noise that it makes, and as I found afterwards he had put them in there. I sent him to look at the press, with which we press our gloves, to see if it was not out of order; then I look'd and found the gloves there cover'd with a skin. I let them lie, and went and told Mr. Hartley the case; then I shew'd Mr. Hartley a little hole, where he might look through and see the prisoner put the gloves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130023"></xptr> in his pockets, and I went to stand in a place to watch him. I saw him going out at the door. I went to the counter and saw the gloves were gone. I gave the signal, saying he is gone. Mr. Hartley followed and laid hold of him at the corner of the Monument. I was at the searching of him, and saw the twenty five pair of gloves found upon him. We took him before my Lord-mayor, and there he said but little; only he confessed he took them out of the warehouse, and whose property they were. I heard him acknowledge after that, that he stole from my masters one dozen and twenty pair, and sold them to Mr. Mitchel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise made him to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Figens. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but call'd the following persons to his character.</p>

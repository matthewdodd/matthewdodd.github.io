            , the books were examined, and it seemed to answer the description of Mr. Davis's watch: Mr. Davis attended; the watch was produced, he said it was very much like his watch, but he could not swear to it as the name and number was altered. The prisoner was present at this time and said, he bought this watch six years before at Boston in New England. I went to Mr. Vulliamy's, he examined his books and before he took the watch to pieces, he said, if it was made by him he should find an inside mark, he took it to pieces and the inside number of the watch answered to the number in his book.</p>

            's, man shewed me the watch to see whether it was what I sold to Mr. Davis in November 1773. A day or two after Halliburton came, I said the watch had all the appearance of that I sold to Mr. Davis, but the name was filled out on the cock; at first the plate was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180041"></xptr> very thin where the name and number were; it appears to have been filled; if so it is still thinner, and there is another name and number engraved upon the same plate; the new number 710, but the original was J. Gray, 813; I put the name of Gray because it was a second sort of watch; I don't put my name but upon the better sort; in order to be sure whether this was the same watch or not; I said, I would look upon the inside, upon which we usually scratch the number before we send it the workman. I took the watch to pieces and found the mark I made myself upon the inside the same as the number in my book; it was entered in my book by this number as sold to Mr. Davis. I am as certain as I can be of any thing that it was the watch I sold to Mr. Davis. I don't rely merely on these figures, the watch is my own making, and I know it from the work itself, watchmakers know their own work.</p>

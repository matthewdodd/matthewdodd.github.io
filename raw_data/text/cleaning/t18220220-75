            , of Stamford-hill. On Thursday, the 11th of February, some pale malt, which had come from Mr. Taylor, of Bishop Stortford, was carted from our wharf, to Messrs. Hanbury's brewhouse; the sacks were marked I. T., and the barge had his name on it. Twenty-six sacks or thirteen quarters, were put into a cart which the prisoner, Merry, drove. I gave him a delivery ticket; it was about six o'clock in the morning, and he had another load of the same quantity between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it your duty to see the cart loaded - A. Yes; I assisted in carting, and stood within seven feet of the barge - he loaded his own cart, and did not complain that his number was not right - we count the sacks in the cart.</p>

            . I am storehouse-keeper at Messrs. Trueman and Hanbury's brewhouse. I applied to Armstrong, and between twelve and one o'clock saw Merry drive his cart in with three others, driven by Dearman, Nichols, and Tyler. Merry drove the third, and I believe his was the third that was unloaded. Here is the delivery ticket which he gave me - it is for thirteen quarters, and only twelve came. I went up to Merry, and asked him if he had not some sacks concealed about him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I have a sack." I put my hand round him, and felt one under his clothes, marked J. T., which is Taylor's mark. I took Dearman into custody, and while I was so doing, I observed Merry get into his cart, and doing something to the sacks; he came down - I gave him in charge of Armstrong, then got up in the cart, and found an old great coat pressed between the sacks of malt where I had seen him, and in the coat was another sack, marked J. T. I asked if the coat was his - he said it was not; but he supposed some person must have thrown it in the cart. I went with Armstrong to the White Hart, Newington, kept by Chapman, and found young Armstrong there, talking to Samme. Armstrong, Sen., asked him if he had had any malt in there that afternoon, pointing to the storehouse; he said he had not. Armstrong said,</p>
               <p>"You must open the door, or I will break it open." Samme then took a key from his pocket, and undid the padlock. We there found two sacks of pale malt, one marked I. T., and a small quantity of pale malt in a third sack, and about two sacks shot in the bin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the carmen. - A. Only by sight. I know Merry's was the third cart - I saw them come in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You heard Armstrong ask Samme if he had any malt in that day. - A. Yes; we got there about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>"Have you, or is there any malt left here to-day." We then stood close to the storehouse door. I said,</p>

Hanbury &amp; Co.'s; sixteen quarters or thirty-two sacks were put in the prisoner's cart, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and a delivery ticket was given him; he stowed them himself - the sacks were marked I.

            . I am storehouse-keeper to Villebois &amp; Co. I was in the yard when the prisoner came with his cart of malt. I asked if he had any sacks concealed round his body, or if he had seen any malt dropped by the way; he said he had not, he had never stole a grain of malt in his life. His was the first cart that came in. I took him to Armstrong in the lobby; and, after being there a short time, he said he must go up the yard and put the nose-bags on the horses - I went with him. I had taken Dearman and Merry before that, which he knew. Church came up - I told him to point out the man who put the sacks under the manger; he said it was the prisoner; he made no reply. I had taken him about ten minutes after he came into the yard; he was very near the stable-door, and might have gone in many times without my noticing him - the stable-door was ten or twelve yards from the cart.</p>

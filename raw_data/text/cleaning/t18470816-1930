                  </hi> I am a billiard-room keeper at 218, Regent-street. The prisoners lived in my service as errand-boys, and attended to the rooms and to the playing—I had a box in a drawer in the kitchen, containing a small box with the notes and money stated in the indictment—I went out on Sunday, the 25th of July, and left everything safe—I did not leave either of the prisoners on the premises—when I returned I found the kitchen door fastened inside with a chisel—I pushed it open, and found the box on the kitchen table, opened, and everything gone out of it—I went into the area, and found the steps placed against the gate, and the gate open—I called in a policeman, and the prisoners were afterwards taken—Bear said he was induced by Blerton to go down the area with him, and it was him that opened the box with the chisel.</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Drummond Woolf, of Half-moon-street, Piccadilly. On Sunday, the 25th of July, I was walking with the prisoners up Regent-street—Bear left me, to go down to see if his master wanted him, and he went down the area—Blerton said, "We will stand here"—we stood on the other side of the railing, a little way off—I thought I heard the door open, and I said to Blerton, "What is that?"—he said, "It is the kitchen door"—presently Bear came, and called, "George"—Blerton went to him on the other side, and I saw him hand him a box—Blerton then got down, and I thought he lifted up a ladder—they then both came out, and ran across the road—I asked what they were running for; if they had been doing anything—they said, No, they were only running out of the way of the carriages—we went down by the corner of Hanover-square—Blerton turned to see if anybody was behind him—I said, "What have you been doing, have you been robbing the house?"—he said, "No," and he was going to punch my head for saying so—we got into Brook-street, and Blerton said, "I am going out of town"—I said, "What a storyteller you are; you said you had but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and wanted to borrow something of me"—he said, "Yes, but Bear has been down and got some money"—he pulled out a box and gave Bear a sovereign and a half, and some silver—Bear had some silver before that—when we got into Curzon-street, Blerton said to me, "I will give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will change a bank-note for me where you change your master's checks"—I said, no, if it was stolen I should have to abide by the consequences—he said, "If you will, I will give you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—I said, no, I would not—we got into some mews in Park-lane, and Blerton offered me a sovereign—I refused it, as I thought it had been stolen—Blerton took out a knife, and said he would stick it into my ribs if I ever said such a thing again—I did not receive the sovereign—I do not think this is the box that was taken—I thought it was a box with the corners rounded off, and larger—it was mounted in gold—I saw Blerton with two bank-notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Blerton.</hi> He did receive the sovereign, Bear gave it to him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Bear said he did not give it me, but that Blerton did; but I did not receive it.</p>

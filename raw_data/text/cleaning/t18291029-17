            . I am a labourer in the London-docks. I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw Mr. Shedder; I did not see the prisoner near him, but saw him throw the handkerchief down close at my feet - nobody was pursuing him; three or four young lads were just before him - he was trying to make his escape: I collared him, and took the handkerchief up - Mr. Shedder owned it when he turned round; I was merely passing along.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I saw the prisoner standing at the end of Fleet-market, alone; I watched him for ten minutes - I saw him follow Mr. Shedder and a gentleman, and attempt his pocket; he did not succeed at first - I was crossing to see if he had picked the pocket, but a coach passing prevented me; when I got over I found him in custody - the handkerchief was delivered to me; the prosecutor's initials are on it: he tried to get away - I took another person, knowing him to be a suspicious character.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

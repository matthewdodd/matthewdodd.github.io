               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you think it was possible for me to make a mistake in the hats? A. I cannot say - they were on one table.</p>
               <p>MARY COURCELL. I keep the coffee-house, and remember the prosecutor coming in to dine; I saw the prisoner take a hat, but I did not know but it was his own; there was one hat left behind.</p>
               <p>THOMAS YOUNG. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner running - the bags were given to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My friends are out of town; I have not let them know, as I am afraid it would injure their feelings, and perhaps be the death of them.</p>

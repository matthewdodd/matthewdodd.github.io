                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Ashford, in Middlesex, On the morning of the 24th of December I missed a cream—coloured, long<lb></lb>stailed gelding from my straw-yard there—I afterwards saw the same geld<lb></lb>ing at the stable of the Griffin Inn, at Kingston, in Surrey—Ashford is about fourteen miles from Hyde-park corner—I afterwards attended before the magistrate, and saw the horse—the magistrate's clerk, Mr. Horne, took down the evidence—but he is not here.</p>

                  </hi> I am a constables of Kingston, which is about eight or nine miles from Ashford. On the night of the 23rd of December, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock I met the prisoner at Kingston, leading a cream-coloured horse—I stopped him, and asked where ha was going with it—he said, "To London market"—I asked him, "What for?"—he said, "To sell it"—I asked him where he brought it from—he said at first, "From Staines"—then he told me brought it from Weyhill, in Hamp<lb></lb>shire—I told him I should detain him and the horse, as his story did not satisfy me—I should take him before the mayor and if they were satisfied, I should be—I put him into the watch-house, and looked the horse up at the Griffin Inn; and on Thursday, the 24th, Mr. Sherborn came and owned owned it—I went before the mayor that day at Sunbury, which is five miles from Kingston.</p>

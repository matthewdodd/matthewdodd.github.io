            . I am a watchman. On Saturday night at 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing down an alley in Cable-street, which is no thoroughfare; I asked what he did there. He said, he was waiting for a friend. I found every house there fastened up, and as I returned he was gone. He returned in half an hour, I saw him lurking about on the other side of the way. At half past three o'clock I took him coming out of the alley, and found the lead in a doorway there - it is half a mile from Harwood's house. I can swear he is the man - I know his features, and he was dressed the same both times; he ran away when I went towards him; I ran and caught him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about the lead." Nobody had spoken to him about it.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 21st of July, about three o'clock in the morning I was going up the alley, and the prisoner came out, and on seeing me he made a stoop, as if he had been there for a certain purpose. I saw the lead lying by him, and called the watchman to stop him - he was secured, and I took the lead up.</p>

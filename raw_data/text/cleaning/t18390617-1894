                  </hi>. I live in Leman-street, Whitechapel, and am a watchmaker. On the 6th of June I saw the prisoner in my house, about half-past eleven o'clock—he said he was captain and owner of the ship <hi rend="italic">Johanna,</hi> from Hamburgh to New York, and wanted to buy some watches—I showed him eight or nine—he was with me about two hours—he gave me an order for about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of watches and time-pieces—he did not select them—he left it entirely to me—he said he was not particu<lb></lb>lar what the amount was—after he was gone I missed a watch—on the next day two young men came into my shop—I made inquiries of them, and I had reason to believe that the prisoner was neither a captain nor an owner of a ship—he afterwards came and dined with me—I had heard he was an impostor, but he gave himself such a good character that I did not suspect him—I afterwards found my watch in pawn.</p>

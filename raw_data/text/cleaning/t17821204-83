               <p>Prisoner's counsel. There was, I believe, a very great croud? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was very much pressed upon by the people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not detect the prisoner in the very act? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you saw a hand before you felt any pluck from your pocket? - I do.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear whose hand it was? - I can very safely.</p>

               <p>I picked up a watch on Ludgate-hill, I did not know who it belonged to; as I was going along a person pulled me by the leg, and immediately I looked down and saw the watch.</p>

               <p>I was going to the play, and there were a great many people waiting to see Lord Rodney, he came in two or three minutes, and they laid hold of me; there was a great croud; they searched me, and found nothing on me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

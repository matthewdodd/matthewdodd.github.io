"Go there, and get a pair of boots and a bundle, which I left there last night; your cousin shall stop here with your bundle, and I will go and get a pint of beer;" I went, and when I returned he was gone, and the bundle.</p>

I said I would rather keep my bundle; and he said "It is not your's, it is your cousin's." He took it from me. I went on to the place, and when I came back he was gone with it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of July, a little after three o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming along Ratcliff-highway. I stopped him with this bundle under his arm, and asked what it was. He said "Unmade slops for my mother." I asked where she lived - he said up this way. When I got about half way up Blue-coat-fields, he said he was sorry he had told me a lie - that he bought it of a man for two shillings.</p>

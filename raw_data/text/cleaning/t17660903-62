               <p>On Friday the 18th in the morning, I was going to Whitechapel to see my father and mother in Three-un alley; I met with a man, who said he had some old silver to dispose of; I said I knew a young fellow a Jew, I would ask him if he knew any body that would buy it; I went and spoke to him, and he went and got this Markas Garrick; he told him to go to a public-house; then Alexander came and said Garrick was at the top of the street, and he desired me to take the plate, because Garrick would not buy it of any body but me; I never had it about me till that minute; it was delivered to me in the open street; then Garrick took me to a public-house and hand-cuffed me; Garrick and Alexander came to me when I was in the Gatehouse, and said, for 3 or 4 l. they would get the bill thrown out.</p>
               <p>Garrick. I went into the Gatehouse to a Jew that was there; when I was talking to the Jew, the prisoner came and said, when you have done with him, I should be glad to speak with you. Then I went to him; he took me into a little room, and said, it will be a discredit to my parents, and to throw my money away on counsel is doing nothing, it will be better to put it in your pocket to get the bill thrown out; I did say yes, fearing I should have a knife run through me; he mentioned three, four, or six guineas, and said, I have got a brother can advance it; but I never went near him since.</p>

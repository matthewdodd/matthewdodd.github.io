            , a saddler, in Vere Street. On the morning of the 6th of May I was at work, and saw the prisoner through a window which has a view of the street - I saw him pass on the opposite side of the way, and he was taking a red silk handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket; it was similar to this - he put it into his right-hand trousers pocket; I ran out, took him, and called the prosecutor - I said to the prisoner "You have robbed that gentleman;" he said "Let me go - let me go" - he produced the handkerchief from the same pocket, and I gave it to the gentleman; the prisoner lifted up the pocket with his left hand and took it with his right.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MURTON. I am an officer. I received this handkerchief from the prosecutor - I searched the prisoner at the station; I found two silk handkerchiefs in his right-hand pocket, and one round his neck - I found 10s. in silver and 6d. in copper on him.</p>

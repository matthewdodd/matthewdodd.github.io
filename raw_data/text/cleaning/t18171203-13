               <p>MR. WILLIAM WHITMORE. On the 18th of November I was in <placeName id="t18171203-13-crimeloc76">Throgmorton-street</placeName>

Brown came round on my right side and the other on my left. As I passed between them I felt Thomas's hand in my waistcoat pocket. As soon as I got clear of them, I put my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket-book, which contained a 5l., a 2l., and three 1l. notes. I turned round, and saw 
               <persName id="t18171203-13-person164">Thomas</persName>
             a few yards before me; I ran up to him-he took to his heels as hard as he could, and crossed Broad-street - I called out Stop thief! he was stopped; I came up in half a minute - I never lost sight of him. Several people came round him; one of them gave me my pocket-book; the other prisoner was taken and brought up, and the constable took them both. I am positive he is one of them - I saw them both walking together before they came up to me.</p>

            . I am a bank-porter. I saw the prisoners running, and Mr. Whitmore following them. I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book and run on. When they came to the corner of the street Thomas was stopped. While they were taking him to the Mansion-house, Brown was standing in the street and was secured.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SCOTT. I was in Threadneedle-street about a quarter of an hour before this happened, and saw the prisoners in company together. Brown stepped up to a gentleman, and attempted his pocket, which was rather open-the gentleman turned into a coffee-house. When I returned, I found Thomas in custody, and saw Brown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181712030009"></xptr>standing at the corner of Throgmorton-street; I pointed him out, and the officer took him. I am sure he is the boy.</p>

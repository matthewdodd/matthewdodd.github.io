                  </hi>. I am clerk in the employ of Messrs. Sherwood, of Lambeth, and live in Belvidere-crescent, Lambeth—at half-past nine on Mon<lb></lb>day evening, the 1 lth of September, I came from Messrs. Sherwood's counting-house—in going across Belvidere-road I saw a light in Mr. Watts's house, which is opposite Mr. Sherwood's—I went down the road some distance and still observed the light—I went back, stood with my back towards the gate, and still saw the light—it moved down stairs—I crossed and knocked a gentle tap at the door—I was not certain whether Mrs. Watts was at home—as soon as I tapped I stepped back a pace or two and looked at the fan-light over the door—I saw the light immediately go out—there is a yard for build<lb></lb>ing materials adjoining Mr. Watts's house—directly the light went out I heard the bolts of the back door drawn—I looked through the crevices of the</p>

               <p>building-yard door, and it being very moonlight I saw a person get over a wall about six feet high, and slide down the building materials up against the wall separating the yard from Captain Watts's premises—the man then went in an angle across the yard, and climbed up the building materials—I ran round the premises in a direction which I expected he would come—he peeped down, saw me, and began to retrace his steps—several pieces of wood fell down with him—I could hear his footsteps at the other end of the wall in a direct angle across the yard—he jumped over the gate I had been peeping through, nearly into the centre of the road—I had then retraced my steps to the corner of the fencing, and saw him just descending into the road—I ran up and caught hold of him—I thrust him across the road into Mr. Sherwood's court-yard, which is well lighted, and called for assistance—he then struggled very violently, and I had his face full to the gas-light, not more than six feet from it—he at last succeeded in getting away from me—I had had him last by the arms, and was afraid he would strike me—his hat was knocked off, and he ran off—I followed him—when he arrived at some houses, called Kelham-place, sixty or seventy yards off, I distinctly saw him throw some things in the area of one of the houses, and heard them most distinctly against the wall—I was very near him, almost touching his coat—some other person joined in the pursuit—he went as far as Edward-street—he went down there into the York-road, and at the end there I lost sight of him—I could not run any farther, and called out "Stop thief"—a great many persons were in pursuit of him—I waited two or three minutes—I can swear that the man brought back to me by the policeman was the man I had seen before—it was the prisoner—I went to the house in Kelham-place—the lady was standing at the door—she went down into the area with a light—I stooped and saw her pick up something—she brought these things and delivered them to me—I gave them to the police<lb></lb>man—some other things were brought to me by some gentleman, which I gave to the same policeman—this thimble was afterwards picked up in the road—it was not brought to me—the middle of the Belvidere-road is about thirty or forty yards from Captain Watts's—the prisoner ran directly down the centre of the road, so if any thing had been found in the middle of the road, thirty or forty yards from the house, it would have been in the direc<lb></lb>tion he took—he ran past the fence of Kelham-place—the fourth house down is No. 39—he threw the things there.</p>

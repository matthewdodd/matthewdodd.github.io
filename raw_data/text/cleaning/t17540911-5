               <p>Duke. It is worth about 15 s.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop on the 7th of August as I was going on an errand, and saw him come out and put the violin under his coat. The woman of the shop came out and called, Stop him, Stop him. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him taken?</p>
               <p>Pearson. No, I did not. I saw a man bring him back into the shop, and saw a violin produced there, but can't say it is the same I saw before.</p>

            . When they cried, Stop Thief, the prisoner had the violin and a bow under his coat. A porter stopp'd him and they both fell down. The prisoner dropp'd the violin, and I took it up and would have given it him, but he denied it being his property. The mob carried him to Mr. Duke's shop, and there I saw a violin produced, but whether it is that which fell from the prisoner I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence</p>
               <p>As I was going through the Red Lion passage, there I heard there was a siddle dropp'd, but I know nothing of it. I am by trade a shoemaker.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon within. On the 15th of December, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Newgate-street, and met the two prisoners, and another person with them, coming down Newgate-street, towards Giltspur-street - Stone had got a flat of butter on his shoulder; I called to Lloyd, and told him my suspicions, and we ran down Newgate-street, and found they had all three stopped in Giltspur-street, and Mills was in the act of taking the flat of butter from Stone; he put it on his shoulder, and they went on; the third man turned, saw us coming, and crossed over the other side of the way, and gave a whistle - the prisoners turned down Windmill-court, which is no thoroughfare; we stood, and as they came out of the court we stopped them - Mills had then got the flat on his shoulder; they were both together - we stopped them; Lloyd asked Mills where he was going to take the flat - he said he was going to Mr. Smith's, in Whitechapel; we opened the flat, and it contained butter - there was a bill inside the flat; we then took them to the watch-house, and went out into Newgate-street to make inquiry -Hedges came to the watch-house.</p>

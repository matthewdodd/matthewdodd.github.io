            . On the 24th of November in the evening, near eight o'clock, a lady came into the shop very hastily, and said that a person had taken a barrel of oysters out of the window, and went through a court just adjoining; immediately afterwards I pursued him as far as Bucklersbury, and overtook him, and took the oysters from the person of the prisoner; he had contrived to take off the direction, but the barrel having Mr. Ross's name stamped on it, I could swear to their being Mr. Ross's property. I secured the prisoner, and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I came from Leadenhall-street, in Dove-court I saw this barrel of oysters; I took it up, and coming into Lothbury that gentleman overtook me, and said it was his barrel of oysters; I said, if it is take it; he said, a gentlewoman saw a man take it out of the shop; I said, have the goodness to bring her to me, and she will satisfy you it is not me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Albemarle-street. The prisoner Merriman was in my employ for three weeks, and he lived with me before—in consequence of information which I received, before the 2nd of January, I applied at the station-house for some policeman to watch my premises—some mutton and meat was produced to me, at the station-house, on the 2nd January—I am sure it is my property, be<lb></lb>cause I know the fat—I had missed a shoulder of mutton and a neck from the shop, and some suet and fat—I know nothing of Jenner—I had seen the property safe the afternoon before—I knew the suet by its coming out of a particular bullock—it is very rich—we were obliged to put it to go away as fat, and the mutton we know—it is scored in a particular way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Spreckley. On Friday morning, the 2nd of January, I and the prisoner Merriman were in my master's shop from ten minutes before six o'clock to about ten minutes after—we were left alone in the shop—Merriman asked me if I was going to have any coffee—I said I did not know—he came to me and said, "I will toss you for some"—I tossed, and won two cups of coffee, which was 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling to go and get it and pay for it—he told me to have mine at the coffee-shop and to pay for his—I went out to the coffee-shop by the Arcade in Piccadilly, and had some coffee—I re<lb></lb>turned to the shop in about five minutes, and saw him altering some shoulders of mutton, changing the places where I had hung them—I said, "What are you changing them for?"—he made no reply, and went out—he came back in about five minutes, and in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, a person named Stone called, and in consequence of what he said to me, I examined the mutton and missed a shoulder—it had hung up in the part where he was altering them—I had hung it up myself—I saw that shoulder of mutton at Marl borough-street—I knew it by a mark on it—it is in Court—it was in its proper place in the shop when I tossed for</p>

               <p>the coffee, and when I went out—it must have been removed in the five minutes I was absent; and he was hanging up more fresh ones with the others when I returned.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 99.) In consequence of information I received, I watched the shop of Mr. Spreckley on the 2nd of January, in the morning, and a little before six o'clock I saw the shop door open, and two men come out—in a few minutes afterwards those two men came back with a cart—while the cart stood at the door, I saw Jenner come down Albemarle-street with a basket under his arm—he crossed over Piccadilly and went towards the Green-park—he came back again and went up Al<lb></lb>bemarle-streetagain, and looked into the shop-door—the cart was gone away then—he went half-way up the street, crossed over, and stood there for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then went back to the shop and stood at the corner of Piccadilly—I went past him, and saw the basket was empty, except a cloth—he walked past the shop, stood there a few minutes, and while he was there I saw a boy come out of the shop—directly the boy got into Piccadilly, the prisoner Jenner ran across the road into the shop with the basket under his arm—he came out without it and went towards Piccadilly—while he went towards Piccadilly, I saw Merriman come out at the shop door, and look up and down the street—he then went into the shop, and came out with the basket full, and a cloth over it—he placed it on the step of the next door, and went to the shop door again—Jenner ran over to the shop door, and had some conversation with him—then Merriman went inside the shop, and Jenner went and took the basket from the door.</p>

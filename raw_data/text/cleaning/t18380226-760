                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at, Portland-town. On the 12th of February I met the prisoner Hogan in a public-house in Hol<lb></lb>born, about five or six o'clock—I was sober—I left her, and told her I would return about nine o'clock, which I did, and went to a house with her—I agreed to stop all night with her—she took me to George-street, St. Giles's, into a room up stairs—I took off my coat and hat, and had been there a very few minutes when the prisoner Jones came in—I did not lie down, and had nothing to do with them—when Jones came in they</p>

About twelve o'clock on the night in question, I met Jones in George-street, St. Giles's, with this coat in her apron—I asked her what she had got there—she said it was her brother's coat, and she had brought it from Lambeth—I took her to the station-house—I went out in search, and found the prosecutor at a house in George-street—he gave me the account he has given now—he was per<lb></lb>fectly sober—I apprehended Hogan about three o'clock in the rooming—the was quite sober.</p>

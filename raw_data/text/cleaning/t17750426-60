On the 6th of March, my wife who had been at London, came home in the afternoon; we went into the parlour, and missed twenty guineas out of the bureau; by carelessness, my bureau was left unlocked, and the key lay upon it. The house door was not locked, because it is a public house, and a thoroughfare; but the door of the parlour in which the bureau was, was locked up, and my wife had the key of it in her pocket; when she came home she missed the money, and asked me in a great fright what I had done with it. I advised her to make no noise about it, and we might probably hear of it again.

            . I lodge in the back building in Mr. Parkinson's house; my chimney was swept the 6th of March, there were some peculiar circumstances attending the sweeping of it; this boy, the prisoner, came about two or three in the afternoon, and begged very hard for leave to sweep my chimney, in order to get the foot; he said, he had got but half a bushel of foot, and he was obliged to bring a bushel home, or else his master would beat him; he begged leave to sweep my chimney; I gave him leave; he went up once, and continued a long time, then he came down, and brought but little foot. I observed that, and said the chimney was not so foul as I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260036"></xptr> it had been. Said he, the other part of the foot is lying up in a part of the chimney, I must go up again. I refused at first to let him go up, I said that as there was a slit in the chimney I was afraid he would burst it out; he said he would go up, and up he went; I put something on the fire to prevent his burning of his feet: he staid up a great while that time; when he came down again, a pretty great quantity came, and down tumbled this candlestick, (producing it) that astonished me. I thought it an odd place to find an iron candlestick in; I knew it immediately to be my landlord Parkinson's candlestick that they burnt a candle in their chimney, for purpose of watching a sick child.

               <p>Prosecutor. This candlestick stood in our chimney ever since last Christmas, on account of a sick child we had in the room, therefore we burnt a light at night in that iron candlestick. I set it upon the hub of the chimney. It is all one stack of chimnies between mine and the back building, Simmonds lives in the two buildings joined, so that any one that goes up one chimney might easily get down the other.</p>

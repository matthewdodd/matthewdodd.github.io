            . I am a watchman of Blackfriarsbridge. About half-past eight o'clock at night on the 6th of September, the prosecutor delivered the prisoner and handkerchief to me; he charged him with stealing it - he denied the charge; I searched him at the Compter, but found nothing on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A little boy told me there was a fire at Guildford-street, over the water; I was going over the bridge - two men were on before me, and the handkerchief was thrown right on my breast; I looked at it - the gentleman turned round, and said I had his handkerchief; I gave it him immediately.</p>

I laid down on the grass to sleep; I had a 1l. bank note in my right hand trowsers pocket-Clark awoke me, and I missed it-the prisoner was pointed out. We went up to him, and said he had robbed me - He at first denied it, and then said he did take it out of my pocket, and had thrown it away-it has never been found.</p>
               <p>WALTER CLARK. I am a smith, and live in Sherard-street, Golden-square. I was in a room commanding a view of the Park, and saw the prosecutor sleeping on the grass - I saw the prisoner put his hand to the prosecutor's pocket several times, and take a piece of paper out - He then got up and walked away. I ran out, awoke the prosecutor, and told him of it. The prisoner turned round, and saw me; I said he had been robbing the man - He denied it. When I took him to the prosecutor, he said he did take it, and if I would give him time he would find it, as he had dropped it. We gave him half an hour to find it, but he could not.</p>

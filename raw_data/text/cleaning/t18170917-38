On the 2d of May, about six o'clock in the morning, I went into the garden, and missed the property and twenty-one rabbits - They were safe the night before. I traced the footsteps of two persons. The prisoner's son is eighteen years of age - He has been tried here. I saw the rabbits found under the ground-floor of the prisoner's house, the same day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I never saw the prisoner on the premises.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Brown, who lives in the neighbourhood of Mr. Druce. I received information, and went to the prisoner's house with the officer, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 2d of May; I found eleven rabbits under the floor, and a box of marking-irons, concealed under some wrapper and rubbish in the garden, and a quantity of new potatoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The house is a quarter of a mile from Mr. Druce's.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PAYNTER. My garden joins the prisoner's. I saw the goods at six o'clock on the 2d of May, which was an hour before the officers came; I had seen him constantly for four or five days before, he lived at home; I never saw him afterwards until Sunday the 20th of July-if he had been at home I must have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His sons could not manage the garden by themselves.</p>

            . I am a gardener at Fulham. On the day after the robbery, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to me and said, "I suppose you have heard about my affair; I told him I had, and was very sorry; he said,"what do you think they can do to me?" I told him he had better surrender and impeach the rest - He shook his head, but made no reply. I told him if the guilt was brought home to him the law would transport him; he said some advised him to surrender and some not. I then left him, and did not see him after. I used to pass his garden two or three times daily, but never saw him - I used to see him every day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have told the very words he said. He said some told him to surrender to get his son off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got a constant place in the country, and used to come home every Saturday night.</p>

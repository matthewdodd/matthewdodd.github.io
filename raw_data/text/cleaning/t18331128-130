             (police-sergeant I 20). On the 23rd of October, I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road, about a quarter-past seven o'clock; I met the prisoner carrying this bundle; I said, "Halloo young one, where are you going with that?" he said, "They are things belonging to a servant maid, and I am taking them to No. 94, Park-lane; I said, "No person would allow you to carry them there in these rags - where did you bring them from?" he said, from Kensington, and if I would go to Park-lane, I should see it was right; I said, no, I would take him to Kensington; he went on with me for ten or fifteen yards, and then turned, and said, "My statement is false, they are my things - I brought them from Notting-hill, near Acton." I then said, "Where does your mother live;" he said,"She did live in Wild-court, Wild-street, but she is removed to near Ealing; I am bringing these things there;" I took him to the station-house, and found this bill of parcels inside the bundle.</p>

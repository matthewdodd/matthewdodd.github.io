               <p>Wm Monksfield. I am servant to Mr. Everett. On the 7th of March, about three o'clock, I was in the warehouse at the desk, which is just behind the door. The door was open, and the cloth stood in a corner, so that the door prevented my seeing the cloth. I heard a foot come in and go out again, but did not see the person. I went out at the door, and then saw the prisoner with a piece of superfine crimson under his arm, about half a dozen yards from the door. I called and asked him what business he had with that cloth. He immediately turned round, and, seeing me, dropt the cloth, and ran. I called to a gentleman to stop him, which he did, and brought him to the warehouse door. I took up the cloth and brought it in. (Produced and deposed to.) He was near out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether there was not a man came into the warehouse before?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050003"></xptr>Monksfield. There was a man came in, and asked for one Mr. Switt. I told him I knew no such person, and he turned and went out again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>That man asked me if I would earn a shilling. I was willing to earn it. He desired me to carry that piece of cloth to Bishopsgate-street, and delivered it to me, and said he would be there as soon as I. I took it under my arm, and when the gentleman called stop thief, I was afrighted, and throwed it down. I went along with him willingly, and the gentleman that delivered the cloth to me went another way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Monksfield. How long before you saw the prisoner with the cloth was it that the other man came into the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Monksfield. That man came into the warehouse I believe about ten minutes before I saw the prisoner.</p>

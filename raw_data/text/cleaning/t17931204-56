I told him to walk in, I had seen him the Sunday before; he walked in, and sat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040150"></xptr>down, and went to breakfast with my husband and me; after I had poured out a cup of tea, he said, he could not drink his tea without a pint of beer, if I had no objection, he would go and fetch one; I told him, I had no objection at all; and he went and fetched a pint, and brought it in his hand; he went to the Star in Aldersgate-street, a public house, and brought it in one of their pots; when he brought it in, he said, he should be very much obliged to my husband, if we had a silver pint to pour it in. There was a silver pint in the legacy, and a silver cup, he had seen them, and drank out of them the Sunday before. It was in the cupboard in the room where we were; I went to the closet to reach it out, while he was there, he saw me take the pint out from among the other things; there were some buttons which we did not know at first, whether they were gold, or no; and he advised to try aqua-fortis, my husband said, he had tried it, and found they were not gold. After breakfast, my husband and he set off from our house; by this time, it was about half past nine; at about half past ten he came back to our house in a very great hurry, he said, there was hell or the devil to pay, one or the other; I asked him what it was about, he said, about a medal that was missing, that the lawyer said, that my husband had received the medal with the plate on Sunday, he said, if the medal was missing, it was worth thirty guineas; he says, your husband has sent me down for the inventory of the plate, which you have got in your pocket, and all the plate; and I delivered to him the inventory, and all the plate; he said, my husband was not to receive one thing more, till he had taken the plate up there; with that I took all the plate out of the cupboard, and put it on the table for him, and he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else taken? - He read the inventory over, and he said, there was a watch short, I told him, the watch hung upon the nail; after he had put all the other things into his bag, he went and took the watch down himself, and put it into his pocket, and says, I will be glad, if you will give me a drop of water; I will take a coach, and make as much haste as ever I can after your husband. I did not suspect, but what he came from my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things afterwards, or your watch? - No, never. I am very sure, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You have mentioned of me having a pint of porter at my breakfast, did you drink any gin on Monday morning? - Yes, you had gin, but I did not touch the gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to inform the court, whether or no you had not a child before you was married.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very improper question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You remember, on Sunday the 24th of November, your coming to drink tea at Mr. Croft's in Exeter-street. You remember going out, and getting change for a guinea, and coming back very much intoxicated? - I had no guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. After you returned home, the tea was made; do you remember the circumstance of your husband attempting to strike you across the table, and knocking down all the cups and saucers, and throwing a dish or two of tea over me. My Lord, the husband of this woman charged her with embezzling property to her own relations, before this time; some of the words he made use of were, you drunken whore keep from your thieving, swindling relations. You have taken a deal of property from me for them, and you also had a bastard before I married you.</p>

             did not charge his wife with making away of his property to her relations? - No, I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, before you give a decisive opinion upon this matter, I most humbly beg to place a few circumstances before you, relative to the evidence given by these two treacherous women, particularly Mrs. Croft, who has declared that she brought forth and delivered the property to me; is it consistent with reason that a woman would deliver such a property into the hands of a mere stranger, unless she was mad or drunk? if you consider her mad I trust her evidence will be of no avail; if drunk, I doubt not but you will be of the same opinion; with respect to the other evidence, no doubt but Mrs. Croft and she had revelled with the chearful glass together, that destrustion of mankind, and as connected with Mrs. Croft, it is not to be persumed but she will do any thing to reinstate Mrs. Croft into unity with her husband, which by her own imprudence, she has lost. I trust also that if you think her guilty of committing of one embezzlement, though her husband will not allow it now, I hope you will also think her guilty of another Unhappy for me I am pointed out to be the object of her treachery; there have been instances of women when they have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040152"></xptr>to a knowledge of their foibles, being known to any one individual, for fear of their divulging it, have not stuck at any thing to gain their point, to the overthrow of the individual, and what is there that a woman will not do that has deviated from the path of virtue? what is there that she is not capable of doing? I shall now conclude, putting my whole trust and confidence in you, making no doubt but you will weigh the case with humanity, and dispel the heavy cloud that now hangs over me.</p>

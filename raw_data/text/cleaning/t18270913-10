The prisoner immediately flung a great stone at the watchman - there was nobody else to heave it but him; there had been no conversation between him and the watchman; I spoke to the watchman just by Baker's-row - the prisoner did not hear what I said, as I whispered; he was standing at a short distance; I walked by the side of the watchman to near Whitechapel workhouse, about ten yards - the prisoner was behind, about three yards from me - another man was walking just before us: we continued walking on, with the watchman behind, till we came to the workhouse; the watchman did not speak to the prisoner, he only said, "Let the poor woman go home;" the prisoner never said a word, but directly flung a stone - I did not see it thrown - he could hear the watchman say let the woman go home; the stone then immediately came at the watchman, and knocked him right down; I did not see the prisoner throw it, as my back was towards him; I heard it rattle, turned round, and saw the watchman on the ground; we were almost side by side, but he was rather behind me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not a very short time from the time the watchman came up till he fell? A. It might be ten minutes; it began and ended in ten minutes. I never saw the prisoner before - he was as sober as a Judge; it was about two o'clock, and a very fine night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it moonlight? A. Yes, my Lord, and there are gaslights in the street; I happened to be out - I was looking after a person I wished to see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing before he threw the stone? A. He never said a word, and the watchman never said a word; he never spoke afterwards - the stone was flung directly he said, "Let her go home"- there was a gentleman before me, who picked up the stone; I could see him: he could not have thrown the stone without my seeing him, as he was walking before me; there was nobody else in the street on that side of the way. The prisoner ran away directly the stone was flung - he ran down the road behind us. I was quite sober - I had not tasted a glass of liquor that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you complained of him to the watchman? A. I only asked him to see me home.</p>

            . I am a silk-weaver. On the morning of the 24th of July, about two o'clock, or rather after, I was in Whitechapel-road - I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, and Mrs. Gray was walking towards Whitechapel; I was coming from Mile-end, and was about six yards before them - Gray was walking rather first, the deceased next, and the prisoner behind - they arrived nearly at the end of the workhouse, and then all three stopped; I stopped, standing before them; the deceased said to the woman, "You had better follow that man (meaning me) and then you will be safe" - the woman then said to the prisoner, "You go about your business;" the prisoner answered, "He shall not follow you," meaning that the watchman should not follow her; he had both his hands behind him - he took his left hand from behind him, and immediately threw a stone at the watchman - I saw the stone, and saw him throw it at the watchman, who was about two yards or two yards and a half from him - it struck him rather above the left ear, towards the temple; he directly fell forward on his face, and the prisoner ran away directly - he appeared quite sober; I directly ran after him, hallooing Stop thief! a young man stopped him at the end of the road, and delivered him up to me - I never lost sight of him. I and the other young man delivered him up to the watchman directly; I afterwards assisted in conveying the deceased to the Hospital; he was in a very bad state, bleeding at the left ear, very fast. I never heard him speak after he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it a bright moonlight night? A. It was after two o'clock - day was beginning to break, and it was very light from the gaslights - I could see him by the lamps; I did not notice whether there was any moon; it was nearly half-past two o'clock; the woman was nearer to the watchman than me, and he spoke to her - I had no conversation with the prisoner, but he appeared quite sober. I do not know whether he and the watchman were at all acquainted; it did not last above five or six minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear the watchman say anything to the prisoner? A. Not at all. I saw his hands behind him - he did not stoop; he could not stoop to pick up the stone at that time without my seeing him; he could not have taken it up while I was there, or I must have seen him; he was rather behind the deceased.</p>

I am a hackney-coachman, and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July, a little after two o'clock, at the corner of St. Mary's-street, against the post (it joins the workhouse;) I saw the prisoner walking up the road with the deceased and the woman; Doleman was before them - they walked within seventeen or eighteen yards of me, by the workhouse - I I heard nobody speak; I saw the prisoner throw the stone with his left hand; the watchman immediately fell; the prisoner turned round after throwing the stone, and ran away; I pursued him - a person stopped him before I got up to him, but I never lost sight of him. When I got up he asked if I could swear he was the man who threw the stone - I said I could; he said nothing further. I assisted in conveying him to the watch-house, and the deceased to the hospital. Doleman got up to him before me - it was getting towards light - the day was breaking. The prisoner seemed perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you much opportunity of seeing whether he was sober or not? A. Yes; I saw him in the watch-house; I did not notice him before - it might last four or five minutes altogether.</p>

            . I am a dealer in fruit, and was in Whitechapel-road on the morning of the 24th of July, between two and three o'clock; I heard a cry of Stop him! Stop him! I went towards the road, to see if I could see any one running, and saw a man running from the workhouse, across the road, in a direction for the New-road - I instantly ran across the road, and secured him; he resisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130018"></xptr>very much, and said, "Let me go - it was not me - it was not me;" that was all he said - it was the prisoner. I went afterwards with him to the the watch-house, and saw the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the last witness from him? A. I saw nobody near him till somebody came to my assistance; I just looked round me; I did not look to see if any one was near - my attention was to secure the prisoner - I delivered him to Doleman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see anybody beside the prisoner in the street? A. Not running.

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel. - On the morning of the 24th of July, I was standing at the end of Great Garden-street, in Whitechapel-road, and heard a call of Stop thief! I ran up to where the deceased lay - I was then desired to follow the prisoner, which I did, to the corner of Cannon-street-road; when I got there he was custody - two or three men had hold of him; we brought him back by where the deceased lay, and a man sung out, "Look out for the stone;" as I came by, my foot kicked the stone - I picked it up within about two yards of where the deceased lay, and put it into my pocket; I delivered it to the officer afterwards - I looked at it at the watch-house - I saw no blood nor dirt upon it, but did not examine it close enough for that - it appeared to have been carried about for some time: it had no dust nor any thing on it, nor dirt or mud. The streets were quite dry. The prisoner did not appear the least in liquor. The deceased's name was

            . I am a pupil at the London Hospital. On Tuesday morning, the 24th of July, the deceased was brought there - he was completely insensible; his feet and legs were cold, and his pulse fluttering - he was evidently dying when he came in; he had one bruise on the forehead, and one above the left ear; there was a severe bruise on the forehead, and a considerable swelling - he lived about three hours; after his death I examined the head; there was a fracture of the skull, passing from about the left ear, across the base of the skull, to the right ear; there was from a pint to a pint and a half of extravasated blood on the brain - the blow above the ear was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a severe blow in front of the skull? A. Yes; as if it had come in contact with some hard substance - as if he had fallen with cousiderable violence - that was only a bruise, and would not affect his life - the skin was not broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you form a judgment how the blow above the left ear had been occasioned? A. By something striking the head; a large heavy stone, like that produced, would do it, I should think; his merely falling down would not produce such a fracture; I am satisfied his death could not arise from the fall, but from the violence applied to the head.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-house at Bexley-heath. On the night of 20th Aug. I was in Tooley-street, in the Borough, about nine o'clock—the prisoner met me and asked me to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> some gin—I went with her to a public-house and had some—we were not there more than three or four minutes—the prisoner then said she had had nothing to eat all day—I took her to an Alton ale-house in the Borough, where she had a meat pie—I had then a half-sovereign, a half-crown, and some silver and halfpence in my right hand trowsers pocket—I went home with the prisoner, and 1 found her feeling in my trowsers pocket—I said to her, "You are robbing me"—she said, "No, I am not"—my trowsers were on—I then felt in my pocket, and my money was gone, all but one shilling and two penny pieces—I accused her of robbing me—she said she had not—I knocked for'the woman of the house to come up, and I told her—she said if I would mind the prisoner she would get a policeman—the policeman came, and I gave her in charge—I had before paid the woman 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the room—I took my money out, that I might not give her the half-sovereign, I gave her a shilling, she gave me sixpence back—I know I had my other money safe then.</p>

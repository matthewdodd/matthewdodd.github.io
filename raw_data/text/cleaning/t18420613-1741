                  </hi>. I live in Belton-street, Long-acre, in the parish of St. Giles, and am a shoemaker. I occupy the ground-floor, and pay rent to Mr. Lucas, who does not occupy the house himself—it is let out in tene<lb></lb>ments—the street-door is left open for the lodgers—on the 16th of May, I went out about half-past eight or a quarter before nine o'clock—I locked my room door, and put a brad-awl into the back parlour window—the back parlour door was bolted inside—I was fetched home from my club-house, found the parlour door unbolted, and the window undone—I missed the ar<lb></lb>ticles produced, which were in my drawers when I left—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner a hundred times before—he has been on the second-floor of my house many times, and was well acquainted with it.</p>

On the 16th of May, I met the prisoner in Wooburn-street, with these articles tied in a bundle—he said he had brought them from St. Luke's, and was going to take them to Paddington to his sister—he afterwards said be bought the coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and boots in Monmouth-street—I took him there—he pointed to a shop, and the man said he had never seen him before. <hi rend="largeCaps">

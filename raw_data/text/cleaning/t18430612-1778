                  </hi>. I live in Circus-road, St. John's-wood. On Friday night, the 2nd of June, I was returning home from Bow—I got to White<lb></lb>chapel-road at near twelve o'clock, within ten minutes of twelve—I had drank something, but was sober—when I came into Whitechapel-road I met two females and a man walking together—I asked them where there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-stand—the two females caught hold of my arm, and said they would show me where there was a stand—I cannot recognize either of the female prisoners as the per<lb></lb>sons—I walked some little distance to discover a stand, and felt them pulling me by the arms—I was afterwards knocked down, and rendered senseless, in a certain measure—I was so stunned, I had no power left, and was robbed—I had, when I left Bow, five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and five sovereigns—the notes were pinned into my right waistcoat pocket—I am quite positive the notes and money were in my pocket when I left Bow, and after that I was not in con<lb></lb>tact with any person, or in any situation in which that money could be taken out—it was inside, and my coat was buttoned—I felt a person's hand in that waistcoat pocket twice distinctly, and at the same time I felt a tugging—that is the first thing I remember after I was knocked down, while I was on the ground, I had not strength to resist—the next thing I recollect was the police<lb></lb>man coming up—I was lifted off the ground—my hat was gone—I remember feeling it taken off, after the money was taken—I did not see who did it—I was quite stunned from the blow, and paralysed in a measure—I lost all my strength—I was knocked down not more than two or three minutes after seeing the females, in my estimation—I had a pocketbook and handkerchief in my hind coat pocket—they were also taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wentworth-street, and am on the town. On Friday night, the 2nd of June, I was at the Pavilion theatre, in Whitechapel-road, with Garland—we came out at twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner Martin go up to a man and call him as he was standing at the door of the Gardener's public-house—she said to him, "Come along, make haste, here is a chance;" or some such words—he followed her—in about five minutes I saw Mr. Wood and the two female prisoners with him, one having hold of each arm—I knew Martin before—I am certain of her—Hill had on a lilac-coloured frock, a dark shawl, and a blue velvet bonnet with red ribbons—I saw a bonnet in the hands of Alderman, the constable, before the Magistrate—it was such a bonnet as she had on—I pointed Bannister out the morning after the robbery, to the constable, as the person who had been with Mr. Wood—she was dressed the same as the prisoner Hill.</p>

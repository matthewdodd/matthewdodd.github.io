On the 12th of April, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I was coming by <placeName id="t18210411-155-crimeloc960">the East London Theatre</placeName>

I stood against the corner of the door, and had not been there above two minutes, before I felt a hand in my right hand breeches pocket; I seized it, looked round, and saw a face, but the hand was immediately snatched away. I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or not; I waited there a few minutes, as the company were going into the theatre. When I felt the hand, I found my pocket turned inside out, and three half crowns and 6 d. gone; this was not the pocket in which I felt the hand; they had robbed this first. I saw my money again, and knew one of the half crowns by a mark which I pointed out to the officer - I had taken it in the course of the day; it was one of George IV. and the first I ever saw; it had a scratch on the head from the nose to the four figures of 1 - I found that it corresponded.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I was at the Royalty, as the half-price was going in, and saw the prisoner attempt several people's pockets. I saw him put his hand round Hart, and put his fingers about half way into his pocket, but saw him take something. Presently Hart came back; I went after the prisoner and took him in less than three minutes, under the gallery of the Theatre, at the outer seat. I found three half crowns and 6 d. on him; Hart described a mark on one half crown before I produced it.</p>
               <p>HART. This is the half crown.</p>

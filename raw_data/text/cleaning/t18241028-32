             was the master of the works; before the 23d of September, there had been great repairs of plumber's and carpenter's work - the prisoners were <rs id="t18241028-32-deflabel173" type="occupation">plumbers</rs>

On the 23d of September, I got into the hay-loft and removed some boards, suspecting that the plumbers had stolen lead - I placed myself in the loft at a quarter past six o'clock in the evening, and on looking through a hole I had made in the lath and plaster, I saw Franks with his waistcoat partly unbuttoned, and a piece of lead in his hand, which he concealed between his waistcoat and breeches, he then buttoned his waistcoat over it; I then saw Bowdley do the same; Connell, another man, was treading on a piece of lead to bring it into a small compass. I went down and called Mr. Osborne - he went with me to the shop, and there we found the two prisoners. Connell was at that time shut in a cupboard; I shut the room door, and said, I suspected they had lead about them, and insisted upon searching them before they left the room - they denied it; I then went up to Franks and unbuttoned his waistcoat, and found this piece of lead in his possession - I put my hand to it, and then he took hold of it and pulled it out. I then went to Bowdley and said, I insisted upon searching him; he opened his waistcoat, and gave me out his piece of lead. I then went to the cupboard, and found Connell - I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got yours about you;" he said No - but I found a piece on the floor in the corner. Mr. Osborne and I took the lead into my room, and kept it there till the Tuesday following, and then took it to Bow-street. I discharged the men, and told them that was all I could do, but should inform Lord Egremont of it, and he might do as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there a house adjoining belonging to Lady Marsham - A. Yes, the workmen were stripping that house as well; the old lead from the two houses was mixed together in the work shop - we had no private mark on the lead which came from one or the other house - I could not tell which they came from; Lord Egremout paid for the repairs; he is the proprietor of both houses. Lady Marsham is his tenant; the lead had been brought from her house, No. 3, on that day.</p>

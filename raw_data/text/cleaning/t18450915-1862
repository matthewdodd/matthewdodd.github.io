                  </hi>. I live in Bridgewater-gardens. On the 31st of Aug., I was in Old-street-road—the prisoner and another female stopped me in the highway, at the George the Fourth—it is commonly called the No. 9 house—they said, "Where are you going, my dear?"—I said, "Home, to be sure, where do you think?"—the other said, "Won't you take a walk with me?" and the prisoner said, "Won't you treat me to a drop of gin?"—I said, "I have no money"—the other then said, "Won't you treat us with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oysters?"—I said, "I have no money for gin, how can I have money for oysters?—they then laid hold of me, and dragged me to the corner of the City-road—there the other one shoved rac—they took me to Plummer-street, and asked if I was not going to give them a drop of gin—they then hustled me round and patted me round, and the prisoner said, "You carry a watch; if you can carry a watch you can have 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—they dragged me down Plummer-street—there is a court there, and when I got there, there was not a soul near—one of them dragged me, and the other pushed aside of me—the prisoner then pulled my watch out and said, "It is twenty minutes to one"—I said, "Let that alone, it don't belong to you"—I took it from her and put it in my waistcoat pocket—they still held my arm and my wrist—I bad no sooner put it in my pocket than the prisoner snatched it out of my pocket, and she said to the other, "Look out, here is a policeman"—the other went off down a court—the prisoner kept me—I said, Now as the other is gone I will keep you, you have not got the watch, but your mate has"—we wrestled together for four or five minutes, and I called "Police"—I got her into I Plummer-street—she said, "I will black your <hi rend="italic">peepers</hi>," and she gave me a claw down the face—I clasped my arms round her, and she bit my cheek—the policeman came and took her, and then she insulted me by kicking me before her.</p>

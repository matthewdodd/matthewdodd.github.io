                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Russel's-court, St. Giles-in-the-Fields: it is also called Salutation-court. On Friday last I left my house about half-past six o'clock—it consists of one room—I left nobody in it—I tied the door twice with a piece of string—I tied the staple and hasp together, and made it as secure as I could with string—I had been out shortly before, and when I came back I saw the prisoner listening at my door—I asked him who he wanted—he made no answer—I asked him again, and took particular notice of him, as he did not answer—it was just dusk when I went out at half-past six o'clock—I do not call it very dark then—there are gas-lights there—it would be quite dark without the lamps—I was not out above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at most—when I came back I found the door wide open, and the things laid on the table—the sheet and blanket were gone—I saw them again next morning, at Queen-square.</p>

Last Friday evening, I saw the prisoner in Broadway, Westminster, about half-past eight o'clock—he was offering this sheet and blanket for sale—I asked if it was his own pro<lb></lb>perty—he said they were—I looked at the marks, and said I did not think they belonged to him—he said they belonged to him, and he had brought them from St. Giles's—I took him into custody—he went with me very quietly till he came to the corner of New Tothill-street—he then gave me a push, and ran away—I ran after him, caught him, and brought him back—next day the prosecutrix appeared at the police-office, and saw the things.</p>

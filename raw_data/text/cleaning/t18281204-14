No, I did not; I do not recollect any thing of the sort - I knew perfectly well what I was about; I was quite collected, quite sober - I possibly was not what you might call quite sober, but knew perfectly what I was about; he was not about to be discharged in consequence of what I said - when I first went into the watch-house I was so alarmed I could hardly speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the first words you gave utterance to, that the prisoner was not one of the men? - A. I have no recollection of saying so; he did not object to be searched - I will not swear he was not asked if he objected to be searched - he was searched, and nothing of mine found; I said I was robbed of my watch when he was being taken to the watch-house, and in the watch-house - the watchman went out to look for my property; I remained at the watch-house a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, sitting opposite the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cheap ward. I was stationed, on the night in question, in Iroumonger-lane, about half-past nine o'clock; I heard a cry of Watch! and Stop thief! several times, it came from Church-court, leading from the lane to the Old Jewry, I was about fifteen yards from the court; I saw the prisoner running out of the court as fast as he possibly could, and laid hold of him- he said "It was not me, it was not me, there are two or three, they are gone the other way;" I turned my head, and saw three men came out of the court running, and as I turned round the prisoner made his escape from me, and as soon as he got away he pulled his hat off, and ran down the lane as fast as he could - I sprang my rattle, cried Stop thief! and never lost sight of him; he kept his hat in his hand - my fellow watchman came into the lane, met him, and stopped him; I saw part of a gold chain picked up, against Mr. Duncan's door, which the prosecutor claimed; we took him to the watch-house, the prosecutor followed - the prisoner was searched, and nothing found on him; I was ordered by the night officer to take a lantern and look over in the church-yard, but could find no watch; a smaller part of the chain, and part of a ring were found at day-light next morning, by a person who is not here; the prosecutor seemed very much agitated, indeed, in the watch-house - I did not see him till he got in; he did not appear insensible from liquor - he said the prisoner was one who helped to rob him; the prisoner was never out of the lane, he was stopped fifty or sixty yards from the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the prisoner came into the watch-house he was immediately searched? A. Yes: he was not asked if he had any objection to be searched -I have no recollection of his saying he had no objection; I was not there all the time, I was there when he was searched, but they might have searched him again - he was not about to be discharged; the prosecutor appeared agitated, and as if he had taken a little, but not intoxicated - he did not say the prisoner was not the man who robbed him in my presence, nor was the constable of the night about to discharge him; they sat about searching him directly he got into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 9th of November I was in Cateaton-street, and as I was calling half-past nine o'clock, I heard a cry of Watch! Stop him! I made towards Ironmonger-lane, where I heard the voice - I heard a rattle spring, went into the lane, and saw the prisoner running down the lane, towards Cateaton-street, pursued by Branston, coming towards me; when he saw me come up the pavement, he jumped into the road, and tried to get past me - I struck at him with my stick, and got hold of him; Gardner came up just as we were beginning to take him to the watch-house- when I caught the prisoner he said, "I am not the man - I am not the man; they are gone another way:" there was nobody but him and the watchman till Gardner came to us - I do not recollect Gardner saying any thing when he came up, but the watchman said he was the right man, and we took him to the watch-house; Gardner was very much flurried, and was obliged to sit down in the watch-house some time before the night-constable would take the charge - the night-constable came in a little after us; Gardner saw part of the chain which was found, and said it was his - he was quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Quite sensible? A. Yes; I was not in the habit of seeing him before, but he appeared sensible - not knowing him I cannot say whether he had been drinking, but I mean to say he was sensible; he might have had a drop to drink. I saw the prisoner searched - he was a little time in the watch-house before he was searched, about a quarter of an hour; the constable of the night was not there at first, but when he came he was searched - I did not hear him asked if he objected to be searched, but he said he had no objection; the prosecutor always said he was one of the men, and that he never had him out of his sight - he never said he was not one of the men, in my presence, nor was he about to he discharged. I went out to look for the chain, but found nothing; I was not in the watch-house all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040013"></xptr>time: a little while after the constable of the night came in I went out to my beat.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was at the watch-house when I came in; I saw Gardner there, and in my opinion he was a little intoxicated - he was not insensible from liquor, but was agitated very much indeed, and not for some time after he was there did he declare that the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever express a doubt about him? A. He was in such an agitated state of mind I could not take notice of what he said at first; I never heard him express a doubt about him - he gave charge of him after some time, but before that I sent the watchmen out to look for the property; the chain was not brought in till after he was sent to the Compter - Gardner was gone then; he claimed it before the Lord Mayor - it was delivered to me by Armstrong, the superintendent of the watch: I have had it ever since - here is also another part, which was found next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner searched? A. I did; I had then been about ten minutes in the watch-house - I did not hear him asked if he objected to be searched; he did not object - he said he was not the man; Gardner was in a state between agitation and intoxication - he might certainly have made a mistake; the prisoner and he sat down face to face.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he not jump up, and say,</p>
               <p>"That is the man- I will swear to him?" - A. He did say he would swear to him ten or fifteen minutes after he was there, but there were persons intervening between them till then -I was not about to discharge the prisoner, but wished to be satisfied whether Gardner would really identify him, and he positively identified him before he left the watch-house - he might certainly make a mistake, as well as most of us.(Watch-chain produced and sworn to.)</p>

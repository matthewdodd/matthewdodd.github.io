            ; I lost a quantity of callico from my bleaching grounds; on the 2d of June, at five in the morning, I went down the field as I generally do, and ordered up those goods that I wanted up first; I missed one of the pieces, in consequence of missing it, I enquired of my people;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300076"></xptr> three weeks after I lost three pieces more, and I applied to the public office; on losing the three pieces, I advertised the prisoner on this occasion; two or three days after I missed the first piece, I had occasion to take some of my women to go to the hay fields, and in consequence of some conversation I had some suspicion of the prisoner; I advertised him; then I went to Bow-street, and about a month ago, I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; the prisoner desired to speak to me, and 
he related to me how he took this piece away.</p>


               <p>Did you threaten him or promise him? - By no means whatever, he sent for me voluntarily himself; he began relating the story where my piece was; he was very sorry, and that he would tell me of the others; he then told me, he had sold it to Mrs. Daly, a woman with one eye; I went to Mr. Bond the magistrate, and he said, if it would be of any service letting the prisoner go with us, as he had informed us it was somewhere in Rag-fair; we found it in the Minories.</p>
               <p>Was there any of your property found in consequence of any information you had received? - There was no goods found in the house, but there was a gown found that was pledged.</p>
               <p>Was that gown any part of the callico that was lost? - I am sure of that, for this reason, I can shew you the original pattern, whereby I distinguish it. (Produces the gown.) This piece and this piece only taken away, is the only piece in the world, I will venture to say, that is to be found in this state.</p>
               <p>You will venture to say there is no piece of that pattern? - No, I will venture to say so; this gown is a part of the property I lost, I know that; the reason why I know it to be mine is this, this piece is without either green or blue in it, the original pattern is what we call chintz, which has both green and blue in it, and if that had been left with me then it would have had both green and blue in it; I first saw this gown at Bow-street; I saw it afterwards, only within this month.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the confession reduced into writing? - Yes, it was, but he would not sign it himself, but Mr. Bond said, he would sign it, and send it here himself.</p>

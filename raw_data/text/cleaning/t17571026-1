               <p>Elizabeth Green. I live with Mr. Dobison. I had been cleaning the chamber pot, and had set it out at the back door to dry; the prisoner came into the house, and I went to draw a pint of beer to carry out to a neighbour; when I came back I missed the chamber pot, and suspecting the prisoner had taken it, I went after her and asked her for it; she drop'd it down, and said if it was mine I might take it. It is a pewter pot.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had she gone?</p>
               <p>E. Green. This was within a little way of my master's door.</p>
               <p>[ The pot was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

                  </hi>. I have been married to Mr. Hunter since this transaction—my name at the time in question was Hoseason—I live at No. 23, Grosvenor-street West, Pimlico. In the early part of last year, a gentleman named White, an acquaintance of mine, was in the King's Beach prison—I have not the slightest recollection of what month it was—I went there, and was shown into his room—I found the two prisoners there—I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect whether there was any other person—I had a reticule in my hand, which contained a diamond ring—I had put it in that morning—my attention was drawn to the ring some time before I entered the prison, when I was in the Strand—it was then safe in the bag—I had not taken it out between the Strand and the King's Bench—when I got into the room in the prison, I left the bag on the table, while I went out to speak to Mr. White—I was not with him long—about five or ten minutes—I do not recollect any one going into the room after I came out—I believe I found the bag on the table when I returned, but I do not remember at all—I staid there three four hours, I think—I do not think I took my bag up till I was going home—I did not miss the ring until some hours after I got home—I have since seen a ring very like it—I suppose it to be mine—this is very like mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I cannot swear to it, but I think it is mine—I was not in the habit of wearing it—I believe it to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>. In the early part of last year I was in the King's Bench prison. The prisoners were inmates of the prison at the time, and I permitted them to use my room for a few days till they got one for them<lb></lb>selves—I was not in the room when Mrs. Hunter came to see me—I was going up, and I rather think Mrs. Hunter heard me—on my going up near to my door, she came out of my room in my sight, and met me, and I talked to her outside the door, I should think for five or ten minutes—I then went into the room, and found Mrs. Newman and her daughter, but nobody else to my recollection—Mrs. Hunter went in with me—at the time</p>

               <p>we were talking, we were standing close to the door—it is a double door—we were close to the outside door—nobody came in or went out at the door during our conversation—I did not observe any thing on the table when I went into the room—I did not hear any thing said about the bag or ring; (and I should say that the statement I made previously, I find from subsequent conversation I have had,) to be wrong; that the conversa<lb></lb>tion respecting the loss of the ring was when Mrs. Hunter and her neice came to me the second time; and I should also say I was not aware of the precise time—I know it was early after Christmas—I thought it was the first day of term after Christmas, but I find it must have been March when Mrs. Hunter came—I stated in my deposition that a complaint was made of the loss at the time, but I now find I am in error.</p>

I have the corresponding duplicate to the one produced—it is for three rings pawned on the 21st of September—I was present at the pawning, but did not take them in—it was a smart young person that pawned them—what calls the circumstance to my recollection was a doubt respecting the ring now produced being a diamond one—I had some conv<lb></lb>erson with the person who took them in, but he has now left our service—that brings the circumstance to my mind, and my impression is that it was the younger prisoner brought them; that is my belief—they were pawned in the name of Julia Newman, No. 8, Fitzroy-place—I have not seen her since.</p>

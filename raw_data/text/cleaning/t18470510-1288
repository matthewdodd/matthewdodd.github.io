                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Hunt, of Sydenham. On the 4th of May, abont three o'clock, I missed from a drawer in my bed-room a shawl, a gown-piece, a watch, and a pocket-book—they had been safe at half-past two the same day—in consequence of information, I sent for a po<lb></lb>liceman, and showed me a gown-piece and shawl which I had lost—the watch and pocket-book produced are my property, and were in my drawers—I know this box.</p>

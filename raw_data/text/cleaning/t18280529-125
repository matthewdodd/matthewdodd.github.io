            . Elliott found this gown on my premises, as he was making the head of a sewer at the back of Mr. Beatson's - we afterwards found another bundle tied up; I saw the prisoner at near eight o'clock the same evening - he came and removed the bricks which had been covered over the gown; I went to him, and he tried to get into a gentleman's garden - I said he must come with me, and took him to the watch-house; he was known by the watch-house-keeper; he said to me, "Is there anything amiss?" - that was almost all he said; there was no one with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you see that there were two others with me? A. No, not in that field - there were in the other field.</p>

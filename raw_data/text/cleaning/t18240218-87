I kept the key of the bed-room, banging in the bar, and missed it. I tried the door of my bed-room on the first floor, and found it unlocked. I went away, thinking he might be in an upper room, and then saw him come out of the bed-room, and asked how he came there - he asked what I made a piece of work about: I asked if he had taken anything from the room; he told me to look, and said he had not. I have three chests of drawers there - I looked, and missed nothing. I called the pot-boy, and the prisoner declared to him that he had nothing, and was going down stairs; I called out to two gentlemen who were in the bar; they stopped him. The officer was fetched, and found a pair of bracelets and a silver thimble on him, which I had seen in my room three weeks before.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SMART. I am servant to the prosecutor. I was called up, and took hold of the prisoner - he attempted to go down; I took hold of him, called for help, and two gentlemen came from the bar, and stopped him. The officer found the bracelets, three keys, and a thimble on him.</p>

            . I travel for a house in the City. On the 10th of February, I was in the bar, heard Smart call, and in five or six minutes heard a bustle on the stairs - I stopped the prisoner coming down, took him into the bar, and saw him give up a shawl and shirt; he went to the end of the room, and sat down, pulled something from his pocket, and tore it up. I heard something fall, and after that Mrs. Skerrett said he might go; I went to where he had sat, and found a gold seal and three picklock keys. I called out not to let him go, and he was brought back.</p>

On the 9th of February I was sitting by the kitchen fire, the prisoner and another boy came down the area, and knocked at the door. I opened it - the boy who has escaped, asked me to buy a bonnet box - he had two - they stood on the step. I asked him how much they were, he asked 1 s. 6 d. I offered him 1 s. 2 d.; the prisoner said take it. I went across the kitchen for the money, and on my return I found the prisoner at the dresser; he put the box on the dresser, and behind the box, on the shelf, was the silver pepper box - the other remained at the door; the prisoner took the pepper-box. I heard him say to the boy,</p>
               <p>"You go, and I'll take the money." I saw him hand the pepper-box to the boy. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have given the boy the pepper-box" -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170059"></xptr>the boy ran away. I hallooed out, and ran up the area-steps, but was so frightened I could go no further, I came down the steps and stopped the prisoner; he said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened." I called out, and two of our men came down and took him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be frightened, and I'll tell you all about it. The boy told me to go in, for there was plate about, and I did take it and gave it to him - you will be sure to have it again. His name is John Hall, he lives at the corner of Sander's gardens - if you will go at twelve o'clock at night, and ring the bell twice, you will find him there."</p>

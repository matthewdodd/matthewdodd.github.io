                  </hi>. I am the wife of Nicholas Crowder, we keep a clothes-shop on Saffron-hill. On the 3rd of May, about ten o'clock at night, I was coming home, and saw the two prisoners at my shop-window—I had a broken square of glass there—I saw Connor with her hand up to the window, trying to get a pair of shoes out—I saw one of the shoes hanging out of the broken pane—I said, "What are you about? you are after no good"—Connor said, "What do you want to accuse me of; do you want to send me away?"—they said, "Search us"—I did feel, and found nothing—they abused me very much, and said I was a false-swearing Jew b—I was about to let them go, when a neighbour called out, "There is something white hanging from one of them "Tighe then said, "Give her a <hi rend="italic">drive,"</hi> and they went off—I knocked at my window, and my husband and my little boy followed them—I then missed a shirt—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it was taken from the window—there was a piece more glass broken out.</p>

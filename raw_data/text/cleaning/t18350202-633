                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at West Ham, in Essex. The prisoner had been in my service about seven months—he was a carter and ploughman—on the 17th of January, on my way home round my fields, I discovered a sack in a ditch of what we call the nine-acre field—the sack had my name on it, and contained beans and oats mixed—I had no doubt of the sack and its contents being mine, and I directed my servant, James Trench, to watch—the sack was covered with grass, as if to conceal it—I set Trench to watch on Saturday night, and he brought the prisoner to me between five and six o'clock on the Monday following—the prisoner said, "Master, your watchman has caught me with a little corn—I am very sorry for it—I meant to give it to my horses."</p>

               <p>there was some bran in my granary, which lies south-west, and when the wind sets that way, it blows the bran over the corn.</p>

I watched from the Saturday till the Sunday night, and the prisoner came between five and six o'clock, and took the sack out—I followed him—I then heard a cart coming—I drew back, and laid down under the hedge—the carter saw me, and he passed by without stopping—the prisoner came again at six o'clock and took the sack, (which he had before removed to a gate-way near the road,) and I collared him.</p>

            . I live in Round-court in the Strand. On the 1st of this month I heard a man say to my girl, take care of these shoes till I call for them; she brought in two pair of shoes and a pair of pumps, they did not appear to be finished; I bid the girl put them by, she did; I went to the door, there was the prisoner with some sole leather in a bag; I said, am I to take care of these shoes till you call for them; he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>E. Jobins. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>E. Jobins. I keep a public-house; I asked him what he was going to do with the shoes; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070040"></xptr> he was going to carry them as far as Tottenham; I said it is very odd a master shoe-maker should send such shoes out of his shop in such a condition; he called for a glass of gin and went away; I suspected they were stole, so went to the next shoemaker's shop, and there I was directed to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clock-maker, and live in East-lane, Walworth. On Saturday, the 28th of September, I left my house at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, leaving a lodger there—I locked the shop-door when I went out, and put the key in my pocket—the street-door was on the latch, but they could not get at my shop without forcing the door open—I left some clocks there—I came home about seven o'clock in the evening, and found the shop-door open, and missed seven Dutch wooden clocks, with brass wheels—on the Monday after, I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to Penton-street, Clerkenwell, and got a parcel containing four of the clocks—a policeman produced some keys, one of which opened my lock.</p>

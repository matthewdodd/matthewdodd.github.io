                  </hi>. I live with my father, Charles Froude, at Leyton-stone, in Essex. About eleven o'clock at night, on the 12th of January, I was with him in High-street, Whitechapel—he was driving a cart of Samuel Gurney's, to whom he is bailiff—he had a bundle in the cart, con<lb></lb>taining the articles stated, in a basket—before we got to Mile-end gate the policeman asked us if we had lost any thing—we looked up, and missed the basket and its contents.</p>

I live in Whitechapel-road—I was standing in front of my own shop—I noticed two men with a cart loaded with grains near Mile-end—when it had passed I saw the prisoner and three others pass by—theprisoner was looking nt the cart—I saw him follow it—after he had got about forty yards to the corner of Mary-street he went half-way across the road, and returned to the cart, raised himself up on the cart, took a bundle off, and ran away—one of the others ran after him—they went down by Craggs' public-house—I gave notice to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 278.) I went after the cart, and found the prosecutor had lost a bundle and basket—I went after the pri<lb></lb>soner the same evening, but could not find him—I took him on Friday evening—I told him it was for stealing off 'Squire Gurney's cart on Tues<lb></lb>day night—he said, "I think you are mistaken."</p>

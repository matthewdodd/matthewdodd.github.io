             stopped at my master's door, and left his cloak in the chaise, while he came in to visit my master - I took the cloak out of the chaise, and laid it over the horse's loins, as he was hot; there came a knock at my master's door, and I went in for a moment, but did not take my eye off the horse - I saw the cloak drawn off the horse; I went down the street, and saw the prisoner with the cloak which he was rolling up before him - I said it was mine; he said, he only took it for a lark - he was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you never take your eye off the horse? A. No, I only went into the passage - the horse was apt to start; it was my master's horse and chaise which I took to fetch the doctor with.</p>

We found the house locked up, and the prisoner absconded; we found the key in a little house where he kept his working tools; when we got in, we found a little box and a chest of drawers taken away; I had seen them about half an hour before he had the key; the chest of drawers were removed into a barn just by, and the back broke; I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) to the amount of about 50 l. I saw the prisoner about three weeks ago in Spital-fields watch-house, in custody; I asked him how he could think of robbing us, after we had put him in possession; he made no answer to that, but when I asked him if he would acknowledge that he did it; he said he did it with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to acknowledge it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor use any threats if he did not? - A. No: he left his own cloaths behind him in the little house where he kept his tools, and took my husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever slept in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor any of your family? - A. No; he worked for our landlord; we had taken the house about six weeks before, but it was not finished; it was too damp for the family, fires were kept in it.</p>

I granted a man liberty to sleep in the barn one night, and the next night I gave him liberty to sleep in the little room I lived in; in the night I awoke, and saw a light; I went down stairs, and found he had got the drawers down; he threatened my life if I attempted to resist his taking them away, and he did take them away.</p>

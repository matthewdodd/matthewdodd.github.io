                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How can you swear he was not there that particular night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain of it, because on that particular day there came a Frenchman to me at the Custom-house, who had lost a case in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I recollect the whole day by that—the Frenchman came to me about three o'clock in the afternoon—I was not hunting about with him in the evening—I do not remember the prisoner giving a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the pot-boy as a Christmas-box that night—I swear it did not take place—I was not drinking all that time—I did not drink gin and water with the prisoner—I drank with several per<lb></lb>sons, but not with him—I was subpoenaed here by Mr. Humphreys—they found me at the Custom-house—I had not seen the policeman before Mr. Humphreys subpoenaed me—I cannot say whether the prisoner was at the Ship on the following night or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am stable-man at the Custom-house livery<lb></lb>stables—I knew the prisoner by sight. On the 27th of December, I was at the stable—the prisoner came there, and asked my consent to allow him to nail a mat on a box—I gave him my consent and lent him a hammer it was a mat similar to this which is here—it was between five and six o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I attend from the Crown-office—the title of Mr. M'Kenzie is Lord Commissioner of the Ionian Islands—I have an extract from the book—it is a minute or docket-book, in which every patent passing the Great Seal is entered, and it is kept in the Crown<lb></lb>office.</p>

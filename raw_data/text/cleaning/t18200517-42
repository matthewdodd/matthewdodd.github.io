            . I live at Risley, in Bedfordshire. On the 29th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I was walking up <placeName id="t18200517-42-crimeloc253">Holborn</placeName>

He denied taking it, and said it was some other person. He began to resist and strike me - I was obliged to return his blows, and when I let go to strike him, he escaped from my left hand, and ran into Brook-street - he was stopped there. I never lost sight of him till he was apprehended. I positively swear he is the man; nobody was near enough to take it but him, and I saw him drop it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane, and heard the call of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner run, and pursued him down Brook-street - I never lost sight of him until he was stopped. When I took him he struck me. The prosecutor came up immediately.</p>

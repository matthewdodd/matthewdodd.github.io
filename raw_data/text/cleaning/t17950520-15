            , did you go to her for any linen? - Yes, I always go.</p>
               <p>Q.What day did you go for the linen that was lost? - On Monday the 4th of May, about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Roberts? - No, I see the servant, a woman servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she give you? - I don't know, the articles that were in the bundle; they were pinned up in a dimity petticoat. The first bundle were Mr. Dillon's things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call on Mr. Dillon before you called on Miss Roberts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you have from Mr. Dillon's? do you know what they were? - No, they were tied up in a table cloth for me. When I was coming from Mr. Dillon's man met me, and asked me if I did not live with one Mrs. Johnson, that washed his linen for him? I told him, no. He then asked me, where I did live? I told him, with one Mrs. Roberts; and he asked me, where I had been? I told him, to Mr. Dillon's and then I went down Mary-le-bone-street, and I met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from? - Out of Francis-street, Tottenham-court-road. She asked me if I did not wash for Mr. Dillon? I told her, yes; and she said, she came from Mr. Dillon's cook, and she desired her to send me back directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to send back? - To go back myself to Mr. Dillon's cook. I told her I was going a little further, after another young lady's linen. She told me to make haste, and she would stop at the corner of Titchfield-street; and I went after this Miss Roberts's linen.</p>

               <p>Q. You left her there? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her there in the same place when you came back? - Yes, in the same place where she said she would stop. She told me, I had better not stop any longer, for she could carry home the linen as well as me. I asked her what was the master? She said, she did not know what was the matter. I delivered the bundles to the prisoner, one under one arm, and one under the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered both of them? - Yes, both of them, and I returned back to Mr. Dillon's again.</p>
               <p>Q. And what became of the prisoner? - She went up Portland-street, to take the bundles home. She was by when I met the man, and she said then, when I said I lived at Mrs. Roberts's, it was No. 109, Great Portland-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Mr. Dillon's? - Yes, and when I came there, I asked if they had sent for me? They said, no. The servant asked what was the matter? I did not make any further answer, but went out of doors, and went home, to see if the woman had brought the linen home, and there had nobody been.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your property since? - No further than I employed a constable to search the pawnbrokers, but they could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any part ever been found at all? - No, there has not.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you get at the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200023"></xptr>again? - She was taking a bundle from a little boy in Oxford-road; a person sent for me that heard of it, and I was sent for to the watch-house in Mary-le-bone-lane, to see if I knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - It was about four o'clock when I went, and they said she was taken up about one, the next day but one. Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there, did you see any bundles belonging to you? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same woman that took the property belonging to you? - Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where was it you first see the person that afterwards got your bundle? - Between Ogle-street and Titchfield-street. I was going to this young lady's for her bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the young lady live? - At. No. 13, Norton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not far off from there? - No, only a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave these bundles with her then? - No, I took the bundles with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave Mr. Dillon's bundle with her then? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see this person before in your life? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, she had told you a story, that you was desired to go to Mr. Dillon's; that something amiss had happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You inquired of Mr. Dillon's whether they sent for you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them at Mr. Dillon's what a strange fool they had made of you? - I did not say any thing further; but I was frightened; I was afraid the woman had robbed me then.</p>
               <p>Q. This is just by Portland-street where you parted with the two bundles? - Not far.</p>
               <p>Q. Hardly a hundred yards from your house, is it? - Rather better than that.</p>
               <p>Q. It would not take you above three minutes to go from there to your own house? - No, I could not walk it in less than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. She went towards your home? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Miss Roberts's, was not she extremely angry? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she threaten to take you up? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she tell you that you must find them out? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you was a good deal frightened, and thought you would come to harm on the occasion? - Yes, I did; I did not think I should come to any further hurt than my friends must pay for the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never been able to find any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not see the person to whom you imagined you delivered them till three or four days after? - Not till the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say before the justice, that you had delivered one of the bundles first, and that the person waited with that bundle till you brought the other? - No, I did not.</p>

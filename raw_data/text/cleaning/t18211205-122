On the Saturday night I was out, and came home about eleven o'clock, I heard nothing of the spoons till Friday morning, when one of the young men asked Duggett if he would pledge five tea-spoons, I do not know which it was, but they were all there, she said she did not like. One of them again asked her to pawn them for 30 s., she took them, and returned, saying, the pawnbroker would not let her have so much; one of them sent her with two table-spoons to pawn for 1 l. I cannot say who gave them to her. Duggett lived on the first floor, with Bury; I live on the second floor, with Davis. Turner was a stranger, he only came the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sworn to speak the truth. Whom did you tell the Magistates gave her the spoons - A. I saw Davis have them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you not entice Duggett to the house - A. No; she was there about three weeks.</p>

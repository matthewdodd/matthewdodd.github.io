               <p>I delivered the things mentioned in the indictment to the prisoner, last 28th of July was twelvemonth, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I delivered the box to him to take to the inn, to go to my son at Plymouth; he corded it: I gave him threepence to see it booked. Next morning he returned me a penny, and said he had given the trunk to the proper person, on Tuesday following I received a letter from my son, who expressed some astonishment at not receiving the trunk.</p>

On the 28th of July, 1791, the prisoner brought a hair-trunk into my house, about a yard long, and said it was sent him from the country; he had had a few words with his wife, and seemed afraid she would take the trunk; on the Saturday he sold his goods, and went away; the trunk he took with him. I saw him some time after in Bishopsgate-street, and he ran away from me.</p>

               <p>Mr. White. I am a servant to the prosecutor. I was not at home when the robery was committed. On the 7th of July, Mr. Barear came and asked if we had lost a fork; I went down and looked, and missed two knives and three forks. He brought the prisoner with him. He was searched, and two knives and two forks were found upon him. I never saw the prisoner before that time to my knowledge. We took him before the Justice, and he was committed.</p>

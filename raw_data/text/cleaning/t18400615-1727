Last Saturday morning I had five caps placed on a hat-bol at iny door—I went out, and saw the prisoner walking on with a cap on his head—I went and took him with the cap on him—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is mine—he had no right to have my cap.</p>

I bought the cap of his wife the day before—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, and she gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he wanted me to pay for it again, and I would not—when the officer came I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out to pay for it, and the woman did not recollect any thing of the kind. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. We had not sold such a cap the day before.</p>

                  </hi>I live in Church-street. On that morning I was looking out of my mistress's window, which is opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's door, reach, and take the cap from a stand—he put it under his coat, and then on his head—I went and told the prosecutor.</p>

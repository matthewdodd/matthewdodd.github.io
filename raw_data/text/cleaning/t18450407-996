                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Charles Smith—we live in Poplar-place, Lewisham—on the evening of the 17th of March I was in the gallery of Deptford Theatre, with my neighbours—I had a sovereign, a half-crown, a sixpence, and some coppers in my pocket—I held my pocket while I was in the gallery—I did not sit—I was standing—I felt a person crowd against me, and felt a sensation at my neck, which induced me to let go of my pocket—I did not miss my money till a quarter to ten, as I was going to leave the theatre, Mrs. Reed then said something to me, and then I missed my money—I saw the prisoner in the gallery—I came down and heard a scuffle—the prisoner passed me in going out—he made use of abusive language, and said, "You have lost nothing"—he was searched, and a half-crown, a sixpence, and two pence were found on him—there was no sovereign found, but he was seen to swallow something.</p>

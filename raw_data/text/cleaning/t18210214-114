            . On Wednesday, the 14th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Portland-road. I went down Norton-street, and saw the prisoner with two others; I passed them, and returned, took the prisoner, and Davis took the others; in the prisoner's hat I found this veil, and in his pocket a latch-key, which opens the prosecutor's door. He said the veil belonged to a young woman,</p>

After seeing them go to several doors, I ran and told Smith, and we apprehended them. I found some keys on the others, and on the prisoner a latch-key and the veil.</p>

I am in partnership with Lyon; the prisoner is apprenticed to his father, who is a tailor. He came about four o'clock.</p>

I do not know much about cards, I was trying to play. I do not know what game they called it, if she put down diamonds, so did I, and if hearts, I put down hearts.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woburn, in Bedfordshire. On Wednesday, the 7th of September, I went to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn—I had a purse in my possession when I went to bed that night—it contained five or six sovereigns, and about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in half-crowns, shilling, and sixpence—in the morning, when I felt in my trowsers pocket, I missed my purse and money—I did not lock my room door—nobody else slept there</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live, in Silver-street, Golden-square. I lost a tea box and 441bs. of tea on the 21st of August. In consequence of information I went, on the 22nd, to the prisoner's house, No. 50, Union-street—I there found the remains of the tea box, and some tea of the same description as mine—the remains of the box corresponded with the lid of the box I had at home.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 49.) I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house on the 21st of August—he is a marine-store dealer, in Union-street, Middlesex Hospital—I saw him in the shop, and asked him if he had purchased a chest of tea—he said, "No"—I asked if he had one in his possession—he said, "No"—I said I had a warrant to search for one, and, in company with the sergeant, I commenced searching, in the shop I found this bundle of green tea on a table behind the counter,</p>

               <p>wrapped up in this handkerchief, and on a shelf I found a canister and this little caddy, with tea in them, which appears the same sort—I went into the cellar, and under some rags I found these pieces of wood, which are some part of a tea chest—I then went up stairs, and in the sitting-room I found this caddy, with two divisions of it nearly full of tea—they all ap<lb></lb>pear to correspond—I went into the bed-room, and between the bed and the mattress I found this parcel of tea, which appears to be the same—I asked how he accounted for it, but I could not catch his answer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant E</hi> 10.) I went with Restieaux—I saw this tea found, as he has described, and these three other parcels—they all appear to be the same tea—I heard him asked where he got the tea from when the first parcel was found—he said, "I know nothing about it; it was not here when I went out;"—when I went into the cellar, I found the tea lead in an iron pail, covered over—I said, "What do you say to that, Mr. Hamilton?"—he said, "I bought the lead"—when the pieces of the chest were found, I said, "There is a tea-chest"—he said, "I know no<lb></lb>thing about it; I sometimes buy pieces of wood with the bones I purchase"—when I went to the bed-room I questioned him about the parcels I found there—he said, "It is part of 2lbs. I purchased, and am paying for weekly."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not tell you that when he went out he left the shop in care of Mrs. Curry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said, "I bought that lead," not "I buy lead"—I believe his answer was, "I bought that lead"—I might have told the Magistrate that he said, "I buy lead"—I do not know that I did—I affected to give to the Magistrate the answer he made me—I believe he said, "I bought that lead"—it might have been, "I buy lead," and if I swore it at the police-office, it was so—I did not mention that he left his shop in care of the woman, because I did not recollect it.</p>

            . On Thursday Morning last, I went to see an Acquaintance at the other End of the Town; I had drank a little more than ordinary; and coming home at Night, I met the Prisoner somewhere about Holbourn-Bridge; she picked me up, and carried me into a Bawdy-house in <placeName id="t17430114-37-crimeloc188">Goldsmith Alley in Holbourn</placeName>

I undressed myself all but my Stockings, and laid my Breeches under my Head on the Off-side: I had not been in Bed long before she put her Arm a-cross me. - She made a long Arm: I asked what she meant by that; and she did not seem to give me any Answer. I had Occasion, soon after,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174301140029"></xptr> to go to my Pocket to pay for some Liquor which we had, as we sat in Bed; and I found that my Breeches were removed, and there was not a Farthing left in my Pocket. - I had four Guineas and some Silver, but I cannot tell how much. - I saw the four Guineas after I was in Bed. - I was not asleep , I might be in a little Dose. - I got up immediately, and called to the Landlord, and told him I had lost all my Money. - The Landlord and a Watchman came up; and there was a Guinea found in one of her Stockings. - Her Stockings were never off any more than mine. I thought she had a Guinea in her Mouth, but I can't be sure of that; one Guinea and nine Shillings were found upon the Bed. - The other two Guineas I can give no Account of.</p>

            . On Thursday last I was calling the Hour at four o'Clock, and a Man came out and called, Watch! He desired me to come in, and said there was a Robbery committed - He said, there was a Man and a Woman in Bed: that they had not been long there before the Man missed his Money: I saw eight Shillings in Silver, and a Guinea, upon the Bed, and one Shilling upon the Floor, and one Guinea was found in her Stocking; she had her Finger in her Mouth, but whether she swallowed the other two I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was sitting down at Holbourn-Bridge, and that young Man coming by, I asked him for a Penny; he said, if I would shew him where to get a Dram he would give me a Penny; we went to this House, drank three Quarterns of Gin by the Fire-side, and two more after we were in Bed; he fell asleep, and the Landlord came up, took his Breeches from under his Head, and gave me a Guinea; he pulled all my Clothes off my Back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barton Lodge, near Preston, in Lincoln-shire. On Monday night last I was in Fleet-street, about ten o'clock, returning home, accompanied by my son, and between St. Bride's church and Temple-bar, near to Chancery-lane, I was met by a person who gave me a violent push in the stomach—I thought I felt my watch gone—immedia<lb></lb>ately put my left-hand to my side and found it was so, and at the moment the man who gave me the violent thump took to his heels as quick as possible—I immediately pursued him for about thirty yards before my son came up to me—he passed me, and I called "Stop thief," and continued to purse about fifty yards—he then turned to the left, and went up a small street, through which my son pursued him, and when he was within a few yards of him, I saw a gentleman stop him, and my son seized him—I am sure the prisoner is the man—I gave him in charge, and saw him give my watch up to the officer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

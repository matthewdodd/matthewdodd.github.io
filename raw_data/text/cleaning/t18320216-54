On the 20th of December I gave her a purse, containing a half-sovereign, ten shillings, and a sixpence of William the Fourth: I told her to take it up stairs, and put it into her master's shirt drawer - when she came down I asked if she had put it in the drawer; she said Yes, that she had locked the drawer, and hung the key up; on the 21st we were washing - she asked leave to go out for twenty minutes or half an hour; I gave her leave about eight o'clock in the evening, and never saw her again till the 24th, when she was at Worship-street - she had not given warning; finding she did not return, I went to the drawer - the purse and money were gone, also a shawl and two gold rings, which I should think were worth about 5l., but I did not buy them, and cannot swear to the value - none of my property has been found; she had been with me once before for nine months.</p>

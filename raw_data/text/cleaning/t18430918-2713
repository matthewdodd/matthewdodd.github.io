                  </hi>. 1 am housemaid to Lord Thomas Cecil. On the 31st August, about twenty minutes past two, the prisoner came to his house in Eden-place—she said 6he came from Lady Charlemont for a card of Mrs. Russell's, and asked if Lady Sophia Cecil was in town—I said she was not—she then said I was to speak to the housemaid for the card—I said there was not a card—she wished me to look—I went into the dining-room, she fol-lowed me—I went to the table drawer to look—she came up to the table—I said there was not any there—the door-bell rang, the footman came to the door—I said perhaps he could tell her where Mrs. Russell's address was-the prisoner went away, and I then missed a coral seal, which I had seen just before she came—no one could have taken it but her—it was on the table in the dining-room—the prisoner was by that table—I have never seen the seal since.</p>

On the 7th of October, about seven in the evening, the property was taken from my house; I had seen it about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour before that at the further end of the counter, that comes into the passage of a night, in a place where we keep brooms and such things. I suspected some person in the house had thrown it there for the purpose of conveying it away. I went out and pulled the street door too, leaving my nephew, my shopman, and my porter, in the house; when I went out I waited about a quarter of an hour in sight of the door, at about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to such a distance that you could see any body coming out. - A. The way I could see was by the opening of the door; when I saw the door open, I drew nearer. I saw him coming out, I saw it was the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off were you then. - A. From ten to fifteen yards, I walked up to him, I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing; I then requested that he would go back with me to see what the bundle contained.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a bundle then. - A. Oh, yes, when I came up I could see him as well as at broad day. I saw a bundle, he went back with me as far as the door, and when I was in the act of ringing the bell he disentangled himself by twisting my arm, and gave me a blow across my breast; in the act of escaping his arm came across my chest, he then ran down Southampton-street towards the Strand; I pursued him and cried out stop thief, he was stopped in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to him. - A. Yes; he had not the bundle with him when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you afterwards see the bundle. - A. I saw the bundle in my nephew's possession at the bottom of Southampton-street not a minute after. It contained a piece of our furniture cotton, about twenty-eight yards, it was worth two guineas to me.</p>

             sworn. On the 7th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I heard the cry of Stop thief. I ran to the door and ran down the street; finding the prisoner was secured in the Strand, I ran back to find the bundle. It was delivered into my hands by a young woman in Southampton-street, it was tied up in a handkerchief, this is the handkerchief, it contains the property.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that handkerchief yours. - A. It is a silk handkerchief, it is not mine, it was the covering that was on the bundle when I saw it under the man's arm. I saw the handkerchief by the light of a false hair shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And the contents is yours. - A. I can safely say it is the cotton I saw in the place under the counter; I know it is mine.</p>

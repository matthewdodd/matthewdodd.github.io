I first missed the property in January; the first article I missed was a piece of plain muslin; I taxed her with it on the 18th of March, I told her I insisted upon seeing her box opened; she said she would go up stairs and open the box before me; I found a calico petticoat belonging to me, I found nothing else at that time, I told her to come down and take her wages and go; I was directed afterwards to take a search-warrant, and search her sister's apartments; I went immediately to her sister's, whose name is Parker, and found the box, and her brother-in-law, after searching his house, brought the box to me in the evening, on the 18th of March; the box is here with its contents.</p>
               <p>Q. This box contains the whole of the things charged in the indictment? - A. Yes; the prisoner gave me the key of the box before it was brought to my house.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Portal: all I know about the matter is, I saw this petticoat taken out of her box, the prisoner was present; I cannot say the petticoat belonged to my master.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FISK sworn. - I am a Police officer belonging to Worship-street: On Saturday the 18th of March, Mr. Portal came for a search-warrant; I found the petticoat, part of the property, in the prosecutor's house; then I found three handkerchiefs, a piece of muslin, a pair of stockings, and several things in the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there twenty yards and a half of muslin in the box? - A. It was measured by the prosecutor, he can give you an account of it; I have kept these things ever since. (The box produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.(To Mr. Portal). After you had discovered the petticoat, I believe you told the prisoner if she would confess she had taken the property, you would forgive her? - A.Nothing at all like it.</p>

             sworn. - I know nothing further of the transaction than I saw the box brought to Mr. Portal's house by Parker; I went with them to the Magistrate's in Worship-street; I saw the box opened and its contents, it was on the 18th of March, and they were sworn to by Mr. Portal.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Portal). Look at the twenty yards of muslin, can you swear to it? - A. Yes, I can, from its having my own hand-writing on it at each end.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of it? - A. It has been cut since I had it, it was in one piece when she took it, the piece cost me six guineas, at 5s. 9d. a yard.</p>
               <p>Q.It is valued at 5l. 12s. would you give that for it? - A. Certainly I would.</p>
               <p>Q. The three yards and three quarters of muslin, can you prove that to be your's? - A. Yes; but there is not my mark on that part, because the prisoner has made part of it into a petticoat; I value that at 24s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. All the articles, excepting the petticoat, were found in the box, which Mr. Parker brought to your house? - A. Yes; except little trifling articles.</p>
               <p>Q. The twenty yards of muslin is now in two pieces? - A. It is in two pieces, I cannot tell the length of them now.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell whether they were taken in one piece or two pieces, they might have been taken at different times for what you can tell? - A. They certainly might.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not state the value too high? - A. I state it at what it cost me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had a very good character with this woman? - A. Yes, I had.</p>

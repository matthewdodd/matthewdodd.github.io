            . I am servant to Mr. Hillier; I remember four table spoons which he had in common use, one pair marked P. L., the other pair plain; we missed one of each pair about the 14th of August, and found them on the 28th of August at Hatton-garden; they were kept in the kitchen; the area gate was open on the day they were missed.</p>

            . I am a constable of Pentonville. I saw the prisoners on Saturday the 14th of August, about half past two o'clock in the afternoon, coming up Collyer-street together, they turned into Rodney-street; I was induced to watch them, having frequently seen them about the place. I saw Scott draw this spoon from his bosom; I went up to them, and Ritson said</p>
               <p>"Here is somebody coming;" I seized Scott and pulled him across the road, and then seized Ritson, they struggled, but could not get away. I found the marked spoon in Scott's hat, the other was dropped in the scuffle, and was brought to me as I was going to Hatton-garden. They had been together, and Scott seemed to be giving the spoon to Ritson, but seeing me, Ritson went across the road.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SCOTT's Defence. I was going along, and saw a bundle of wood and a spoon.</p>
               <p>RITSON's Defence. I turned into Collier-street, and the officer collared this boy, I stopped to look, and he plunged upon me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are one."</p>
               <p>JURY to REYNOLDS. Q. When Scott held the spoon to the other prisoner, did he offer to take it - A. No, he saw me so close that he did not offer to take it.</p>

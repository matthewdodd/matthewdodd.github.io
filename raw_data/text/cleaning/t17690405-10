The prisoner came into our house on the 9th of Feb. between four and five in the afternoon, and asked for Mrs. Smith, who lodges in our house. I asked, if she would go up to her, or should I call her down. She said she would go up. The prisoner should have gone up but two pair of stairs, but she went up three, and she returned in about ten minutes with a great bundle in her hand. I inquired if she had been with Mrs. Smith, and found she had not. I ran out and found her about an hundred yards from our house. I told her they were my clothes; she said they were not. She said Mrs. Smith gave her them to wash. I held her till my master came and took hold of her; they were the things laid in the indictment ( mentioning them by name). They were taken out of a back garret and front garret up three pair of stairs. They were all clean but the table cloths of my master's. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I gave the woman some things to pawn, to the value of 17 s. in Sept. last. I went to her, being near my time, and told her my husband had deserted me, and I was very much distressed for money, and said I must have some. She went out of the room and brought me a bundle of things, and said I must get what I could on them. When they brought me back, I came willingly. Though Mrs. Smith said she did not know me, I have known her between five and six years.</p>

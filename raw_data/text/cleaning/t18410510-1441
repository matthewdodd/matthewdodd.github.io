                  </hi>. On the 6th of May, I was in Oxford-street. I was going towards the City, and saw the two prisoners coming up towards the Circus—they were in company, talking together—I watched their motions—they noticed the omnibuses as they passed—they looked at them as they went along, and after going up to the Circus, and crossing and re-crossing from one corner to another, and looking into the omnibuses as they came up, they got into an omnibus—I met a policeman in plain clothes, and in consequence of what said to him, he and I got on the top of the omnibus—I made a communication to the conductor of the omnibus—it then came on and stopped at the corner of Well-street—the conductor made a sign to me that the gentlemen were getting out—the policeman and I got down—I ran to the door of the omnibus and. said something, and in consequence of what heard said from inside the omnibus, I ran after the two prisoners, who had then got out and gone up Well-street—the police<lb></lb>man had gone on after them before I did—they continued walking—came up to Williams, seized him by the collar, and with my other hand I took hold of his hand, which was underneath his cloak—his hand was closed—I said, "What have you got here?—he said, what was that to me—I said, "I will see"—we had a severe struggle, and got into the road, and by a sudden jerk of his arm, I saw something of a purse in his hand—a gentleman came up from the omnibus to assist me, and by some means or other Williams got down in the road, and the purse, by a sudden jerk of his arm, went out of his hand—I did not see for a second where it went to, but I picked it up off the ground—the gentleman and I brought Williams to the corner of the street, and a policeman of the E division came and took him—I charged him with felony—he said he was a respectable person, and I should find myself mistaken—I saw Wakeling taken by the officer—he said he was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—proprietor, and he was going to pay his duty—I took the purse to the station, and gave it up to the officer in presence of the In<lb></lb>spector—Williams denied all knowledge of Wakeling.</p>

I happened to be in the omnibus—I saw the two prisoners in it—Miss Stanley sat on the left-hand side as you go in, within one of the door, when I first went in—and there was no one sitting by her, but ultimately the prisoner Williams sat beside her, and Wakeling sat almost exactly opposite him—Williams had either a loose coat or a cloak—I saw the prisoners get out—some alarm was given on their getting out, and I got out immediately—I came up with the prisoner Williams—he was struggling with Leathart—I caught hold of his collar as he was getting from Leathart, I thought, and either personally, or with Leathart's assistance, got him on his back, and the coat or cloak he had got across his person, slipped down, and immediately under it I saw purse on his person—I said, "We have got the purse"—we got him on his legs, and I saw Wakeling, and a man with a constable's staff in his hand, holding it, as I thought, in a threatening attitude—I said, "Don't strike the man, you have got him in custody"—we went to the station, and I went after the omnibus, and got the lady—she went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station, and recognised the purse as hers.</p>

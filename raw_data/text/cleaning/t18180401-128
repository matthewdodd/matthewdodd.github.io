            . I live at the Sun, public-house, Chapel-street, Grosvenor-street; the prisoner and prosecutor came in about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor called for some ale; he pulled out his watch to see if it was right - I went out of the room. The prisoner got up and left the prosecutor, who was asleep at the table - He sat by him; when I came in he was gone; I said, I supposed he had taken Graham's watch; he immediately missed it. He was apprehended on Good Friday-the watch was never found; nobody but the prisoner, was near the prosecutor; no person was in the box except them; I am sure he is the man; I was not absent above half a minute.</p>

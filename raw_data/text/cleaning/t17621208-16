On the 4th of Nov. at night, my house was broke open, the bar of the cellar window was taken away, when they got in there they opened the cellar door, and came up into the house, all were fast over night. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I advertised them, and on Saturday at noon Mr. Bopard came to me, he said, he believed he had seen my watch. I described mine, then he said he had it, that he bought it for 34 s. he said his apprentice could swear to the identity of the man he bought it of. Then I desired him to go down to the rendezvous with his apprentice, to see if it was not one of the seamen; (we had found a bludgoon by my counter the morning after the robbery, which I thought I had seen before in a sailor's hand) but during the time we were there, the woman at the bar carried some silk handkerchiefs to pledge at Mr. Bopard's, and she was secured, she being with the man when the watch was sold; then we went with her before justice Willoughby, there she said the man at the bar told her he bought the watch. She was put into the Tower goal, and in the morning she was carried before justice Pell; the man was taken and brought there also; they denied knowing each other. He owned he sold the watch, and said he bought it of one

I come home from the West-Indies; I brought a letter from this woman's husband; I found her out, and told her, he was well; she asked me to drink; I got in liquor; from that I became acquainted with her. I received 15 guineas for my voyage; there was a young man wanted to sell this watch; I said, how much do you ask for it, Cock? he said 2 guineas; she persuaded me to buy it; I gave him 2 guineas for it. After that I wanting money, went with her to Mr. Bopard's, and sold it.</p>

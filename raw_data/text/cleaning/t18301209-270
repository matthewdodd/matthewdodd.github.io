               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw a watch - I asked him for money in the morning, and he would not give me any - he said he had lost a watch; he brought a Policeman, who searched the house - I heard the knock at the door, and came down in my night-gown; the Policeman came before I was dressed, and I was taken to the station - We had been to Mr. Alabaster's public-house, and he would make me drink something.</p>

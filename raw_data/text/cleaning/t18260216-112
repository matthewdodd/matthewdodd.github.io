            . I am an officer. I saw the two prisoners on Saturday evening, the 21st of January, between five and six o'clock, in the City-road - Jacobs came down Featherstone-street, and beckoned to Kelly, who was on the same side as I was, with this trunk on his shoulder - he pointed to a turning; I passed Jacobs, and got pretty close to them; I had something in my hand, and while I was putting it into my hat they crossed to the other side of the City-road - I heard Jacobs talking, but I cannot tell what he said. I then crossed, and seized Kelly with the trunk; I asked what he had got there - he said what was that to me - it was his property. I told him I was an officer - he pulled out a stick and struck me on the head - we fought for about ten minutes - Jacobs got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. FISH. Q. Have you any reason to think that Jacobs saw you? A. I do not know; I saw him speaking to the other prisoner, and directly I seized Kelly I saw him walk off at a quick rate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there light enough for you to see his features? A. Yes; he passed a gas light, and I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160062"></xptr>>plainly - it was about twenty minutes before six o'clock; I am sure Jacobs knew me.</p>

I am Jacobs' brother - he had seven examinations before Mr. Bennet; I was called in on the sixth or seventh examination, and Mr. Bennet told the attorney and the officer that he should not commit them till he had facts before him - the attorney said he did not care for Mr. Bennet, and they went and found a bill - they were called before Mr. Bennet again, who said, "What do you mean by this, Vann - I have a great mind to let the case go to the ground - I have a great mind to let Sir Richard Birnie know of your conduct" - and they brought on the case yesterday morning before the Grand Jury.</p>

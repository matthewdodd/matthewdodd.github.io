               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was unfortunately married to this woman when I was an apprentice, I lived very sociably with her upwards of a twelvemonth, when her temper became so violent and disgraceful to all human society, that I could not bear to live with her any longer, I parted with her, and lived from her six years. It so happened that I had to go down into Oxfordshire, she wrote letters repeatedly, saying that she would be happy to live with me, and be a different woman to what she was before; I consented so to do, we lived in peace and comfort nine or ten months in the country, when I had finished my job I came to London; it is only two years ago that she robbed the house where I lodged, where I was taken up, the people knowing me innocent, never offered to prosecute; she frequently told me that I might go out on the highway, and get more money in two or three hours than I could earn in a month. I parted with her on the 2d of last September twelvemonth, I agreed to allow her a crown a week, and to pay ten pound a year for her house rent, I paid the last half years rent for her on the 10th of September last, when she found out I was married, she would not take my money any longer.

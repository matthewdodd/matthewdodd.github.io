            . On the 3d of April, Sherriden and Aplin brought this cable to my house; they had put it in my cellar: I desired to know whose property it was? they told me it belonged to one Mr. Bucannan, the mate of the Carolina: I insisted upon further satisfaction, or they should not go. Then they wrote a letter to this purpose;</p>
               <p>"Sir, we are stopped at Mr. Smith's, with the hauser that we were to sell, and were to bring brooms and greens with: I desire you will come and clear us." I went myself on board the ship, to Mr. Bucannan, and he came on shore: I shewed him the hauser; he said. it does not belong to me: it belongs to such a captain, mentioning the prosecutor; he charged the two men, and they were sent to the watch-house. After that, one of them got the liberty to come to my house again; he then charged the mate with being concerned, in sending it by them, to sell it, and bring him the money; but the next morning, Mr. Bucannan was cleared by the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be brought here?</p>
               <p>Smith. Mr. Bucannan did own to me he sent them on shore to sell it, and to buy brooms and greens, and bring him the money for the ship's use.</p>
               <p>Sherriden's Defence.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell who cut the hauser: the mate ordered me to carry it on shore, and to bring brooms and greens on board: he delivered it to me, on the forecastle of our ship.</p>
               <p>Bucannan's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never gave any such orders. I am chief mate of the vessel: my orders were to the boatswain and second mate, to sweep all the odd ends of rope together, and go on shore, and exchange them for brooms and greens.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call odd-ends of rope?</p>
               <p>Bucannan. I mean short pieces, about a foot long. These two men cleared me before the justice: if I had a mind to have been a thief, I could have taken something worth my while.</p>
               <p>Aplin's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came on board that evening, and heard the mate say, he had liberty to sell junk, and such like.</p>

            . I am a custom house officer: I was on board the Carolina, on the 3d of April: the two other prisoners went on shore, at the same time Mr. Bucannan was in his cabin, about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I was on the deck. Mr. Bucannan was snoring asleep: I said Mr. Bucannan drives his hogs to market. About an hour after this, I heard a noise, and saw Mr. Bucannan run with a candle in his hand, in his shirt and breeches; there was talk about a rope; he ran to see if it was his own new rope: this was after Mr. Smith came with the account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. Did Bucannan own he ordered them to take this great piece of cable?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did say he ordered them to take this piece on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say this piece of cable or junk?</p>
               <p>Smith. He mentioned junk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call this old junk?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Cannot you tell whether he said carry that piece. or carry old junk?</p>

             Some. I attended the ship, the Carolina: the mate was in the cabbin, snoaring asleep, when the rope was taken away. I am the waterman's apprentice, and moored our boat at the bow: I missed my boat, and went to look round, and found her with this rope lying part in her, and the end of it was not cut: Aplin cut it, as the other part was on board the ship, and the bit fell down into our boat: I jumped into the boat, and desired them to hawl it up: Sherriden was on the poop; it was chopped off partly, and then he cut it with a knife. I heard the custom-house officer say, that the mate was driving his hogs: when they had cut it, they carried it away. I rowed them on shore at St. Catharine's.</p>

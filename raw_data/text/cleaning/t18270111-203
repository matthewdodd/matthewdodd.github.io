            . On the 23d of December I bought a coat in Covent-garden, at a sale; I tied it up, and sent my boy home with it in a truck, while I went another way - when I came home I heard it was stolen; I have not seen it since.</p>

            . I am in Hodge's employ. I had this coat in a truck, to take to No. 39, Old-street. I was coming out of Cow-lane - the prisoner and another lad followed me, and both pushed behind the truck; I put it down, and thanked them, but wished them to go away; they said they were going further, and would push on. When I got to the pig-market I saw the other running with the bundle, and the prisoner just after him, about three yards from the truck; I ran and collared him - he knocked me down, but I still followed, and had him taken.</p>

            . I was in Bartholomew-close, saw the prisoner running, and Burke just after him; he caught hold of him - the prisoner knocked him down, and struck him when he was on the ground; I went up, and struck him with a cane, and said, "What, are you going to kill the boy?" as soon as Burke could recover he said he had been robbed - I secured him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran; a man said, "There goes the man," and he took me, but I was not with the other.</p>

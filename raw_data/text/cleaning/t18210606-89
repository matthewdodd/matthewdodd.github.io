            's house. I have the front room, up stairs; the prisoner lodged in the same room; I lost my watch on the morning of the 31st of May, he had gone out very early in the morning; I missed it from the chair when I got up, it was silver; I have had it ten years, and gave 5 l. for it; it had a steel chain. He never returned, he had lodged there three weeks, and did not say he was going - I found him the same day at High-gate, in custody with the watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. About half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was going down Highgate-hill, the prisoner came towards me, in a direction from Hadley; I stopped him, and searched him, and found the watch in his waistcoat pocket - he could not tell the maker's name; I asked where he came from, he said, from Barnet, about three o'clock - I said, that was impossible; and I was sure he had stolen it, and gave him in charge; I found it belonged to Bowers.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Angel-court, Throgmorton-street; on the 26th of November, between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18331128-21-crimeloc129">Mincing-lane</placeName>

               <p>HENRY KEMBLE. I live at Camberwell. On the 26th of November, I was in Mincing-lane, and in consequence of what Lane stated, my attention was called to my handkerchief, which was gone from my pocket - this is mine, I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

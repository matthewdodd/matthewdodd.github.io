                  </hi>. I live in New Compton-street, Soho. On the 10th of September, I was going from Compton-street to the Kent-road—passing down Macclesfield-street I saw the prisoner with two others in Gerrard-street, Soho—the other two have been tried—I am positive the prisoner is the man who was with them—it was between two and three o'clock—I was alone—they appeared in conversation, and having seen this prisoner and one of the others before in the neighbourhood, I looked at them, and I saw just before them the prosecutor and another gentleman walking arm-in-arm together—I saw one of the others put his hand into the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's pocket, and take out his purse—I saw the purse in his hand, and he put it into his own pocket—the prisoner was as close as possible to the pro<lb></lb>secutor, on one side of him—he appeared to be covering the other—the prosecutor was pressed so closely on the side where his purse was not, that it caused him to look round on that side, while the other took his purse—the prisoner then walked about a dozen yards straight on past the pro<lb></lb>secutor, he then turned round short, and walked back again towards Princes-street—I told the prosecutor he had lost his purse.</p>

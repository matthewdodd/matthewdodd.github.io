I had a watch hanging over my fire-place on the first floor, on the 12th of November; the street door is generally kept shut; it was stolen between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw it again at Queen-square - the prisoner was then in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time had you seen the watch? A. Between twelve and one - I don't know the number of it, nor the maker's name - it has been in my possession fourteen years.</p>

            . I am wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came to our house on the 12th of November, a little after two o'clock; he was in my parlour, where I was ironing - he said he was cold in his feet - that his master had sent him the evening before to his washerwoman, who was dead, and he had recommended me - I got a chair, and set it before the fire for him to warm himself - the watch then hung over the mantel-piece - he got up and put his foot on the bar, reached up his hand, and took it down - he put it towards his bosom and then rushed out of the house, saying he would bring his master's card at six o'clock. I pursued him - he ran into Warwick-place, and on his seeing me he got behind some houses, and I lost sight of him before he was stopped - in a moment he came in a direction towards me - I collared him, and accused him of taking my property - he said he had not got it - I told him he had flung it away. It was found in a lady's garden close at the back of the houses. I am quite sure it is ours. My landlord's son came up, and took him into the house till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man said he was coming back at six o'clock, but you did not wait to see if he would? A. No. I knew him before - he got a long way before me when he was running.</p>

On the 3d of November, about 7 o'clock, I was cleaning my plate in the pantry adjoining the kitchen; the housemaid, who was in the front parlour, heard a noise in the street; she looked out of the window and saw a <rs id="t18051204-16-deflabel101" type="occupation">boy</rs>

She asked me if I saw any body come in; I said I did not; I had seen the desert spoon a few minutes before, I looked for it and it was missing; I ran after the prisoner at the bar as fast as I could; he went into Russel-square; I called out Stop Thief; he was stopped by a young man, he threw the desert spoon down first, and the table spoon and the table cloth next; I came up to him and took him; I produce them; they are the property of my master, Mr. Ferdinand Medina.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two boys in Russel-square coming along; one of them that cried Stop Thief, chucked the property behind me, and that gentleman took me; now he says he saw me chuck them away myself.</p>

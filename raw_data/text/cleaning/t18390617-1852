                  </hi>. I live with my mother in Joseph-street, St. George's in the East. On the 19th of April I was coming home, down Joseph-street, and saw the two prisoners walking down the street together—they went towards a clothes-line which hung at the bottom of the street, and peeped round the corner at the linen—I told my mother, and in consequence of what she said, I went to Mrs. Wright, and she and I went into Lucas-street, where we saw the prisoners—I saw the shift hanging out of the side of Barrow's jacket—when they saw us, Barrow ran away—Wilmore walked on—we overtook him, and Mrs. Wright asked him for the shift—he said, "I know nothing about your shift"—I said to Mrs. Wright, "Yes, he does, he was with the one that took it"—he threatened to break my head, and used a bad expression—Mrs. Wright said, "You dare touch her, or I will slap your face."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's mother, but am married again—she told me something which induced me to go to the door, and I saw Barrow take the linen and run away with it—he attempted it twice—I directly sent my daughter to Mrs. Wright.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wright, and live in Joseph-street. On a Friday in April I had some clothes hanging out on a line across the street, to dry—the witness Coleman came, and gave me some information, in consequence of which I ran with her in pursuit, and saw both the prisoners walking together—when they saw us coming Barrow ran away—I ran after him as far as I could, but could not overtake him—I observed the shift hanging down the left side of his jacket—Wilmore walked on—I accused him of being as bad as the other—he made use of a very awful expression to the little girl, and said he was not with him—when I returned I missed the shift from the line, and the pegs were lying on the ground, as if it bad been taken by force—I had the shift to wash, and was answerable for it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 278.) I apprehended Wilmore on the 25th of May—I told him I wanted him for a shift, taken out of Joseph-street—he said he knew nothing about it, he had not done it—I took him to the station-house, and charged him with being in company with Barrow, and stealing the shift—I had been after him and Barrow for more than three weeks, but could not find them—he asked me if any one was coming against him that knew him—I said, "Yes"—he wanted me to point them out, as we stood in the passage by the Magistrate's door, but I did not point out Coleman or her mother—he said he hoped I would not put forth a paper, which he called a former conviction—I found Barrow afterwards in custody at Lambeth-street for another robbery—I told him what I wanted him for—he denied tailing the shift, and said he had not seen it—I told him I had been after him better than three weeks, and could not find him—he said he had seen me about—I have frequently seen the prisoners together in company.</p>

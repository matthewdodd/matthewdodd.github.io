            . I am a marshalsman. I was coming out of Plough-court, and saw the prosecutor going along with a cash-box; the prisoner and another were close to him - the other went away, and when they got to the corner the prisoner left the gentleman; I stopped the prisoner, turned him round, and said, "What are you about?" I saw this handkerchief in his waistcoat pocket, and his coat was covering it. I went into the banker's, and Mr. Reid identified it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

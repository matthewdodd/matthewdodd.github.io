                  </hi>. I am a plumber. I was repairing a house in Pearl-row, Blackfriars-road—the prisoner occupied a room above the one I was repairing—after I had done work we got into conversation, and went together to Aus<lb></lb>tin-buildings, Friar-street, and had a room there—I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—we were there a short time—I had four sovereigns in my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I went to the house twice with her—the second time I wrapped the four sovereigns in a piece of brown paper, and put them in my hat, which I put on the table—the prisoner took my hat up, and the paper rolled out on the floor—I picked up three sovereigns, and was going to pick up the other, and she kicked out the light—I called for another light, and the land-lady brought it—I put the three sovereigns on the table, and took the light to look for the other, but could not find it—while I was looking she took another sovereign from the three—the landlady said, "Why don't you look after the money she is swallowing?"—at last one sovereign was found, con<lb></lb>cealed in her stocking, and the other she said she had swallowed—I had given her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave her something to eat—I am a married man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to bed to her - A. I did; I wound my watch up in her presence and put it in my small clothes pocket; we went to bed; she would not take her clothes off; in the course of a few minutes she said she was very dry, she went down to get some gin and beer; when she went out for the gin she said take care of your smallclothes; she put them on the bed and I put them under my head, under the sacking; in the morning when I awoke the watch and the prisoner was gone. I have seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>- HUMPHRIES. I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner; I found the watch in her pocket.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He took me to this court, I did not like to stop there; he said take care of that watch; I know your landlandy and her daughter. He came up in the morning and brought an officer; I said have you come after the property, I have got it for you.</p>
               <p>Humphries. When I got round the bed I told her I should pull her out if she did not get out quick; I asked her where her pockets were; she said she had none; I said I should find them. She took the pockets out, I took the watch out with my left hand; I said, slow that then; she said he gave her the watch last night to take care of; I asked him, he said not.</p>

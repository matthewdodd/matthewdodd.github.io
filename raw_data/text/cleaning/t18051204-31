               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You or your brother opened a drawer in Mrs. Reeves's back parlour, and found a black fur tippet; did you know that to be your property? - A. I can swear to it; between eleven and twelve the same night I received some black lace, black velvet, and some gloves, from her son, together with a pair of cotton stockings, a straw hat; shortly after I received them from her son; she said she was very sorry for what had happened, and was also sorry that she had not told the night before.</p>

               <p>Q. After the boy had brought the things, Mrs. Reeves with great anxiety brought all the things, and said that she was very sorry that she had not given them you at first; had you known Mrs. Reeves before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew of your servant going to Mrs. Reeves? - A. Not till the day before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to know Mrs. Reeves? - A. Her husband was a carpenter; he had done jobs for us, and she had bought threads of us.</p>
               <p>Q. The box that was brought back was nailed and directed? - A. It was.</p>

             to Mrs. Reeves? - A. Yes, on Saturday the 9th of November, Ann Halward asked Mrs. Reeves for a box, Mrs. Reeves called the young man to fetch it. She said, that Mr. Bell had been there the day before enquiring about the box, and she thought it safest to send it out of the way. Ann and me sat down while the young man fetched the box; when the box was brought, I took it home to my brothers. The box was opened, and an inventory of the things laid upon the top of the things in the box: my brother settled with Ann, and let her go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her who wrote that inventory? - A. I did not.</p>

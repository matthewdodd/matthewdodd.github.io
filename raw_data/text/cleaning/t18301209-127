            . I live in Grove-street, Camden-town - I take in washing, and fetch it from town in a cart. On the 29th of November I was in the cart; a man named Priestly was driving it - I had a basket, containing these articles, which belonged to Mr. Charles Baxter; it was dirty linen - I had been watching it all up the <placeName id="t18301209-127-crimeloc726">Edgware-road</placeName>

Mrs. Gardiner said the basket was gone - I got down; a boy asked if I had missed any thing; I said Yes - he said a man had got into a coach - I ran up to the coach, and the prisoner jumped out; I made a grasp at him, but he got from me, and was taken by the Policeman.</p>

            . I live at Portsea; I came to obtain some pension money at Greenwich. On the 23rd of April, near eleven o'clock at night, I was coming from <placeName id="t18080601-40-crimeloc225">St. Martin's lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did not you go into any room with he. - A. No; we came out of the liquor shop; she then began to board me, she came to close quarters, she felt at my pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket - A. No, but I felt her very busy about my person; I took hold of her hand, I never let go of her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in her hand - A. I smelt her hand and I knew there was a one pound note in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open her hand - A. No, I could not; I kept my hold; she threw my hat over my head, still I would not let go my hold; she slapped me on both sides of my head, then I called the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she get away with any thing of your property - A. No; I did not let go my hold; after that I went to the watchhouse to have her safe moored, there I delivered her up to 
               <persName id="t18080601-40-person363">Gregory</persName>
             the constable; he had a good deal to do to get her hand open, he unscrewed her hand, she dropped the one pound note; it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the note drop did you - A. Yes, I knew it to be mine by the smell of it, and by the name on it; I happened to have a bottle of bergamot in my pocket; it was stained with it.</p>

            . Q. Was you constable of the night - A. I was; I produce the note; Johnson came in the watchhouse in a strange kind of a state, with his handkerchief tore off his neck, and with a thick rough coat on; he had hold of the girl, he brought her in; he says I have boarded her at last; he delivered her into my custody; I thought he was joking, the woman said nothing was the matter; he said she had got a note of his; she said I will be damned if I have; Johnson said it was wrapped in a piece of brown paper, and he knew the note by the smell of it. I desired her to open her hand; she refused it; I rubbed her hand and got it open; I took this note out of a small bit of paper, the same paper it is in now.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it any particular smell - A. It has now, of bergamot.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the note; he wanted to take great liberties with me, he hit me upon the breast; I called the watch, I gave charge of him, and he gave charge of me.</p>

About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 29th of January, I was on my way home to Pentonville, and by the dead wall, at the back of the Merlin's Cave public-house, I was struck violently by the prisoner, and my watch was nearly pulled out of my pocket; if he had not taken hold of my small-clothes likewise, he would have got it; he ran by me - I pursued, and did not lose sight of him for two seconds, till he was taken - the light shone full in his face, and I am quite certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a young woman in the street, and it was a very narrow road. Witness. I had just noticed the young woman before he came up - the road was wide enough for three carriages to go along.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the mode of the attack, do you entertain any doubt that he meant to rob you of your watch? A. No - I felt for my watch, and it was nearly gone out of my pocket - the seals were hanging down quite low.</p>

I pursued the prisoner, who was running, and saw him stopped, without losing sight of him; the prosecutor came up behind me - I heard the sound of a blow, and saw the prisoner separate himself from the prosecutor; I had a bundle under my arm, and was going to my home; in Margaret-street; if I had not had the bundle I should have caught him.</p>

I ran against the gentleman, but with no intention of robbing him; he was gaping after a young woman - I was coming down the hill, and could not stop myself; I said, "I beg your pardon," and ran on - I then heard a cry of Stop him! but no thief attached to it; I ran on, because I knew I had committed an assault, by running against him.</p>

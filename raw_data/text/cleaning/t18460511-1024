                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, Islington. On Saturday, the 2nd of May, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Barns-bury-park, in the Liverpool-road, Islington, at the gate of a house—I had a reticule on my arm, fastened to my hand by two silk cords—after ringing the bell, I was in the act of opening the gate, and the prisoner Hole came and snatched my bag—on turning round, Godfrey was at my elbow, and said he would catch him for me—I did not accept his offer, and he ran away himself, following Hole—he did not bring Hole back to me—<hi rend="italic">a groom on</hi> horseback overtook Hole, and brought him back—he said he was very sorry—the cords were broken which held the reticule to my arm—there was a little pocket-book in it—Godfrey was apprehended outside the station-house, on Islington-green.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Godfrey.</hi> I crossed over to the lady from the other side of the way, where I was with a young man who works at a baker's, and whom I know—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and said, "What have you lost?"—she said, "A reticule," and I said I would run after him—I ran as hard as I could,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110046"></xptr>
               <p>and a man on horseback passed me, and overtook this man. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I turned round the instant it was taken, and found him at my elbow instantly—it must have been done in his presence—I cannot say whether I had called "Stop thief" before he offered to run after the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I was riding in Barnsbury-park, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw both prisoners running—Hole was first—I saw him throw the reticule away—a schoolmaster picked it up—I did not lose sight of Hole till he was stopped—when I was got to the station I saw the prisoner Godfrey taken into custody—in my opinion, Godfrey had some connexion with Hole—I do not think he wanted to catch him: he did not run so fast as him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Godfrey.</hi> I have a very bad leg; I followed down to the station with the mob, with a man I was in company with: the policeman pulled me inside, and asked if I knew Hole; I said I had never seen him before.</p>

I took Hole, and showed him to the prosecutrix—I asked if he was the person—she said, "Yes"—he said, "I am the person, I am very sorry for it"—in going to the station he said a young man threw it at him as he was going past.</p>

On the afternoon in question, about five o'clock, I saw both the prisoners walking and talking to<lb></lb>gether in the Liverpool-road—they appeared acquainted—it was about an hour and a half before this happened—about seven o'clock in the evening I saw Hole in custody—I took Godfrey outside the station, in the mob—I said, "You must go into the station"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—di<lb></lb>rectly I took him I asked the lady if he was the other—she said, "Yes"—I am as sure I saw them together at five o'clock, as I am of seeing them together now—they were in my sight for five minutes—I did not know them before—my attention was drawn to them by the sauntering way they were going along—it was 300 or 400 yards from the spot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Godfrey.</hi> I was in Holloway-road at that time, and was never in the other prisoner's company in my life—I should not have gone to the station if I had been the thief.</p>

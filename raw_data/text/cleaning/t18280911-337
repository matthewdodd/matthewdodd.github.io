I lost six ducks, on Sunday, the 7th of September, and six others were killed; I had seen them all safe the night before; and at eight o'clock that morning, I missed them from my shed, which is about thirty yards from my house; there was no violence on the shed door, but it appeared as if some animal (I presume a dog) had got under - there are some men about there who have dogs trained for that purpose: I saw my ducks at the watch-house; they were dead, and appeared as if worried and taken hold of by a dog - they were bloody.</p>

            . I was with Mann, and saw the prisoners coming down the road, with a bundle in Martin's possession; I followed, stopped him, and asked what he had got - I felt the bundle, and it appeared to me to be poultry; I took him and delivered him up to the constable - there was a dog of a whitish colour, running after them; he followed us to the watch-house, and there we lost him - the constable found six ducks in the bundle, which the prosecutor saw in the morning and claimed.</p>

            . I am a constable of Edmonton. I was called up, between one and two o'clock, by the two watchmen; they gave charge of the two prisoners, and the bundle, which contained six ducks dead, but warm - they neither of them gave any account of them: I shewed the same ducks to the prosecutor, who owned them directly.</p>

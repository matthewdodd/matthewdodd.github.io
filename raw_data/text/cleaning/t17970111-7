               <p>Q. She is here, is not she? - A. No; I came down and found the door that goes into the garden open, and that the till was forced open with some irons that had been taken from the fire; then I looked about the house and missed a tea caddie, with a pound of 8s. green tea, that had been put in the same morning; after that, I went into the back room, and looked in the beaufet, and found five china bowls gone, they had left the matches burning underneath, in the bottom of the cupboard; I then went into the front room, and missed some glass tumblers, I cannot tell how many, I suppose there were five or six gone off the side-board; I then immediately went into the garden to see if I could find the till, supposing it might might be thrown away; I did not find the till, but I found the lock of it, which I have in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it to be the lock of the till? - A. I locked it up myself every night; one of the witnesses went down a field adjoining the garden, and found five china bowls, and four rummers, and then I received a note from Mr. Patrick, that there was a suspicious man in his house, selling good half-pence, fourteen-pence for a shilling, and I got a warrant, and went to Mr. Patrick's, and had him apprehended, Mr. Patrick keeps the White-hart public-house, in the same parish; the prisoner asked the officer's name, his name is Tatham, and said, he wished to speak with him in another room; we then went into the room with him, and he put his hand in his pocket, and said, I am the person that robbed you, and this is your property; he produced 8s. 11 1/2d. in copper, and a bad shilling and sixpence; in going to the Magistrate's, I asked him what he had done with the till, and the tea caddie, he said, he had concealed it in a ditch, at the back of Mr. Scales's sand-house, some persons then went and found it there; I then asked him, if he had any confederates, and he said he had one, that he let in at half past eleven o'clock, whose name and person he knew very well, but would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe how he let him in, or where? - A. At the back door in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this back door last? - A. I saw it bolted at eleven o'clock, when I went up to bed; there were two strong bolts and no lock to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these bolts were shut? - A. I bolted them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those china bowls? - A. Thirty shillings, the large one cost me 17s. and the small ones I don't know what they cost, they were in the house when I came to the house.</p>

            . I live in Great Russell-street, Covent-garden; I deal in coins, metals, and anitquities. I bought these articles of the prisoner at different times; I gave about 10l. for them - I observed something particular in their appearance; I went to the Musenm, and saw similar articles - I bought some on the 11th of August, and for three or four days before - there were some tickets on them, and I saw some tickets on those at the Museum; I have kept the tickets of those I bought - they are genuine antiques about 1800 or 1900 years old.</p>

             (Police-constable C 30). I was on duty in Piccadilly; I took the prisoner on the 13th of August, at the Egyptian Hall, and received these articles from Mr. Till - I found on the prisoner two gold rings, two medals, and some money.</p>

               <p>JAMES KENNERLY. When I took the prisoner I took off his hat, and there was a dent in it, in which, probably, some of these things had been, and some hay in it, and some hay was in these things; he said he had been playing with some horses in a stable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TILL re-examined. Q. How came you to buy of him? A. I had bought some things of him before, of what they call Terra cotta; I then lost sight of him for some time - I then saw him again, and he sold me these things; they ask 4l. or 5l. a-piece for them at the Museum, which is a ridiculous price.</p>

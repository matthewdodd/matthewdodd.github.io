On the 23rd of March I was in London' and met a person who asked me to go and drink with him at the <placeName id="t18320906-99-crimeloc575">New London-bridge tap</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. They breed acute men in Staffordshire, do they not? A. Yes - I do not know whether they call me acute; I am speaking the truth - I had come to London at that time to bring salt; I had three 5l. notes in a yellow purse, and twenty sovereigns and one half-sovereign - I mean I saw the prisoner a fortnight ago, not a fortnight after the time; it was five months after I lost my money that he was taken - I had seen a man once in the mean time, who I thought had taken my money, but I had a load on my back, and could not follow him; it was a gentleman farmer who asked me to go in - I drank once or twice of the ale, and had some tobacco; I was there an hour - the other man did not touch my money at all, I believe: I kept my eye on the prisoner, but he deceived me, or some what else did - I felt the same bulk in my pokcet, as I went along; I am not mistaken in the prisoner.</p>

             (Police-constable H 168.) I was in East Smithfield, and heard an alarm of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running away - I pursued him; he turned up Dock-street - I followed him: he turned to the left, and went into a Jew's, who sells old clothes, the second door on the left-hand; he hid himself behind the door, and I went in and took him - he said, "You must not take me -I have done nothing:' I took him to the station - I found on him this watch, a duplicate, a Bath note for 5l., and two flash notes for 100l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say you know that persons who are not thieves, carry flash notes? A. I have seen them - I cannot find that there is such a bank at Bath as his other note refers to.</p>

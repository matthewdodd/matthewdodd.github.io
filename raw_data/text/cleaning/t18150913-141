            , and keep an eating-house, in East Smithfield. About the 29th of June, the prisoner and another young man dined at our house; he dined again, and asked me how I was? I told him when my husband had done with the sea, he would be glad of some employment. He said, it was in his power to do some thing for him. He then said he belonged to the Custom House himself, and then pulled out some warrant, or something to shew me that he did: and he could get my husband a situation, and it would only be two or three pounds expence to him; he said he did not want any thing for his own trouble, unless he was asked to drink a glass of any thing with the parties. When my husband came home, I told him what he had said. I told him when my husband would be at home, and he accordingly came; he said to my husband, your wife has been saying that you would wish to get some employ in your leisure time. He told him that it was in his power to obtain him some employ, and a place in the Custom House, and that it would only cost him two or three pounds expence for fees of the office. I was obliged to go away, and did not hear him say any more then.</p>

            . After the night of the 29th of June, my wife informed me what the prisoner had said to her. The next evening he came to sop at our house, seemed very friendly, and asked us how we did; he told me my wife had been telling him that I should wish some employ in my leasure hours; that he could get me a situation as weigher in the Custom House, that would not require above three or four hours daily attendance, and that it would bring me in three or four shillings a-day, and it would not cost more than two or three pounds for office fees to get that situation. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130050"></xptr>him, I was very much obliged to him. He said he did not want any thing for himself, unless it was to take a glass of any thing with the parties; he appointed the Monday following to go to the Custom House, and said it would want twelve shillings for fees of the office, and ten shillings to pay for the printed warrant. I went with him to the Custom House, and he went into an office, having got this money from me, and told me to wait outside; he returned, but without the warrant; and put me off by telling me it was not ready; he got other sums from me at different times, and always put me off with different excuses.</p>

I am enabled to say that it was utterly impossible for him to procure a situation for any person in the Custom House. He never paid any money for any printed warrant, nor was any thing of the kind required.</p>

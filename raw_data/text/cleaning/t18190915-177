On the 3d of August, Beswick had driven a postchaise for us to Southall, and as he returned, he met with an accident; the prisoner brought the chaise to the mews for him, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning - he helped to do up the horses. I asked him if he wanted a job? He said he did, and I told him he might come next morning, and do Beswick's work. About six o'clock in the morning he came; I gave him the key of the stable, out of the window, then dressed myself, and found that Watson, my horse-keeper, was also come. About half-past eight o'clock Watson said the prisoner had done his work. I said he might stop, but he said he could not, as he had got a job; I gave him 2 s., and as he went out of the mews, I told Watson to go and fetch my husband's blue jacket, which I had lent to Beswick.</p>

            . On the 3d of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and said Mrs. Hughes had sent for a jacket and pair of breeches, which she had lent my husband. I was going up stairs; he went up with me, shook hands with my husband, and said,</p>
               <p>"How are you, Tom?" He then said he was sent for the breeches and jacked, and I gave them to him; he staid there about half an hour. After he was gone I missed the spurs off my husband's boots, which were by the side of the bed, where the prisoner sat. I immediately went to Mrs. Hughes, and found she had not sent him, then went in pursuit, and found him in Tottenham-court-road, about half-past twelve o'clock, with the spurs on. I followed him to the Rising Sun, public-house - I went in to him. The landlord pushed him out of the house, and refused to take him into custody, although he was a constable, as he had a staff - he said that was only to protect his own house. I followed the prisoner across the road; he said he would go and tell Tom that I had charged a constable with him. He ran into my house, which was just by, told my husband that I was a base woman for charging a constable with him, and said</p>
               <p>"Here is the spurs, I only borrowed them for half an hour to go with a horse." My husband said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care for my spurs, where are my master's clothes?" He said,</p>
               <p>"I have carried them home my boy, and given them to the old woman." I said he had not - he said,</p>

               <p>"Yes I have, and gave them to the young covey. He endeavoured to get out, but two men came to my assistance, and kept him till the constable came and took him. I saw the clothes at the office.</p>

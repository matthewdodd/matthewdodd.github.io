He keeps an Italian warehouse; he has lived there nearly five years; the letter was brought to me on the 7th of August, I think - I have a particular reason for thinking so, as a servant's character was inclosed in it, and the lady who sent it to me, wished me to give it to the servant who was anxiously expecting the character to arrive; the date of the post-mark is the 7th of August - it came from Lymington; I inquired of him for the overcharge; he always said he had not yet got it.</p>

            . I am a window clerk in the General Post-office; it is my duty to make the rebate on overcharged letters; I keep a book to enter the letters on which those overcharges are returned - I have the book; here is an entry on the 10th of August, "Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street; the original charge 2s. 3d. - the allowance 1s. 6d.;" I erase the original charge, and put the reduced charge on the letter, and that is done on this letter by myself; it was reduced from a treble, to a single rate; there are other letters as well as this, seven or eight in number, overcharges; the amount of these overcharges is 5s. 6d; when this entry is made, the letters are tied together with a piece of string, and the amount being 5s. 6d., would be placed in that string, merely to secure it from falling out; the letter-carrier's bring them to us in that form, ande we tie them up again and and place the money immediatly under the string; they are returned next morning to the letter-carrier's office; I don't know whose custody that money would come to; my duty don't extend to that department; it is sent to the letter-carrier's office; the receipt of money is acknowledged by a person signing T. or J. Deacon; I don't know who he is; the entry is, "Mrs. Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street, 2s. 3d. - 1s. 6d.; signed, T. Deacon."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you call the rebate? A. An allowance made on letters overcharged; this book contains the entries of the rebates; there is no particular carrier employed for the purpose of taking the letters to the letter-carrier's office: the prisoner is certainly not the man to whom I gave the money.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier of the General Post-office; I belong to No. 1 division, which the prisoner belongs to; when the window-clerk has entered in his book the overcharges and rebate, the overcharged letters are brought round to me by one of the sorters, with the money to be allowed on them; this is my signature to the book, acknowledging that I received the overcharges for that day; it is my duty to give to the carriers of the different walks, the overcharged letters and rebate; there is an entry of a letter directed to Mrs. Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street; I returned that letter and the money to the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of August; I gave him 1s. 6d. - he should have given that to Mrs. Collins; the prisoner's signature is on this letter; "Single, J. Borrett;" I cannot swear to his hand-writing, but if it had been written by any other person belonging to his district, I should have given it to the prisoner; seeing that name on the letter, understanding what district it belonged to, and knowing he delivered in that district, I should have given the prisoner the money; I have no doubt of the money and letter being given to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Not the slightest in the world? A. No; I am certain I gave it him; there is nothing particular which calls it to my recollection; I return rebates every morning - I don't remember the identical letter, nor giving him the 1s. 6d. on that identical letter - but I swear, according to the book, that I did return 1s. 6d. on that letter; I will undertake to swear, that I did give the prisoner 1s. 6d., as the rebate on that letter - I gave it to him, to return to Mr. Collins, not Mrs. Collins; I gave him the money to return to the party to whom the letter was addressed; he should not have given it to anybody else, except to a branch of the family.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Would he be justified in returning it to anybody, Mr. Collins authorised to receive it? A. Yes; if his wife received the letter, and paid the postage, he would be justified in returning it to her; I never gave the overcharged letter to a carrier, without giving him the money, as he would be answerable for it - he would not take it without the money.</p>

            . I live at No. 14, York-court, East-street, Manchester-square; I have seen the prisoner there delivering letters - he brought me this letter(looking at it) - I paid 2s. 10d. for the postage - I opened it in his presence, and shewed him that it was a single letter; it came from Ireland - I required half the postage back again - he told me to give him the letter in a day or two and he would bring it to me with half the postage back again - I gave him the letter on the Saturday evening following, in High-street, while he was ringing his bell - the letter was directed to East-street, Mary-le-bone - he found me out - I saw him on the Tuesday following in High-street, and spoke to him about returning the letter, but I did not expect he would have it then; I told him I would meet him in High-street, the next evening, while he was ringing his bell, and I met him on the following evening (Thursday) and asked him for my letter; he put his hand to his side, and said he had forgotten it; I never saw him afterwards - I have never received my letter or money back - the letter was first delivered to me on a Tuesday or Wednesday - this Thursday, was the Thursday week afterwards - I had not authorised him to keep the money he was to receive for me, or to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times did you ask him to return you the overcharge? A. Once, I believe; I will swear I asked him once; I asked him for the letter twice; I did not ask him for the money, but, of course, I meant to have the money with the letter - when he clapped his hand to his side, he appeared to be feeling for the letter in his pocket, and then said, he had forgotten it; the letter is now torn across.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It has been out of your possession all this while? A. Yes; when he took the letter from me, he said, he would return me half the postage, which would be 1s. 5d. - when I asked him for the letter I expected the postage also - I know this to be the same letter from the inside of it.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. The two figures on the letters are yours? A.

I am letter-carrier of the same division as the prisoner; my signature is to this book - on the 28th of October, here is a letter entered in the name of "Wells, 14, York-street;" I have signed the book for the amount of money for that division, I delivered the letters to the different carriers - the entry here is"Wells, 14, York-street," but I only sign for the amount I receive - I did not receive a letter that day directed to "14, York-street" - there is a letter entered here, "14, York-street," but I did not receive such a letter - my signature is to the book as having received 5s. 9d. for rebates belonging to my division - there is a York-street in our division - this letter is directed "York-court, East-Street, Manchester-square;" that is in the prisoner's delivery - I have no means of saying whether I received that letter with the overcharge - the prisoner receives the rebate letters from me - the direction of this letter is in his walk, and his name is attached to the letter in his writing - the letter shows it has been overcharged, and the money returned - that letter and the rebate would be delivered to him in due course; I should have delivered it to the prisoner - the Post-office date on it is the 23rd of October, when it went out of the office first - I have no doubt but that I delivered that letter to the prisoner, but at what time I cannot say - the address of the letter is not correctly copied into the book; there is no such an address in it for that day; there is an address of "Wells, &amp;c." with exactly the same amount of postage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to swear you gave any person the overcharge on that letter? A. Yes, positively but not to the time - it must have been after the 23rd of October, that I gave it to the prisoner - I have no recollection of giving it to him, no more than in the general way, as I gave him them every morning, as he sits in his seat, and the money also - he sits the third man from me, and I gave him the whole sum - I received the rebate from a man named Reed, a sorter; it came from the window of the Inland-office.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 2nd of November, I searched the prisoner, and found on him this letter in a pocket-book, in his coat-pocket - there were more letters of the same kind in his pocketbook - I asked him about this one letter in particular; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280107"></xptr>said, he had neglected to return the postage, and that he had to meet the man at the corner of the street, but he had not seen him; he did not mention the man's name, but I inquired why he had not returned the money to Leonard; he said, he had neglected to do so, and had to meet him as before.</p>

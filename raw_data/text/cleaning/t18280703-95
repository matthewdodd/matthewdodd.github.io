               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What time was this? A. Half-past nine o'clock in the evening; it did not take long - he snatched it out of my hand; I had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030052"></xptr>him once before; the milk-woman outside saw me give him the shilling, but she is not here; my sister was gone at that time to take the waistcoat home; I had to go on to buy a mackerel - there was no boy named Harley by me; the woman saw it, and saw a person from a window, but they are not here - they called out from one of the windows, what a shame it was; the people afterwards persuaded me to follow him into the house, to see if I could get it - I went in, and there were some more people there, who said if I would give 2s. more they would give it me, but I had not any more to give; the prisoner was there, sitting smoking his pipe - I have not got the handkerchief since; I cried out very loudly, "Give me my handkerchief," but no one came to my assistance, and no one was by when he took it but the milk-woman.</p>

            . I am a constable. A person came to me at a quarter before ten o'clock, and stated that a boy at the Duke of Gloucester had been robbed of a silk handkerchief; I went up to the house, but as it is a most desperate house, and I had nearly lost my life there, I did not go in alone, but waited till the watchman came up; when I went in I saw this boy up in a corner. and those characters would not let him out: I called him out, and said, "What have you lost?" he said a silk handkerchief; I said, "Go in and point out the man" - he pointed out the prisoner; he said he had given him 1s., and he was to return him the handkerchief or the 1s., but he had not; two or three of them said, "Why don't you give the handkerchief," but the prisoner took no notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search him? A. Yes, but found nothing; the boy did not say anything to me about a milk-woman being there - there were not many persons round the house; the boy was in the house - I was told he had been crying for a quarter of an hour in the street: as I went in the prisoner seemed to be coming from the back yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had done work at half-past eight o'clock, and went to have a pint of beer; I came out to the door, and this lad said, "Tell John Harley I want him;" I went in, and said that person was wanted- this lad then came in, and I sat down; in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour the officer came and called this boy out, and in two or three minutes I was taken.</p>

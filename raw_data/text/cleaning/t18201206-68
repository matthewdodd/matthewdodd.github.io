I stood still, being cautious not to go into the crowd. In about half a minute the procession passed close by me - a person came up and snatched at my seals - my fob was twisted, which secured the watch. The ring broke and he got the seals. I ran after him, calling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060028"></xptr>Stop thief! and caught him fifty yards off, without losing sight of him. I was not five yards from him all the time, and am certain he is the man. I collared him, tore his coat, and fell down - nobody but ourselves were in the road. I was up in a moment. Two coachmen stopped him. We were going up Gate-street to get a constable, and were surrounded by a mob - one man said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, that is not the man that robbed you!" and struck me. Another man clasped his arms round my waist, and dragged me right from the prisoner - they held me against the wall and said</p>
               <p>"Off! off!" I followed him down a court, he ran against a house, I caught and held him - the same mob surrounded and beat me most dreadfully - I was not able to work for a week. A boy came and snatched at my pocket - I struck him, he came again, felt in my flap, pulled the fob and watch out, and called for a knife. I kicked him away. A constable came and took the prisoner, whom I had held all this time. I was dreadfully beat by weapons as thick as my wrist. I am certain the prisoner is the man who took my seals. His coat was torn when I retook him.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. I was in Long-acre about half-past six o'clock, in front of one of the processions, and saw the prisoner snatch two seals from another gentleman. I watched him into Queen-street, he turned towards the prosecutor; I did not see the snatch - I saw him run and the prosecutor following - I ran and assisted in taking him. We were kicked and beat very much by a mob. I was dragged into the road and obliged to let go. I caught him again, and the same gang surrounded us - he was at last secured. He is the man Scott was pursuing.</p>

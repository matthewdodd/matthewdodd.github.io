            . I am an officer. I received information, and apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of January; I had been to Mr. Broad's premises and saw some footsteps, which I compared with the prisoner's shoes; they fitted exactly, in size, the number of nails, and the size of the heads of the nails - I traced them from the hen-house to a moat, and then out of the premises into a field, which leads to the road: the prisoner's breeches had a great deal of blood on them, which appeared quite fresh, and some mud was put over it to hide it - a large piece was taken out of the front of his breeches, and only the lining left. He at first said the blood came from his nose bleeding, and afterwards from kiling a pig.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and live behind the Coach and Horses public-house, at Holloway. The prisoner's mother has a room at my house, and since he has been out of work, she has let him lodge there, as he could not pay his lodgings. On the night of the 28th of January, I heard him come home; I was in bed: I awoke and heard the watchmen call twelve o'clock directly after I heard him come in - I was sure it was him; he came to the window and called mother twice; his mother or sister went down softly and let him in; I heard him go up stairs rather heavily; I thought there were two or three people, and next morning early, Mr. Broad's servant came in a chaise and said they had lost the fowls - I took the prisoner's shoes and compared them with the marks; they corresponded exactly: it is a new made orchard, which is very clayey - we traced them mark for mark, and nail for nail; I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, and noticed his breeches, with a piece cut out in front, and more spots of blood below.</p>

Three geese, five fowls, and the rest of the duckes were found in a bag on the premises - the prisoner said at first, that the blood on his breeches was caused by fighting; and afterwards that he had been killing a pig. There must have been a good deal of blood on the person who did it, as the heads had been pulled off, and cut off.</p>

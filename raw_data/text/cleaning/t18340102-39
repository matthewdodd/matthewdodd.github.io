               <p>GEORGE TREWIN. I am a broker, and live in Weston-place, King's Cross - between twelve and one o'clock, on the 2nd of December, Hunniburn brought the truck to my door, and asked if I wanted to buy it - I said, "No, not exactly" - I looked at it, and asked what he wanted for it - he said,"2l. 5s." - I said, "I don't want the truck, but I will give you 1l. for it" - he said, "I will take it, and stand a drop of gin" - I said, "I don't think you came by it right" - he said, "Yes, I did," and laughed - I sent to the police station, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TREWIN. I was at work in my brother's shop, and while he was bargaining for the truck, Penfold said,"Say 25s., and a drop of gin, that is little enough."</p>

             TAYLOR (police-constable S 82). I was on duty, and took Hunniburn - he said the truck belonged to him, but he had rubbed the name out because he was going to sell it - I said I thought it would have looked better with the name on - he said he supposed he could do as he liked with his own property - I found on him a pepperbox and saltcellar.</p>
               <p>Hunniburn. Q. Where did you take me to? A. To the station-house - you took hold of the truck, and said you would take it to the station-house, and I said very well - you could not have got away.</p>
               <p>Q.Had I not been to you before, and told you the man would not give me the truck, and ask you to go with me to get it? A. No: I had not seen you.</p>
               <p>ALGRRNON SMITH. I took Penfold - he said that Hunniburn had hired him to move some goods, and had taken him with the truck to King's Cross; and then Hunniburn said he would rub the b-y name out, that he took it to the broker, and there was some dispute, and he went off.</p>
               <p>Hunniburn's Defence. I went to move some goods - we left the truck at the broker's, and he would not let me have it again - I got the officer to get it away; and then he said that I should go to the station-house - there was no name on the truck at all - the prosecutor said, before the magistrate, that he had not seen the truck the whole day before - I did not intend to defraud him, nor was it offered for sale; if it had, it would not have been left there for two hours, as it was - the reason this broker appears is because some parties stole some lead and a copper, and it was sold to him, and I have often threatened him with it.</p>

            . I was at the corner of Moor-lane, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - a man stood there - I saw the prisoner coming towards him - the waggon was a few yards off at the end of the lane; I heard the man say to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Go on, go on;" the prisoner then went on before me to the tail of the waggon, and attempted to take a box - I stopped to talk with a person, and saw him go over the way, and stand still for a moment, he then ran across, snatched the box out, and run away to the corner of Aldermanbury; it appeared too heavy - he let it slip from his shoulder, and endeavoured to throw it into a waggon which was going on, but did not succeed; the other man ran, and lifted it on his shoulder, ran after the waggon, and threw it into it; the waggoner turned round, and the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I have thrown a box in which is very heavy - I will give you a pint to give me a lift." I returned and told Crockett, and in half an hour I was fetched to Guildhall. I am certain he is the man.</p>

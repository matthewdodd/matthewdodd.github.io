I was in plain clothes, in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and saw Collins walking with Mr. Hendrich—(I did not know her before)—they walked down St. Ann's-lane—I followed them for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Winter followed them at a distance of twelve or twenty yards; sometimes on the same side of the way, and sometimes on the other—Collins left Mr. Hendrich in a hurried manner, and ran up Foster-lane, across St. Ann's-lane—Winter followed her almost immediately—I spoke to Mr. Hendrich; and, in consequence of what he said, I west after them—they were walking arm-in-arm along Aldersgate-street—they crossed, and went up Westmoreland-buildings—I met a brother officer, and spoke to him, and to the sergeant—I went after the prisoners—they both turned round, and at that moment I saw their hands join for an instant, as if something was passing—Winter started off running, and turned up Albion-buildings—I pursued him—after he had run a short distance, I heard something drop from him, which sounded like money—I overtook him, and brought him hack to the place, about twenty yards—I got a lamp lit, and could find nothing; but in the area of 21, Albion-buildings, opposite the spot, I found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open, with four half-crowns, five shillings, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, in it; and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the area—Collins was secured by the sergeant—the prisoners were taken to the station, where Collins threw herself down in the dock, and declared she was drunk, and that the did not know what she was about—I am certain it was not real—the said, speaking of Winter, "I never saw the man before in my life; I do not know anything at all about him"—Winter said, "She is a stranger to me, I know nothing at all about her."</p>

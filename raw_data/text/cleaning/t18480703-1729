Lubbock's, I inquired of a gentle<lb></lb>man the nearest way to the bankers.'—he said he could not tell—the prisoner Clark came up after me, and asked me where I wanted to go—I told him I wanted to go to the Mansion-house—he said he was going that way, and he</p>

B., at Mr. Clarence's, fruiterer, Church-passage, Pic<lb></lb>cadilly"—on the following Thursday I received a memorandum, in conse<lb></lb>quence of which I went to the East India Chambers, Leadenhall-street, on 20th April—I waited in the passage of the chambers, and Bradbury came to me—he asked if I was the young person who was to meet him there at two o'clock—I said, "Yes"—he asked me to walk with him to the corner of Lime-street, which I did; and as we walked he said he wanted me for a gen<lb></lb>tleman whose name was Bird, who resided near Bromley, in Kent, and who was going on the Continent for six or seven months, and wanted a servant to go with him, and he thought I should suit him—he said he would go and see if Mr. Bird was in town, but he was afraid he was not, as the day had been so wet—he asked me to go to the Custom House, and meet him thereat three, and at the same time gave me a shilling to get some refreshment—I went to the Custom House at three, and met Bradbury at the first door from Billingsgate Market—he said he had been to see, and Mr. Bird was not come to town; but he was authorized by Mr. Bird to engage a servant for him—I asked him twenty-two guineas for wages—he said that was twenty-three pounds, but I need not be particular, the gentleman was a very liberal. man, and he would as lief give me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I should have no objection to that, but I should be satisfied with twenty-two guineas—I was to meet him on Saturday, the 22nd, at eleven—I was there at eleven—he did not come till a quarter-past—he said he was in a hurry, and he made an appointment to meet him again at one, at the middle door at the Custom House, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went at one—he did not come till a quarter-past—we walked round to the water-side—he said he had got business at the Docks, business at the Custom House, and business in the City—he asked</p>

               <p>me if I could do the business for him in the City—I told him, "Yes"—he said it was a check, and rather a heavy one—he said he had a ship lying off the Docks, and they could not get it in till he had got the check cashed—he told me to take it, and if they asked me who I came from, I was to say, Messrs. Hunt and Co.; and if they asked me anything further, I was to say Mr. Thompson had sent me—this is the check he gave me (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was in a bill-case—he took it out and showed it to me—it is for 371<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a paper which had on it "Three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash"—he asked me how long I should be gone—I told him I thought about half an hour, unless they detained me—I went to Messrs. Lubbocks with the check—they cashed it, and I put the notes into the case—I took back the money to Bradbury, at the Custom House, against the water-side—I gave it to him—he took the notes out of the bill-case and looked at them, and I emptied the money out of my own purse and gave it him—he said he had heard from Mr. Bird, but he would not be in town till four, when he would be at Hatchett's Hotel, in Piccadilly—he told me to meet him there—he gave me a half-a-crown, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw's Guide</hi>, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my dinner—he said I was to be there a little before four, but he thought he should not be there till a little after—I went there, and he came, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about twenty minutes past four—I did not see whether there was anybody else in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he had just seen a messenger from Bromley, and that Mr. Bird, while hunting in the morning, had met with a slight accident, and would not be able to come to town till the following Tuesday or Wednesday—he said he must get me to wait till Tuesday or Wednesday to see Mr. Bird—he asked me what would satisfy me to keep me till Tuesday or Wednesday, that I night not look after anything else—he said he would give me a half sove<lb></lb>reign, if that would be sufficient—I said I thought it would—he gave me a half-sovereign, and as the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> turned round to go towards the City, I took the number of it—it was 2268—in consequence of an advertisement I after<lb></lb>wards saw in the paper, I went to Mr. Mullens and gave information.</p>

In consequence of directions, I went over to Brussels, on 1st May—I was present on 4th May, when an examination of the two prisoners took place before some legal authorities—Clark was examined first—before any questions were put to him by the Commissary there, a caution was given to him, on my suggestion—the Magistrate said, "Do you recollect what you have already stated about this affair of the bank-notes"—Clark said, "I do"—the Magistrate then said, "I wish to put some further questions to you which you may answer or not just as you please"—(he spoke in French, but there was a sworn interpreter there who translated what the Magistrate said to Clark)—the Magistrate stated that in the terms I have used—Clark said he was ready to answer—I have a note here for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 4253, 23rd Nov. Portsmouth, and a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 24181, 18th Aug. 1847—these notes were shown to Clark, and he was asked if he recognised them as the notes that had been taken from his person at the moment of his arrest—he examined the notes, and said they were—he was asked on what part of his person they were found—he said, in the inside pocket of his flannel uaistcoat—he was asked why he carried the notes in such a place—he said he had once lost a large sum of money, and ever since that time he had always carried his money in a more secure place, in the inside of his waistcoat—he was then asked where he got these two notes from—he said he had them from his companion Bradbury—he was then asked what notes he had changed in Brussels, out of the notes which were then lying on the table, six notes, and one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., they are all here—he said, "I changed one of these," and after looking at them, he selected this note, No. 24180, dated 18th Aug. 1847, Newcastle—he said, "I changed that for 118 Frederic d'ors; that is my own; I changed that at a money-changers"—he was then asked if he claimed any of the other notes, which were lying on the table—he said, "No, these do not belong to me"—he was asked how he became acquainted with Bradbury—he said he never saw him before they met at Dover—he was then asked where he got the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, which iie acknowledged he had changed—he said from a person at Dover, to whom he gave small notes for it—he was then shown the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper of 28th April, in which the numbers of the notes appeared, including No. 24180—after noticing that, he</p>

               <p>looked at the note again, and said, "If that note is in that advertisement, I am sure that is not the note that I changed"—he was then asked what note it was, he would acknowledge to have changed—he said, "The note I changed was dated 1847, but it was an older note, and I think, rumpled"—he was then asked where he got the notes from, which he had given in exchange for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, at Dover—he said, "I cannot say where I got those notes, but I could if I had my book"—he was asked where his books were—he said they were at home—he was asked where his home was—he said, "I will not say where that is, because I should disgrace my family"—he was then asked, whether he knew who the person was from whom he received the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he did not; he had met the person by accident, on the Quay, at Dover—his attention was called to some notes which had been taken from his person, but there were other notes produced, which were brought by different money-changers, in Brussels—Bradbury was then called in, and the same caution was given to him that had been given to Clark, and translated in the same way by the interpreter—his attention was directed to the whole of the notes that I have produced to-day, Nos. 45307, 42326, 36137, 38273, 2, 180, 24181—he said, "I received them from Mr. Bullock, 114, Yardley-sreet, King's-road, Chelsea, he gave them to me on Saturday, 22nd April, on the Quay, at Dover; the property which has been seized by the police is not mine but Mr. Bullock's; I received them on the Quay, and at the same time seven 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; these are the notes—that is my writing—I know them. by that"—the name, "J.

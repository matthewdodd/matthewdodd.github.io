               <p>The Prisoner's defence was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury. Being destitute of money, and at a great distance from my relations, not being able to see Counsel to defend me, I therefore throw myself upon the mercy of the Court, and crave the indulgence of the Court, to state the following facts: - I came from the North, applied to an office, engaged myself to Mrs. Flowers. It is not my wish or intention to discover what I know of Mrs. Flowers; it is enough for me to say, that I found myself in a situation ill-suited to the virtuous habits in which I had been bred, and I gave her warning; I determined to leave her service, which I had an opportunity of doing one day suddenly, Mrs. Flowers being very much in liquor. In the morning of that day, I found a ring upon the carpet, intending to give it to Mrs. Flowers. The day before I went away, the examined my box, and in the hurry I forgot to take the key with me; when I came the next day for the box, Mrs. Flowers must remember the readiness with which I even invited an examination of my box. Conscious of my own innocence, my astonishment, however, upon the box being opened, was beyond description; those articles were not there the preceding night, nor did I see any of them till after I was in custody; and they must have been put there with a view to my destruction."</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Flowers.) Remember you are upon your oath, who lodged with you? - A.Lady Ophemia Stuart, Lord Grenville's sister; nobody else has lodged there since the has been in the house, nor for ten weeks before.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, that is the defence you have thought proper to make, who wrote that defence for you? - A. A gentleman of the name of Middleton, Mr. Kirby knows him very well.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known Mr. Middleton? - A. No longer than I have been in prison.</p>

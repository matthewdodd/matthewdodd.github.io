            . I was in company with the prisoner at the Ship in Rosemary-lane, on the 4th of June last; I was going home; I had lent my partner my hat and was without one; she took me to her lodgings, and gave me an old hat; then we made a bargain; I was to give her a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie with her?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in liquor?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes, but I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the shilling you promised her?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What silver had you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. In all three or four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her the shilling as you came away?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you concerned with her upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes; she went down stairs; I missed my money directly; my breeches were taken from under the bolster; I found them at the side of the bed when I got up; I ran down stairs in my shirt when I missed it; there were a great many women in the house; I could not see the prisoner at that time, but made a noise about my money and came up stairs again; the landlady of the house followed me with a candle; she brought me half a crown and my knee buckles; I put my breeches on, and went down stairs; there I saw the prisoner; I seized her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had five shillings and three-pence in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not agreed to give the five-and-three-pence for the old hat had you?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you felt your quarter guinea when you gave her a shilling?</p>
               <p>Holmes. The quarter of a guinea was in my fob, the money in my pocket, I thought I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177407060033"></xptr> would be sure to see I had my money at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether when I was in bed with him there were not some hands under the bed?</p>
               <p>Holmes. There was nobody near the bed we were in; there was a woman in another bed in the room with my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been concerned with the woman did you fall asleep?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could she take your breeches from under your bolster without your knowing it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I got to the nearest side of the bed to the door; she would not let me he there, but moved me on the other side, so I shifted the breeches under my head, and she put her pocket or something under my head, where my breeches were.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she get the breeches from under your head without your perceiving it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I thought she was only taking the things she had laid under my head; I perceived her put her hands under my bolster just before she got up and went down stairs; I did not think she was taking my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not the other woman that took it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I am certain it was not.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Rosemary-lane; he picked me up, and asked me if I had got an old hat to sell or give him; I said I had one, I would either sell it or give it him; he went to the Ship in Wells-street, and drank part of three pots of beer there; he asked to go home with me; then he asked me to go to bed with him; I said I did not chuse it without a present; said he I will give you sixpence; I said I would not go to bed for that; he said he would make me a further present in the morning; we all went up together; I gave him the hat; first he said he would make me amends for the hat in the morning; we went up stairs; he undressed himself; there were two young women in the room at the same time, when he charged me with this; he asked me whether I had got any money; I said I would strip and he might search; he went up again; one

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give it him for?</p>
               <p>Watson. For paying his wages.</p>

               <p>Watson. One on one side of the room, the other on the other; we all went in to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any woman near the bed where Holmes lay with Bridgman?</p>
               <p>Watson. No; she took her clothes in her hand, at the same time his breeches were gone; he jumped out of bed, and said, partner, lets go; he kicked his breeches; then he run down stairs in his shirt, and came up again, and a woman came and gave him half a crown, saying she had searched this woman, and could find only half a crown, and a pair of knee buckles upon her.</p>

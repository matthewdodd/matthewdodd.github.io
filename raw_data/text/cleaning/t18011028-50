               <p>Q. What nails were these? - A. They were Dutch filling nails, made in Holland; they are made into copperas; they are stripped from the bottoms of Dutch-Indiamen; I went with the officer, Brown, to the house of Henderson, on the 11th of September, with a search-warrant; his house is at Poplar, about half a mile from the copperas manufactory; we found two bags of nails, and a quantity lying on the floor loose in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that search was the prisoner apprehended? - A. Not more than three hours, I imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the servant of Messrs. Perry? - A. Yes, the nails in the manufactory were under his care.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with a search-warrant on the 11th of September to the apartments of Henderson; in the back room I found a quantity of filling nails in a basket; and, when I came to empty the basket, I found two parcels tied up; after these nails had been found, Sebley was brought to the office by Mr. Dalton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Lebeck's Head before he went to the office? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he made acquainted with what had been found? - A. Yes, I brought the parcels, and put them down on the table before his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person make use of any promise of favour, or any threat, to induce him to give an account of those parcels? - A. No; he said the parcels then on the table were in the same state in which he had sold them to Henderson, and in the same manner in which he had brought them from Mr. Perry's premises; he told me he had sold more at different times; and we found a great many more.(The examination of the prisoner produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the Magistrate's hand-writing? - A. Yes, and I saw the prisoner sign it.</p>

I lost my watch last Sunday between twelve and five o'clock in the morning; I went home to my lodging at twelve o'clock; there are two beds in the room; the prisoner and another man lay with me; I waked about half after five; I put my hand to my breeches pocket, and missed my watch; I had my breeches on; I did not pull them off because I intended to leave my lodging that night; hearing he did not go to work on the Monday, and knowing he had no money the day before, I had a suspicion of him; I went to the Barleymow, a public house he uses; I heard there that he had been drunk that day; I went on Tuesday morning and found him on the bed at his lodging; I then searched about again for my watch, left I should have laid it down somewhere, as I went to bed in the dark, but could not find it. On the same day I found the prisoner drunk at the Crown in Clear-court; I took him up and had him before the Justice, and there the watch was produced.</p>

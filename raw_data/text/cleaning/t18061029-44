On opening the box which contained my linen, I found six pair of sheets lost. I ordered my box to be brought down into my own room, and in the hearing of the prisoner, I said that somebody was dishonest in my house. I went to where the prisoner had lodged before, I then suspected her, and I got an officer to search her apartment and found in the apartment one sheet that I suspected to be mine, it was cut, but I found nothing else in her apartment that belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Who brought them. - A. I do not know, one of my young men took them in.</p>
               <p>Q. And why is he not here. - A. I told the magistrate, and he said it was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. You know as well as the magistrate that it was of consequence, if you had been the magistrate, you would have said, send for the man that took them in; was any thing else taken in at your shop. - A. No, only these three sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Page, the magistrate has put it down that you took the sheets in. - A. I told the magistrate that I did not take the sheets in, Mr. Trott the officer asked me whether I took the sheets in, and I told him no, before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that you know is that there was a duplicate produced to you by Trott. - A. Yes, Trott had the duplicate, this is the counter part of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix.) This room adjoined to where the prisoner lived, did you keep it locked. - A. It was my order to be kept locked, when I went up stairs I found it locked; the key was kept down stairs in the parlour upon a hook.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are an officer of Hatton Garden. - A. Yes. On the 25th of September I went with a search warrant to search the prisoner's room; I acquainted the prisoner with the business, she denied any knowledge of any thing of the transaction; she seemed very much alarmed at the time; I searched about for a long time, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290035"></xptr>at last, I found two half sheets upon the bed, sewed to something (they are hardly fit to be opened) to make it look as if it was a pair of sheets on the bed; the prosecutrix said she was sure the half sheets were hers. In a drawer I found this key, (producing it) it opened the lock of the door without any trouble at all; I took the prisoner to the office, she was then committed for re-examination, and during the time of her coming again, I had this ticket given me by the prosecutrix, for three sheets, pledged at Mr. Page's in the name of

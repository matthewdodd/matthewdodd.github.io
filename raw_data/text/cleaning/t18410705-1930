On Tues<lb></lb>day night, the 25th of May, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in conversation with Mrs. Vichel, inquiring the way to Romford—Vichel is a baker, and lives next door to me, at the bottom of Gold<lb></lb>ham's-hill—she Mrs. could not direct him, and asked me to do so—I told him the way to Romford—he went on four or five rods in that direction, then returned, running, exclaiming as he passed me, "I have left my things"—he came back in a minute or two with three heifers—I suspected some<lb></lb>thing, and went to tell Richard Fuller my suspicions—I did not find Ful<lb></lb>ler at home, and told the ostler—he told me to go to the station, and as I went I met Arthur Talmage—I told him my suspicions, and we went to<lb></lb>gether on the road to Romford about a quarter of a mile, and met the pri<lb></lb>soner returning with the three heifers—I asked him where he was going— he said, to Abridge, which is about three miles from Loughton—we fol<lb></lb>lowed him with the heifers—he drove them on the road to the Plume of Feathers public-house, and there I gave him into custody with the heifers.</p>

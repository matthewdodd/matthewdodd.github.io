               <p>Prisoner. When you first came up to me, you said to me, I think you are the woman that robbed me; I said my friend I never see you before, you immediately seized my hands till the watchman came up; at first you said you lost two guineas and a half crown, and afterwards you said it was not half a crown, it was eighteen-pence. I have a witness that he said in the morning, that if I would give him a guinea, he would say no more about it, nor appear against me; I only put my hand to my mouth to wipe my nose, because they would not suffer me to take my handkerchief out of my pocket, he first said that he would make it up if I would give him the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Crown and Anchor, on the Pavement, in Moorfields, in the house of William Adams Larby, my brother-in-law. I occupy the whole house—my brother-in-law does not live there—I have the care of it for him—I do not pay him any rent—he has the whole in<lb></lb>terest in it—I live there merely to take care of it—it is a public-house—on the 23rd of December the prisoner came to the bar, about half-past twelve o'clock—he asked for a glass of half-and-half—I served him myself—he requested to see the newspaper—I went for it, but it was engaged—he called for another glass of half-and-half, and asked again to see the newspaper—I went a second time to see for it—I did not get it, and when I was returning to the bar, the maid-servant called me, and gave an, alarm—I immediately pursued after the prisoner, who was gone—I caught sight of him about a hundred yards from the house—I went up to hurt in Moor-lane—he had the box in his possession, tinder his coat—I could see the shape of the box under the breast of his coat—I could not see the box it<lb></lb>self—I took it from him—a young man was with me by that time, and we brought him back to the house with the box—I left nobody in the bar when I went for the newspaper—the box contained 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—335<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belonged to me, and the rest to Larby—there were twenty sovereigns in cash,</p>

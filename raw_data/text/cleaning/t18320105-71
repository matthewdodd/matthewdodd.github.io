On the 21st of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I sent my porter with a box to the wharf - it was directed to Mr. Urquart, George-street, Edinburgh; I saw it afterwards at Lambeth-street - it contained the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 15l.</p>

            . I am a porter. On the 21st of December I was taking this box to Downes'-wharf, East Smithfield - a waggoner overtook me in Newgate-street, and he asked me to put it into his waggon; I did not wish, but he said I might as well, as he was going my way, and I did so - I knew him by sight; he asked me to get into the waggon, but I kept by the side of it - he turned down Mark-lane and Crutched-friars, and just before we came to John-street the box had got against the tail of the waggon, it was not very heavy - I put it further into the waggon, and in <placeName id="t18320105-71-crimeloc398">John-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had been watching it, I suppose? A. I thought I kept my eyes on the waggon - I was by the fore wheel; I lost it in two minutes - it could not have fallen out, as the tail was chained up; it must have been taken over the tail.</p>

            . I am a porter in the City. I was in John-street, and saw the prisoner lean over the waggon, and pull out this white deal box - he brought it from the middle of the road, and rested it on the curb; the waggon was going on - I saw two men at the corner of Cooper's-row; they told me to watch him while they fetched a Policeman - he turned up Gould-square; the box was on his shoulder; there was no thoroughfare, and he turned back along Cooper's-row, into George-street, and by that time I heard the Policeman halloo Stop thief! he then dropped the box, and ran away - I took care of the box: Howes claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not lose sight of the person? A. Not till he dropped the box, and then the Policeman kept him in sight; he walked with it - it was not my place to lay hold of him; I am only a lad - I was never in trouble; the waggoner was on the other side of the waggon - if I had gone to give information I should have lost the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I first saw the prisoner in George-street, Tower-hill: he had the box on his shoulder - I called Stop thief! and he immediately dropped it; I pursued, and did not lose sight of him at all- I took him ten or twelve yards further on, in George-street - he had fallen down when I came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any body else in the street? A. No; I cannot say there was nobody: I did not stop to look at the box, but pursued him - I caught a glimpse of the box as it fell; my eyes were not off the prisoner.</p>

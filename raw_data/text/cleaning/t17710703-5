            . I live at Dowgate. I was coming from Highgate, on the 15th of May, in a cart, with the prisoner, about seven in the evening. In the back road, Islington, I laid down to sleep being a tired; I drove the cart to Highgate; he went with the cart for pleasure; there were three carts together. When I went to sleep one of the other drivers lay a sleep a long side of me; Chapman drove my cart for me; I waked rather before I came to <placeName id="t17710703-5-crimeloc27">Islington</placeName>

Chapman had a six and thirty and a guinea, and bought a watch with it, that night; I drove the cart back from Islington; I missed the two six and thirty pieces at Holloway; so in Goswell street I took my money out and counted it; the prisoner bought a watch. The next day I took them both upon suspicion; they denied it. I took them before the alderman, and they were discharged; afterwards Chapman was admitted an evidence.</p>

            . I drove the cart; I saw the prisoner pick Mr. Prior's pocket, whilst Mr. Prior was, I believe, asleep. He took two thirty six shilling pieces and two guineas; I had one guinea and one thirty six shilling piece. I went over to Pepper Alley and bought a watch; I was behind the cart when he took it; he gave me half to say nothing: I had no money in my pocket before.</p>

            . On the 16th of May, the prisoner came to my house to buy a watch; he had a thirty six shillings piece and a guinea: he broke the watch, and brought it back to me in a day or two to mend; while I had it he was taken up. Here it is (producing it.)</p>

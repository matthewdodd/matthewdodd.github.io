I attended the deceased—I first saw her about the 21st of July, in bed, at No. 49, Went<lb></lb>worth-street—she was then labouring under inflammation of the bowels, quite at its advanced stage—I prescribed what I thought available, but I had no doubt at that time that gangrene had already commenced, and that no reme<lb></lb>dial treatment would do, that it was a hopeless case—I visited her every day till the Wednesday on which she died—I think she was aware that she would die for three or four days before her death—she clearly knew that she was dying on the Sunday—I was rather surprised to see such indications of so severe a disease in so young a person—I thought there must be something beyond the ordinary symptoms of disease, and asked her on the Sunday if she had been the subject of any violence—I should not expect such symptoms in such a subject unless from violence—she seemed to consider her case quite hopeless, and that she should die very speedily—she seemed to be quite in a desponding state of mind—I believe she had been told that she was in a hope<lb></lb>less state, and that her recovery was not at all probable—she appeared aware that she was on her death-bed—she told me that she had been pushed in the breast, by a black man, named <hi rend="italic">Black Jack</hi>, in a public-house row—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the room at the time, but said nothing—I think he was present on every occasion when I went to see her—I attended her till her death—she was so scanty of clothing that her person was observable—there was no bruise or mark on her breast—the indications of gangrene increased, and she died on the Wednesday evening—I saw no marks of violence of any importance in any part of her body—there were some bruises on one leg, but nothing to lead to her death—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found the intestines ex<lb></lb>cessively inflamed, with patches of gangrene, or mortification in different parts—in tracing the convolutions of the intestines downwards, I arrived at the secun, and it was bound down to the side by inflammation, in such a way that the course of the alimentary canal was completely obstructed—it was adhering to an abscess which seemed to be connected with the ovaria—the ovaria appeared to have been lacerated, and that laceration to have been followed by ulceration, and an abscess had formed there, and spread—the left ovaria was perfectly healthy—the womb was larger than in its unimpregnated condition, but on examining it internally, I found unequivocal evidence of recent abortion—I think a person in a state of pregnancy, receiving a violent kick at the bottom of the stomach, would probably have inflammation of the ovaria such as I saw—I can scarcely imagine that a disease at that early age, would occur in that part, especially as I found the left ovaria perfectly healthy—the symptoms I saw were such as would result from such a cause—I hardly think it possible they could have arisen from natural disease at that age—disease of the ovaria scarcely ever occurs till a more advanced period of life, and where natural disease occurs there, it is not common to find one ovaria healthy—I saw no marks of a kick or violence, but I think most likely the external mark would disappear—the fact of there being no external mark, does not lead me to suppose that the inflammation of the ovaria could not have been occasioned by external violence—the fall might have caused the laceration, the rebound after receiving the kick—Mr. Hart attended with me at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and attended the patient two days before I saw her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to the deceased on Thurs<lb></lb>day, the 20th of July, by the prisoner—I found her labouring under disease as Mr. Byles has described—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and coincide with Mr. Byles' evidence in every particular—I told the prisoner on the Tuesday evening before she died, that I did not consider she would live twenty-four hours, but not in her hearing—the prisoner and one of her sis<lb></lb>ters in the room, told me on the Tuesday when she was nearly dying, that she had something to communicate respecting the cause of her illness—I re<lb></lb>turned to the bedside, and asked what it was she had to say—she made no reply, which I attributed to weakness—the prisoner then said that about three weeks previously she had received a blow in the chest from a black man, which had very much frightened her, that she thought it had brought on a miscarriage, which was the cause of her present illness—I then asked the deceased if she heard what the prisoner said, and if it was true—she said it was—in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination we found marks of recent miscarriage—that was not likely to have occasioned the injury to the ovaria—there was an abscess in the substance of the ovaria which was not likely to have been produced by miscarriage—I do not think it at all likely that a blow or push in the chest could have produced the appearances I saw—if she had received a violent kick three weeks before, that would account for the injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 4th of July I was at Mr. Sears's beer shop, the Wonderful Man, in Went worth street; I got into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with an Irishman named Carney; I got the better of him, and black <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> came between us, and we fought; the deceased came between us, and he struck her in the chest; I afterwards went into the back yard, she was in a fit; and terr or twelve persons round her; in about half an hour she came to, and went up stairs; she went out with me next day, and was taken very bad; I brought her home, and asked one of the sisters to go for a doctor; she would not, and Esther went; the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels, and ordered mustard and saw-dust poultices, and some stuff, for which I paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she kept her bed that day, and next day we went out over London-bridge; she was taken ill again; I took her into a doctor's shop; he examined her, and said she bad miscarried; he gave her a draught, and I brought her home; she began to get better till the 19th of July, when she was very bad again, in Finsbury-pavement; I bought a piece of mutton to make her some broth, and a drop of wine; and she went to bed; I went to Mr. Byles's, and Mr. Hart came with me; they did all in their power for her; breath was not out of her body five minutes before the sisters Esther and Sarah began to blackguard me, and said I was a murderer; and if they could they would hang me; Mr. Hart said on Wednesday it was her mother's wish to have her opened; he did not come, so I went out to try and get a subscription to bury her; and when I came back they <hi rend="italic">blew</hi> me up, called me a murdering rascal, and said she should be buried by the parish; Mrs. Pedley was there; I got no peace, and left them; it is all malice against me because I would not let her walk the streets; I had bad legs for some time; I would not go thieving, and was forced to beg to get an honest piece of bread; the medical gentlemen can say she was free from any disease when she died; this religious man was not called at the inquest, because they thought they could have it their own way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the Artillery. On the 3rd of April, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner over London-bridge, as I was going to Woolwich—she asked me to give her a gists of gin—I gave her a pint of ale, as the publican would not draw any gin—she took me down a court—I had two half<lb></lb>crowns and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in half-pence in my jacket pocket—we stood talking together—my jacket was undone, and she got her arms round me—she then left me—I put my hand into my pocket, and found all my money gone—I spoke to her about it—a policeman came up, and I gave her in charge—the halfpence were found on the ground—the policeman found the two half-crowns on her—how dropped out of her shoe, about ten minutes after the other—she had denied having any money.</p>

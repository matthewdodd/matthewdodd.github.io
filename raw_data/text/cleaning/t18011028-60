               <p>Q. Were you groggy? - A. Yes; I met with the prisoner, and went to a public-house in East-Smithfield; she asked me to go home with her, and accordingly I did; there was a woman there, who keeps the house, and I gave her money to get some liquor, and then we both went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both undress? - A. Yes, entirely; I laid my clothes down upon the chair, and put my watch under the pillow; after we had laid awhile, we got up, and drest ourselves; she drest herself quicker than I did, and the old woman came up into the room, and kept me in talk while she went away with the watch; I saw the watch in her hand; it was a silver watch; I got up, and went after her as quick as I could, but she was gone in an instant; I could not find her till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Not till the night before I slept with the whole night; the officer has got the watch; the seal is a naked woman.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican in East-Smithfield; the prisoner, in company with two other women and a sailor, came into my house on Monday, the 26th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening; each of them had a glass of rum at the bar; after they had drank their rum, they had no money to pay for it; the sailor presented me a watch, and said, you must buy this watch, for I mean to rig out this girl, and pay for her room; I told him I never bought any thing on the kind, he had better go and pawn it; he said, no, he would be d-d if he would pawn it; he wanted to rig his girl out, and he would fell it; I asked him if it was his own watch; he said, yes, it was; and the prisoner confirmed it as well as the two other women in company; I asked him what he asked for it; he said, four guineas; I looked at the watch, and told him, I would give him three for it, provided he would fetch it away another day; he said, he would come and give me the money for it again, and bring his brother with him; I then gave him a two-pound note, a one-pound note, and three shillings; one of the three shillings they paid for the liquor they had; the prisoner then asked him what he was going to give her to rig herself out; he then gave her one of the notes, and told her to go and buy herself some things; she went out, and he instantly followed her; I then saw no more of them till about ten o'clock the next morning; the sailor came in with the prisoner; he said, good mornning to you, I hope you will stick to your word, and let me have the watch again,as you promised last night; he made me renew my promise, and desired me to shake hands with him to bind it; he then had a glass of rum, and pulled out some halfpence, saying, that was all he had got left out of the three guineas, for he had spent it; he was to come again in the afternoon with his brother, and pay me three guineas and a half; immediately after they were gone, the police-officer came in, and asked for the watch, which I delivered to him.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Whitechapel: On Tuesday morning, the 27th of October, about ten o'clock, in consequence of information,I went with John Nowlan to a house in Henderson's-court, East-Smithfield, where we found the prosecutor keeping in the prisoner and another woman, who keeps the house, whom he charged with having robbed him of his watch; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the man's watch; she said, she knew nothing of it, she had not seen it; the prisoner said, it is of no use to deny it, I took the watch from the man, and I gave it to you, and you gave it to a sailor, and you went with me and the sailor to the Bunch of Grapes, where the sailor sold the watch; I then went to Toulmin's, and demanded the watch, which he gave me; I shewed it to the prosecutor, and he claimed it.(The watch produced, and identified by Hunter.)</p>

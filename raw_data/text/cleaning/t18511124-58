                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hither-row. On Saturday night, 8th Nov., I was at the Marquis of Granby, Hounslow-heath, drinking with the prisoners—I knew them before—I left them there, and went to the Rose and Crown, where I only had one pint of beer—I left there about 12 o'clock, with Shortland and Issey, and went along the Bath-road—after we had got a little way from Hounslow, I saw both the prisoners behind us—they came up to us, and Wilson said I had stolen a handkerchief, with two half-crowns in it—I told him he was wrong, it was not me—I was not aware one had been lost—Wilson searched me, and then hit me with his fist on the side of my head, as hard as he could, and knocked me down, out of the footpath into the road—Todd was searching one of the boys at the same time—when I got up, I started on again to go home, and the prisoners kept on along with us—they then stopped and searched us all again, and Wilson said, "Let us take him back to Hounslow"—they collared me, brought me back about 200 yards, and told the boys they could go home, and they went on—they then knocked me down again, and Todd took my watch, chain, seal and key, and a knife, from my pocket, while Wilson held me down—they then ran away—I got up and followed them, and when I got within four or five yards of them, Todd turned round, knocked, me down, and kicked me—they then ran away again—I ran after them, overtook them, and they knocked me down again—they ran away again—I ran after them again, they knocked me down again, and kicked me again while I was down—I then lost sight of them—I was knocked down four times—I was quite sober—I had not drank above a pint and a half—I am sure I had my watch at the public-house—I also had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket, but they did not take that—I gave information on the Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, and saw Wilson again on the Tuesday morning—I did not see Todd till the following Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hither-row, and work for a farmer there.

In July last the house was to be let fur<lb></lb>nished—we were not residing in it at the time, and the prisoner was placed in care of it—his wife was there first, and then he was there for about six weeks or two months—he had been there once before for two months—this table-cloth and sheet were used to cover over some of the furniture—they have my own mark on them—they were missed after the prisoner left—we did not employ any person named Sullivan.</p>

The Magistrate gave him till the 19th to consider whether he would go into the Army of Reserve; he would not, and then he was committed. I am sure he is the man; he said before the Magistrate that the other young man and he had been drinking at the house of a man, of the name of Baldwin, in Fore-street, that they came together from Fore-street to Drury-lane, and that the other had led him a one side; that was the term he used.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was committed for the value of ten-pence, and expected to be tried at Hick's Hall; my friends have been attending there, and did not know but I should be tried there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Not knowing whether he would go into the Army or not, Mr. Stafford, clerk at Bow-street, put it down at ten-pence; but I afterwards told him the bacon I lost was worth more than two shillings, and he said, I was entitled to indict him for that sum.</p>

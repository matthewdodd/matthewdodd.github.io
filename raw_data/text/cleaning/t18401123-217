                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Fisher's-rents, Deptford On the 7th of November I placed a cup on my mantel-shelf, containing three half-crowns and one shilling, between five and six o'clock, and missed it between six and seven—in consequence of information I went after the prisoner round the Broadway, but could not find him—he is a neighbour's child, and played with my son sometimes—I also missed a knife from a drawer in the same room—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

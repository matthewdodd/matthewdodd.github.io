                  </hi>. I live in Chester-place, Old Kent-road; it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. On the evening of 25th Jan., about six o'clock, I was in the parlour behind my shop—I heard the breaking of my window—I went into the shop, and found a pane of glass broken which had been safe just before—I ran out, and saw the prisoner running, twenty or thirty yards off—I called, and saw him stopped after some chase—he came towards me, and I took hold of him—he said, "You are wrong in your identity"—I brought him back, and missed this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was brought in afterwards by the officer; I had seen it safe in the window not five minutes before; it is mine—I saw the prisoner between eleven and twelve that morning just outside the gate of my house, five or six yards from my window, with another party, apparently making some observations about the watches in the window, and afterwards he put his hands together, and said, "That will do."</p>

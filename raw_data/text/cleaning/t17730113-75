About five in the morning the waiter, with whom I lay, waked me in order to get at the pot; I found that my breeches then were drawn from under, and lay at the top of my pillow beside my head; I said who has been medling with my breeches? the waiter said he knew nothing of the matter, he was just awake; I searched, and the two guineas were gone. On an information received, I went and found the prisoner at the King's-head in St. James's-street; there I charged him with taking my money; at first he denied it, then I told him if he would confess, I would not prosecute him, but he still denied it; at last I searched him, and found concealed in the inside of his breeches a guinea, and 9 s. the prisoner then confessed he had taken it, and had sent half a guinea of the money by a chairman to get changed, who was not yet returned; that he had spent 18 d. I did not make any promise before he made this last confession.</p>

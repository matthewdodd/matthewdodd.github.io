               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What relation are you to Jones? A. His mother is my first cousin - I known him from his infancy; he managed the business of that shop; but since March last I have declined taking in pledges - Mr. Goddard was my partner, but he died in January, 1827; his executors have no claim on the proceeds of the trade - I have a claim on them - the accounts are still open - I do not know of my own knowledge when this watch was pawned, but this is the duplicate of it - it was written by my foreman, who is not here - I have not made any exertion to get him here; the watch might have been pawned when Mr. Goddard was in partnership with me - I cannot of my own knowledge tell how long this ring has been in my shop, that might have been when Mr. Goddard was my partner - I told the prisoner he might use this carpet bag to put his clothes in; here are three books I charge him with stealing; they were pledges, but I did not take them in; they might have been there in Goddard's time - Jones had not pawned them himself, for they were there before he came into my service; I had seen them with other books, and I had taken these books down to look at; I attend at the shop sometimes - I had looked at these books in 1827 - it is Kenilworth; I do not know whether there is another edition of it in my shop - these were pawned for 5s. - I have not the duplicate here, it is only from recollection I speak - the copy I saw may have been redeemed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to Baxter's lodging and found her at home? A Yes. I believe Jones was there, by seeing his clothes - the books were on the piano-forte. Mr. Cameron's shopman brought the watch; Jones lived in the house which these things were taken from - I was only there occasionally, but he slept there - he never gave orders; I directed an elderly woman who was there to provide for the house - I did not know till afterwards that Baxter used to come and dine there - it was not with my knowledge or consent - she told me that the watch should come home next day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen it in the shop before? A. Yes, he used to wear it; I saw him wear it about a month, and any one might see it - I should not have pawned it if I had not thought it had been his own - I have taken out this umbrella on a wet day - I lived at Mr. Cooper's nine months - he did not know much of the business - there was one man and a lad there; the foreman and I have had goods on trust, and entered them in the day-book, but not without Mr. Cooper's knowledge - I have bought articles of wearing apparel, or anything I wanted; I have seen this ring several times in the shop before Jones wore it - I have taken it in myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have seen this woman, and called her Thornton? A. I have heard Jones call her so; he told me her name was Thornton - that was not when she was pawning anything: she was in the parlour; Jones and the servant were there, but Mr. Cooper was not - I never saw her have any coffee or dinner - she had no acquaintance with Mr. Cooper; I did attend at Bow-street - the Magistrate said, at the first examination, that he thought the case could not he made out, without admitting Baxter as a witness; I do not know that I ever called her Thornton myself.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Cooper. I have seen Baxter at the shop; she used to pawn in the name of Thornton, but at home she went by the name of Baxter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is anything more common than for persons who come to pawn things, to give a name that does not belong to them? A. No - I knew her name was Baxter, and knew where she lived; she came to see Jones there - Jones used to be master in the shop; when Baxter came there she used to have tea sometimes, by his invitation, and sometimes by the servant's- we did not call Jones master; I have carried letters to her from him; if he trusted her with a gold watch, she could not know but that it was his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Mr. Cooper occasionally lend him articles to were? A. No - he did wear them, but not by Mr. Cooper's knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. After Jones had left, there were some duplicates found in a pocket-book in his box; I saw them found - they do not relate to any of these articles, but when people come to redeem an article, they bring a duplicate, and the two duplicates are pinned together; that shows me that a certain sum of money has been received, and these show me that he has not accounted for the money - I found this letter on the back counter, in his hand-writing - it is addressed to me, and signed by himself.</p>
               <p>Honoured Sir, - My conscience will not allow me to look my benefactor in the face, since I have behaved so villainous to one who has been a father to me; the reason for my absconding is, that I have worn a gold watch in the name of Steel, and I have had it stolen from me by a woman whom I have loved. Adien, dear Sir, I remain your unhappy and wretched slave R. Jones.</p>
               <p>N. B. By the time you receive this I shall be numbered with the dead; I have borrowed 2l. from the till, which my brother will pay for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you got from this document the knowledge that he had borrowed a watch? A. Yes; I never lent him that or anything else to wear; I never saw him wear a watch or anything that was in pawn in the shop; he had a watch of his own, I believe - he said it was his; I did not see him with one when he came into my service - he might have one: I cannot tell how long it was before I saw him wear one; when he came into my service he was in humble circumstances - I think it was a common metal watch, a dirty yellow colour - I think I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it, when you have just sworn to the colour of it? A. I think I have seen it; I was not sure, but he might have had a watch of his brother's - he may have had a watch; I think I recollect his brother lending him a watch - I did not swear he told me the watch was his own; here is one gold watch-hook - it is one of a pair: I received it from his brother.</p>

I went to No. 17, Craven-buildings, Drury-lane - I found Baxter in the drawing-room with Mr. Cooper who said he had sent for the officer on a charge of felony - he stated that a gold watch had been taken away from his premises, and he supposed Jones was there, and had got it; Baxter denied having anything to do with the watch, but, after a little conversation, she produced the duplicate- I told her I must search the bed-room; she refused me at first; I then heard the window go up - she then opened the door herself, but did not say anything at that time; that had been before I went, I suppose - she only said he was not on the premises; I searched, and found the bed-room window open - I looked out on the leads, but there was no person there; I went round Wych-street to stop the person from coming out, as he must have gone without a coat and hat, but I could not find him - Mr. Cooper then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110154"></xptr>sent my brother officer to some other places, and he went on the adjoiniug houses, and at length found Jones in a cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How was he dressed? A. He had no coat or hat on - I have no doubt of his having been in bed there. Baxter at first denied it, but she gave us the duplicate soon after - in searching the premises the second time I found a pocket-book of Baxter's, and part of a gold watch-hook in it; I did not know whose book it was, but she asked me if I had found a pocket-book; I said Yes, and she said there was a watch-hook in it belonging to Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. I found the duplicate of a watch-hook in the drawer.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Matthews, on the 27th of July, to these premises; I saw Baxter - she denied having any knowledge of the watch, but afterwards gave up the ticket; we went in to the room, and found the window open, but Jones was gone - these two rings I found in a red box, in a chest of drawers in the front room, and this ring was in another part of the room - this carpet bag was in the back room and these boots; I found Jones in a cellar - I think he had shoes on; I found these rows of beads in the drawers - a scentbox and a thimble in different parts of Baxter's room; she said they were her own - I found this umbrella in the back room, against the fire-place.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. I cannot swear to these things.</p>

            . I can swear to these beads by the private-mark on them, but not to these rings; I know this scent-box, it was in the window for sale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What may be the value of these beads? A. About 4s. - I never saw such a scent-box as this before; I have been some years at a pawnbroker's.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you know these boots? A. Yes, Jones brought them from the shop - they were in pawn for 4s, and he had them repaired.</p>
               <p>JONES' Defence. My cousin having allowed me the privilege of drawing things from the warehouse, I took the liberty of wearing this watch; and I took the liberty of drawing money, provided I accounted for it; the cameo ring, I can assure you, I purchased of the person who used to pawn it, and I gave 12s. for it - Sarah Gibbs was in the shop at the time, and Smith came in soon afterwards; Mr. Gray can swear to seeing it on my finger - I told him what I gave for it; he doubted whether I had not given more, and he inquired of the housekeeper, who said I gave 12s. for it - the umbrella I have not paid for, but I was in the habit of having things, and entering them in the day-book; and, provided I accounted for them, Mr. Cooper never denied me anything; the boots are what Smith said just now, they were never Mr. Cooper's - I bought them in the shop; the watch I had worn I suppose five months- Mr. Cooper must have seen it, as he frequently asked me what it was o'clock, and I have taken it out.</p>
               <p>BAXTER'S Defence. I was in the habit of going to the place - I thought it was his own property; I ate and drank there - I pawned the watch.</p>

            . I am independent - I know Jones; I recollect his shewing me this ring - I afterwards asked Gibbs about it, and she said she saw him give 12s. for it; I have frequently seen him wear it when in Mr. Cooper's employ - there did not appear any concealment about it; he was in the habit of wearing a gold watch - there was no concealment about that; this is not the watch - it was a gold repeating watch; it was nothing like a dirty yellow; Mr. Cooper could have seen it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHLS. Q. Did he not go about like a gentleman? A. He used to go very genteel - I called in one night, and he asked me to sing; Baxter was there; and the housekeeper objected to there being any singing, as Mr. Cooper would not like it.</p>

I have known Jones three or four months - I have known Baxter two years and a half; she lodged in my house as a married woman, with a young man, not Jones, and she left me on the 19th of July - I have seen her wear this watch in public company.</p>

            : the prisoner came to our house the 18th of January, and wanted a bundle of matts; he said he came from Mess. Gum; they had credit at our house; I delivered the matts to him, and made him a bill of parcels; he came again the 20th and wanted another bundle; I served him with it, and made him a bill of parcels; he came again at night and wanted another bundle; I asked him for the bill of parcels to put them together; he said he had given it to Mr. Chalton, Mess. Gums clerk; he came again the 26th and had six mats; there is ten in a bundle. My father had a suspicion of him, and sent me to Mr. Gum's to enquire if he lived there; he said he did not. When he was taken before Alderman Bull, he confessed he obtained them, and did not come from Mr. Gum; that he did it for bread for his children.</p>
               <p>- Bence. I am servant to Mr. Gum; the prisoner left our service the 25th of December: I do not believe he ever was near the house since.</p>

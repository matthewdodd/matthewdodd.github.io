I was in the service of William Villiers Stuart, Esq., at the time in question, as footman and valet—he lives at No. 19, St. James's-place, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. I knew the prisoner Mitchell for about a fortnight previous to the robbery, and I have seen the woman. On Tuesday, the 24th of July, I employed Mitchell to remove some luggage from my master's house—he came into the house to remove it—about four o'clock on the evening of the next day, Wed<lb></lb>nesday, I missed from the house some property which, I had seen safe about ten o'clock that morning, and which I had seen on Tuesday as well—he had left the house about half-past nine o'clock on Tuesday night—I had not seen him there on Wednesday—I missed three coate, three waist<lb></lb>coats, one pair of trowsers, a black stock and a pair of boots of my own from my bed-room—I did not miss the shawl till it was found afterwards—I had a shawl among the property on Wednesday morning, nor did I miss the sheets—I have since ascertained that a pair of sheets and a table<lb></lb>cloth of Mr. Stuart's were taken—I missed the latch-key of the street-door, on the 24th, the day the prisoner was in the house—he had been left at the door while I went into the City to see about sending off some packages to Ireland—I left him waiting at the door till I returned—he was to remain in the street—I missed the key before he was gone on the Tues<lb></lb>day evening, off the side-board in the hall—there were two keys—I had one in my pocket, and the other was in the hall—I afterwards saw the latch-key at Queen-square, in the hands of the policeman—I have found all the articles—the boots were found on Mitchell's feet when he was taken, on the Saturday following—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—these are my boots—this is my shawl and stocking—this latch-key is the one I missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Spicer, and live in Three-crown-court, Chelsea. On a Wednesday in July, Mitchell came to my place—I knew him as a neighbour—he said, "Is Mrs. Spicer within?"—I said, "No"—I denied ray own name—he said, "Do you know when she will be in?"—I said, "No"—he sat down, and had a bundle in a green hand-kerchief—he pulled two waistcoats and a coat out of the bundle, while my back was turned, and came to me and said, "Old woman, as my face is so black, will you take this for me to Thompson's, I am ashamed to go"—he had two black eyes—I said my son could go, but he would not, and I took them to Thompson's; and black as his eyes were, he took good care to follow me to the pawnbroker's—I went in, and he waited outside, but I did not know he was there—I saw him standing outside, looking through the window—the shopman asked where they came from—I said there was the man peeping through the window, who gave them to me—he said, "Is that the one with the black eyes?"—I said, "Yes"—he gave me the du<lb></lb>plicate, and lent me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—the prisoner came to the step of the door, and I handed the money and ticket into his hand—he gave me the ticket, and said, "Keep this for me; I mean to release them in a few days, am going to Brighton as soon as my face gets well," and I took it—he gave me nothing for taking them—I afterwards gave it to the officer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mitchell's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor says he saw his things all safe on Wednesday—the pawnbroker had the sheets and the table-cloth pawned on the 24th—I acknowledge giving the female prisoner the table-cloth and sheets to pawn, she not knowing them to be stolen-what I did was through distress—it is my first offence.</p>

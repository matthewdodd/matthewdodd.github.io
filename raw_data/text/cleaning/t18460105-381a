I was standing at the corner of Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Clark, my brother constable—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, No. 2504, pass at a furious rate down Charles-street—I saw inside it a portmanteau, and a boot or shoe loose upon the top—I thought something was wrong, and we pursued the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> down Charles-street—I called out to the caiman to stop—he did not stop till he got nearly to the bottom of the street—he then stopped, and a man got out—I heard him say something about Tottenham-court-road, and he ran away—the cab went on further down the street, when it was stopped by Clark—when I got up to it I opened the door and looked in—the prisoner Reed was inside—I asked him if the property in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was his—he said no, it was the gentleman's that had got out and run away; that the gentleman wanted him to take it to Tottenham-court-road—I then told him to come out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which he did—I had seen him pre<lb></lb>viously with a gang of thieves in Drury-lane—I told him to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, which he did, and I followed him—Clark got on the box, and we drove to Bow-street station—I heard Hutchinson the driver say something, but Reed was then inside, and I cannot say that he heard it—I afterwards took the luggage into the station—I have it here—it is a portmanteau and a carpet-bag, con<lb></lb>taining a number of the articles stated, a box of cigars, a bundle with eight waistcoats and a pair of trowsers, and another bundle with a pair of boot—he said the gentleman had given him the hat and the coat he had on for his trouble in assisting him into the cab with the things—I afterwards went to No. 21, Princes-street, Cavendish-square, between eight and nine o'clock that same morning, in company with Clark*—Clark put his shoulder to the door and it was immediately opened—two females were in the passage—we west in and found the house had been robbed, and entered the back way by means of a ladder placed to a water-closet at the back—a square of glass in the water-closet window was broken, and there were marks of feet down—they appeared to have got from that broken square on to the top of the cistern of the water-closet, and then in at the staircase landing window—I found some lucifer matches in Reed's pockets at the station—I found this jewel-case in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Reed's Defence.</hi> On the 28th of Dec. last, about a quarter to six o'clock in the morning, I was proceeding across Cavendish-square, and up the street where Mr. Bennett lives; a gentleman was standing at the door, with a cigar in his mouth; he said, "Young man, will you mind this door for me?" It was open. I said I would; he said, "It is very cold, here is a coat for you." I said, "Thank you." I had a travelling cap on, and I gave it to him for an old hat which he had; he went and fetched a cab; Hutchinson was the driver; the man put the things in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and asked me to go with him as far as Drury-lane; he got out then; I thought he was a gentleman; he shut up the door, and said something to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man, which I thought was, "A door or two fur<lb></lb>ther on;" the man went two or three steps further, when up came the police<lb></lb>man, which very much astonished me; he called me outside, and asked me whose property it was; I told him, and looked up, and, to my astonishment, the gentleman was gone; Mortimer is not at all like the gentleman that en<lb></lb>gaged me; he had long light hair, half way down his back, and carroty whiskers, but he is about the height, and that makes the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man speak to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Mortimer's Defence.</hi> They searched my place, and found no clothes there; I had no suit but this to stand upright in; I have been at Mr. Agate's stable four years.</p>

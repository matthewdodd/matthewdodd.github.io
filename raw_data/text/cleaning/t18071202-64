            . I am a constable. I searched the prisoner's apartment upon another occasion, on the 5th of November; I found these three boots under the prisoner's bed; the prisoner was in prison at the time I searched the lodgings; he said that he lodged there, and he told me it was his bed. I knew them to be Mr. Moggridge's; there is the name in full length, except in one boot the name is scratched out.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 5th of November we were called in upon another service; after we had taken the prisoner and the other people that were in the room to prison, I went back with Mr. Bayliss and found the boots. The prisoner first told me that he picked them up in the street on the morning the fire was; afterwards he told me they were given to him by a man from a window of a house where the fire was.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman owned that he handed a great many pair of boots out into the street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not touch a boot. There were most likely a great number of friends that assisted.</p>
               <p>PATRICK M'CONNER. He said he brought them from the fire, they were handed to him there to keep for the owner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DALEY. I lodged in the same room. Smith brought the boots in he said he had them from a man in Fleet-street at the time of the fire; he desired that if any body called for them at his lodgings to give them the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the day the fire happened that he brought the boots. - A. No, it was not; he was only five nights there.</p>
               <p>M'Conner. It was the day week after the fire.</p>

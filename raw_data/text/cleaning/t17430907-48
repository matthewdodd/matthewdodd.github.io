            . On the 27th of July, I had been at Pancras-Wells to drink the Waters, and coming Home between eight and nine in the Morning, I met the Prisoner in the Farthing-Pye Field; two Women passed me; and as they passed me, one of them said, Why don't you cut your Coat shorter, and went forward; I turned about, and saw the Prisoner behind me; she came on the right Side of me, pushed me, and asked me if I did not come along that Field (a Field by Tottenham Court) I told her, no; she said, you lie, you did, for you have get my Apron off my Sides; I told her, I had not; for I never saw her before in my Life; said she, Madam, don't deny it, for I have the Strings in my Pocket; and she pulled two Bits of Strings out of her Pocket; she said, you and a Fellow were drinking a Pot of Beer at the Sun, and if I would tell her who I gave the Apron to, she would let me go on, else she would have either my Apron or my Cloak; so she took hold of my Cloak, and pulled it; I said, Pray don't pull it, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174309070029"></xptr> will strangle me; said she, Oh, d - n you, so I will. I screamed, and called out Murder; but she took the Cloak, and ran away with it; I saw this Soldier at the End of the Field, and told him that I had been robbed of my Cloak; he went with me to the Edge of the Bank, and

            . I saw the Prisoner skuffling with this young Woman, and saw her take the Cloak off her Back, and put it upon her own, and run away with it, and ran down a Gravel-Pit. Holder took her, and brought her up the Bank. I asked her how she could take the Gentlewoman's Cloak from her; she said as Mrs Favel has related, and infilled upon keeping the Cloak. I desired her to return it, and go home with her to her Father and Mother; said Mrs Favel, If you say I have stole your Apron, I will give you this which I have about my Middle; but she said, No, that Apron is not so good as mine, mine was a Holland Apron.</p>

             sworn. - I am watchman and constable of the night for Kensington: Between two and three in the morning of Tuesday, the 27th of March, I saw the prisoner cut the rope, and the basket dropped, he then took it on his shoulder and carried it ten or twelve yards; I took it from him, and pursued him; I never lost sight of him till I secured him; there were eight fowls and three rabbits in the basket, all alive; this is the basket.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Walkling.) Are you responsible for these fowls? - A. They were my own, I bought them to bring up to London for sale. This is my basket.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a watch-house keeper: I heard Williams call out for help; I came up to his assistance, and he beat me about very much; when I got him just to the door of the watch-house, I had got the door open, he pulled out a knife, and said, he would cut the first bloody thief's arm off that attempted to shut the door. I found a crow that had dropped from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first time I saw those fowls was upon William's shoulder; he told me the fowls had been cut from a waggon, and sent me forward to ask three waggons that had gone past whether they were their's or not; and two of them said, no; and then he laid hold of me, and said I was one of the thieves.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Williams.) Is what you have sworn true? - A.It is.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

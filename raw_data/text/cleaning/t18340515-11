               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I suppose you were rather agitated at the attack? A. I cannot say I was, or I should not have been able to clear these fellows out of the way for me to run after him - I certainly was not very collected - I lost sight of the prisoner when he turned into the market - there was the angle of the passage between him and me for about half a minute - he must have changed the watch from his right hand to his left before he got to the corner, because I saw it in his left hand before that - I was not observing him at the moment he changed it - he must have done it under his coat - he took it with his right hand, and I saw it afterwards in his left - I will not venture to swear he changed it under his coat, because I could not see it - I recognised two other men at the police-office, but not sufficiently to swear to them - there are one or two others I could swear to, whom I have been looking for ever since - there was a man with a wooden leg in the office who I said was exceedingly like one of them, but I said I would not swear to him - I am not persuaded that he was not one of them now.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether he changed the watch before his breast or under his coat, are you sure he was the man who had your watch? A. Most undoubtedly - I never doubted his being the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Although your attention was not called to the features of the man who took the watch, because he was so near you, are you quite clear the prisoner was the person who held your watch in the manner you have described? A. My attention was particularly directed to his features; I saw his face at the time the watch was taken - his face was close to mine; but I could not see the watch then, as he was so close to me - I saw his features distinctly when it was being taken from my person.</p>

            . I pursued the prisoner, hearing the cry of "Stop thief" - I saw nothing in his hand - I kept my eye on him, and when he went round the market I lost sight of him for a short time; and at the end of the market a number of others surrounded him, and he said, "I am not the man; let me go" - I said, "That is the man; do not let him go" - I saw no property about him; but I pursued him, on Mr. Webster's calling "Stop thief," up Lime-street, into the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you keep your eyes on him all the way? A. Certainly not - I saw nothing at all in his hand - from his appearance at first I could not believe he was the thief; but when I saw him endeavouring to get away, and saying it was not him, I said, "That is the man" - I knew it was the prisoner from the first sight I had of him- he ran about fifty yards - I had a full view of his face when he turned the corner.</p>

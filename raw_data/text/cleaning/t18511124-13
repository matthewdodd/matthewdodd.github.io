                  </hi>. I am a native of Holland, and am a ship agent, living in Scarborough-street East, Goodman's-fields. On Monday, 10th Nov., between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning, I was in Princes-street, near the Bank, during the procession of the Lord Mayor's show—there was a very large crowd—the prisoner stood next to me—I felt something in my pocket, and felt something go from it, and I saw the prisoner go with my watch from the place: it had been in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I am quite sure I saw it in the prisoner's hand—he ran into the crowd—I ran after him—he stopped, and turned back of his own accord, and I asked him for my watch—he said, "Oh, I have not got your watch!"—he called out several names, "<hi rend="italic">Bill, Tom,</hi> and so on; and several people came up, and said, if the man has got your watch, why don't you search him?"—and they came between us, and stood in front of me—they said to the prisoner, why don't you run away?—he ran away, and one person, a little fellow, came in front of me, to give the prisoner the opportunity of running away—I ran after him, and called "Stop thief!"—he was seized by a policeman—I did not lose sight of him—he made a very pitiful face, and said, "I never took your watch;" and coming from the station to Guildhall, he said, "If you will go with me to my house, I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you must drop the matter"—I gave more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my watch; it was a silver one; it has not been found—this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on the ground—the prisoner found it about three yards from the place where he took my watch—he said, "Why don't you look round, may be you will find your watch?" and before we moved from the place, he said, "There is your ring on the ground"—I picked it up—he saw it—it was not possible for him to have seen it on the ground, be<lb></lb>cause I stood before him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief against a window; a gentleman who was going by, said,"What is it, a handkercheif, my lad?" I said yes; I put it into my hat, and was going along - when the gentleman saw there was a little bit of a mob he came back, and told him not to interfere; he gave his card at the station.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TOOL. There was a person who wanted me to let him go - I have not got the card he gave - I am quite sure the prisoner took the handkerchief.</p>

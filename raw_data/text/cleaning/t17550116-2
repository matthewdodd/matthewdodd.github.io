            . Hearing Mr. Clark had detected a person for robbing his till, I went there; he told me he missed about 15 s. We searched the prisoner, and found nothing upon him; then we took a candle, and went out into the middle of the street, and we found 10 s. and two half-crowns. The next day the boy acknowledged he dropt the money there, and said there were two half-crowns amongst it.</p>

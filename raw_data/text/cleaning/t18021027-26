Not. long; I walked very fast, and he would insist upon walking by the side of me; I told him I did not want his company; when I got to Red-lion-street, I found his hand in my pocket; I asked him what he was doing in my pocket, and he said, nothing at all; I immediately laid hold of him; I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; he dragged his hand from my pocket, and wanted to get away; he then pushed me very much, but I kept hold of him, and crossed the way with him; I cried out, and two watchmen came to my assistance; when I cried out, the other men ran away, and the watchmen secured the prisoner; I missed a silk handkerchief, and a nutmeg-grater, with half-a-guinea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your money? - A. I had changed one shilling out of it at a public-house in Ratcliff highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at the time? - A. I was not the worse for liquor, I might have drank three or four glasses of spirits in the course of the day; I had drank some with a friend that I had been to see in Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you had before you went there? - A. I drank one glass at home, and one at her house; I drank one with her out, when she went out to buy a pair of shoes, and one glass coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was that? - A. The Ship and Horseshoe; my friend had a glass with me, and I paid for it; I took one shilling out of my nutmeggrater, and then there was half-a-guinea remaining in it; I received 9d. in change, which was left in my pocket; he was searched, but nothing found upon him; I have never found them since.</p>

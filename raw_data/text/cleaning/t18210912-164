When he paid me money I examined his account and signed it as correct.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Leslie, and have been so seventeen months. I produce the cash book in which the prisoner entered what he received in the course of the day; there is no entry of 1 l. being paid by Smith on the 16th of April; the entries are made by him. There is an entry of 1 l. 19 s. on the 7th of May, but it was originally only 10 s. I can take on myself to say, that till the 21st of July, the entry remained 10 s. for on that day I took a copy of the cash-book by master's order, in order to detect any thing wrong; I have the copy here. In the cash-book, there has been a figure of I put in the pounds column, and the 0 in the shillings column is turned into 9; I received no money from him on Smith's account in April or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is it in the prisoner's writing? - A. I do believe it to be; (reads it), "Alter the cash-book, May the 7th, Smith 10 s. to 1 l. 19 s. to correspond with the Ledger."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You dont know where that paper comes from? - A. No: I believe it to be his writing; I began to copy the book on the 21st of July, and finished it on the 23d; the entry was then 10 s. Mr. Leslie does not interfere much in the business; I cannot say what his memory is; he has been very ill; I cannot say whether his memory was affected.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather an awkward question to propose - but, do you believe in the Scripture? - A. I believe in a portion of them. I believe them generally.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the New Testament to be a revelation from God? - A. It is impossible for me to say whether it is or not; it very probably may be so. I do not profess not to believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it. - A. I have given very little thought about it. I am bound to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose bye and bye you will say, you are bound, in a moral sense, to speak truth, but do you believe the New Testament, on which you have been sworn, to be a revelation from God. - A. Very probably it might have been - I can say nothing against it. I do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. To be what. - A. To be a history.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do you believe the whole of the New Testament to be the revealed word of God. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say so at first. - A. I did not completely comprehend your question.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not professed not to believe the Holy Scriptures, and that Jesus Christ was not the son of God. - A. I certainly have disputed it, and do dispute it now. Is is impossible for me to say what it is. I cannot contradict it. I believe it in certain parts.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you robbed of any pots at any time? - Yes, two pint pots; the prisoner came to my house on Sunday morning, in company with one Campbell, he had two pint pots of beer, and I missed the two pint pots after them; I got a police officer, and went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you go? - I went the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house? - King's Head-court, Norton Falgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - Near half an hour after seven o'clock, on Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you came there? - I knocked three times, the officer was with me; I asked the woman if her husband was not a glover? she said, yes; I told her I had a job for him to do. I went up stairs; I see the woman push the pan under the bed, I told the officer of it, and he cropt under the bed, there were two pint pots in it, there were nothing left to know them by, but my initials; the one was quite melted, the other is in three parts, there was nothing left but the handle with the initials of my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more about the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any pots at this time? - I missed some almost every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sold any pots with your name on them? - I have not for these three or five years, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the pewter? - The officer, he has had the pewter in his possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner frequented your house before? - No, I never see him before that time.</p>

               <p>I am an officer; I know nothing of the business till I went to the house; I found a frying pan just taken off the fire, and put under the bed, and this here metal was in it, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pots were there in the frying pan? - I look upon it to be two, I believe they were pint pots by the handle. (Produced.) I asked him if he had any thing belonging to Mr. Phipps? he said he had not, I might go up stairs and see.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you weigh the pewter? - I did, it is almost two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Is it a pint pot, that with the name? - Yes, it is, there are three letters on the handle, S.S.P. for Samuel and Susanna Phipps.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Sunday morning I went with Mr. Campbell, to the house of Mr. Phipps, we had two pints of beer, I was very much in liquor, and I had two pint pots put into my pocket, I went home, it was unknown to me that they were in my pocket, and I kept them in my pocket till that hour, which was about nine o'clock; not knowing I had the pots in my pocket, and I took them out, and because my wife should not know any thing of the bu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160212"></xptr>siness, as she was sick, I melted them down, not with an intent to hurt the prosecutor, it is not my inclination; I never did so before.</p>

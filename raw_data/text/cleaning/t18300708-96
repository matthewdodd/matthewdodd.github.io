               <p>JAMES COLLINS. I am a porter at the Bell and Crown, Holborn. I saw a mob round the shop window, and was desired to fetch an officer; while he was searching the prisoner I saw him throw the seal behind the chair - the officer picked it up.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CATMULI. I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge - I found a half-crown and 3d. on him - while I was searching, somebody said, "Here is the seal;" I picked it up behind the chair, and the key was given to me - the prisoner said nothing; he was in liquor, I believe, but knew what was going on.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

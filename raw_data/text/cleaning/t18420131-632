On the 5th of January I went to bed at ten at night—I saw the doors and all the windows of the house fastened before I went to bed—I was awoke about two by a noise in or about the house—I got out of bed, went to the front window, looked into the street for a policeman, and almost immediately heard a rattle spring—soon after there was a knock at my door—I went down and found the policeman knock<lb></lb>ing</p>

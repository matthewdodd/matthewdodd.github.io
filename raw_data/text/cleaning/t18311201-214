            . I am a street-keeper. I watched the prisoner for some time, going up and down Fleet-street, with another; they followed another gentleman, who went into Serjeant's-inn - they then followed Mr. Manger; I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Manger's pocket, and draw the handkerchief out - I took hold of the end of it in his hand, as he was handing it over to his companion; part of it went on the ground - his companion ran away; I should know him again - he was there ready to receive it; I did not see Mr. Manger at the moment, but I called out; he turned round, and claimed the handkerchief - the other was a youth, stouter and taller than himself; the prisoner said he had no parents, and did it for want - he had no money.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

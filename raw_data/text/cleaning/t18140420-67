On the 10th of March, between one and two o'clock in the middle of the day, I took the goods out of the Red Lion-inn warehouse, and put in my cart; I had been with a load of hay.

            , cheesemonger, in Whitechapel; that is very near the Red Lion. On Thursday, the 10th of March, between one and two o'clock, I saw this cart standing near the Red Lion-yard; I saw the prisoner put his hand in the front of the cart, and take a brown paper parcel out; he ran away, across Whitechapel, and up Essex-street; I lost sight of him there. I saw him about two hours afterwards in the custody of Miller and Freeman, officers. I am certain the prisoner is the man that took the parcel out of the cart.</p>
               <p>JOHN FREEMAN. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 10th of March; I took him at the back of Levy's house in Wentworth-street. Miller was at the front; I went to the back of the house. It is a common receiving house, kept by one Levy. I saw him coming out of the back of Levy's house. I took two of them; the prisoner was one of them. I then took him to the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any appearance of a shop to this house - A. It is a kind of a chandler's shop. There I found my brother officer prevented from going up stairs. I saw the paper that apparently contained the parcel, burning; the paper was burning in a back room on the ground floor. I told the prisoner I took him for stealing a parcel out of a cart in Red Lion-street; he said, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. Yes, I know his person well. The parcel has never been found.</p>

            . I am a brother officer to the last witness. I went into Levy's house at the front door, and in a little room there was a great deal of brown paper in flames; I got some of it out, and was in the act of trampling it under my feet to put the flames out. A young man that was in the house ran up stairs, his name is Levy; I believe he is a relation to the man that keeps the house. He ran up stairs, and I after him to the top of the first landing; there they have got a door that shuts to; he barred the door against me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the parcel the paper contained - A. I do not know. At the top of the house they have got a pigeon-trap. They might have throwed it into another yard. I went down for the poker to break the door open. He let me in after some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Keep a good look out after this Mr. Levy - A. Yes; he does a great deal of mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. What number is this receiving house - A. I don't know the number; it is nearly opposite of Gulstone-street; it comes into Whitechapel.</p>

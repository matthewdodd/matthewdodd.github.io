            . I am a surveyor, and live in Sussex. I was on the platform, standing by Mr. Sampson. I heard him say there was a pickpocket; the prisoner stood directly behind him - next to him, and I was next to the prisoner; nobody was near enough to rob him but the prisoner and myself; the prosecutor picked up two sovereigns and seized the prisoner - he seemed much agitated, and I suspected he was the person. I laid hold of him, he endeavoured to keep his hand down, the prosecutor tried to get it up, and I asked why he did not open his hand; he said, he did not know but we were going to rob him; this we said after we got him through the crowd; we took him to a public-house, the constable searched him, and took from his breeches-pocket two sovereigns, two half crowns, and 1 d.</p>

I told the Magistrate I had been at work for Mr. Hughes, No. 19, Perceval-street, Goswell-street-road, for five years; he asked what I worked at, I told him at a plaisterers, from whom I had 2 l. a week. You must bring some one up to speak for me, and say you gave me the two sovereigns last Saturday night, and say your name is Mr. Hughes, and that you live in Perceval-street, and I shall be discharged. I will pay all expences I was taken for robbing a man of ten sovereigns. I gave my name

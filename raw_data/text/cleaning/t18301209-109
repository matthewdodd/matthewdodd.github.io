             had this large hand-box. and his wife the small one - I did not see that the other two men had any thing, and they got away; I called a butcher to go after them, and I took the prisoners but I found they were getting rather the better of me, by repeatedly striking me over the arms, and I called the butcher back to assist me, as it was near Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know either of the other men? A. I should know one of them if I was to fall in with him - I did not know either of the prisoners, to my knowledge; I only know the other man by walking behind him and the prisoners for near half a mile that evening - I do not know that I had ever seen that other man before; the prisoners said the other person had employed them to carry the things, and this man said, "Let me go, I will run after them," but I did not let him go because he had the property about him; I did not then know the prosecutor had been robbed - I noticed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183012090059"></xptr>a gown among the property, and I said I thought it belonged to a person who had lately been robbed; they were about a mile from the prosecutor's - I found this trunk at their lodgings.</p>
               <p> - HUNT. I live at No. 3, Little Pearl-street. The prisoners had a room not a dozen yards from the house I live in; when the officer came I tried the keys of some rooms I have, but none of them would open their room - I cannot tell when I had seen the prisoners there; I had not been in the room before I went with the officer.</p>
               <p>SARAH JACOMBE. This property is all mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before you went out had you seen these things safe? A. About noon, when I went out.</p>

They desired to know whether I chose to have my head knocked about or not; when I had cried the the other end of my walk he turned again within about a hundred yard of Mrs. Lucas's, Hindes had got three bars; I asked him what he had got there; he said he had got nothing, and threw them on the ground, and made off; I took them up; then one of the other said, the watchman has got them let us go back and knock him on the head, and take them from him; with all my heart, said the other, but he has got a good stick in his hand; then they walked off; I went to the other watchman, we went to see for them, but did not see them, till I got in at the Blakeney's-head; there they all four sat; Farrell looked at me and said, have you a mind to have your ears pulled; I said, what do you mean by that; I went out and sent for a constable: Dyer followed me directly; I took hold of him, and said he should not go yet: I took him in and set him down, and said, the first man that stirred I'd knock him down; the constable came; we took them all to Bridewell; then the woman said, let me go back, and I'll shew you where there are three more bars, under a cart or a waggon by a public-house; we secured them, and according to her directions found the other 3 bars. Dyer said, going along, some shall answer for this if I get my liberty; the woman said to Dyer, swear the young man that assisted me was a confederate with us: we carried the bars to Mrs. Lucas's house; there every bar fitted the place they were taken from, (the bars produced and deposed to.)</p>

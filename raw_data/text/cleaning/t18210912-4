On the 11th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, one of my children gave me information. I went into the hall, and found the prisoner doing something up in a basket. I asked what he did there; he appeared confused, and on my repeating the question, he asked if I wanted any lemons; I told him to go about his business, he took up his basket, and went. I followed him, and before he got out of the garden, I insisted on looking in his basket, and found, two of my great coats. He was not willing for me to examine it. I could not see what was in it, without opening it. I took him out into the road, and sent for the constable who took him. One of them, was a box coat nearly new, and cost me four guineas and a half. I saw both in the hall the night before. He had two lemons in his hand. There was another man outside who ran away.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am the prosecutrix's daughter. It was my duty to serve the customers during my mother's absence—I was in the parlour and I heard the till-drawer shut—I went to the window, drew back the curtain, and saw Morriss quitting the bar—I had seen the till-drawer shut about ten minutes before—there were two bowls in the drawer when I left, one containing about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, one half-crown, two shillings, and two sixpences—the bowl that was produced before the Justice was the one that had the silver in it.</p>

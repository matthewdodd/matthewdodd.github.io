                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Union-court. At the time in question I lived in the Maze, and worked for Smith and Sharpe—I did not know John Cole—he was a stranger to me when this happened—I was told his name by the Jury—I did not see his body—I saw him delivered at the hospital—I went part of the way up Deane-street, and helped him to the hospital gates—I was told before the Coroner's inquest, and by his captain, that his name was John Cole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him receive any injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Sunday, the 10th of August, about a quarter past eight o'clock, I saw John Desmond and Dennis Donovan strike the deceased four times, to my certain knowledge; and his son, William Desmond, succeeded him afterwards—Cole was trying to get from them as far as laid in his power, and begged for mercy, but no</p>

               <p>mercy was shown him—it happened just by Mr. Smith's door, at the corner of Union-street, Maze, Tooley-street, Borough—I did not see any provocation given by Cole—I saw him surrounded by these people, endeavouring to escape, but he could not; he was overpowered—I did not see him strike any blow at all—when the man was down, and I ran to his assistance, John Desmond kicked him on the left breast, just on his left ribs—he fell from the blows he received from Dennis Donovan, who is not apprehended—Cole begged for mercy—I wished to assist him, but I was in danger of my life; and in assisting him to lift his head up from the flag stones, I was struck three times myself—John Desmond struck him repeated blows, both right and left, and struck him on the left ear—Wil<lb></lb>liam Desmond repeated it, to follow his father's blows; and struck him in any part which laid in his power—I saw him strike him, and he hit him more than two, three, or four times—the deceased kept on his legs at first—he made no resistance; it was out of his power, he was so overpowered—John Desmond kicked him when he was down, and Hannah Donovan scratched and kicked him when he was down—as he was falling, she tore his face and kicked him afterwards—I cannot say what offence he had given to these people—Murphy had nothing to do with that—nor as to what Mary Hurley did—I went to Guy's Hospital gates, and left Cole there—I did not see his corpse—I did not see any of the surgeons who took care of him—I was not at the first coroner's inquest, but I was at the second one—there was a bit of a skirmish, but I did not see Cole strike any blow—he had no friend there but me—they were all round him—he called for mercy, but got none.</p>

               <p>the extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—I think if he was struck, and trampled on, and knocked down, his head coming in contact with the ground, and his receiving other blows, would account for the appearance I found internally—I have heard the witnesses' evidence—I do not remember hearing them mention any blows on the head, but there was the appearance of a blow on the head—I think the circumstance of his having a blow on the head would alone account for the appearances—I think the state of the clotted blood quite sufficient to cause death.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you been a medical student long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six years—this is the third winter I have been at Guy's—I have a guest, many cases of accidents brought in there—I am not quite certain this was the only case brought in on the evening in question—there might have been others brought in—he was not bloody when he was brought in; that I swear—I saw no wounds except the one on the right eye—the bleeding he received on Monday was by the lancet—it was not fit that he should leave the hospital—we told him not to leave, but he felt himself well enough to leave—we should not have permitted him to leave, if we had had our own will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you heard of his leaving the hospital, drinking rum, and exposing himself to the night air, would not such conduct have been sufficient to pro<lb></lb>duce death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, unless he had received some injury before—my opinion is formed from the blood on the brain at the post mortem ex<lb></lb>amination—I think most likely he would not have recovered if he had not left the hospital—I cannot be positive of that—his exposing himself to the night air, and drinking rum, would not be sufficient to kill him unless he had received some previous injury—he died of apoplexy, but I believe it to be occasioned by the blows.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a student of Guy's hospital at the time in question. I saw the deceased on the Sunday evening—I believe him to be the same person as I saw dead before the Coroner, but I could not swear to his person—he was in bed when I was called to him—he appeared labouring under the influence of liquor when I visited him—he vomited fluid which smelt of porter—sickness is one of the symptoms of concussion, but I smelt porterin what he vomited, but a man drinking moderately would void the contents of his stomach—I conceived he had been intoxicated—he had symptoms of stupor—he could speak and answer questions incohe<lb></lb>rently, as far as I can recollect, but I go principally from what he vomited—I cannot say what quantity of liquor he vomited—he vomited frequently during the night—I did not see all he vomited—I bled him at four o'clock—he expressed himself considerably relieved—I believe the causes spoken to by the witnesses sufficient to produce the appearances I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe death was attributable to the application of external force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is more than I can assert—it possibly could have arisen from common causes—if he had diseased arteries, this clot may have been formed—I believe the man died from the injury received, but it is possible it might be from natural causes—I have no reason to suppose so—I observed a wound under the scalp—I might have covered it with half-a-crown—there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183411240207"></xptr>
               <p>were no corresponding appearances internally with that external wound—there was no coagulated blood immediately under the wound—there was a a lot the base of the brain—I should expect to find the clot of blood there—I should expect to find blood on the base of the brain if there was a blow on the vertical part of the head—that is the most common, but not the invariable consequence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The person of the individual you saw at the hospital, and the body you subsequently examined, you cannot swear to be the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear to it—I believe him to be the same—I did not distinguish his features when I saw him in bed—I believe him to be the same man—I certainly should not swear to him—I did not notice his features—the symptoms arising from intoxication and from concussion are very much alike—it is very difficult to distinguish—it was doubtful, when he was admitted, whether he was labouring under symptoms of intoxication or concussion—he could not have been on Sun<lb></lb>day in the state which I found him in on the post mortem examination on board ship—I conceive the treatment he received at the hospital might enable him to walk about a day or two afterwards—the exertion of walking from the hospital to the ship might bring on hemorrhage, and produce death—the exertion of leaving the hospital, accompanied with the previous symptoms, might have been the cause which produced his death—he had symptoms both of concussion and drunkenness when he came to the hospi<lb></lb>tal—the clot of extravasated blood on the base of the brain was the imme<lb></lb>diate cause of death—I conceive that was from the rupture of a vessel or vessels—I conceive the wounds were kept down by our treatment, bleed<lb></lb>ing and purging—I think he would have had a very fair chance of recovery if he had remained in the hospital—if he had drank to excess, and had a violent fall or shake after leaving the hospital, it might produce rupture of vessels—I did not take any accurate examination of the external injury when I saw him on the Sunday—we were not aware of the blow we found till we removed the scalp—I do not recollect the blow over the eye at all myself—I saw no blow whatever in the hospital, nor the appearance of any, that I recollect—he did not complain of any thing except the head—he was not then labouring under symptoms of frac<lb></lb>ture—I did not conceive it necessary to examine his head—I treated him, the night he came in, as a drunken man; and, on the Monday, I treated him as a man labouring under a very severe headache, as I sup<lb></lb>posed, arising from a slight concussion of the brain—it is extremely difficult to distinguish between drunkenness and concussion—I had no reason to suppose he was mortally injured on the Sunday—I cannot undertake to say that he was mortally injured when I saw him on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When he received the blow you discovered, on removing the scalp, are you of opinion that it caused the coagulated blood, on the base of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive so; if it was sufficiently severe, it would produce that consequence—it was not a severe one—I found the blood in the place I should naturally expect to find it, if a blow was inflicted on the vertical part of the brain—it is not usual to find the blood exactly under the place injured, unless it is fractured—it is sometimes on the op<lb></lb>posite side, sometimes at other places, but not immediately contiguous.</p>

                  </hi>. On the Sunday in question, I was going into the Red Lion, at the time of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I believe it was between eight and nine o'clock—I stood at the Red Lion door, and saw three or four sailors come out of the Red Lion—I can swear to four—Desmond was standing oppo<lb></lb>site the Red Lion, smoking his pipe, against a warehouse belonging to Mr. Humphries—one of the sailors said, "Come on, my lads, here he is"—he swore, with an oath, he would take old Desmond's <hi rend="italic">day-lights</hi> from him—he said, "Here he is! come on! so help me God, I will take his <hi rend="italic">day-lights</hi> from him"—Old Desmond did nothing at all to them, while I saw them—Young Desmond was standing by his father—I had not observed either him or his father do any thing to the sailors, before they used the expression I have named—I do not know the sailors—to the best of my opinion, the man who used the expression was the worse for liquor—the tallest of the sailors hit Desmond—they crossed the street to him—I cannot exactly swear to what followed afterwards, because there was a crowd of people, and I could take no notice—another sailor, a shorter one, <hi rend="italic">tackled</hi> young Desmond, who told them to go about their business—he would have nothing at all to do with them—old Desmond staggered against the wall, from the effect of the sailor's blow, but did not fall—his pipe fell on the pavement, and was broken—there was a mob, and I could not swear to what happened afterwards—young Desmond had not done any thing to either of the sailors—I cannot tell what caused the disturbance—I did not see old Desmond strike any body—I cannot describe any thing further.</p>

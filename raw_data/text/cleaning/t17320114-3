               <p>Daniel White. I sent five Parcels of Goods to the Windsor Row-Barge, and directed them for my self to be left at the Warehouse at Windsor till call'd for. When I went to ask for these Parcels at Windsor, I found but three of them, the other two being lost. Most of the Goods in those two Parcels were stopt by Justice Lade , who advertis'd them. I went to his Worship, and found all my Goods except a Box of Headcloths, 2 Dozen of Handkerchiefs, two Diaper Table Cloths, and some Stockings.</p>

               <p>James Crawford, Waterman. On the 10th of November, as I was standing at Cupid's Bridge , where I ply, the Prisoner Beach past me, and went into the King's Head Alehouse. A Peter Boat had been robb'd a little before, and Beach was suspected to have been concern'd in it, he having dispos'd of some Fish and other Things which were thought to have been taken out of that Boat, and so I and some other Watermen agreed to take him. We went and found him and Moss (the other Prisoner) sitting by the Fire, and two Parcels of Goods lying by them. We seized Beach , but Moss got by us and hid himself in the Cellar, where we afterwards found him. They gave no account how they came by the Goods, and so were carried before Justice Lade . The Goods were open'd there, and I saw Stockings, Diaper, and other Shop Goods.</p>

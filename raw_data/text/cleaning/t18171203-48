Five or six persons came behind me and on my left, surrounded me, and pressed me against the wall. The prisoner came directly in front of me-my watch was at that instant taken from my fob. I do not know who took it. At that moment I saw something glitter in the prisoner's left hand, which he stretched out to a person, which, I believe, was the same that had followed me - He was on the right-hand of me. I immediately seized the prisoner, sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. I am sure it was in his hand that I saw something glitter, and he handed it to his companion. As soon as I seized him the others dispersed very quietly. The person who received it from him ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was not pushed in front of me.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD. I took the prisoner in charge. He said, he only came up to ask the prosecutor what was the matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Birmingham. I came to town on Fri<lb></lb>day, the 17th of October, and put up at Mr. Kay's, the Green Man, Coal-yard, Drury-lane—I took a lodging there for two nights—my bed-room was the first floor back room—Mr. Smith, who had come with me, bad a room up another story higher—I continued these till the Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing following, the 19th—I then locked my bed-room door, about a quarter after ten o'clock in the morning—I had seen my watch safe before I locked the door—I had placed it on the dressing-table, and I saw the neck-chain safe, and two rings and six seals—the seals and the chain were placed in a little box which was put on the dressing-table—the eye-glass was fixed to the chain—my reticule was there—I saw Mr. Smith's great coat on the chair at the top of my luggage—that was before I locked the door—after<lb></lb>wards, on seeing the company who came into the house, I felt uneasy, and went up to my room—I do not know that I saw either of the prisoners among the company—I went up stairs a little after eleven o'clock—I found the door was neither locked nor on the latch—it was ajar—on going into my bed-room I missed all the trinkets I have mentioned—they had all been on the table; and the great coat was gone off the luggage—I missed a box in which the trinkets were, and my reticule—I, the policeman, and Mrs. Kay went to search, and some of the articles have since been shown to me by the policeman—I have never seen the watch again—I consider that it was worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it cost 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband gave it to me—the neck-chain is worth at least five guineas.</p>

I lived at the Green Man, in the parish of St. Giles, with my husband, John Kay—(he was landlord of the whole house) on the Sunday morning in question—I recollect the prosecutrix going up to her room—I had seen Warner come into the house, and saw her go out that morning, with John Berry, the other prisoner—they went out together, before Mrs. Chirm discovered the robbery—I did not see what part of the house they came from—I had not seen them in any part of the house—my occupation was in the bar—I only saw them going out,</p>

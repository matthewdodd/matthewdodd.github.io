            : Mr. Hills died on the 21st of October; the executors took the direction of the business: The prisoner had been servant to the deceased four years and an half; we continued him in the business, there was no other servant but a little boy, the prisoner had the management of the shop; after the death of Mr. Hills, we took stock, the goods lay alphabetically; there is an entry of the gold watch, and the six table-spoons; it was made on the 23d of October, it is my own hand-writing; I saw the watch before the Justice's at Bow-street, about the 17th of December; I found the tablespoons at Mrs. Mills's lodgings, in Suffolk-street; on the 15th of December, Mrs. Mills came to the shop in a hackney-coach, the prisoner went over the counter to speak to her; the lady pulled up the glass and was going away; I jumped over the counter, stopped the coach, went into it, and shut the door, after that I found the spoons at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Upon your oath, did you make an entry of that watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew it me, (refers to some papers;) that is no book? - A. I call that a book.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be looking into that book,(a ledger;) you have turned over at least thirty pages of it -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The stock was taken on those bits of paper, and afterwards inserted in a book? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Point out an entry in the book? - A. I can only say from the general stock.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew me an entry of any particular watch in that book? - A.(Points out an entry of a number of gold watches, one of which is 13l.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your hand-writing? - A. No, it is the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you made an entry of it in your hand-writing? - A. Yes; on that paper there is a watch, at the head it is No. 13, which is what it cost the estate, it is afterwards entered into a book, which was made the 23d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say there is an entry of any individual watch? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a book in the hand-writing of the prisoner, a book in his hand-writing cannot be evidence for him, we did not call for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am on the cross-examination, and call for the entry, and he produces this book.</p>
               <p>Salkkld. We take the regular numbers, they go on to 109, and then they are entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an entry of a watch in this book? - A. It is included in that sum.</p>
               <p>Court. They take the stock, there is such a number of watches, they all come to so much, they don't describe every watch, the 13l. with a number of other sums makes up the whole amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.There is no entry of any watch in particular? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That or any other watch may be included under that 13l. - will you swear there was no other watch in the stock, of the price of 13l.? - A. Not one, there is one 12l. 16s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You produce a book in the hand writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; that was the stock at the death of Mr. Hills.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether, in that stock, there is an entry of a watch of a particular number? - A. Yes, 1094.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you took the stock, was that number struck out as sold? - A. No, it was unsold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that number when you took stock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is there any entry of the name or number of that watch, in your handwriting? - A. No, only that thirteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did that thirteen pounds refer to that watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any entry of the six table spoons in the stock-book? - A. Yes. (Produces the spoons.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any entry of these spoons in any other way than you have been describing on a bit of paper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to these spoons from your mere recollection of them? - A. I can; when we took stock, there was only one dozen of spoons in the window, tied in two half dozens; I missed one half dozen on the 15th of December, the price and weight of them corresponds with the stockbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accuse the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise of favour?- A. No, one of the executors did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is a crest on them, do you know them by that? - A.No, there is no private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark at all upon them? - A. They are the same spoons according to all the information I have had, I would not swear not swear to them, I would not swear to a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any means of swearing to spoons without marks upon them? - A. I won't swear to them.</p>

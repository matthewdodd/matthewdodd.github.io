            . I am a gangsman on Bear-key. On the 10th of Dec. we had some skins at that key; they were opened; I saw the prisoner on the key at that time, he was afterwards stopt about 20 yards from the key, with this wolf's skin; (produced in court) when he was brought to me, I asked him how he came by it; he said a man dropped it and he took it up; I said that was not true; then he went down on his knees and cried, and said, if I would forgive him he would never do so any more; there were such sort of skins as these opened, lying on the wharf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming along the key and picked the skin up, and a gentleman that was coming by took and brought me to Mr. Austin.</p>

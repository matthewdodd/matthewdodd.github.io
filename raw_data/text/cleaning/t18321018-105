            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. On the 22nd of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I went to a house in <placeName id="t18321018-105-crimeloc598">Essex-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose that was after you gave him the blow? A. Yes, some time after; he did not say that John Webb had desired him to stay in the room till he came in.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house in Essex-street. The prisoner was tenant of the room, No. 7, and had been so nearly five months; he had a young woman there, who passed as his wife - she hallooed out Murder! when the officers came; I received silver for the rent once or twice - but at the other times always copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you many lodgers? A. Yes; I am sure the prisoner was my tenant- I never knew a man named Webb; I never knew the name of the person living in the next room - a person took a room in the name of Bob, the painter, and he was taken with the prisoner, but let go; one of my tenants, named Sheen, was tried at Clerkenwell - he lived in No. 9.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What rent did the prisoner pay? A. Four shillings a week.</p>

G., and the other part has the back of the head; there are forty-six counterfeit shillings - they resemble the current coin of the kingdom; this one with the get to it is in the state in which it first comes from the mould- all the shillings appear to have been cast in this mould; the metal is usually melted in a tobacco-pipe, poured into the mould, and afterwards field to fit them for circulation; this file appears to have filed white metal - these spoons are a similar sort of metal to what the shillings are made of- the broken pieces are the same; the mould is made of plaster of Paris.</p>

            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Brunswick-row, Queen-square, and I was returning home in a hackney coach, at one o'clock on the morning of Monday the 2d of September; the coach was going pretty fast, and it stopped so suddenly, that I thought some accident had happened, or that one of the horses had fallen, I was on the left hand corner of the coach, and was just going to let down that window to ask the coachman if anything was the matter, when that instant the right hand door opened, and two men rushed in at the door, and one of them put his right-hand against me, and both of them at the same instant, said, your watch and your money, quick, Sir; quick, be quick! they repeated it several times; the other man who afterwards made his escape, a much shorter man than the prisoner, seeing he had an instrument in his hand, I could not tell what it was, I put my hand into my breeches pocket, where I had some gold and some loose silver, when at that very instant to my great surprise both the men who demanded my money vanished from the door; I heard a voice say with some expression that I cannot recollect,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140059"></xptr> or mention, what do you stop my coach for, and about the distance of five yards, I saw two men struggling together; it was extremely dark, and I got out of the coach as fast as possible, the coach door was put too again, when I came up to the spot, the coachman said master, I have got one of them, but the other has made his escape; when I came up, I found the coachman and prisoner struggling together; it occurred to me at that very instant, from a manoceure of the prisoner as he was turning himself, that he meant to make his escape by pulling off his coat; I had no arms, nor a stick, I struck him with my fist, and he fell backwards, and I then seized him by the collar, and held him down and called out watch, and it was some minutes before the watchmen came, but when they did come up, they explained the circumstance of their not coming up immediately, for they were calling the hour, and were at a distant end of the street, and when they did come up, I will do them the justice to say, they used every attention and zeal in taking the man; the coachman was so active, that he left his coach and horses without any person on earth to take care of them, because he would secure him; the man was taken to the watch-house, he had no arms of any kind about him, he had not a knife at all; this is the whole of what I have to say, but I think in justice, I must add this, that he made use of no abusive imprecations whatever, or dreadful expressions of any sort, and he had no weapons about him of any sort; it would have been impossible if we had not secured this man at the instant, that I could ever have recollected their features, for I was coming by the rails of Bloomsbury Square, to Queen's Square, and they were with their backs to the lamps, therefore I could not see their faces.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know it was him? - Because nobody else was nigh but him; I laid hold of the prisoner, and got him down, and in a short time the gentleman came.</p>

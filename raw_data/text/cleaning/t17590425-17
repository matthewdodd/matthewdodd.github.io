               <p>Q. Did he live with you?</p>
               <p>Hutson. He lodg'd at the next door to me (a publick house). I had got discharg'd from him last January. He was not my apprentice at this time. He knew my house very well: he lay in the garret at his lodgings, and I imagine he got from thence into my garret, from his window.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found the goods again?</p>
               <p>Hutson. I have, all but two pair of breeches; a man that is now in court bought them after I advertised them: Mr Coleman went to Justice Fielding and he sent for me; he told me he believed they had been offered to him; I asked Mr Coleman what sort of a man it was that offered them to him; he said, it was a young man like a Taylor's apprentice, but he asked more money for them than he chose to give; by the description he gave I found it was the prisoner. I took him up and carried him to Justice Fielding; Mr Fielding examined him; I charged him with taking these things; he denied it, and said, he knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by them that you have got again?</p>
               <p>Hutson. One Mr Steff delivered them to me, he deals in old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Terence Mac'gray. On the 16th of March I had been at work.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Mac'gray. I am a Taylor: the prisoner at the bar and a woman about forty or fifty years of age, came to my shop with these goods; my wife told me she had seen them before; I asked them what money she had bid for them when they came, they said, five guineas, but seven guineas was the price if they sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said this?</p>
               <p>Mac'gray. The woman that was with him did. Produced in Court and deposed to by prosecutor. These are the same, I bought them for five pounds fourteen shillings of them, and sold them again to Mr Steff for five pounds seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. In what part of the house were these goods taken from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were taken out of a press in my cutting room.</p>

            'gray. I am wife to Terence: on the 16th of March I was going along crying old cloaths; the prisoner at the bar asked me if I bought old cloaths; I said, yes; he said, he could help me to a bargain; I asked him what they were; he said, they were two suits of cloaths, and he described them as in the indictment; and said, that he had the selling of them, but they belonged to a friend of his; he brought me into an Alehouse called the six Canns, Holborne; from thence to the Castle about six doors higher up; he bid the woman that was with him bring the cloaths to the Faulcon and Castle in order to sell them; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250024"></xptr> I looked at them, and asked what he demanded for them; he asked eight guineas; I offered him five; that he refused; from that place they were carried to my apartment, and my husband bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these cloaths, are these the same?</p>
               <p>C. Mac'gray. I am sure they are: I was present with my husband when he sold them afterwards to Mr Steff.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your husband sell them for?</p>
               <p>C. Mac'gray. He sold them for five pounds seventeen shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Palliss. About the middle of March, an old woman came to my shop with a lad; he told me he had a bargain to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I keep a sale shop in the Minories: they brought these cloaths that are here produced with them, which were two suits, I know them again very well; I asked them the price, they said twelve guineas; I said, I would not buy them; about a week after Mr Steff (he and I deal together) came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Palliss. He lives in Grace-Church-street: he wanted some cloaths to be dy'd, which upon his describing them, I thought to be the cloaths I had seen; I went to his house and saw them, and knew them to be the same that the lad and a woman had brought to my house; he said, he had bought them of one of the business; I told him they were Mr Hutson's cloaths, which I had found by an advertisement; he and I went to Mr Hutson's, and from thence to Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner examined there?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I did: but he always denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that young lad was the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Palliss. I would sooner swear it was the prisoner, than I would swear it was not; but I will not be sure.</p>

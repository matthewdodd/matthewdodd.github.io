I came and found the prisoner in the shop; my man told me the prisoner asked him if he wanted any saw-dust, as he was sweeping the shop, he told him he might fetch some if he would; and when he came up, he looked a little bulky; my man asked him if he had not got something: he said he had not; my man looked under his apron, and saw something bulge out in his pocket, and took out one of these pieces of soap; and while he was going to take the other piece out, he threw the rest down the stairs, which he took up: this was told me in the presence of the prisoner. I asked him how he came to take this soap, he said he never stole any before, and begged I would not hurt him, and he would never do so any more. I sent for a constable, and took him before the alderman, before whom he confest he took one piece to wash his hands with, but had not meddled with the other piece.</p>

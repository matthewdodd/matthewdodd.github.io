On the 8th of January, about two o'clock I went out of the warehouse, and the street-door is always open; joining the street-door there is a warehouse door from the passage; I left the warehouse-door, I believe, on jarr; I went up stairs and staid about two minutes; when I came down again, a person in Court informed me that a man was gone out of the warehouse with two parcels under his arm; we pursued him, and met him just turning the corner of the gateway, about sixty yards off; he had put the two parcels down by the gateway, I saw the parcels in the gateway, not in his possession; the prisoner was turning the very corner of the gateway; I took him and brought him back to the warehouse; I know the parcels to be my property; they contained twenty-four pair of women's black worsted stockings, as I believe, but I really had not examined them, because the goods had not been in the warehouse two hours; I had opened them.</p>
               <p>What value were they? - About twenty shillings; they were worsted stockings.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the warehouse at the time? - Nobody; there was a gentleman in the counting-house, but he did not see him.</p>
               <p>I understand you then that it is a wholesale warehouse, not a retail-shop? - It is a warehouse; not a retail-shop.</p>

I turned my head behind the gate, and there lay the goods; I am sure he was the man that went into Mr. Deans's, and came out with the parcels; I am sure I saw him again, after he came out with the parcels.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know his person - A. Yes. On Friday the 24th of June, he applied to me for work; we engaged the prisoner to come to work on Monday morning. He came on Monday, and continued working for us until the Saturday week following. On the Saturday week following, I received an order for some garnet ear-rings; in the evening I looked out a small box to pick out these small garnets; I immediately perceived a considerable number had been taken away; I informed my partner. We referred to the stock-book, and found a number gone; there was fifty-two gone. We had never missed any thing previous to the employment of the prisoner; suspicion then fell on the prisoner. I told the prisoner the work he had in hand was particularly wanted; he offered to come the next day, Sunday morning; which I wished him to do, because no other person should be there but himself. On the Sunday, about one o'clock, I took a small topaz from the box when he was there. (Previous to this, I had counted all the stones in the box, and weighed them also, there were seventy-two stones.) The prisoner continued to work himself, and me only, until he talked of going to dinner; as an excuse, I told him I must fetch him some water from the bottom of the house. On my coming up with the water I met him going out to dinner. I immediately went to the shop, and counted these stones; I missed eight. I then told my partner of it, and thinking he would come on the Monday morning, I took no further notice of it then. He did not come on Monday morning at his usual time; at twelve o'clock at noon I went to the Magistrate at Queen-square office. I found out the prisoner's lodgings, but there he went by the name of Wells; I never knew him by any other name than Palmer. I considered it might possibly be some other person. On my return home. my servant told me he had come to work. I immediately returned to Queen-square, and obtained a warrant; the officer came with me. When I came home, the prisoner was in the work-shop; I went into the work-shop; I told him it was needless his coming to work on the Sunday, and to neglect his work on Monday. I asked him the number where he lived. I said, if I had known where he lived, I would have gone to him; he said he lived at No. 2, Arabella-row, Pimlico. I told the officer his address, and called the prisoner into a back-room. The officer searched him, and found a number of duplicates on him, and some pieces of silver; one of the pieces of silver I had given him as materials to work with. I went with the officer to look at twenty-nine stones, pawned at Mr. Lane's in Holborn, with the duplicates; the pawnbroker's man has them now I, and the officer, Popal, searched his lodgings. We found a little box of stones; some of which I knew to be mine. I found eight topaz stones, and fifty-two garnets; I found the eight topaz stones I lost on the Sunday; the fifty-two garnets were missed on the 1st of July. The twenty-nine stones at Mr. Lane's were a variety; I could not speak to every one of them. I am positive I lost fifty-two garnets, and eight topaz stones, and the twenty-nine found at Mr. Lane's, I know some of them.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house, Castle-street, Leicester-fields; I there took the prisoner into custody. On searching him, I found two pieces of silver and a duplicate of twenty-nine stones pledged at Mr. Lane's, Holborn, for five shillings.

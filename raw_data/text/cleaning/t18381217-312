                  </hi>. I am the wife of Moses Deal, a dealer in earthen-ware, in Bell-street, Edgeware-road. On the 13th of December, about half-past three o'clock, in consequence of information given me by my opposite neighbour, Mr. Reed, I looked and missed two tumblers, which I had seen safe not five minutes before—I went to Mrs. Austin's, a marine-store dealer, and found Conway there—I told him he had taken my glasses—he denied it—Mrs. Austin came into the shop with the uses in her hand, and said, "Do you mean to say these are your glasses?"—I said they were—she said, "Why I have just brought them off my mantel-shelf"—I believe her name is Maria Ford, but she is called Mrs. Austin—I know the glasses to be mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

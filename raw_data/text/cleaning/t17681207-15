Last Friday evening I was in a little room adjoining to the shop; I saw the prisoner going out of the shop, but I did not see him come in: I ran out and called, Stop thief! seeing him running up the lane: he was stopped, and brought back, and this parcel of tobacco, (producing a parcel tied up in a paper) is our property. It was lying in the shop just before, having been brought in not long before.</p>

            . Last Friday fortnight I was standing at my master's door, in Gray's-Inn Lane, I heard the cry, Stop thief! I saw the prisoner come running, and two or three boys<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070014"></xptr> after him; I crossed the way and stopped him, and this bundle of tobacco was picked up by one of the boys, within about five yards from him; he struggled hard to get away from me; I took him back to the prosecutor's; he said he was running to pay a man 6 d. that he owed in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>- Crookshanks. I am fourteen years of age. I saw the prisoner run up the lane. I saw him first, within ten yards of Mr. Marshall's house; he had this tobacco under his arm; Mr. Hughes knocked him down; a boy took up the tobacco and delivered it to me, about five yards from where the prisoner was knocked down.</p>

               <p>I was going to Gray's Inn Lane, about six o'clock I had the same business to do, and I owed a man 2 d. I had told him I would pay him in a quarter of an hour; a man passed me; they called out, Stop thief! I pursued that man as fast as I could, and they stopped me.</p>

I fell in company with a young woman, and while I was talking to her two young women and the prisoner Ryan came up and asked me to give them some drink - I said Yes, if they could find the men I wanted - presently Ann Clisset came up and said, "Bradlay, is that you?" I said Yes - I asked her to go and have something to drink, and we all six went into a public-house; they were all women but me- I treated them with some gin, and had a pipe of tobacco myself; they all stood at the bar; I knew none of them but Clisset; we came out of the house together; I walked a few paces from the door - Ryan then clapped her hand to my watch, to take it out of my fob - I caught hold of her hand, and said, "Don't do that again" - I had not moved her a minute, before she seized it, and got it out of my pocket - they all set off running in different directions - I followed one to a house, and told the watchman - he took her - I am positive of Ryan's person, for I talked more to her than any person.</p>

On the 20th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw Bradley in Rosemary-lane - I have known him these twelve years; four women were talking to him, and Ryan was one of them - I said, "Is that you Bradley?" he said Yes, and we all went into the public-house together; he had a pint of beer at the bar; we came out - Ryan kept very close to him; she snatched his watch out, and ran round the corner with it - I am sure she is the girl - I knew her before - we were all sober.</p>

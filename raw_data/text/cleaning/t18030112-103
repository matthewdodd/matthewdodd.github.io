             sworn. - I am a patrol in the City-road, and was on duty between seven and eight o'clock; every now and then I heard something fall upon the floors in this unfinished house, for near an hour, from the top of the house; at last I heard something fall very heavy, I then called my fellow patrol, an said, there was somebody in it; we searched it, and the prisoner forced his way out f the first floor window, the other patrol took him; he asked where his hat was; he said, he did not know; I said, here it is, where you got out of window; I picked it up, and gave it to him, and he owned it. We then examined the house, and missed the lead from the top; we looked for the lead, and found it rolled up in three rolls, and thrown into the next yard.(Benjamin Taylor, a patrol, confirmed the last witness).(The lead produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taken short, and stepped into the house; I was not two minutes there, when a man jumped out of window, knocked down a board, and knocked my hat off; I was going away, and the patrol came up and charged me with a robbery. <rs id="t18030112-103-verdict561" type="verdictDescription">

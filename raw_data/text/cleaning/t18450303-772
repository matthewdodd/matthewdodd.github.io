                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Crosby-row, Walworth. The prisoner had been in my service a fortnight and a day at the time she was given into custody—when she came she appeared in a distressed state, and badly supplied with clothes—I am the collector of a rate—I keep the gold and silver I collect for that in two bags, and my own gold and silver in two other bags, separate from the other—I keep these bags, in the day-time, in a desk in the shop, which I keep the keys of, and at night I take them up to the room I sleep in, and bring them down myself in the morning—on Thursday, the 6th of Feb., I counted the gold which I had in the collecting-bag at nearly ten o'clock at night—there was then 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—on the Friday I put into it 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and on the Saturday 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, but I did not take any out—there should have been in it 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—on the Sunday night I took that and the other bags up stairs, and put them on the drawers at the foot of my bed—on that Sunday night I had a child ill, and had a fire in my bed-room—I attended to the fire during the night, but I dropped asleep—I awoke about five in the morning, and the fire was out—I went to sleep again, and awoke a little past seven—I then found the fire had been lighted—the prisoner was kneeling at the grate, and putting the fender to it, as if she bad just lighted the fire—it was the housemaid's business to attend to the fire, but she was at home at her mother's that night, and the prisoner attended to it—when I got up I found the bags in the place where they should be, on the drawers—I found the money that was in my own private bags right; but between three and four o'clock on that Monday afternoon I missed 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold out of the col<lb></lb>lecting-bag—I made some inquiries about the neighbourhood, and on the following Friday, at dinner-time, I called the prisoner into the room, and told her I suspected she was robbing me—she said, "Of what?"—I said, "Of money"—she said, "I have taken none of your money, I have not touched your bags"—I had not at that time said anything about bags—I asked whence she got the money to buy so many articles, and enumer<lb></lb>ated some which I heard she had bought—I asked her the price of them, and she told me—I asked her about a shawl, and she said she had had that for two years—she told me she had had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Camberwell Savings-bank, and had taken it out about last July, and had replaced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during her servitude at her previous mistresses, and that she had received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from her previous mistress; that she had 41. 105. when she came to me, and had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left; but on the production of her money it was only half-a-crown—I left the house, to make some inquiries, and was gone about twenty minutes—when I returned she had absconded—I traced her, by means of the snow, over the fence to a house in East-lane, and after some difficulty, I discovered her in the house of a man named Gib<lb></lb>bons—when I got into the room she came from under the bed, and asked me what I wanted her for—I said she must come with me, and that if she had been innocent she would hate stopped at my house—she went home with me, and I gave her in charge—when she was taken she asked me to give her the shawl, but I refused.</p>

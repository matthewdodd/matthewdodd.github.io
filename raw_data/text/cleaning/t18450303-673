The two prisoners lived in the back room—about a quarter before three o'clock in the morning of the 27th of Jan. I was in bed and awake—I heard a voice from the back of the premises call "<hi rend="italic">Ned</hi>" and immediately somebody from the back room adjoining to mine, went down stairs and let in two or three persons—I am certain there were two persons let in—they went into the prisoners' room, and shortly afterwards they commenced a great noise, as if they were hammering a tin cannister—I listened attentively, and could not distinguish their voices from the sound of the tin, and as if they were sounding gold and silver—I heard somebody say, "Now we shall have the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be divided between us"—it was a male voice that said that—I then heard a female say, "Now, I suppose, it is all over, you will go out of town," and a male voice said he thought he should go to Brighton—shortly after we same persons, apparently, who had been let in, left—I did not see any</p>

I loosened the prisoner directly to secure my property; two waggons were coming along; a waggoner picked up the case, and I the watch. The prisoner ran away towards Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get hold of the prisoner - A.In about twenty minutes afterwards, Branscomb brought in a man, which I thought was the man, who robbed me, but when I saw the prisoner brought into the house, I said, that is the man, the other is a mistake. The prisoner was brought in five minutes after the first man, and he appeared to be very much intoxicated at the time that he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, is the prisoner the man that robbed you of the watch - A. Yes, I am certain he is the man.</p>

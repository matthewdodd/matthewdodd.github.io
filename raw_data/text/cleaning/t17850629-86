               <p>I am a working woman, I get up very early in the morning, and I saw the prisoner come down Back-house-lane, Hackney, about a quarter after four last Saturday was a week, and I saw him look through the key-hole of Mr. Newman's stable door, my business called me off, and in about ten minutes I saw him come from off Mr. Whitworth's coach house door, he had a great coat and a bag, I cannot say what was in the bag, but I saw the coat; he walked off up the lane, I did not know him before, nor ever saw him, I know him by his apparel, I did not see his face, for his back was towards me; I can swear to his clothes.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the watch-house door in Hackney church-yard , in the morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290117"></xptr> a little before five; I made after him , and took him, and he has these glasses and a coat, all that he said was, that he begged I would not hurt him, one Mr. Gough came up and said it was Mr. Chalkley's great coat, and Chalkley came and owned it, and we have had them in our possession ever since.</p>
               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with the last witness, I saw the prisoner pass, so we stopped him and brought him back with the things upon him, he cried out do not hurt me, he had a bag and a great coat, and there were three coach glasses. (The things deposed to.) The coach strings were cut off and left in the coach-house, and they match directly.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went down this lane and there was no thoroughfare, coming back I found that was no turning, I was taken short, and I went by the side of a dunghill, and there was this bag and these glasses, and the great coat was alongside of it; I shook the great coat and brought it out, and looked at it for five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a very good character, and said he had three children.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitworth . Was your coach-house door locked? - No, it was bolted withinside, they could get in by getting over into a gentleman's garden, where the bolt was on the outside.</p>

               <p>Court. Do any of the officers know whether he has ever been here before? - no, my Lord.</p>

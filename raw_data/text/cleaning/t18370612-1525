                  </hi>. I am butler to the Honourable Harriet Grimstone, who lives in Upper Grosvenor-street. On the 20th of May this wine label and chain hung on a nail in the pantry, down stairs—I lost a pocket handker<lb></lb>chief, which was safe in the pantry at one o'clock—I did not miss the label till past ten o'clock, when I was putting the plate away; and a pair of plated sugar-tongs were taken out of the housekeeper's closet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable to the Mendicity Society. I saw the prisoner that day, about a quarter to two o'clock, go down the area, No. 1, Seymour-street—he was dressed in this white apron, with the corner drawn on one side—he was not gone an instant—he then came up, and went to No. 10, and went down—I followed directly, and went and called to the servants, we went to the pantry, and there found the prisoner—I searched him, and found this label and other things on him—this was concealed in the belt he had on—this spoon was bent, and fixed in the belt, and this silver watch in his fob—he said he would get me 20. if I would let him go.</p>

               <p>(Thomas Anderson, a green-grocer, and Sarah Tidmarsh, of Kensington Gravel-pits, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

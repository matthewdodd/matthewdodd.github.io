            . I am sixteen years old, and live in Isabella-row, about a quarter of a mile from Hobson's. About half-past seven o'clock, on Saturday evening, I saw Harrison, opposite Hobson's house dancing. I passed him - then saw him whistle, and look up towards the balcony - it is a French window. I cannot say whether it was open. I looked up and saw somebody on the balcony with a large white bundle in his hands - it was a young boy, almost as tall as Harrison. The prisoners were two of them. He threw the bundle to three persons who were below. Harrison was close to the house. I think he laid hold of the bundle. I went and called at a sadler's, next door. Before the bundle was thrown out, Mascoe said to me,</p>
               <p>"Push on;" and I went to the sadler's - I opened the door, went in, told the apprentice; he came out; and then I saw another bundle thrown from the window - one of the three picked it up - I think it was Harrison. I saw the man get out of the balcony. The apprentice ran to call his master, and when he came out, they were all gone, with the bundles; they all four went up Stafford's-place; we did not follow them. I saw Harrison in custody on the Monday, and was sure of him; and about a week after I saw Mascoe come out of the lock-up place, at Bow-street, and told the officer that he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you. - A. I live with my father, who was inspector of gas-lights, and is now promoted. I have known Harrison two years; he is a lamp-lighter. I saw him there for ten minutes, and am positive of him. There was no ladder at the balcony.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the sadler, next door to Hobson. Fitzgerald called me out about half-past seven o'clock. I looked up to the balcony, and saw a bundle thrown out - three persons were before the house, another came from the balcony, and all ran off together, leaving nothing behind - they could easily get down by a lamp-iron. I know Mascoe to be one; he stood against my master's railing, and ran off with the others.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took Harrison on Monday. the 4th of February, at his father's, in Vauxhall-road. He was denied to me, but I found him in bed; and Fitzgerald, who was with me, pointed to a hat in the parlour, and said it was what he wore, and said he was the man who received the bundle. About a week after, Mascoe was at Bow-street on another charge. Harrison was being examined, as Mascoe was brought out of the lock-up place. Fitzgerald said he was with Harrison. - The balcony had been painted that day; and there was fresh paint of the same sort on the back of Harrison's jacket.</p>

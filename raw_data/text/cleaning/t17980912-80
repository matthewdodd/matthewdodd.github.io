             sworn. - I am an officer of the Police-office. On Monday, the 9th of April, I went, in company with some other officers, to a house in George-yard, Whitechapel, where we apprehended the men that were tried at Chelmsford, in company with the prisoner at the bar; the three men that were tried at Chelmsford resisted very much, in the mean time the prisoner made her escape; I searched the apartment, it was a lower room, she acknowledged that it was her room; I searched the room, and found the articles stated in the indictment tied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120097"></xptr>up in this handkerchief, and concealed in a bureau bedstead; I secured the three men, and took them to the office. On the Wednesday following, I went, in company with Griffiths, to a place called Salter's-rents, near Shoreditch-turnpike, where we found the prisoner in bed; I asked who that room belonged to that she made her escape out of, and she said it was her's; I asked her if she knew any of the prisoners that we had apprehended; she said, yes, she knew Morris, he had slept with her about six weeks; she had a bed-gown, which, upon my asking her, she said Morris gave her after the first robbery; Mr. Chapman was robbed twice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman. I was robbed the 17th of March the first time, and afterwards in the night of the 8th of April.(Nowlan produces the property.)</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. He and his wife lodged in my second floor for four or five years; I know nothing of this business.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. (To Prosecutor.) Look at the things produced, and tell us whether you know any of these things are your's? - A. These seven shirts belong to me, six are striped cotton sea-faring shirts, and one white soldier's shirt, with a frill; there is no mark upon them; I employ a man in the country who makes the whole of this cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these seven shirts? - A. They are valued at one pound eight shillings and sixpence; I had only a remnant, a yard and a half, of swansdown in the house, and the piece of swans-down found in the prisoner's lodgings is not quite a yard; I have the other piece here, and the piece found at the prisoner's lodgings make up a yard and a half; it is the same pattern, I value that at two shillings; the buttons I cannot speak to myself, they are in this paper with the word middling upon it; it is the writing of my young man, they are valued at four shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. These shirts have no mark on them? - A. No, I know them by the pattern and quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not any person find in shops of the same description, shirts of the same quality and pattern? - A. I do not think they could for width, length, pattern, and quality; I know so well the particular patterns, and the cotton the man makes by contract, I know I am perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he a patent to make that pattern? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different shirts have you sold? - A. A great many.</p>
               <p>Q. And no mark on them at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to that piece of swans-down, you did not make that? - A. I did not; I only say that was in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, from your own knowledge, that it was in your possession before the 19th of May, or do you speak so because some of your servants knew that? -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you yourself observed that individual thing in your stock? - A. Yes, a little while before, on the 30th of April I took stock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. On the 30th of April you took stock, did you yourself notice that there was only a yard and a half of that swansdown? - A. Particularly so, and on the 19th of May I found but half the remnant.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to the shirt-buttons, there is your servant's mark upon the paper, and that piece of paper was in your warehouse - do you swear to the buttons? - A. I can give you a fellow-parcel of buttons to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say they are not common buttons? - A. They are not common buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (Shews the buttons to the Court.) They are common sugar-loaf buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons, who are not slop-sellers, do make use of them? - A. They do.</p>

               <p>Q. You had many others marked in the same way, middling, and the same sort of buttons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me how many more persons, slop-sellers, might or might not have in their possession as many as there are persons dealing in the articles? - A. Yes, we do not sell them, we put them on shirts; in that paper is twelve gross.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not sell buttons - now, supposing the paper in which buttons is bound up that are to be used, when the paper is empty, what becomes of it - it is waste paper, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>

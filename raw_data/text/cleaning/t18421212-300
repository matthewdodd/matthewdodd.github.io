                  </hi>. I am single—I lived at No. 3, Mary's-place, Peckharm, New-town. I know the prisoner—he called upon me in Sept. last year—I cannot tell the day—we went out together, and he gave me a watch to pledge for him—it bad the appearance of a gold one—he said his father had come to town, that he wished to make an appearance, he had not money, and he wished to raise money on this watch—he told me his name was Stanhope—I bad known him some time—in consequence of what he said to me, I pledged the watch at Mr. Filmer's, in the Walworth-road in my own name, for I think 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot exactly say—I gave the money and duplicate to the prisoner—I should say there was a glass to the watch, but I had it in my hand a very short time—the dial was gold—I pledged another watch for him, not at the tame time—I cannot say how long afterwards—one was in Sept., and the other I think in Nov., both in the last year—I pledged one at Tur<lb></lb>ner's—I do not know whether it was the first or second one, and the other I pledged at Filmer's—I pledged hoth in my own name—the second one had also a gold dial—the prisoner had a little black dog at the time I knew him—I believe it was a valuable one—he told me when I pledged one of the watches that he had an allowance from his father, that his father had stopped that allow<lb></lb>ance, that he wished for money to go to the Isle of Wight, and this watch was Merely a temporary thing till he got his money—I gave the pawnbroker di<lb></lb>rections to put my own name on the duplicate of the one pledged at Filmer's—I said, "You had better put the maker's name on"—the prisoner said it was a valuable watch, and I thought if I did not take it out, it would be all right, not being accustomed to such things—I gave him the duplicate and money—he took the duplicate, read it, and said, "You have pledged this in your own name and the maker's"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Quite right,"—folded it up and put it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

I first saw the prisoner ten or eleven years ago, and have seen him in all about ten times since; he has called on me several times, and told me his mother-in-law was dead, and had left him something very handsome - that he had some money to put out, and did I know any body who wanted any; I said No, but on the fourth or fifth application he offered to lend me 100l. on my own warrant of attorney, and said if I would go and dine with him at the

             he would give me the money - this was on the 17th of September; I said I could not, but I would be there about four o'clock - he told me to bring a 30s. stamp for the warrant of attorney; I went, and he said, "We will go into the other room, and have a bottle of wine," which we did, and then he asked if I would pay for a bottle - I said, "With all my heart," and another was brought; I had taken a 30s. stamp and three 2s. ones- while this bottle was drinking he wrote something on the 30s. stamp, caught them all up, and went out - I said to a person there, "Why he has taken the stamps;" he said, "Oh, he is only gone to the water-closet;" I waited there three hours, but he never returned - he had left his bill unpaid; I did not see him again till the 23rd of April - I never saw his 100l., or the stamps either.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was it in 1817 that you first knew him? A.About that time - I had to receive 200l. from him, paid by his mother-in-law, about twelve years ago; I understood he was an attorney - I had orders from my agent to go to Colchester to receive the 200l. - I went, and was introduced to the person who was to give it to me; as soon as I had signed the document, he said, "Where do you dine?" I said at the Cups - he said he would bring me the money there in half an hour - he never came; I posted up to town, sued his mother-in-law, and got the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the name of Johnson mentioned as the person who was to lend this 100l.? A. No, not at the coffee-house; he mentioned some name to the Magistrate - the prisoner is the person who was to lend me the money; Mr. Carpenter, a confectioner, of Fleet-street, was in the room when I produced the stamps - I wanted the 100l. for a particular use; Carpenter was not to join in the security; I had got him to purchase the stamps and go with me as a witness - we had two bottles of wine between us three -I paid 14s. for what the prisoner drank; he did not say he was going to Peele's coffee-house, to Johnson, for the money - Mr. Halls, the Magistrate, offered to admit him to bail, if he could procure it; as he was going to the station he wanted me to go to a friend of his in Stanhope-street, to settle it, but I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say "I am sorry I did not come back -I could not get the money, and was ashamed; it is true I used the stamps, but here is the money for them?" A. No - I never asked 5l. to settle this; I was tampered with by several persons, but would not accept any thing - the bill-stamps were not written on; I cannot say what he wrote on the 30s. one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.The prisoner knew well were to find you? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live in Fleet-street. I know Jacobs - I never saw the prisoner till the 17th of September, when I called on Jacobs, and he was in the counting-house - Jacobs gave me two sovereigns, and asked me to buy the stamps; I bought a 30s. and three 2s. ones - the prisoner came out, and Jacobs introduced me to him; I afterwards went to the Belle Sauvage with Jacobs - the prisoner asked if we had taken dinner; we said Yes - he said, "Well, perhaps you will take a glass of wine;" we had a bottle in the drinking-room - Jacobs produced the 30s. stamp, and hauded it to the prisoner; I understood the prisoner was to lend him 100l., and I was to witness it - Jacobs took out the other three stamps, and laid them on the table, with his pocket-book; the prisoner talked to him about Essex, and he appeared to be writing on the 30s. stamp - he handed the wine round very fast, and then proposed that Jacobs should stand a bottle, which was brought in; I took my share of it, and when it was about half drank he said something to Jacobs - he had the 30s. stamp in his hand, and went out with that and the other three; we stopped there till eight o'clock at night - he did not return - we called in the waiter, who brought in a bill of 14s., including the dinner, which Jacobs paid; I never saw the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street, on the 27th of April - he said the stamps were to be produced - Mr. Halls gave him time to produce them, but he never did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you yourself been negociating in this way? A. No - I have borrowed hundreds and thousands in my life; I was not to join in the security - Jacobs did not tell me what was to be done with the billstamps - I only went to witness the warrant; I smoked a pipe - I can sometimes drink three bottles of wine when I go to cook a dinner, and be steady after it; I was perfectly sober.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had failed in getting the money, was ashamed to return without it, and unfortunately kept the stamps? A. He never said a word of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had seen the prosecutor three weeks or a fortnight before - he asked me to procure him the loan of 100l.; I said I would speak to a friend of mine, Johnson, of Stratford, who I expect here - he was at Bow-street, but Mr. Halls did not think it necessary to call him- I wrote to him last night, but do not see him about the Court; if he is here, I shall staisfy the Jury I am perfectly innocent - I asked what security he could give, and I solemnly declare Carpenter was the security; the warrant of attorney was filled up, and I read it over to them before I took it away; the stamp on it was allowed at the stampoffice.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL JACOBS. The value of the stamps has never been returned to me by any body - the prisoner told Mr. Halls they were allowed to him at the office; Mr. Halls told me to make inquiry, but we could make nothing out- he never offered me any money as being allowed for them.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find the prisoner? A. I was passing in the Strand, and saw him - I said, "Mr. Weeding, you are the person I want, stop, for I have an officer;" he said, "Why, I owe you something, and will pay you;" I said, "No, you have robbed me - you owe me nothing."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you pay him any money for preparing the warrant of attorney? A. No - I have not seen the stamp since; it was a printed one - I do not know that it was ever filled up; the bill-stamps were provided in case he should require to draw bills on me for the amount.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The bills were to be given at different dates, and the warrant was the security - if the deposition before Mr. Halls was brought forward, that is very different to what he has said to-day; Carpenter declared there that I took the stamps with the consent of Jacobs, for the purpose of going to read the warrant to the person who was to advance the money.</p>

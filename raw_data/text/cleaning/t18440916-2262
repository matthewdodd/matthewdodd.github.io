                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Attenborough. On the 7th of Sept. I saw the prisoner Edwin in my master's shop offering a gold watch in pledge—in consequence of the address he gave on that occasion, by direc<lb></lb>tion of my employer, I accompanied him on the road to No. 15, Dorset-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184409160049"></xptr>
               <p>Clapham—on our arrival within a few yards of that place, he pointed out Dorset-street to me, and said, "That is Dorset-street; I will not trouble you-to go there, I do not wish my friends to know it; but if you will step up the Clap<lb></lb>ham-road, to my brother's, he will be able to satisfy you"—on arriving within twenty yards of South Lambeth-road he said, "My brother lives near where those boys are playing"—on arriving there I found no houses—a little further on a man was waiting for him—he said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> "—the prisoner said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> "or "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, just step up the road, and tell <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> I want him"—I asked who he had sent for—he said only his cousin, and asked me to wait till the man came back—I said I could not <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> that, he must go back with roe to Dorset-street—he consented, and as we were turning the corner he said he did not live there, it was all a lie, he never had lived there—we went to Dorset-street—I found he did not live there—I then told him he must consent to go with me back to the shop, or I should give him in charge of the first constable I met—when we were rounding the corner by Newing<lb></lb>ton church I asked him who the watches belonged to—he said one belonged to himself, and the other to his brother; that he had bought them in the City, and they cost 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a-piece—I asked if he could tell me where he had bought them—he said he could not—I took him back to the shop, and asked if he would give me any further information—he said he could not—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith and jeweller, in partnership with my father and brothers, in the Poultry, in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin. I know this watch—I saw it safe on my premises on Friday week last, about eight o'clock in the evening—I left at a quarter-past eight—it was in a glass case on the counter—William was in my service at that time, and Edwin had been so—the watch cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in consequence of information I received on Monday, the 9th of Sept. I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol, and there saw Edwin Hartridge in custody—on my return to the shop I found William in the counting-house—the inspector asked him if he knew where his brother was—he said he did not know—William went home every Sunday morning, and returned at seven in the evening—I gave him in charge—he then bunt out crying—he said he knew his brother Edwin had been keeping very bad com<lb></lb>pany lately; that he had allowed him to sleep with him on Friday evening; that he awoke at six o'clock on Saturday morning, and found him behind our counter; that he then went and said to him, looking at the case, "I know you have taken some watches from this case;" he said, "No, I hate not;" he said, "I know you have; you know Mr. Sarl has missed several things lately, and we get blamed for it when you take them;" he then said, "If you don't give up the watches I shall give you in charge;" that his brother denied having any; that he then, as his brother was going out of the door, took him by the coat, and took a gold watch and a silver watch out of his pocket, and kept them in his possession until my coming to town, and that after I had unlocked the case he put them back again—I then said, "How could your brother get at the case?"—he said, "O, Sir, he can do it with a pair of shop scissors"—I said, "What, open this case with a pair of scissors? show me how"—he tried to do it, but could not—there was no mark on the case as if scissors had been applied to it—he then went with the policeman—it is a very unusual thing to have a fire in the room next the shop early in the morning in Sept.—the shop is dark when the shutters are up—it was the business of the witness Batson to come at seven o'clock in the morning—there would not be light enough to see the means of getting at the property as late as seven, without the light of the fire, or a candle.</p>

            , the prisoner, Betterton, was in our employ, at a salary of 90l. per annum, and had lived seven years with us, we live in the Old Jewry. On the 17th of January I took out a search-warrant, he lived in the City-gardens, City-road. Armstrong and Gleed went to his house with me, to execute it. Armstrong went in first, and laid hold of the prisoner, Frost, he ran away directly he saw us; Armstrong brought him back into the kitchen - He had a parcel in his hand, which he put on the table; Armstrong asked what it was, he said it was his own clothes. Armstrong produced his warrant for silk goods, and asked if it contained any thing of that sort; after some hesitation, he acknowledged that it contained some of the articles which had been read to him; it was opened, and contained the articles enumerated in the indictment - I knew them to be mine; we had not sold him any of them, they are worth 40l. Frost said that he bought them of his brother Betterton, and produced a paper in Betterton's hand-writing, which, he said, was a bill; some of the articles are much lower, and others rather higher, than they would be sold for. We went up and found Betterton in his bed-room, I told him what I came for, and that Frost said he had the goods of him - He did not deny it. He afterwards requested to speak to me, and said, he hoped we should be lenient with him. I told him it depended on my partners.</p>

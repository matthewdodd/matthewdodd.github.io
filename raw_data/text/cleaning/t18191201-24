            . On the 22d of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was returning along Holborn from the City - At Furnival's Inn I took my watch out to see the time, and when I came to the top of <placeName id="t18191201-24-crimeloc150">Gray's Inn-lane</placeName>

I felt, and missed my watch, and have no hesitation in believing it was stolen at that time and place. I did not observe any of the persons.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snowhill. On the 22d of September, to the best of my belief, between twelve and three o'clock, the prisoner's wife brought me a silver watch, five gold keys and three seals, for which she requested the loan of 4 l. - I advanced three guineas, and gave her a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was his wife - A. She occasionally came to the shop with him as his wife. I do not know whether the prisoner was with her at the time or not. I produced this watch, among others, before the Magistrate, and the prosecutor claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. You have no reason to say he was with her - A. No; I cannot say positively that he was.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on another charge - I found nothing on him. I took his wife at the same time, and found thirty duplicates on her. He was detained, and the different watches and things advertised. On Friday the prosecutor claimed this watch. I found no duplicate of this watch on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When were they unpacked and repacked? A.

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If I rightly understand you, you say you saw them counted, or counted them yourself, and this is the memorandum? A. Yes; I am not aware that sailors are in the habit of making these purchases.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were satisfied with that account, that he got it from the Naples packet? A.

On the 20th of February I was with Hughes in the Surveyor's room at the office - I asked how he got the feathers out of the dock - he said he saw a waggon come in, and he told the waggoner he would give him half-a-crown to lend his great coat, and take a bundle out of the dock for him - that he got the great coat and wrapped the bundle in it, and placed it in the waggon; he followed it as far as the Mint - he then took it to No. 92, Wood-street, Cheapside; I saw a person named Ball the same morning, who produced some feathers in Hughes' presence, which he said he bought of him on the Thursday before - they weighed 41/2lbs. Ball said, but who is to return me my money - I said I could say nothing about that - he said he gave 3l. 5s. for them, but Hughes said it was only three guineas - Ball then said "I believe that was the case;" I afterwards went to No. 21, Bath-street, Hackney - I brought away from there this bundle of feathers, weighing five ounces; and a little more than 1lb. of loaf fine sugar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And so all this was told you that you might find out where they were? A. Yes; he did not tell me the feathers he took to Mr. Ball's were his own, nor any thing like it; I think it my duty to examine a prisoner who is brought under a charge of felony, when there was any property lost - I did not guard him in any way against telling me.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Hughes. On the 9th of February last I received from him a small parcel of sugar, and a bunch of feathers; I put them into my drawer. Lovell is my brother-in-law - he knew where I put them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. About four months; I was told he last came from the Indies; he had not given me any thing before - he said he got these feathers from the ship in the London-docks, and I took them; I asked him if he could get feathers from the ship, and he said that each of his shipmates had a bunch given them.</p>

            . I am a feather-maker, and live at No. 6, London-wall. On the 16th of February Hughes came to my house, with a parcel of feathers in a pocket-handkerchief, which he opened out - there were twenty-one bundles, and I considered they would weigh about 6lbs. - he asked but 50s. for them - I said I thought he had come by them wrongfully, as I should think they were worth 30s. a pound, as they appeared very good, and remarkably clean.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you get that in the market for them now? A. I do not know, there has been a great fall, but I would give that for them.</p>

            . I have been in the feather trade for fifteen years. I directed some cases of feathers to be shipped on board the Lord Exmouth, and received the bill of lading on the 8th of February. The feathers produced are exactly of the same description - I shipped them at 40s., which was the limit I received them at - I would have given from 35s. to 40s. for them in the market.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you ship them? A. Because I could not get 40s. for them - the market was extremely dull, and it is now still worse; I do not affect to say these are the same, but they were of the same description as these - they are particularly clean picked. I offered them at from 46s. to 48s. in bond, but with the duty and expenses, they would have been nearly 60s.</p>

            . I shipped seven cases of nutmegs on board the Lord Exmouth, from No. 1 to 7, marked H. H. and Co., on the 13th of February, on account of Messrs. Stirren and Co. I have seen one of these cases since in the possession of Mr. Fowler; I have compared the nutmegs in that case with those produced - they appear to be the same sort, but those produced by the officer are rather darker, as if the powder had been rubbed off them - but they were as near the quality as possible. I have seen a great many nutmegs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are these good sound nutmegs? A. Yes; there is a good deal of difference in nutmegs.</p>

            . I am a part owner of the Lord Exmouth, at the London-dock - Edward Mills is the Captain, and is part owner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then these things were not in your possession, but in his, as Captain? A. Yes; as part owner of the ship I considered them in my possession - I had no interest in the cargo except the freight - the Captain had the care and possession of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Were you answerable for them as well as others? A. Yes; I was, from time to time, in the ship as well as the Captain; I have paid the duty for all the deficiency, to Government, and I have bills of the different articles from the proprietors, who have applied to me.</p>
               <p>HUGHES' Defence. The last voyage I made was in the Comet, from Constantinople and Smyrna; I had not an opportunity of taking these feathers out which I had brought with me, and I put them on board the Lord Exmouth; Spoor was the man who gave them to me out of the forecastle, but he did not know what was in the parcel. Trudgett says she received the feathers of me on the 9th of February, but these were not shipped till the 13th. The mate says, it is not a common thing for sailors to make a venture, but I have been various voyages and I know that it is a very common thing for them to do if they can get them on shore.</p>
               <p>HAYNES' Defence. I did not know the feathers were on board the ship - we were cleaning out the forecastle and found the nutmegs lying about - I got them together.</p>
               <p>SPOOR'S Defence. I gave up a parcel to Hughes, but I did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>Hughes put in a written defence, protesting his innocence, and denying any knowledge of the transaction.</p>

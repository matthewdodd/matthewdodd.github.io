                  </hi>. I reside at Greenock, in Scotland, and am a merchant. On the 10th of August, about twelve o'clock, I went to St. James's Park to see the palace—the prisoner Cummings came up to me, and told me he was a merchant from Newcastle—he asked if I was a stranger—I told him I was, and that I came there to see the Palace—he said he had got all his busi<lb></lb>ness done—that the merchants here did their business soon, and he was wait<lb></lb>ing for a vessel coming into the pool, and he expected to make a handsome sum of it, as he had the first offer—we walked about for an hour, or an hour and a half, and then he asked me to go and take a drink of porter, (it is not possible I can be mistaken in the person, because these two men were with me in the house and there was no other person with me,) I have no doubt of them—I had drank nothing then—I went with Cummings to a</p>

               <p>public-house near the Park—he called for a bottle of porter—we were only a short time there, when Baseke came in—he seated himself right oppo<lb></lb>site on the other side or the same table—he began telling a story about his family—that his father was dead, and his elder brother had taken possession of the property, and left him and his sister destitute—he said he was at service at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and he gave part to give his sister schooling, and the people of the village, in Lancashire, told him that his brother was born before his father was married, and he had got the property that day or the day before—he had got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it of the lawyer—he proposed to give each of us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to the poor, or do what we liked with—I said I had a little money with me; but Cummings said he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or about that, at his lodgings—I did not say what I had—then this <hi rend="italic">laird</hi>, (the man that had the money,) went to another house—we came through the Park again, and came to another house, and dressed a beef-steak—this <hi rend="italic">laird</hi> paid for that—we drank a bottle of port wine—the laird paid for it—then each of us put our money out—we had been home before we had the beef-streak—I lodge in the Minories—we got one of the little <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and Cummings went to the Belle Sauvage to take his money out—I went to the Minories, when I got home, I took my pocket-book, which contained forty-one sovereigns and a half-sovereign, and one Scotch note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was taken in by that fellow—he told me he drove one of the best gigs in Newcastle, and had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I met Cummings at the Belle Sauvage, and Baseke was at the door—we had shifted a house or two, because they wanted to go into some low house, and I would not go but into a respecta<lb></lb>ble house—it was about four o'clock when we took the beef and port, and then Cummings showed some notes that he had—they were rolled up in a piece of paper, and what money I had was put on the table, and rolled up in a piece of paper and the note—Baseke had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, which he had shown us long before that, I believe—I did not examine them—then I put mine into my pocket, rolled up, and Cummings was to put a second piece or paper round it; and he made me pull out my watch—he put it down under my watch—the <hi rend="italic">laird</hi> (Baseke) then went away to buy some cigars, and then Cummings left me before I could look round—I was satisfied I had my money; and when I was going to bed I found I had got two shillings' worth of halfpence instead of it—I gave information to the policeman next morning, and after that they were taken—I was at a loss to know them at first, but the waiter having so completely described them, I was certain these are the persons.</p>

               <p>after that I had my doubts—I went to the policeman—I could not give any description of the two men—I was fetched by a policeman down to Greenwich, to be examined before the Magistrate—the policeman told me on the way that he was going to show me the men who had robbed me—he said, "The two men that are taken on suspicion"—I went down expecting to see the two men that are taken on suspicion"—I went first to the watch-house—let Baseke hold out his right hand, I will tell you by his fore-finger, it is crushed in some way—I never said any thing to any one about the finger—I think I saw something remarkable in one of them hands at the watch-house—I really cannot charge my memory—I did not ask to look at his hand—I took a note of it in my mind—no one had told me about this man's finger—I saw it myself the first day I was with him—I did not give that description to the policeman—he was better acquainted with the man than I was—I said I could give no description; but every thing does not occur to a person at one time—it would appear I said no<lb></lb>thing of it before the Magistrate—I might not think of it.</p>

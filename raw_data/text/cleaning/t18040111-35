               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was it not the prisoner's duty to assist about the Portsmouth mail-coach? - A. It was his place to push the coach out after it was unloaded; he had no concern in unloading the coach.</p>

Mastermans, bankers, in White-Hart-court, Lombard-street; I believe the prisoner is the person I changed ten Portsmouth notes for on the 24th of November, they were payable at our house; nobody was with him; I paid him ten ten-pound Bank of England notes, No. 2706, dated 4th of October; No. 7923, 11th of July; No. 3882, 17th of September; No. 8285, 12th of October; No. 5657, 5th of October; No. 3149, 9th of November; No. 6907, 15th of November; No. 9131, 20th of July; No. 5089, 11th of July; and No. 8485, 11th of November; for ten Portsmouth notes; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and believe him to be the man; I took notice of him, because on the same day a woman came with ten Portsmouth notes, and was asked what others she would have in exchange; she said, it was a matter of indifference; the clerk gave her one hundred notes, of one pound each, and desired her to count them, which she declined, although he pressed her to do it; she said, she dared to say they were all right; she went out, and no other person came in till the prisoner, about five minutes after, and tendered me ten of the Portsmouth Banknotes of ten pounds each; I thought it extraordinary that two persons should come to close together, having the same quantity of Portsmouth Banknotes; I asked him what notes he would have; he said, it was immaterial; I gave him ten ten-pounds.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110020"></xptr>From the vast number of notes we pay, we do not take person's names; it frequently occurs that sailors have a quantity of those notes, and I thought it possible the prisoner might be one, and I did not ask him his name. About half an hour afterwards, a gentleman came in, and asked me if I knew that a parcel containing Portsmouth Bank-notes had been lost; I said, no. In the course of the morning, Mr. Burrage came to stop them, and I told him I had paid ten of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The man coming with ten notes so immediately after the woman excited your attention? - A. Yes, it did very particularly.</p>

Yes: On Saturday the 30th of April, I saw the house; there were two coppers in the back kitchen fixed in the building; I saw them safe about half after six on Saturday evening; it is a house undergoing repairs; nobody lives in it; I left the house at half after six, and double-locked the door, and took the key with me; I returned about eight in the evening, and found the door on the single lock; going into the passage, I saw the back door open; I looked into the yard, and saw the shutters of the back kitchen window put back</p>
               <p>Q.At this time it was dark? - A. Not quite; I immediately went down into the kitchen, and found one copper taken out of the place in which it was set on the floor, immediately after I heard some noise at the foot of the stairs, and turning about I saw two men going up the kitchen stairs, the prisoner and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure one was the prisoner? - A.Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he been employed as a workman in the house? - A. He had not; I went up, and caught them on the kitchen stairs; I caught the prisoner as he ran up stairs, and conveyed him to the door till assistance came; the other got away.</p>
               <p>Q.When you unlocked the single lock, did you shut the door after you, or leave it open? - A. It was left open.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first saw them, they were coming up from the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then they could not have come in after you? - A. No, they must have come in before me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any instruments in their hands? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250050"></xptr>Q.Nor in the kitchen? - A. No; the prisoner was taken to St. Pancras watch-house; he was searched, and two parlour-door keys found upon him, and a knife; I believe that was all.</p>
               <p>Q.No key large enough to open the street-door? - A.No; there was a key picked up in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the men that ran up from the kitchen must have been in the house before you came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The house was under repair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There were workmen employed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not they received orders to remove the coppers? - A.They had not.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you last see this copper? - A.About six o'clock; it was fixed. I and the last witness left the house together; I saw him doublelock the door; I am certain we left nobody in the house; I did not return till about nine o'clock in the evening; then I saw the copper on the kitchen-floor.

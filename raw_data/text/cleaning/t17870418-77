             Ridley, a good hearty fellow; says he, we shall call on you to-morrow about this time, and bring him with us; on saying so, I looked on the other side of the chimney-piece where the watch was; the watch was hanging; says he, is there ever a coach-stand in this street; I told him there was; says he, I believe he would like to have the use of your front parlour for one or two mornings in a week; and he asked to see the parlour; I took him out to see the parlour; he approved of it; as we were coming out of the front parlour, I met the prisoner, whom I had left in the back room where the watch was; and they went away and bid me a good morning; I went into the back room again, and there was no watch, the watch was gone; I immediately recollected the watch was there when I went with the other into the front parlour, and left this prisoner in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. How long were you and the other in the front parlour? - About three months afterwards, I met the other prisoner; I took him, and he was tried and convicted here, at the sessions following, for stealing this watch, and being connected with the prisoner; I should have taken this man, but he ran into a house and made his escape out of the garret window; I happened since to meet with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. So this extraordinary fact happened on Good Friday, 1786? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You immediately went out to pursue them? - I did, and could not find them; I went down to Bow-street, and described the man and the watch; I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it, because you talk of believing? - I am not sure Sir, I know I went down to Bow-street that same day.</p>
               <p>Did you not immediately then of course describe the two men? - Yes, I believe I did give a description of two men; I did give a description.</p>
               <p>Was a part of their description, that they were very elegantly dressed? - I do not recollect that; Townsend was very well dressed; this man was not so well dressed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not a part of your description that these men were elegantly dressed? - I will not say that, I do not recollect that; I thought they had taken up a great deal of time in shewing the lodging, but they had not taken up much time since they looked at the watch.</p>
               <p>In July, you accidentally met with Townsend for the first time? - I did.</p>
               <p>No notice of him in consequence of your information from Bow-street? - No, it was accidentally; I fixed on him at a very great risque of my life.</p>
               <p>I believe you stumbled on this man too, in the street by accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to state to my Lord and the Jury, what was the first thing you said to him when you met him? - I was going on Dean-street; I thought he was the man, so I passed him and went to the opposite corner of Compton-street, and there I staid and viewed him, then I was sure; he saw me look at him; he immediately walked off to Green-street.</p>
               <p>My question is this, did not you say to this man, am I right or am I wrong; is not your name Wright? - No, I said to him, and I laid my hand on my shoulder, how do you do Mr. Wright? says he, my name is Cook; says I, it does not signify what your name is, I believe you are an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178704180077"></xptr>acquaintance of Mr. Townsend's, and you took an opportunity to take away my watch; he immediately said, he knew nothing about it; he went with me before the Magistrate, but very unwillingly; I was certain, though I said I believed.</p>

               <p>Pray, if it is not an impertinent curiosity, may I ask you what way of life you are in? - What way of life! I am employed by the board of navigation in making astronomical and nautical calculations for them.</p>
               <p>I rather think you attach yourself more to the study of the stars than mens faces? - That is no business of your's.</p>
               <p>I dare say if you had a question about the Georgium Sidus, you could resolve us? - I could tell you a great deal more about the Georgium Sidus than you know. Townsend was was found guilty on my charge, 39 s.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Taylor; on Good Friday, 1786, the prisoner at the bar and another man, came to our house to look at a lodging; I opened the door and acquainted Mr. Taylor; then I went down stairs, and in a little time after they came down stairs, the prisoner came into the middle kitchen where I was; there are three kitchens.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the same man? - Yes; I took very particular notice of him; I thought he did not look like a person that wanted a first floor; I am very sure it is him; he was very shabbily dressed, and he said that was a genteel kitchen, and every thing was very pretty and very convenient; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You thought these two people very impertinent in taking up so much of your master's time? - No.</p>
               <p>You thought they did not want a first floor; the other was not shabbily dressed? - Very genteel; this man was not very genteelly dressed.</p>
               <p>Have you never said they were both very genteely dressed? - I never said that.</p>
               <p>What other servant does Mr. Taylor keep? - He has none but myself; he has a wife.</p>
               <p>You are the only servant in the house? - There are other servants besides myself, but not belonging to Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in his service? - Almost three years.</p>
               <p>You came with him from the North? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You are the only servant he has? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see this man again for a twelve-month? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see me come to take a lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you had many people come to look for lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>How many short of five or six hundred? - Not half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Not in three years? - That is not surprising.</p>
               <p>It surprises me? - I am not surprised at all; - I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Was you as sure to Townsend? - Yes, I was; I swore positively to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

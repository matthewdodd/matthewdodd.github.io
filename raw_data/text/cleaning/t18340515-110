The prisoner came to lodge in our house about three months before Christmas; he left on New Year's Day - he hired the lodging weekly - he did not give notice that he would leave on the 1st of January - there was about two months rent due - he had agreed to pay nine shillings a week, but he said he would give me ten shillings, as he was rather more trouble than I expected - I missed a Bible, an account-book, a milk-pot, and a table-cloth, the morning after the prisoner was gone - they had been in his room - he hired them - I did not see them again till Wednesday last.</p>

            , twice - I do not know that it was treated at first as a case of unlawfully pawning - I found the Bible by means of this letter, which the prisoner sent to his wife, to send me the articles home that he might make his escape - it was in his wife's reticule which was dropped at the station-house - he lived with his wife at my lodging, but she is a very bad wife - she said she pawned the table-cloth - I went to the pawnbroker's, and saw it - I never speculated upon settling this matter for money, instead of treating it as a felony - I swear that solemnly - I did not say when I took the prisoner that all I wanted was, to be settled with for my rent, and the return of the articles - I told his wife the money would be of more service to me than to hurt any one - I did not desire her to get me the money - she said she would - I got 20s. of her - I did not mention that to the magistrate - she did not say any thing about any more - I went to one place with her to endeavour to get money, but we did not get any - she got a sovereign, and I received 20s. from her in about three hours after.</p>

No; but she had had the sovereign of me - she wanted to borrow 5s. of me, and I lent her a sovereign - I went to another place with her, but I did not go in - I wanted to pay my rent - she had two or three pounds at a time of me.</p>

             (City police-constable No. 61). I went to take the prisoner on Monday last - he made his escape through the window - I lost him till Tuesday, when I received information he was at No. 5, Coldbath-fields - I went there, but he got into No. 6 - I found him behind the door - he said he would walk quietly, but I got a hackney coach - I found in the bag this letter addressed to his wife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In consequence of having no friends in town, as my father died the night before last, I can only produce documents to my character since I was in his Majesty's service in 1810. I was then in the Mediterranean with Lord Exmouth. I was in three or four actions during the war; and in 1823 I received a medallion from the king of Portugal. I then entered the Greek service, and came home in 1829. I then married Miss Biggs, and understood her father was to give me some property; but I found he was a bankrupt. I made great exertion to get into a situation, but without effect. I did not intend to rob the prosecutor, and I wrote that letter to say that directly it was in my power, I would pay her that, and every thing belonging to her.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it your duty to make out a list of the bills that are to be sent out on the following day - A. On the 7th of February, I had a number of bills given to me to arrange for the clerks that are sent out; on the following day I deliver the prisoner his bills, here is the list I delivered it to him, (produces it.) There was a bill upon Greenwood and Co. for eighty pounds. After I had listed them, I counted them, on the evening, I put them into a drawer; this list contained the bill upon Greenwood and Co. for eighty pounds, I delivered him this bill among the others on the 8th of February, it was his duty to collect them. He came in on the 8th, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100022"></xptr>one and two o'clock; I examined his list, and found that all the payments were right; the bill of eighty pounds of Greenwood's, is scratched out; I have nothing to do with this scratch out. I was present when he discharged the of the bill he had in the morning. Mr.

             that is my name. The prisoner was an out-door clerk; his duty consisted in receiving the bill and cashing them. On the 8th of February, he came home between one and two o'clock, as near as I can recollect; I asked him where his list was, that he had been out with in the morning; he produced his book, which contains the accounts of that day so far as concerned the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it contain the eighty pounds of Greenwood - A. No, it does not; this is his bill list. In this list given him in the morning, the sum of eighty pounds is scratched out. When I saw this bill of Greenwood's not accounted for; I asked what he had done with it, he replied, it was due on the 10th of that month. There were two other bills that were returned; he gave no account of them. The bills speak for themselves; they were put into the box. I supposed the eighty pound bill to have been an undue bill, and to have been put into the box, in order to have been taken out again on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had you any suspicion of the prisoners dishonesty - A. None at all. I took what he said, for granted, and did not go down, and look at the box.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that occured, the prisoner left your service and house - A. He did; in consequence of which, I made enquiry at Greenwood's about the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill - A. This is the bill; the signature is the prisoner's own writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended -

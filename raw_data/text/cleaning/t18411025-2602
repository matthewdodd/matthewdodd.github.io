(<hi rend="italic">A prisoner.</hi>) I am sixteen years old, and have been in gaol since the Magistrate committed me—I was in the service of Mr. Benjamin Robinson, in Little Britain—I was working in the farriery—I know Clark—my master had some nails for securing the shoes of horses at his farriery. On the 23rd of September I took 43lbs. weight of my master's nails to Clark—I know there was 43lbs., because I weighed them—the nails were kept in a loft at my master's—there was one sort of nails, and three sizes of the sort—I took them wrapped up in some tow, from one to two o'clock in the day—I had been to Clark once before with an old man—when I got there on the 23rd of September I saw Couch, who is a man who Clark keeps—I told him I had brought some nails—he said I was to wait till Clark came in—Clark was out—I waited an hour and a half—when he came he told Couch to go and weigh them—when Couch came back he told Clark there were 43lbs., and Mrs. Clark said I must take 4lbs. off for the wrappers—Clark gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Couch took the nails</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk to Mr. Benjamin Robinson. On the 1st of September I received three bags of nails, called sixes, sevens, and eights—they weighed 5cwt. 1qr. 17lbs. —they were put in a loft over the farrier's shop—in consequence of information I examined and weighed them on the 29th of September—there were 2cwt. 2qrs. deficient, besides what we had used, which I suppose was about 1cwt.—in consequence of suspicion I questioned Barber, and he made a disclosure to me on the sub<lb></lb>ject of these nails—in consequence of what he said, I weighed 20lbs. of the nails, we had left, and marked about fifty of them—we gave the nails to Barber to take as he used to do—I and a policeman whom I had sent for, went in plain clothes, and followed Barber—he went to Clark's shop between three and four in the afternoon—he waited about an hour and a half—I saw Clark go in a few minutes previous to Couch coming out to weigh the nails—he took them to a chandler's shop directly opposite where we were waiting—in five or ten minutes after Couch returned to Clark's shop, Barker came out—he gave the officer 4s,—we then went into the shop—the officer pointed to the nails and said, "I have come about these nails"—Clark said to the man in the farrier's shop, "You make haste and shoe my horse"—the officer then told Clark he must go along with us—when he got outside, and saw we were determined to take him, he en<lb></lb>deavoured to make his escape, and said he knew nothing about the nails—on the following morning I examined the back wall at Clark's shop—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250047"></xptr>
               <p>the wail was very much scratched on Clark's side—they were such scratches as would be made by a parcel of nails being got up and thrown over the wall, they appeared quite fresh, and by the side of the wall on Clark's side I found one nail, and three nails on the other side—they were the same sort as belonged to my master—since then 2cwt. all but 12lbs. of nails, have been produced by Mrs. Twigg, which are of the same descrip<lb></lb>tion and size as my master's—I believe them to be his property, and they and the others which have been found make up nearly the amount we lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you found these marks on the wall, were the prisoners in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when Clark was taken, I should say he was not sober—he was not so much in liquor but that he knew what he was about—he did not say that the premises were not his—I should not have taken him to be Clark.</p>

I missed six planes, six saws, and a Dutch clock, which I had left in my shop on Friday evening, the 23d of December. I do not live there - it had been fastened with a padlock and a common lock; I went next morning, and found the lock had been wrenched, and the padlock taken away; I saw part of the property on the Saturday evening at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Howse, a pawnbroker, of High-street, Bloomsbury. I have two saws, pawned on the 24th of December, in the morning - the hand-saw by the prisoner, and the other by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons come to your shop in a day? A. Perhaps 150; I could not know them all, but I took notice of the prisoner - he has a cast in his eye, which I noticed - I swear he is the man; I think it was about eleven o'clock - they were pawned in the name of John Brown.</p>

            . I live in Lawrence-lane. The prisoner was there all day on the 24th of December, till four o'clock in the evening - he did not lodge with me, but he was there all that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who keeps the house? A. A person named Grant. I keep my own room - the prisoner sometimes lodged with his father and mother, and sometimes he would be with me for a week together. On the 24th of December he got up about nine o'clock, and breakfasted about ten - he staid with me all day till four o'clock, and came again about seven in the evening. No one told me to attend here, but I saw his name up against the door, and I came in. I do not know what time the shop was broken open; I never heard of it; I am an unfortunate girl - I do not know how I know it was the 24th of December that he was there.</p>

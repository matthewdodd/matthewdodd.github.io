                  </hi>. I am superintendant of the police of the Great Western Railway. I remember the loss of this box—it was not heard of till the last fortnight—the prisoner left the service soon after the box was lost—I heard of the stoppage of this crape at Grout's—I went in search of the prisoner, and found he was employed at the Penitentiary—about eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th of Nov. I went there in a cab, but did not find him—as I was driving away I saw him about a quarter of a mile off—I drove up and said to him, "Rowland, what are you doing? you were absent from the Pe<lb></lb>nitentiary last night; you are wanted there"—he said, "I suppose it is you that want me"—I said, "I do; you must consider yourself in custody for having stolen a box from the station last Feb."—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I took him into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I called at the Penitentiary to let them know that I had him; then took him to the Police-court—as we were going, he asked if I had got the people in custody with whom he was lodging—I said, "No; I wanted to apprehend the man, but he warout of the way"—he said, "Ah, if you had got them they would be no use to you; they know nothing about it"—I had not said anything to him about the lodgings or the people—I cautioned him, that whatever he said to me would be used as evidence—he replied, "I will say no more."</p>

I remember Pain and Mills bringing these things—I appointed them to come again—they left the parcel, and brought some more on the Monday, and were taken—these crapes are in an unfinished state, and are not marketable—some of them have been scalded, and others dyed black.</p>

                  </hi>. I was warehouseman to John and James Baylis and Co., in Gutter-lane, in Feb.—I had been with them since the 7th of Jan., and left in June—they were in the habit of receiving crapes in an unfinished state from Mr. Hardisty, by the Great Western Railway, twice a week—they came in a box, which was returned—this invoice arrived by the post on Saturday, the 18th—the box it referred to never came to hand—I never remember, during the course of business from January to June, any instance of any goods not coming according to the invoice, or any loss, with this exception—Baylis and Co. never disposed of any articles in this state—I have looked at all the marks on this invoice, with reference to the marks on these goods, and they correspond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrate. I attended the first examina<lb></lb>tion of the prisoner—he made a statement, which I took down and read over to him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Seven weeks ago last Sunday the crape was sent to me tied up in a parcel; it was directed to me at No. 3, Lambeth-square. The man rang the bell; I went and answered it; he asked me if there was a man named Rowland lived there; I said, 'Yes, I am the person, what have you got there?' he said 'There is a parcel for you.' I asked where it came from; he shut the door, and walked away. I did not know who the crape belonged to; I never saw the man before or since. I took the crape up stairs, put it into my box, and turned the key on it. I went to my situation on the Monday morning, and have not seen the crape since till now."</p>

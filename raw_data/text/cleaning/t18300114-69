            . I live at No. 5, Pleasant-buildings. I saw this property safe in the room the same evening - here is a coat, a pair of trousers, and a shirt, belonging to me; I am a shipwright - I missed the things about eight o'clock, and found the room had been entered by a skeleton-key.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BELL. I am a Police-officer. At six o'clock in the evening of the 1st of January, I stopped the prisoner with these things; I asked where he got them - he said he was taking them from his mother's, in Somer's-town, to his sister's, in Old-street - I left him in the possession of an officer, and went to Old-street-road, but could find no person of the description he gave; I found on him fourteen keys, five of which are skeletons - one of them is the same size as the key of this room.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Holborn, and between Brook-street and Hatton-garden, I met a young woman, the daughter of a landlady with whom I used to live; I spoke to her - a young man came up, asked me to carry a bundle to the 
               <persName id="t18300114-69-person559">George</persName>
             the Fourth, Cloth-fair, and he would give me half a crown; I went on to Hatton-garden Office to get an affidavit of a waistcoat signed, but was too soon; I was going down Mutton-bill, and met the officer - I did not give him a satisfactory answer at first; I then told him if he would go to the George the Fourth he would find the person, but he refused.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BELL. He said he had them from his mother's in Somer's-town.</p>

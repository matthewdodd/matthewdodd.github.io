I enquired for them. My wife described a woman and a girl that had been in the shop so well, that I thought I could find them; I went to Billingsgate, and from thence to Rag-Fair, and applied to all the pawn-brokers I could think think of; the next day a pawn-broker from Hounsditch sent for me, there I found one pair of stockings and Margaret Bush. I sent for a constable and took her into custody, and had her before my lord mayor ; I knew she was neither of the persons that my wife described, so I let her go about her business, and sent my girl to see-which way she went, she followed her and returned and said she saw her over the bridge, and go into Ax and Bottle-yard in the Borough. I went over and sat in a publick house over-against that house, where she went into, but could not meet with her; the next morning. I went again and got intelligence where to find

I was in town on the 24th of August, and became acquainted with the prisoner - I am a stranger in London; he showed me about town - we went to Bartholomew-fair on the 6th of September; a disturbance took place, and he lost his hat there - in consequence of that he went home with me to No. 2, <placeName id="t18300916-153-crimeloc799">Shepherd's-market</placeName>

            . I am a Police-officer. Cunninghame brought the prisoner to the watch-house with this box; I asked who it belonged to - he said it did not belong to him, but the contents of it did, or part of them; I asked what part - he said a watch, with a chain, two seals, and one or two keys, or two keys and one seal (he was not positive which) suspended to it; I asked when he had wound the watch up or worn it - he said on the Sunday previous; I put the box to my ear, and hearing a watch tick inside, I asked him for the key; he said in consequence of a fall out with his friend he had come away without it; I found a key to open the box - it contained the articles stated; a card of Curtis' was in the box, and I detained the prisoner; I went to Curtis' lodgings, found the street door open and his bedroom door - I awoke him, and brought him to the watch-house - I found a silk handkerchief round the prisoner's neck, a pair of shoes on his feet, and one stocking, which Curtis claimed - I do not know Goldfinch's Christian name.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner in Shepherd's-market, at a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, with this box under his arm - I asked where he was going; he said to the other side of the market to work, for he had a shop there, and was a tailor - I said, "I do not know you;" he said, "Then you must be a stranger here;" I let him go; but as he turned down a street and ran, I followed and secured him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Curtis in the Quadrant - he asked me to go to the fair, which I did; he said he had been obliged to leave Bristol at an hour's notice, and would be obliged to me to pledge his watch for him in the morning; I said Yes - we drank a great deal in the fair, and were very tipsy; as we came home, I was insulted in Holborn by a man, and lost my bat - I could not get into my lodgings; he said I might as well go and sleep with him, and I could pledge the watch in the morning; I went and made a noise at the door, being in liquor; we had a few words - I said I would not stay with him; he said, "Nonsense, come in;" I went up, but said I could not stop till morning as I was such a dirty figure - I should leave before day-light, and would take the watch, and bring him the money by nine o'clock; he said, "Be sure you come by nine;" I got up - it was rather dark; I put on his handkerchief and shoes by mistake; I understood nothing but the watch was in the box, and I took it to pledge.</p>

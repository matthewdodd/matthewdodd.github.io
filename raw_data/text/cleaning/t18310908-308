On the 2nd of July I left the brew-house, at half-past ten o'clock, and was going home; I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger to me - she said she wanted me for a few minutes; I said, "What do you want me for?" she slipped her hand into my right-hand trousers pocket, and took out a sovereign - I had not spoken three words to her; I felt her hand in my pocket, and as she was pulling it out I seized her arm - she slipped the money round to another girl behind; I know it had been safe not two minutes before - I then gave her in charge -4s. 41/2d. was found on her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FURLONG. I am a Police-officer. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for taking a sovereign out of his pocket; she was trying to get from him.</p>

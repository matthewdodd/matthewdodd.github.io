                  </hi>. I am a constable. I went to the Harp, in the Edge<lb></lb>ware-road, on the 6th—I found Hanson there with a bundle, containing one pair of trowsers, one pair of stockings, one knife, two thimbles, one half-crown, and two shillings—these have been shown to the prosecutor—I took Hanson into custody—he went about a mile on the road, and then he said, it was no use going any further; if I would go to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Parish's, I should find the remaining part of the things, which Parish bought for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the night before—I put him into the cage, and went to Parish, who keeps a booth in the fair—I there found the coat, waistcoat, boots, hat, and two silk handkerchiefs; I said, "There is another handkerchief, "he directly gave the other constable the other handkerchief.</p>

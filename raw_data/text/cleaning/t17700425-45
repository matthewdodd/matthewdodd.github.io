            . On the 10th of April I happened to be with an acquaintance; I staid late, and was locked out of my lodging. I met the prisoner in the Strand; she persuaded me to go with her to her lodging; this was about twelve at night. I went with her to the corner of <placeName id="t17700425-45-crimeloc293">White-hart-yard, by Catharine-street</placeName>

I had my watch and money in my breeches when I went into the house. I put my watch-chain into my pocket, and felt my half guinea in my pocket, when at the foot of the stairs. I did not pull my clothes off, only my shoes, but lay down on the bed with her. In the morning as soon as I awaked, I missed my watch and money; this was about nine in the morning; she was lying on the bed by me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Medley. I was a little disguised in liquor; I did not feel her pull my watch away. I awaked her, and taxed her with taking them; she said, she knew nothing of it. I searched the bed, and searched her, but could not find any thing; but the same day I found it pawned at the corner of Half-moon-street. Then I got a warrant and took her up; and before Sir

She said, a young man had been with her all night, and he had no money; and he had left it with her, and desired she would pawn it for a guinea. I went and pawned it at Mr. Brown's, and gave her the duplicate. (The watch produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.) I think this is the same watch.</p>

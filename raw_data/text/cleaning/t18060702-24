Yes, they were both sitting in the tap room, I was standing in the passage, I saw him take the money out, and he dropped two shillings on the floor; when he took his hand out of his pocket I told him then that the young man was picking his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable of Hackney. The prisoner and the prosecutor were sitting together on the bench in the tap room, I saw the prisoner take a seven shilling piece out of his pocket and lay it on the bench, he took it up again and put it in his mouth; I had charged him with picking the man's pocket, and the people in the tap room threatened him, he took it out of his mouth; then Tom Stevenson took the money and gave it to me, some of the money was on the ground; as we were coming to town the next day, he said he did not think of doing what he had done five minutes before; he said that as he was going to have his hearing.</p>

             sworn. I am a hair-dresser by trade, I live with my mother at Hackney; I was down in the cellar, I heard somebody say there was a man picking another man's pocket; I came up and found a seven shilling piece lay on the bench, there was some silver and halfpence on the floor, I sent for a constable, and I delivered it to Mr. Carr. (The money produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear to money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you about you. - A. I had a seven shilling piece, three shillings, two sixpences, and fifteen halfpence, that is exactly the sum I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to Stevenson) Was not the man in liquor. - A.No, he had only two pints of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him drop any money on the floor. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of the charge that is alledged against me; instead of the prosecutor putting the money in his pocket, he kept it in his hands and dropped asleep, then it dropped out of his hands, I picked it up and put the seven shilling piece in my mouth while I put the other money in his pocket.</p>

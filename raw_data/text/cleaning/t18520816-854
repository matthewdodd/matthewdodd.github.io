                  </hi>. I live at Deptford, and am an upholsterer; the prisoner is my nephew. On 5th July I had occasion to leave home—I expected a customer, named Charters, to call to pay for some goods, and I told the prisoner if he called those were the goods, and he was to receive the money on delivering them—they came to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I came home in three or four hours—the prisoner was not then in the shop—I saw him in about half an hour, and I said to him, "Mr. Charters has been and had the goods, where is the money?"—the prisoner said he had not paid for them—I said, "You have not delivered the goods without receiving the money; you have got the money, and if you have been out and spent any of it give me what you have got"—he refused to do so, and rushed by me out of doors—I looked after him that evening and night, and found him in a state of intoxication—he has not accounted to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mrs. Dadd—it was his duty to have entered it in a book, and have given it to me—the goods were not entered, and I did not know that Mrs. Dadd had had them.</p>

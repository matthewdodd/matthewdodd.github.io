                  </hi>. I live in Frederic-place, Mile-end, and am a boot and shoe-maker. On Friday, the 2nd of February, just about midnight, I was a little elevated, and met the prisoner just past Mile-end turnpike—I had been with my brother the best part of the afternoon—I was passing—the prisoner seized me from behind—she began to talk very quickly to me—I listened to her, and walked home to her house—she did not ask me to go—I went quietly on—I think she took me to No. 1, Little Collingwood-street, up stairs—I was there, I suppose, three quarters of an hour—I only gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to get a pot of porter and a pipe of tobacco—I had a sovereign and a half-sovereign, wrapped up in a <hi rend="italic">£</hi> 5 note, in my fob, under my watch—I was on the bedstead—I felt the prisoner's hand at my watch, as I thought, and I put my hand down, and the watch fell into my hand—I said, "What is this, how is this?" and immediately I was left in darkness—I suppose it was the prisoner's hand that pulled my watch out—the waistband of my trowsers had become unbuttoned—I judge that was by the operation of the prisoner—the braces were not undone—I missed my money, I suppose a quarter of an hour after she got the pot of beer and the pipe—I did not charge her with stealing it—she was too quick in going away, and leaving me in darkness—I went down to the street's end, and requested a person to tell the first policeman, and in a minute a policeman came to me—I told him, and he knew the prisoner, and knew her residence—I went to the station soon after, and the prisoner was brought, and said, "If you will give me the change, I will tell you where the£5 note is.</p>

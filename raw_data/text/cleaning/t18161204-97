            . I am a constable. I was in Crown-court, Cheapside, on Sunday night, the Ist of December, about half past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner tying the things up in two or three aprons. I asked him what trade he was; he said, he was in the coach line, and that they were his own. I suffered him to bring them out of the court, and when he came to the corner of Queen-street I saw the watchman, and then took hold of the prisoner. He threw down the bundle, and made a blow at me, and got out of my grasp. The watchman, whose name is Taylor, ran after him, and secured him. I secured the bundle, and picked up some more tools which he left behind in his hurry to tie them up. When he was taken to the watch-house, he had some more tools in his pocket, and three old keys; the keys will not fit any part of the premises. I learned, the next day, that the tools belonged to Mr. Wilson. The prisoner said afterwards, that he was hired to carry them, by a person in St. Paul's Church Yard, for one shilling, to East Smithfield. They were claimed by the several persons who have seen them to day.</p>

I took one of them; he walked faster than me. As I was coming down Cheapside the watchman stopped me, and said, he suspected me. I threw them down, and endeavoured to escape.</p>

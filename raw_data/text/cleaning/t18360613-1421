                  </hi>. I live at Kensall-green, with my father and mother. I was walking in the Harrow-road, between six and seven o'clock, on the 10th of May, alone—it is about ten minute's walk from my house—I had a bag in my hand, which contained the articles stated—this is it—it was on my arm—there was a man walking a few yards before me—he stopped till I passed him—he then came round to the other side, and pulled my bag—I held it for about two minutes, and then let it go—he pulled the bag, and I held it against him, and that pulled me across the road—we were about two minutes together—I cannot say I should know</p>

I am a carpenter, and live in Wattt's Mews, John-street, Edgeware-road, At half-past six o'clock that evening I was coming from Kensall-Green towards London—on the banks of the canal—I passed the prisoner on the bank, going from London, I had seen him numbers of times before—after I had passed from eighty to a hundred yards, I turned round, and he was struggling with a lady for her bag—he pulled her across the road—there was no one near, except myself and an old gentleman—he succeeded in getting the beg, and I ran across the fields after him she was as hard as he could—I cried, "Stop thief"—I perceived two labourers running in the field to the right of me—the prisoner was making an angular direction—these men ran after him by my crying out, and of them came near him, and he threw the hag away—I am able to swear he is the man who was struggling with the lady and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Marsden Green. I had been watering the roads at Kilburn, from six to seven o'clock in the evening—I was coming down the lane, and saw some persons running across the fields—the prisoner was a good way before them, with a little black bag in his first hand—I am sure he is the man—I ran after him—he dropped it—I picked it up, and delivered it up to Miss Pasquier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-chandler, and live at Wapping-wall, On the 5th of October, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to me and asked if Hill was in—I asked what he wanted—he said two bolts of canvas—I asked him what sort—he said he had a written order, which he handed to me, and it not being in the regular form, I said we did not do business with a person of that name—he said, "Yes, it is correct, we had a bolt of canvas on Friday, which I paid you for"—I referred to the book, and it was not the case—I said, "Wait a few minutes till the foreman comes in, I will inquire about it"—he said, "I will get a pint of beer, and return in a few minutes"—I went to the door, and watched that he should not go away—he returned in a few minutes, and asked if the foreman had come in—I said yes, and sent the foreman with him to St. Katherine's Dock to see if there was a ship named the <hi rend="italic">Tropic</hi>—I had never seen the prisoner before—(<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>)—"Mr. Hill, Please let the bearer have two bolts of canvas for the <hi rend="italic">Tropic,</hi> Captain Smith, lying at St. Katherine's Dock.

I went with the prisoner, by Mr. Hill's direction, to go to St. Katherine's Dock—on the way he said, "You had better have brought the canvas, it would save you the trouble of sending them afterwards"—I said I could bring them—when we got to Wapping church he wanted to turn down there—I said I must keep with him—when we got further he said, "Now you have come so far, you shall have a run for me"—he ran off—I pursued and caught him—he said if I did not let him go he would cut my hand off—I re<lb></lb>quested him to go with me to the station, which he did.</p>

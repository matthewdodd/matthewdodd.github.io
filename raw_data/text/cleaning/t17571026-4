               <p>Q. Did she lay at your house only one night?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. She lay there several nights, best part of a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master know that?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. No, but he saw her at work in the house. I missed a silver spoon of my master's on the 24th of July, but did not suspect her. After she was gone I missed my silk gown and a pair of jumps.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the house did you miss the spoon?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. From out of a closet in the kitchen, and my things from out of a garret where I lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took them ?</p>
               <p>M. Jones. They were found at Mr. Spencer's, pawn'd in her name, and I had them again on my paying for them.</p>

            . Mr. Baynham came to me and ask'd me if I had taken in a silver spoon, mark'd J. B. I looked in my book and said I had, but had delivered it again a few days before to Jane Hickey. There was 5 s. put down against it, which she had on it.</p>
               <p>Q When was it?</p>
               <p>Spencer. It was delivered on the 27th of July, and she brought it on the 23d. As I had deliver'd it I cannot swear to it now. The prosecutrix and Mr. Baynham's son came and ask'd me if I had ever a silk gown or jumps of any body's bringing. I looked, and found that on the 28th of July I had taken in such things of the prisoner. I went and brought them down, and the prosecutrix own'd them. She ask'd me what I lent upon them. I said I lent her 7 s. upon them, which she paid me, took them away, and has had them in her custody ever since. (The things produced in court.) As to the spoon, that which I h was like it, but I can't say this is it. The gown and jumps are like what I took in, and I believe they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the woman that brought the things you mention?</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to John Richard Morton. We missed a great deal of property, and I spoke to Perkins on the subject—I asked him for six brigate watch-keys, and a pair of cameo bracelets and comb—he said he knew nothing of them—he denied all knowledge of every thing I asked him about—on the 18th, he was taken into custody—I told him I suspected him of robbing me—Baylis the officer took a key from his pocket, and I proceeded with him to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house in Carter-street, Walworth, and found some property (<hi rend="italic">produc<lb></lb>ing it</hi>) I have examined the whole of this property, and in my judgment it is Mr. Morton's, some of them are marked—I find among it the cameo bracelets, and a pair of combs which I had particularly inquired of him about, but not the keys—there are some things I can positively swear to—in consequence of information I went to the Pantheon in Oxford-street—I found, on her stand, property to the amount of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I claim, that is here—there are articles of jewellery any things amongst</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280156"></xptr>
               <p>them—I can positively swear to these pencils with the name of Morton stamped on them, but most of them have the name partly erased—I told her these goods were in our warehouse within a month, and I was sure they had not been regularly sold—at least I had not seen any account of them—she said she could produce invoices that her husband bought them at Birmingham—I addressed her by the name of Standford, and she an<lb></lb>swered to that name—I told her who I was, and gave her my card—on my doing so, she said she did not know me—I had never seen her at my house, I had seen her at Carter-street, when I engaged Mr. Perkins, but had no conversation with her—I inquired she did not know Mr. Perkins? she said no, she did not, and said, "Who is Mr. Perkins?"—I told her he was a young person who went round to sell goods for Mr. Morton—she said the might have bought some, and might know such a person—I do not remember any thing more passing—here is the book in which it was the male prisoner's duty to enter what he sold—here is an entry of goods sold to Mrs. Stanford on the 31st of October—I found some articles at the stand corresponding with that entry—I left those things on the stand, and took possession of the rest, amounting to full 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take her into custody then—I went to Carter-street the same evening, but did not find her there—I went again the nest morning, and took her into custody there—the male prisoner was then in custody—I found an elderly man named Godfrey in the house, and found more property there of Mr. Morton's—when I first engaged the male prisoner he went there with us, and the female prisoner opened the door to us; she went by the name of Perkins there.</p>

Perkins, Carter-street, Wal<lb></lb>worth—she gave six references, but we did not inquire of either of them—I produce some articles, which were claimed by Mr. Morton.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you allow manufacturers to have stands in the Bazaar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we do—I have no doubt the persons in the Bazaar would deal with a manufacturer who had a stand there—I did not know Perkins at all—there was no concealment in the transaction—she con<lb></lb>ducted herself respectably while there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hay salesman, and am in partnership with a lady named Brown. On Thursday, the 4th of January, the prisoner came to me in Smithfield, and bargained with me for a load of hay, which was to come to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and according to agreement paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would send the rest by the man—the giving the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was his voluntary offer, not a demand made by me—I told him that when the man arrived with the hay he would ask for the remainder of the money—(it was to be delivered in Cromer-street)—he said the money should be sent back—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290033"></xptr>
               <p>I sent Thomas Tookey, the farmer's man, with it—he is not my own servant—I gave him directions to receive the money before he delivered the hay—he was not to come back without the money—the prisoner was aware of those directions—he did not hear them given, but I told him the man would ask for the money—Tookey left with the hay about half an hour after I sold it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the prisoner gave you the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., what did you say to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "The man will ask you for the rest when he arrives with the hay"—he said, "Very well, I will give it to him"—the prisoner was a stranger, which made me so particular—this was about half-past twelve o'clock—Tookey was not present at the time—I sent the hay—it was the property of myself and partner—we were answerable for the money—next morning I saw the prisoner at Battle-bridge, and said to him, "You have been swindling me out of this load of hay"—he replied, "I should have paid the man, but was disappointed in taking the money from that person," pointing to a person in the road.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say any thing to you about if? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he had lost the key of the place—I saw a few trusses of hay there—I said, "What have you done with it?"—he said he had sold part of it to a friend—I merely had a casual view of the place—I suppose I saw six or seven trusses there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carter to Mr. George Ellis. On the 4th of January I took this hay for the prosecutor to the prisoner's residence, as he represented—he took me to No. 108, Cromer-street, which is a beer-shop—that was the place to which I was originally directed to take it—I saw the prisoner when I brought the hay there—I asked him whether he had bought it, whether it belonged to him—he said "Yes"—he said "You must come along with me"—I gave him the bill—he did not ask me for it—it was for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a bill of parcels—he was to pay me that—when I gave him the bill, he said, "Come along with me"—he took me to Battle-bridge mews—I undid the ropes, and delivered the hay into the stable—there were thirty-six trusses—he took them into the stable himself—I then asked him whether he was going to pay me—he told me I must go up to Cromer-street again—I did so, and took the empty cart along with me—when we got there he went into the house—he went into the front door and came out again, and told me his wife was not at home, that she was gone to the other end of the town—I am quite sure he said his wife was not at home—I am sure he told me it was his wife—I told him it did not matter to me about his wife, I wanted the money—he said, "You must come along with me up Cromer-street, to go into Gray's Inn-lane, to my sister"—he told me to stop in Gray's Inn-lane—I did so, and he ran down the street, and came back to me, and told me his sister was not at home—I told him I wanted the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he must go back to Mr. Mason's with me, or else pay me then—he said, "Do you think Mr. Mason will doubt my word for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—I said, "Yes, perhaps he might"—he said I was to go up into Cromer-street with him again—he did not go all the way with me—he went about half-way up the street and then sent one of his men with me, as he called him, and said he would be back in about ten minutes—I went to No. 108, Cromer-street, and waited till half-past six o'clock in the evening—I went there about three o'clock—he never came back, and I went back to my master without the hay or money.</p>

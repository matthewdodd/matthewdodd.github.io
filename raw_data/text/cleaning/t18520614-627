                  </hi>. I am an officer of detective police. On Friday even<lb></lb>ing, 4th June, I was on duty with Brett in plain clothes—about half past 10 o'clock that evening I observed the three prisoners—Davis was standing in the middle of the road at the King William-street end of Cannon-street—she was talking to a gentleman, and Smith and Williams were standing about twenty</p>

               <p>yards off under a lamp post, looking towards them—the gentleman left Davis, and she went along King William-street towards the Bank—the two male prisoners crossed to the other side of King William-street, and followed Davis a short distance towards the Bank—Davis accosted another gentleman, and turned back with him to the corner of Cannon-street—she remained talk<lb></lb>ing to him there for about a minute, and Smith and Williams returned to the corner of King William-street opposite the corner of Cannon-street—as soon as the gentleman had left Davis, Smith and Williams crossed from the corner of King William-street, and stood talking with her for about a minute—they then went down Cannon-street to Neighbour's Tavern, into which they all three went—they remained in there about ten minutes, and they all three came out together—Davis went down King William-street, and Smith and Williams crossed over to the other side—we followed them for about an hour, during which time Davis accosted twelve or fourteen gentlemen, and upon all occasions Smith and Williams were within sight, keeping pace with her and stopping when she stopped, until they got to the corner of Bow-lane—at nearly half past 11, Davis there accosted the prosecutor, and went with him along Bow-lane as far as George-yard, and Smith and Williams crossed from the opposite side, and went up Bow-lane after Davis and the prosecutor on the same side—there is but one pavement there—Davis and the prosecutor stopped at the corner of George-yard—Smith stood about eight or ten feet from the corner of the yard in a doorway; I lost sight of Williams—I saw Smith and Williams go into Bow-lane—I still kept sight of Smith, but I lost sight of Williams—Davis and the prosecutor remained there between five and ten minutes; at the end of that time I heard a cough, and at the same mo<lb></lb>ment I saw Davis running from George-yard along Bow-lane into Bow Church-yard, at the corner of which I was standing—I went after her, and overtook her about half way through the Churchyard—I laid hold of both her hands, and said, "You have robbed that gentleman; what have you got?"—she said, "What do you mean? I have got nothing;" but finding she kept her left hand clenched, Iendeavoured to open it—she struggled very violently to prevent me, and in the struggle we both fell—she endeavoured, by kicking and biting my hand, and dragging my hand to her mouth, to pre<lb></lb>vent my opening her hand—at last I succeeded, and took this watch out of her hand, and this chain—the glass of the watch was broken, and one of the hands—on the road to the station she asked me what I wanted with her; I told her it was for stealing a gold watch—I took her to the station and left her with an officer, and I went back and found Smith and Williams were secured—I went back to the station and resumed the charge of Davis—I was not gone above half a minute—Davis was asked by the inspector where she lived, but she and Smith refused to tell—I found on Smith a gold ring and a door key, on Williams one farthing, and on Davis a key was found by the female searcher—before Davis accosted the prosecutor I had noticed him, and I saw a chain in front of his waistcoat—I passed at the moment she accosted him—when this watch and chain were shown to him he claimed them at once—I had seen the prisoner Williams frequently before, and I have an indistinct recollection of the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City. I was with Haydon on the evening of 4th June—I saw the three prisoners about half-past 10 o'clock at the corner of King William-street—I saw them all go into a public-house and come out again—I kept my eye on them till they got to Bow Church—I saw Davis stop a gentleman at the top of Bow-lane, which turned out to be Mr. Young, the prosecutor—she was in front of him, meeting him—she took him by the arm down Bow-lane—Smith and Williams were on the opposite side of Cheapside watching the female, and they crossed Cheap-side and walked down Bow-lane after them in company—Davis and Mr. Young turned into George-yard—I passed Smith and Williams in Bow-lane, and as I passed the end of George-yard, I saw Davis and the prosecutor standing in George-yard—I went on down Bow-lane into Watling-street, and round Queen-street into Well-court, which is the opposite entrance to George-yard—when I got to the commencement of George-yard, which is rather wider than Well-court, I saw Davis and Mr. Young standing in the same place where I had seen them when I passed down Bow-lane, and on my right hand side, in a dark corner of George-yard, the prisoner Williams was standing—I heard Davis cough, and at the same time I saw Smith come up to Mr. Young, the prosecutor—he appeared to speak to him, and appeared to detain Mr. Young by keeping him In conversation—he was standing in front of him—at the time Smith came up, Davis ran away—in fact she ran directly after she had given the cough—Smith came between Mr. Young and the direction Davis had run—Mr. Young must have gone out of his way to have got by Smith and have got into Bow-lane—I walked towards Mr. Young, and Smith; and Williams, who was following me up George-yard, came up to the side of me—I took hold of Smith and Williams—Russell, another officer, came up—I delivered them to him, and told him to keep them—Smith said, "What are you holding me for?"—I made no answer, but turned to the prosecutor and said, "You have been robbed, Sir"—he put his hand to his waistcoat-pocket and said, "Have I?"—I did not stop, but immediately Russell took Smith and Williams, I ran to see if Davis was in custody, and saw Davis and Haydon struggling on the ground—having seen Davis in custody, I went back and found Russell struggling with Smith, holding him against some shutters—in consequence of what Russell said, I ran down Bow-lane and saw Williams struggling with Mr. Young—I took</p>

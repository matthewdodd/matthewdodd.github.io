On the 9th of April I lost three half-crowns and two shillings; I felt it taken from me - the prisoner had hold of my arm at the time; she had asked me to take a walk with her, and I was going - I made some resistance when she took my money; part of it fell on the pavement, and a witness took the other from her hand.</p>

            . I am barman to Mr. Martin, in Church-street - I gave the prosecutor change for a half-sovereign - I gave him three half-crowns, one shilling, and two sixpences; he was in liquor, but not drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About ten o'clock, or half-past ten, the prosecutor met me and laid hold of my arm - he asked to go home with me; I said I was married and my husband was at sea - he then took me to that gentleman's house and called for a quartern of rum; he gave me one glass - he called for another, and wanted me to drink the whole of it; he came out and asked if he could get a bed, saying he had plenty of money to pay for it - he took his money out and showed it, and dropped it - I called the officer and said he had dropped some.</p>

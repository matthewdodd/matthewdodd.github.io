               <p>Charles Steward. On Michaelmas Day, between 2 and 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, I was sitting in my Kitchen, and heard the Hatch make a Noise; I went to the Door, and saw the Prisoner turning up the Street, with something in his Apron; I stepped into the Parlour, to see if I had lost any thing, and came out again immediately, and ran after the Prisoner: Coming into the next Street, I got Sight of him; he turned under a Gateway, and some Neighbours went before him, stopped him, and found the Cloaths upon him. When I came up to him, I asked him, how he came by them; he said, a Gentleman had given them to him to scower; but there was no body at all on that Side of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150004"></xptr> Way, between him and me. Before the Justice he was search'd, and the Castor found upon him.</p>

            . I met the Prosecutor in Albermarle-Street , almost out of Breath; he told me he was robb'd, I pursued the Prisoner, and took him. We carried him before a Justice, he was there searched, and the Castor we found concealed between his Breeches and his Skin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Swan. We lodge in Play-house-yard, in the parish of St. Luke—my husband is a brush-maker—on the 15th of Feb, I went to the Spotted Dog, in Tottenham-court-road—I had my child with me, which is now in my arms—his name is John Swan—I sat down in front of the bar—in a few minutes the prisoner cane in and sat down by the side of me—I had then drank about half of my ale—the prisoner said, "You have a baby"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "How old might it be?"—I said, "It will be three months old on Monday week"—she looked at it—I told her it was a boy—she said,'" Pretty little fellow, he don't look so old"—she then said she had a sister who lived at No. 15, London-street, who had got a very hard place, and that she was going to leave that night, that the mistress she lived under was a very severe, cross old lady, and she said would I be so kind as to call and tell her sister she was waiting for her—I told her I did not mind—we then came out of ttte Spotted Dog and walked down to London-street—she then asked me if I would have part of half a quartern of rum—I said I did not mind—we went to the Globe and called for the run, which she paid for—she poured me out a glass which I drank—she refused drinking her part, and said sfee would let it be till I came back—I then said, "I will go to your sister and deliver the message"—she said, "I will hold the baby till you come btck,"—I said, "No, I will take the baby with me, as it is such a little distance," but she put out her bands and took the child out of my arms—I went to the house to which she directed me, and inquired for the name she told me to ask for—when the gentleman came he told me I was wrong, that there was no servant going to leave that night—I came back to die public-house, and the prisoner was gone and my baby—I went directly to the station, and told the inspector—I described the prisoner and the clothes she had on, and also my baby—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 19th of March, when I was crossing from Soho to come into Crown-street, about nine o'clock at night—the prisoner was crossing to meet me—we met face to face—she stood and looked at me—I stood, I could not speak, I was so flurried—she looked at me again and then she ran—I chased her through several streets—she was exhausted with running, and I caught hold of her by her shoulder—she said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "You are the woman that robbed me of my baby"—she straggled to get from me and said, "You wretch, you are wrong, I have got no baby"—there was a little boy standing by, about twelve years of age—I said, "My good boy, will you look for a policeman?—there were three women standing there—I said, "Women, women, for God's sake help me to hold this woman, she is the woman that robbed me of my baby a few weeks ago"—they never offered to assist me, and the prisoner struggled and got from me—she ran up a court and I saw no more of her that night—I went to the station and gave information that I had seen her—on the 21st of March I went again to the station—an officer went with me up and down the streets, and at last we went to a house in Crown-street, which I think is No. 28—I went up two pair of stairs, knocked at the room door, and asked for the name they had told me to ask for—the prisoner opened the door—she said, "There is no such person lives here; get out," and shut the door in my face—I called up the constable—he went into the room, and I went behind him—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070156"></xptr>
               <p>said to me, "You wretch, what do you want?"—I said, "My baby; you are the woman that stole it"—she said, "I have got no baby but my own"—the constable asked her if she had got a baby—she said, "Yes, on the bed"—he said, "I must look at it"—he looked at it and said to me, "Mrs. Swan, come and look if this is your baby"—I looked and knew my baby directly—I said, "My God, that is my baby! O you hussey, for robbing me of my baby"—it was this baby which I have now in my arms—the prisoner offered to strike me, but the officer stood before me—she insisted on my leaving the room—I did so, leaving the constable in the room and the baby—I saw the prisoner was such a desperate woman that I thought she would either kill me or my baby if I offered to touch it—the constable called to me and said, "Mrs. Swan, you must go down to the station and fetch another constable," which I did—they then told me to go to the station and they would bring the woman—when I got there the prisoner came and brought my baby with her—the inspector asked her where she had lain in—she told the day of the month that she left her home, and that she had lain in at Mrs. Sullivan's—they made every inquiry and found it was wrong—this was on Good Friday, and on next day my child was given up to me—I only know the child by its features—on the day I found the prisoner out, I found the bed-gown, the little shirt, and two rollers which my child had on when the prisoner took it from me—I can swear to the clothes—these are them—they have been washed since I lost them—this is the gown the prisoner had on at the time she stole the child—this gown was hanging be<lb></lb>hind the door in her room when she was taken—it was about half-past nine at night, on the 15th Feb., when I lost my child.</p>

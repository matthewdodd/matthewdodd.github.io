                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you know he has borne a bad character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—he has always been a free-hearted sort of roan to his wife and family, and as to me he has never been dishonest—a person named Phillips was with at on the night in question—I saw him at the gardens—I met with him there—there was some one in his company—I believe it to be a person named Bar<lb></lb>ton—he was with Phillips when we met with him—I saw them when I first entered the gardens in the bowling-green, and from there went with them into the concert-room—I had met the prisoner on the 2nd of May near the Great Wes<lb></lb>tern Railway—he was with me when we met Phillips and Barton—he accom<lb></lb>panied me down, and we all four went into the concert-room—we did not go in together—I and the prisoner went in first—the others came in after us—I cannot say exactly how long after—it might have been within half or three quarters of an hour—I sat in the concert-room the whole evening, and so did Phillips, Barton, and the prisoner—I was smoking a pipe, and drinking half-and-half—our party drank half-and-half in the concert-room—I was not before the Magistrate when the prisoner was committed—I think I was first asked to come here as a witness last Sunday evening—I live about two miles and a half from the prisoner—I was not one of Weymouth's witnesses to character, nor in court at his trial—I knew him well—I never saw the prisoner and Weymouth together—I knew Weymouth by business transactions—I swear the prisoner was in my company on the 2nd of May from six o'clock till twelve—I believe Phillips and Barton are here to speak to that—I do not know that any of the waiters are here that Waited on us—I have not brought anybody out of our party—I do not remember any of the performances of that evening—there were songs—I believe comic songs—there might be two or three, within the lapse of the time—we all went away from the place together—not all four of us—I am not sure whether Phillips did not go first—I am certain three of us went together—we left as near twelve o'clock as possible—I am a coachman's journeyman—I formerly worked for James Pindar—I am at home now, living with my friends—my father is a coachmaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are out of employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I met the prisoner made the Great Western Railway, in pursuance of an appointment to go lot the Bayswater-gardens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been on the look-out for work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had—I have made a great many applications at the Great Western Railway, being introduced by the foreman there, but have not succeeded—I paid my part for the enter<lb></lb>taiment, as far as my means would allow—we all four drank together at one time, and two were in their own company at one time—we got into the con<lb></lb>cert-room about six or seven o'clock, and stopped there six hours—I was not continually drinking—I do not think what I paid exceeded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the concert began somewhere near eleven—there was singing going on before that, and stage performances, for six hours, as near as I can say—I was never in the house before—I have been since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you meet him at the concert-room on the 1st? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 1st we walked down there about seven or half-past, and staid, as near as I can say, till eleven or twelve at night—I had met him in the Edgeware-road—he said he had a horse at home lame, that he was very much distressed, and he should endeavour all he possibly could to have his son to manage his affairs, and he to apply for an omnibus situation—I left him in the Edgeware-road—I met</p>

               <p>him promiscuously in the Edgeware-road, and on that evening we made a proposition that we should go and have a walk round the Western Railway—I first met him about three or four o'clock—I did not remain with him till we went to the concert-room—we parted company, and agreed to meet at the concert-room that evening, and we met about six or seven—we had met on the 1st at the same place, and staid there till between eleven and twelve at night-Barton was not there on the 1st—he was on the 2nd, and Phillips too—Phillips did not come on the 1st, no one but the prisoner—the perform<lb></lb>ance and singing was similar to that on the 2nd—I cannot tell what the per<lb></lb>formance was—there was singing—I took greater interest in the songs than the performance—I have not the least idea what the performances were—I cannot remember the songs—parties came on the stage in character, and there was a party or two dancing in chains—that was a remarkable thing—I do not know whether that was the first or second night—we paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for admission—I had every reason to believe the prisoner was residing within a very short space of Maiden-lane bridge, where he had lived four or five years—the stand where he is said to have driven the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, is near King's-cross—the son usually put the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Portland-road, I believe, but the father used to put it on near Maiden-lane—he was in the habit of driving—the son was in the habit of driving at times in the day, and the father by night generally speaking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live sat No. 28, Nutford-place, Bryanston-square. I have known the prisoner between two and three years—I was with him on the evening of the 2nd of May at the Bayswater tea gardens—I did not see him come in—I met him accidentally in the gardens with two other parties, and afterwards saw him in the gardens—I have since heard the names of the parties—Rubridge was one—I never saw them before that night—I have seen them to-day—I have not seep Barton here.</p>

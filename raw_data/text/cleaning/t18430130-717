Q.</hi> How far is Rosemary-lane from the Minories? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The part I saw the van in is about 300 yards from the Minories—if I were going down the Minories to St. Katherine's Docks I should pass the end of Rosemary-lane—I was going home to my dinner—there is a turning out of Rosemary-lane which leads to St. Katherine Docks, but it is no thoroughfare for carts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master carman, and live in Breezers-hill, Ratcliff-highway. I was in Rosemary-lane on the 24th of Dec., about one o'clock—one of Vestey's vans met me—it had one horse—it contained a package something similar to this package which is here—the prisoner was driving it towards Sparrow-corner—that would be coming into the Minories.</p>

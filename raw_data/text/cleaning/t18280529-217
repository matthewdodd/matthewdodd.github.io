               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He left you on the 20th? A. Yes; he went out on pleasure I understood - he returned on the Monday, and said his absence was caused by illness; I said I should not take him again, and he went away; I saw him again a few days after at his lodgings, No. 27, London-terrace, Hackney-road; I did not say I was sorry I could not take him again - I have a person named Balding in my employ - he is here; I never knew of my servants selling goods to each other - he proposed to take the stock in November.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever authorize them to sell to each other? A. I authorized Balding to sell the prisoner twenty-four yards of gros de Naples, but nothing else - it has not been paid for; here is the stock-book - this piece is entered as cut, and not to be put with whole pieces.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the stock taken by him or you? A. By him; it was only of the Irish linen; I saw this Irish entered in the book, and might see the piece - it was marked when it came in, which was not twelve months ago; I had no other of that mark; the book is in the prisoner's handwriting - he states it to be on hand in November.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you quite sure you never authorized him to dispose of this linen? A. Yes.</p>

About this time last year I made up some millinery for the prisoner, and in February last he came with some - I worked for him till then; he said he lived with Mr. Edwards, and that in July Mr. Edwards was going to take him into partnership; that he had a large sum coming to him, and that Mr. Edwards had a warehouse in Cheapside, and allowed him part of it, and two days in a week to sell by commission: he brought me patterns of different articles to purchase; I gave him an order on the 10th of February for a whole piece of Irish, which I received; I cut part of it up, and the other is in possession of the officer - it was marked "No. 60, M.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you always given the same account of this transaction? A. Yes; I told the Magistrate that he said he was allowed to sell on commission; here is"No. 6" on the Irish - the letters are on the paper it was in.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in Cold Arbour-street, Hackney, on the 15th of May; he denied the charge; I said, "You recollect the linen and things you sold Mrs. Bowen?" he said, "I did; they were Mr. Edward's once, but I bought them of him."</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. I believe this to be my linen: this mark on it is my writing - the other goods are mine: I never authorized him to sell any of them - here is a remnant which matches the silk.</p>

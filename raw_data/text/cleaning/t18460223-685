                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Cradle-court, Red Cross-street—I knew the deceased, Martin—he was in St. Martin's workhouse—that was his last residence before he died—I know the prisoner—he lived in Cradle-court—I lived with him for two years and a half—I had not previously lived with him—I had previously lived with Martin, but not for above these three years—I did so for thirteen years, and had four children by him—the two last are living—we were compelled to separate, through being distressed, about three years ago—there was about twelve months interval between my separating from the one and living with the other—I was in the house myself—on Tuesday, the 17th of Feb., between ten and eleven, Martin came to No. 8, Cradle-court, where I was, to remove my things belonging to me—he first came on the Tuesday morning—I had told the prisoner on the Monday morning that I would not live with him any longer—Martin was assisting me in removing the furniture which was left to me by my uncle—Martin came again after that, and we went out together—it was about one o'clock, or I should say, between twelve and one when we came back—Martin remained there with Feacy, and we all three sat talking together—Feacy made an objection at first in the morning to my removing the things—that was the cause of our going out—in the afternoon I went out, between one and two, to look for a room to remove my things to, and Martin remained there with Feacy and their children—no one else—the elder child is nine years of age, and the other seven—I came back about two, I should think, or between two and three—I cannot say exactly the time—I found them both there—Martin had tied up the bed ready to be removed, and took it away to the lodging that I had taken, and I remained on the stairs—he came back again, and we went into the room, and then Martin began to undo the bedstead, and while he was doing so, I gave him a bed-winch out of the drawer—Martin said that would not undo it, and I went to see if I could borrow one, and when I came back Martin had undone the bedstead without it, and had tied it up partly, and while tying it up Feacy asked me about a shirt—it was a shirt belonging to my uncle—I was looking up the dirty things, and I picked up the shirt, and said to Martin, "This is one of my uncle's," and I said to Martin, "Never mind that; let him have that;" and I threw it down on the floor—Martin said, "Oh! he shan't have that;" and with that Feacy laid hold of it, and there was a struggle between the two—Martin twisted it out of his hand, and threw it on the floor, and with that Martin stooped to finish tying up the bedstead, and while he was stooping tying up the bed<lb></lb>stead, Feacy took the knife, and run it into his side—the knife laid on the table when he took it a few minutes before I saw it—the table was near to him, on the left-hand side of him—they were one on each side</p>

I am stabbed"—I run down stairs instantly to the landlady, in the bottom room, and said, "Oh! he has stabbed Martin"—my eldest son was there, and I said, "Run for the doctor," and he run for the doctor, Mr. Ponder, in Redcross-street—when I came back, I went up stairs, and the police had got the prisoner—the name of the deceased was Thomas Martin—he re<lb></lb>mained in the room till next day—I have seen him since his death.</p>

I am stabbed"—I told it to those in the house where I lived—I have said a great deal concerning it since the poor fellow has been dead—I said it to the landlady—she is not here—and to others—I was very much alarmed at the time—I ran down as fast as I could.</p>

I am clerk to the Magistrates of the City of London—I accompanied Mr. Alderman Farebrother to this place, No. 8, Cradle-court, Red-cross-street, on the day this occurred—I cannot recollect the day of the week—I found the deceased, Thomas Martin, there—the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate asked him, previous to my taking any depositions, what he considered to be his state—he said he did not consider he had many hours to live—he was in bed at the time—he said further that he did not expect he should have lived so long as he had—he presented the appearance of a person seriously ill—I should have said he could not have lived long—he presented that ap<lb></lb>pearance to me—Feacy, the prisoner, was in the room at the time—he was in custody—I administered the oath to Martin and took his deposition in writ<lb></lb>ing—it was read over to him in the Magistrate's presence, after I had written it—I asked him if he understood it—he said he did, and he put his mark to it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—"Thomas Martin, late an inmate of St. Martin's workhouse, says, I was discharged from there yesterday morning—I came here for two children of mine, by Susannah Emberson, now present, with whom I had lived for thir<lb></lb>teen</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and live at No. 54, Redcross-street, City. On Tuesday afternoon, the 17th of Feb., I was called to Cradle-court—I found Thomas Martin there—I saw him in the corner of a room lying onthe prisoner—Martin said, "I am the man that is stabbed, and this is the man who has stabbed me"—Martin then showed me a knife, and said, "This is the knife that has done it"—I then assisted the wounded man to a chair—the pri<lb></lb>soner was given into custody of the police—Martin became faint when sitting on the chair—I immediately laid him down—the faintness increased very rapidly, he became perfectly collapsed, the skin cold and damp, and the extremities, and without any pulse perceptible—after using means for resuscitation he gradually revived—a temporary bed was made for him, on which he was placed—I then examined the wound, after taking off the belt, which he had round him at the time—I found the wound as I thought, between the eleventh and twelfth, but I have since discovered it was between the tenth and eleventh rib—I had the assistance of another medical gentleman, Mr. Parnell, of Char<lb></lb>terhouse-square—we afterwards examined more minutely, and found that the wound passed obliquely downwards, probably to the extent of an inch, or an inch and a half—I could not exactly say at that time—I rendered him every assistance that could be done for him, and he was removed to the hospital next morning, about one o'clock—I superintended his removal, and took every care that his person should not be shaken in any way—I saw him every day after that, but the day on which he died, which was Saturday, about a quarter past eleven o'clock—I saw him when dead, on the Sunday, about two o'clock in the morning, in the dissecting-room—the wound did not penetrate the thorax—I said it did at the police-court, but I had an opportunity of cor<lb></lb>recting that afterwards—it was such a wound as might be produced by a weapon like that, and in my opinion the wound was the cause of death—I have not the least doubt of that myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

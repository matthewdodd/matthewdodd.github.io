                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the employ of Mr. Young, of West-square, St. Georges's. On the 2nd of Sept. I was working at a building in New-street, Bermondsey New-road—I went away to dinner at twelve o'clock, leaving my tools lying about—there were three baskets there, one of which was mine, but the tools were not in it—after I bad been away about half an hour, Green called us out of a public-house—I went back with him, and found the greater part of my tools in the basket, and in charge of Ashworth—there were six planes, a stock, and three saws—they were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—they are here—I never knew the prisoner.</p>

I will go back with you"—he did so—I unlocked the back door—he went into the building and put the tools down—Mr. Ashworth said to me, "Is it the men's tools he has got?"—I said, "I do not know, he seems to say they are his own"—"They are my own," the prisoner said—I said to Mr. Ashworth, "Do you know how many baskets the carpenters have got?"—he said, "Three large ones, and one small one"—I went into every room, and could only find two large ones and one small one—I said to the prisoner, "You had better stop till the men come from dinner"—he said, "I shall lose my job; I know where the men go to dinner; I will go and make it all right that they are mine"—he then left the tools in the building and said to Mr. Ashworth, "I will leave my tools in your charge while I go to the men, to satisfy them that the tools are mine"—the prisoner and I then walked off to the Com<lb></lb>passes, where the men dine—when we got nearly there he said, "You go in and tell the men to come out"—I said, "You had better come in with me"—he went with me. very near to the door, and took a pipe out of his pocket—he said, "Go in and tell them to come out"—I left him out<lb></lb>side and went in, tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and said, "I want you"—I then went out, and the prisoner was gone—I am quite cer<lb></lb>tain he is the man—he was dressed in a white flannel jacket.</p>

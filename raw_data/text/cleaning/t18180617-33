The man who quitted my left side crossed the street immediately-he turned back and began running. Suspecting him to be the person, I crossed the street, and pursued some way. He ran up Chancery-lane - I called Stop thief! he turned down Carey-street; he was some distance before me, several people pursued him, and he turned up Star-Yard. A gentleman said, "Let us go through the archway into Lincoln's Inn-he must come out on that side," which I did. Before he could get out of the inn I saw him stopped. He said he had no pocket-book of mine. I heard the mob say my pocket-book was found. I asked him for a letter which I missed, he denied having it. I am sure he (the prisoner) is the man who touched my coat on the left side, and crossed immediately-the other man was not taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I was attacked between Chancery-lane and St. Dunstan's Church. I saw the prisoner sufficiently to observe his person. His getting away in a hurry made me suspect him. I lost sight of him when I went up the gateway, and met him as soon as I got into the inn - I am sure he is the man. Hempel gave me my pocket-book.</p>

            . I am porter to the Society of Lincoln's Inn. I saw the mob running by the side of Star-yard, and heard the cry of Stop thief! by this time the mob had got by the fountain; I pursued-several gentlemen were there. The prisoner was stopped by Mr. Hawkins, at the end of the passage leading to Searle-street - he would let nobody pass. I followed, and laid hold of him; he turned round and said, "What do you want of me?" I told him there was a cry of Stop thief, and I thought proper to stop him. I brought him part of the way back into the inn. Mr. Barton came up and asked for his pocket-book - A man said he had got it. I took the prisoner to Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were more than twenty persons ran from Star-yard - They were above half way across the inn before I knew what was the matter. Nothing was found on the prisoner.</p>

On the 18th of May the prisoner came and hired a weekly lodging at my house; he lived with his mother, but slept at my house for three nights; he then absconded, and the same day, we missed the property stated from a drawer in the room he had slept in - I am sure it was all safe when he came to sleep there; we did not see him again till last Saturday week, when he was in custody; no other person could have taken the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I went down in the morning, did you not go up directly and lock the door? A. I did; I missed the cap about three hours afterwards - I have a man and his wife who have lodged with me for five years; they have not a key of the room you slept in.</p>

On the 23rd of October, I took the prisoner; I said, there was a charge against him for felony in Bethnal-green; he denied all knowledge of it; I read the charge over to him, and asked if he knew a person named Clark; he said, "Yes," but denied all knowledge of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went out that day and met a young man who asked me to go into the country; I went with him, and then to some friends of mine at Royston. I staid there till my friends sent me word there was a charge against me; I came to town, went to the station-house, and asked if there was any charge against me; they said, "No;" I went home, and then the officer came after me.</p>

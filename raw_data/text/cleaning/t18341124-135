                  </hi>. I have lived with John Boyce for twelve months. On the 18th of October, he and I were at the Bull, in Kingsland Road—the prisoner came in—I had not known her before, but Boyce had—she said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, I wish you would give me half a pint of beer, for I am in distress, and I have just been to the pump to get some water"—he said, "Half a pint is not much," and gave her a pint—I then asked her to go home to our lodging in Spitalfields, and have some refreshment—she went with us, and I took in a pot of beer for supper—Boyce and I laid down on the bed about one o'clock, leaving her in the room—he gave her his tobacco-box to take some, as she smoked—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my hand when I laid down—I awoke about three o'clock—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed the money and my shawl which had been on the back of a chair—it was on Saturday night she went home with us, and on Monday we gave information, and she was taken with my shawl on her.</p>

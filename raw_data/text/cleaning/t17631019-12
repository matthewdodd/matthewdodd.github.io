I seeing the knife, called out murder. The prisoner cut at me, I held up my hand to save my neck, and he cut my thumb. The man at my right hand felt for the watch, but I not having a string to it, saved it. There were two women looked out at a window, and called out to the person that took the prisoner, and said, that was the man, directing him to the prisoner.</p>

            . I was coming home between 8 and 9 o'clock that night, as I was near Justice Pell's door, I heard murder cry'd, upon hearing it a second time I ran very hard, as I got by the posts the prisoner past me, two women over my head from a window said, that is the man that has past you; he was walking alone, I said, what have you been doing? he answered nothing at all; the women said, they believed he had murdered a man; as soon as the prosecutor saw him he said, that is the man that held a knife to my throat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

            . I am a patrol. The witness gave me information - I knew the prisoner, and went to look for her; she absconded that night, but I found her at two o'clock on Tuesday morning - I knocked at the door, and some girl said, "What do you want?" I said, "I want to speak to the mistress of the house" - I heard two persons come down stairs and whisper together; I then heard a back door unbolted and bolted again; another girl opened the street door, and I accused her of letting a girl out at the back-door - she said she had not; I went into the yard, and there was no one there - I got over the fence, and found the prisoner in another house; I took her, and put her with three or four other girls - the prosecutor pointed her out.</p>

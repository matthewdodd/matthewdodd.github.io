                  </hi>. I occupy No. 16, Seymour-street, Portman-square, as a lodging-house. About eleven o'clock, on the 30th of June, I saw my watch safe in the housekeeper's room, in front of the house, down-stairs, in a stand on the chimney-piece—it was a gold watch, with a rose-wood case, let in with mother-of-pearl—it is worth 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure it is worth</p>

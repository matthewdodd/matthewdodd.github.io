                  </hi>. I keep the Flying Horse public-house, Wilson-street, Finsbury. On the 7th of September, about five o'clock, I was serving gin and milk—I heard a noise at my till in my counter—I had this bowl—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in my till, and to the best of my knowledge it had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—there were several shillings, sixpences, and groats—on hearing the noise my wife went into the bar to see what was the matter, and I saw some of the party who were at the counter drawing their hands from that side where the till was—their hands had no business there—my wife went and found the till a little drawn out—she missed the bowl and silver—she accused the prisoner, who was going to the door, with having stolen the bowl—I went after her, and caught her—I saw her throw this bowl away, as she was running in the street.</p>

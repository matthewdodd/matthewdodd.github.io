            . I saw the Prisoner take half a hundred of stubs, which were in a tub; I asked him, what he was going to do with them? He made me no answer, but went away with them. He came last night to his master, and abused him very much, and he said, I am come to surrender myself to clear myself. His master took hold of him, but he got from him and run away, and we took him in New Broad Street; he kicked me over the shins, and pulled out a knife and fork, and threatened to kill us.</p>

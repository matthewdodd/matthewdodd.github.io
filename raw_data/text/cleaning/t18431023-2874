                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Old Coachmakers' Arms, Long<lb></lb>acre. On Wednesday, the 30th of Aug., the prisoner came there, and slept in my bed-room—there are two beds there—my trowsers and things were all in the room—my watch was locked up in a small box—I did not miss any thing till the Sunday following, as I did not go to the box—none of them have been found, except my hat, which was taken from the room—this is it—my box had been opened, and locked again—it is the dwelling-house of Charles Bowin—nobody slept there on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—nobody had been in the room except the servant—the prisoner complained of being very warm in the morning—I asked how he slept—he said, "Very well"—he drank some gin at the bar, and went away—I little thought he had my hat on at the time—he left his old one behind instead of mine.</p>

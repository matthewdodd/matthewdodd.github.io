            . I am beadle of London-bridge. -I took the prisoner, and told him the gentleman had lost his handkerchief: he said he had not got it - I searched at the watch-house, and found it in the flap of his breeches; I asked him where it was - he said, "I have not got it," and on searching I found six other handkerchiefs on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

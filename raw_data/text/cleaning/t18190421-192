            . I live two doors from Lovegrove. On the 31st of March, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners (both of whom I knew before), looking in at his window. Williams went in soon after, and came out with a bundle, which appeared to be stockings, she gave them to Wildey, who walked away with it under her shawl. She went into the shop again. I ran into the shop, and asked if they had lost any stockings? the little girl then missed them - Williams was not in the shop then. I and the prosecutor went in pursuit, but could not find them. I knew them both well.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to the prosecutor, and serve in the shop. On the morning of the 31st of March, Lovegrove put the stockings in the window. Williams came into the shop three minutes after, and asked the price of the ribbon, which lay at the further end of the window - the stockings were next the door. I did not understand which ribbon she meant. She said she would go and point it out, which she did, and came in again. I showed them to her, and while I turned to get others, she went out, and said she would call again. I had seen them safe in the window before she came in. Nobody but herself came into the shop till I missed the stockings. I knew the prisoners before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 31st of March the prisoners were brought to the office - after that I went to a house in Elger-street, Essex-street, Whitechapel. The street-door was open. I went up to the first floor, and found the door locked - I looked through the key-hole, and saw two pair of stockings on the floor, and two pair in a chair. I broke the door open, and took them. Wildey said she lodged there.</p>

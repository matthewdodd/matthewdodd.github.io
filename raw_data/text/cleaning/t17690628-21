            . On the first of June I lost many things; but found nothing on the prisoner but a cloth great coat, which I found upon him the same day. I am a <rs id="t17690628-21-viclabel107" type="occupation">publican</rs>

The coat being at the further end of the club room, my little boy said, Mind that thief! he never comes here but he robs us of something. I went out about my business. My wife can give a farther account.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Feild. I am wife to the prosecutor. After my husband was gone out, I heard the club room door move. I ordered my little boy to go up and see what the prisoner was about. He came down and said the prisoner at the bar had stole his dada's great coat. It was too big to be hid under his coat, for the flap of it hung out. I laid hold of it. He took and threw it out at the window, held up his fist at me, and got out: he made a full stop to take up the coat, but did not take it. I went out and called, Stop thief! He cried Stop thief! all the way he ran. He was taken in about two or three hundred yards. My child is about nine years old.</p>

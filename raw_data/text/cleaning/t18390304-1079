                  </hi>. I am apprentice to a pawnbroker. On the 24th of February I was in Drury-lane, at ten o'clock at night, going home to my father, in Berwick-street, Oxford-street—the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to give her a halfpenny—she stood close to me—I told her I had not got one—she went away—I found after she left that my watch was gone from my left-hand waistcoat pocket, and the guard with it—I am sure it was safe when she came to me—she ran—I ran after her, and caught her just by the Mogul, in Drury-lane—I told her she had stolen my watch—she put a ginger-beer bottle in my face, and said, "Is this your watch?"—I said, "No, it is not"—she called out, "Eliza"—the people all came round her, and they called out, <hi rend="italic">"Bung</hi> it" and <hi rend="italic">"Ding</hi> it"—the policeman says that <hi rend="italic">"bung</hi> it" means, "Put it back"—I do not know what <hi rend="italic">"ding</hi> it" means—I still kept hold of her—the people threatened to pull my jacket and hat off if I did not let her go—they pulled me about, and a witness saw the watch passing from one to the other—the prisoner was taken, and after I got home I found my watch in my right-hand jacket pocket—I am sure it had been in my left-hand waistcoat pocket.</p>

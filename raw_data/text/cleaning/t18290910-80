            . The prosecutor came into my shop, and was paying for some goods; the prisoner came in, went behind him, opened his pocket with his right hand, and with his left I saw him put the handkerchief into his own pocket; I came round the counter - the prosecutor then had hold of him, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the shop on the Saturday night; this gentleman was standing at the counter with his handkerchief half out of his pocket; I said,"Your handkerchief is hanging out." Mr. Reynolds was selling bacon, and he wanted to pretend that I wanted to steal some, but I did not; and then the prosecutor said I wanted to pick his pocket; and when before the Magistrate he told the gentleman to say I wanted to take it out of his pocket.</p>

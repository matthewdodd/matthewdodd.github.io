The prisoner was in my employ for three years - he was discharged on the 12th of November, for being insolent to one of the other servants. I afterwards received information, and got a warrant; I went with Avis to search his father's house, at Battle-bridge - we found him sitting by the fire, and I said "William, I understand you have robbed me" - he said he had never robbed me in his life. I said, "You have taken a pair of shoes, and other articles." He then said, he had taken a pair of soiled shoes, and looked about the house to find them. I then said, I heard he had taken tools to make shoes - he said he had bought them, but he could not give a strict account where. Avis then found three duplicates for boots and shoes, which were mine. - Avis told him three times that he was at liberty to make any confession he pleased, but he would neither make him any promise or threat - he then said that he would confess, that he had other duplicates, and he went with the officer into a back-room, and brought out of his box ninety-seven or ninety-eight duplicates, which he confessed were for my property. We took him to the office - I then went to the pawnbrokers, and got the articles. The prisoner is a cousin of my wife's, and she has a brother living within two doors of me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there any name over the door? A. Yes; the name of Bosley - he was my uncle - I bought the premises of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Whitechapel-road, and keep a cook's-shop. Early on the morning of the 20th of April, the prisoner followed me to my own door—I knocked at my door, and turned round and desired him to leave me—he said he should not leave without something—he made a snatch at my seals, and dragged my watch from my pocket—he ran off—I followed him, and called "Stop thief"—he was stopped by the policeman—I kept him in view till he was stopped, and have not the least doubt of his being the man who did this—the watch was found on him in my presence—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 60.) About two o'clock that morning, I was in Brick-lane—there was a cry of "Police"—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner running—I went and stopped him—he endeavoured to get away from me—I forced him against some boards—he put his hand behind him, and I heard something rattle—I endeavoured to get hold of his hand—something touched my fingers, and fell on the ground—I stooped and picked up the watch close to him.</p>

Q.</hi> Where were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About twenty yards, up Brick-lane—I did not see what took place in Whitechapel—I am quite sure I heard something rattle, and felt something in the prisoner's hand as I put my hand round him—he put his right hand behind him—I put my left hand, and something touched my fingers. I heard something fall—I pulled him on one side, and there was the watch—I can venture to say that no person ran by—there was a gas light within five yard, of the place.</p>

            . On Saturday night, the 3d of May, about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in St. Giles's. I had a bag containing 26 s. in copper. I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18230514-122-crimeloc653">Bainbridge-street</placeName>

In about ten minutes I heard the watchman calling three o'clock, called him in, and gave one of the men in charge, then returned to the house, and found her in the front room, and went with her to a house, where she unlocked a box, and handed me out my bag of money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was called to the house, and took charge of a man, returned with the beadle, and found the prisoner in bed, in the front parlour, with her clothes on - she said she had given the money to her pall, and would go and show where it was. She took us to to No. 9, Maynard-street, and gave the money, and charged the prosecutor with attempting to commit an unnatural crime. She did not say he gave her the money.</p>

            . I am constable of Norton Falgate. On the 27th of October, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners singing together at the Duke's-head public-house, High-street; as they were going out, I observed that Pennycad had a bundle - I asked him to let me see what was in it; Murrell said, "Old shoes, show the gentleman" - Pennycad said, they were his fathers, and he was waiting there to meet him - I asked where his father lived, he said, he did not know - I took them to the watch-house; I put them in separate places - I said to Pennycad, "I don't believe your story, where did you get them;" he then said voluntarily, "Well, I will tell you the truth; we were in distress, and we got them from Shoreditch work-house - I and Flood got over the wall, and Murrell waited outside" - I took three pairs and two odd shoes from Pennycad's bundle, and one pair he had on, and Murrell had one pair on his feet - the next morning, I asked Flood who went over the work-house wall with him; he said, Pennycad, and that Murrell waited outside.</p>

            . I am master of the shoemaker's shop, at Shoreditch work-house - the prisoners have been paupers there, and one of them worked in the shop; these shoes are the property of the trustees of the poor - I hung them up in the shop about four o'clock in the afternoon; it was then dusk - I found, about half-past eight next morning, that the window had been forced open.</p>

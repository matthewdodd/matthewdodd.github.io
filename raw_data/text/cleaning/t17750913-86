I had before washed a great many things, and bundled them up. When I came home at night, I saw the counterpane which I had washed in the week, on the ground, then I saw the prisoner come down stairs, he flew past me like an arrow out of a bow; my daughter pursued him. I went up stairs and found all the things mentioned in the indictment bundled up in a sheet, on a frame of the window, half in and half out. I has steped home about an hour before, they were safe then. I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was taken in about half a quarter of an hour; I knew him again directly.</p>

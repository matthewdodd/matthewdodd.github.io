                  </hi>. I am a barrister; my chamben are at No. 2, Pump-court, Temple. On the 4th of Dec, about a quarter to one o'clock in the day, I was passing through East Smithfield, near Tower-hill—I felt somebody rush up against me, behind—I put my head round to my pocket, and at the same time turned round, and there stood the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand, quite close to me, almost touching me—I took hold of it, and immediately I took it out of his hand he ran away—I pursued him, crying, "Stop thief!" and after running some little distance, he was stopped by a police-officer—when I came up to him, he said, "You won't give me in charge for this? "—I said, "I shall," and I gave him in charge—I have not brought the handkerchief here—I will swear the handkerchief I took from him was the one I had in my pocket before—I produced it before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You told the Magistrate you saw another lad pass at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames-police. I was in St. Katherine's dock on the day mentioned, and heard an alarm of "Stop thief!"—I stopped the prisoner—he said, "I have done nothing"—the prosecutor came up, and said he had stolen his handkerchief, which he produced—the prisoner did not deny it, but said, "I hope, Sir, you won't give me in charge."</p>

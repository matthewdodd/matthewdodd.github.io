I was discharged at Bristol, and arrived at the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street, on the 14th of February, and at seven o'clock I came out, and met the prisoner with another woman in Gracechurch-street, after nine o'clock - I was sober.

I retired with the other girl; the prisoner went into another room with an old man. I had hardly got to bed before she came and crept under the bed. I had a light in the room, heard somebody under the bed, jumped out, and caught her by the neck; my trowsers were drawn off the bed, and my pocket torn out of them. I took hold of a knife, and said</p>
               <p>"Deliver it up, or I will cut your block off," and she gave me my pocket, there was a sovereign and 16 s. in it. I said I had lost more, but if she would give me half I would give her the rest. When I left the Cross Keys, I had six sovereigns and 16 s. loose in my breeches pocket. I had spoken to nobody else - a sovereign was found on her at the watch-house. I detained the other woman, but she slipped away.</p>

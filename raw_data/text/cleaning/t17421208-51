Friday, November 20, I met Campbell, he asked me if he should come for the Sweepings, I told him yes, and on Sunday Night, Brown and Campbell, got a Lighter Man's Skiff , and came into the Ship<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174212080038"></xptr> Peggy and Jenny : I opened the Gratings on the Quarter Deck, and went down between Decks into the Steerage, opened the Hatch, and went down in the Hold where the Cask of Sugar was; Campbell held a Bag and Brown put the Sugar into it with a Shovel, there was about 5 or 6 Hundred Weight; Campbell handed the Bags, then they carried them into the Hatch-Way, laid them on the Gratings, and afterwards carried them to the House of one Wright , at the Black Swan, in Ratcliff; Brown carried up the Elephants Teeth, and the Rum. I drew a Staple out of the Chest with a Marling-Spike which Brown gave me: I took out one Bottle, says Brown , What signifies one, take 5 or 6 they will serve us to drink, so we took out 5 more, with Wine and Rum; the Skiff lay at the Dock Gate: Brown went on Shore and Campell handed them to him; these were all put into the Boat, and landed at Wright's House, as soon as they came up the Sugar was delivered to Wright himself, and put by under his Care - he carried it into a little Room - Wright carried the Candle and Brown carried in the Sugar, Wright told Brown and Campbell, that the Bags were wet, and made the Sugar run, and Wright got a couple of dry Bags and put the Sugar into them; the Bottles and the Elephants Teeth were all delivered to Mrs Wright, and she carried them up Stairs. - The Goods were to be sold, and each of us was to have an equal Share of the Money. - I was took up the next Morning, that was the Reason they were not sold. I have known the Prisoners about three Weeks, they worked out the Ship. - I never had any Promises from any Body.</p>

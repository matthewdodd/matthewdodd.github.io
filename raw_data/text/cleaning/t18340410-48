            . Q. Have you told us every thing you saw? A. I believe so, as far as I recollect - I had a pistol, and told them all, if they resisted, I would shoot them - it was loaded - what Hunt handed to Shipley was hot - I believe he dropped it - Peapall tried to make his escape directly I got into the room - he did not touch any of the implements - I was once in St. Catherine's Dock, and left because it did not suit me - I was not dismissed - there was never any charge made against me for stealing brandy, nor of stealing a donkey: except by people of this sort - there is no charge in the least against me in the police - I was never accused in my life of making false charges against any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not now under suspicion, and only allowed to wear your uniform till this trial is over? A. I am not - I was three years in St. Catherine's Docks - I went from there to Mr. Freeman's stone-wharf, Millbank, and left him on purpose to join the police - Miller had a file in his hand - that was all I saw him do - I have seen Hunt go backwards and forwards there night and day - I know he lived there - I had seen Peapall in the street about an hour or half an hour before - it was more than half an hour - I had been watching the house for a good while - I saw Peapall at the end of the street with a good many more - I did not continue watching - sometimes I had other business - I was not watching the house all that day - I was watching it for twenty minutes before I went in - in the course of that twenty minutes I saw some women go in - it is a kind of lodging-house - Peapall was not one of those persons - I do not know the name of any body who went in - it is a general house for these kind of people - three or four different families lodge there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to his Majesty's mint. I have been experienced in coin several years - this is a plaster of Paris mould for casting a half-crown - it has the impression of the obverse and reverse side of a half-crown, and appears to have been used - here is a good half-crown, and the mould appears to have been made with this good half-crown - this is a counterfeit half-crown which has been made in the mould - it agrees in date and every thing - it is the half-crown found in the mould - these two half-crowns produced by a witness are both counterfeit, and the same in all respects as the other - they were cast in this mould; and the one found on Miller is the same - this file has white metal in the teeth of it, such as would be used to remove the surplus metal from the edge - these spoons are the same metal as the base coin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100035"></xptr>and here is a pipkin with white metal of a similar description in it, and this tin hand appears to have been used in forming the mould, to keep it together while the plaster of Paris was in a liquid state - this tobacco-pipe has some white metal in the bowl, and might be used to ladle the metal out of the pipkin - this is plaster of Paris in the bottle.</p>
               <p>Hunt's Defence. I went up to No. 10, Pye-street, as I knew this girl as a friend, and had something to drink with her - I left word at the public-house that Peapall was to call there for his tobacco-box - he came, and was going out, when the policeman broke the door open, and swore he would blow my b - y brains out if I stirred.</p>
               <p>Shipley's Defence. Hunt came into my room about half an hour previous - he sent me out for six pennyworth of rum - I went and fetched it - I had occasion to go to two or three different places - I was not gone more than half an hour - I returned - we drank the liquor, and when I returned the other two prisoners were in the room - I returned with a bottle which I had borrowed at the inn; and keeping on my bonnet and shawl, I came down stairs a second time - I threw my shawl on the chair immediately, went to the bed, and put my bonnet inside the bed, and was returning from the bed, having occasion to go out again, when the policemen surprised me by the sudden entrance - the first policeman who entered, to the best of my knowledge, was Goose - he flew to Hunt - two others flew to the others, and the fourth stationed himself with his back towards the door - they bid me stand in the same position as I was in when they entered, which I did - when they searched the other prisoners a policeman came and searched me - then he left me in care of another while he took the three prisoners to the station-house - then came back and took me.</p>

               <p>Miller's Defence. I came up to the room knocking at the door - the prisoner, Shipley, let me in - I went for a clean shirt she had of mine, and in five or ten minutes Goose arrived - he immediately rushed to Hunt, put the pistol to his head, and said, he would blow his b - y brains out if he moved - he could not see me, for I was behind him, and he took a false oath that it was I dropped the file - I had nothing to do with it - a policeman laid hold of me, and took an oath I had thrown one across the room, but I had nothing in my hand - when Clifton went to give his evidence, Goose was behind him putting the words into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Peapall's Defence. I live at No. 4, New Peter-street. I was returning home - I called on Hunt for a tobacco-box I had given him the night before and forgotten, and was not in the room three minutes when Goose rushed in - I was taken to the station-house - Goose came and said, "Peapall, I am sorry for you, for I saw you go in not five minutes before, myself" - a soldier was in the place, and heard it, and they would not allow him to give his evidence - he is in the 15th Hussars, and is gone to Ireland, or he could take his oath I had not been there five minutes.</p>

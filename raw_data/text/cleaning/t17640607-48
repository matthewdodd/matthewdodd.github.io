The prisoner took a two pair of stairs room of my wife, by the week, about the 4th or 5th of April; he lived in it about three weeks, and had no visible way of employment; he said he had a mother living, of whom he had a dependance for cloaths and money. He wanted to ride out one day, and it being showery sort of weather, my wife lent him my coat a first and second time; but the last time he took it without asking for it, although it was a fine afternoon; he returned without it. We lost a teaspoon, which was part of the furniture let with his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Draper. I lent the prisoner the great coat twice, and he brought it again; I was in my room, and saw him in the street with it on a third time; it was a very fine afternoon; he came home that night. I asked him where the coat was? he said he had left it at one Mr. Kilbourn's, at Rotherhithe church, and he should be there in two or three days, and would bring it home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend him the coat that third time?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Draper. No, I did not; he never asked me. A little after this, I went to clean the room, where he lodged, and missed a silver tea-spoon; I asked him after it, but he did not then tell me; but afterwards he told me he had pawned the coat and spoon too: I found he deceived me about money being sent out of the country, so we took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176406070029"></xptr> him up, and carried him before the Alderman, and he was committed; the Alderman knew him by the name of

While I was trying the Shoes, in comes Mr. Kitchen, and took a Pair of Shoes from the short Man, the Prisoner: As soon as Mr. Kitchen had taken the Shoes, the Prisoner ran away out of the Shop, and Mr. Kitchen run after him; the tall Man said, What is the Matter? I said, the Man that you brought into the Shop with you, has stole a Pair of Shoes; said he, I don't know any body but my Wife; said the Woman, The Man is not my Husband, I know nothing of the Man. The tall Man said we should not detain his Wife over and over, and ask'd if they had stole any thing; I said, No, you have not, but I won't let you go 'till my Master comes. She declar'd afterwards, that she was not his Wife.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of December, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the end of Little George-street, and saw the two prisoners in company together, in George-street, which is no thoroughfare; I went up the street, and they came down on the opposite side - in going up the street I kicked against the head of one of these drums; I saw Baker with something very bulky in his apron before him - they were about twenty yards from the drumhead: I looked after them, and Brown made a stand; I immediately went up to Baker, and said, "Young man, what have you got there?" he d-d me, and said what was it to me; I pulled out my staff - he immediately let the two drums of figs fall at my feet, out of his apron -I immediately laid hold of him, and he began to struggle with me; Brown then came up, and struck me a most dreadful blow on the cheek-bone - it cut the flesh off the bone; I staggered, and fell against a gate - I was obliged to let go of Baker; they then both immediately fought me - I began to make a noise, saying, "Why, you are going to murder me!" and they ran away, leaving the figs behind them - (about half an hour afterwards Holditch came to the watch-house, saw the figs, and claimed them); when the prisoners ran away I pursued them and never lost sight of Brown till I had him in custody -I lost sight of Baker for about five minutes; he was taken in John-street - they had separated in New-square; they were both secured in the watch-house about the same time: John-street is in the City, and so is the place where I found the figs; they were afterwards claimed by Mr. Borer - I saw the letter B in a chalk-mark on them; the drums are here - the greater part of the figs were taken while I pursued the prisoners.</p>

Nobody that I saw; I first saw the prisoners together in Little George-street - they were together when I first saw them; Brown might be about five yards off when he stopped to look at me: I was not pursuing him more than half a minute - he might run three hundred yards; he turned one corner - I was close at his heels, and am certain of him; I never said I thought he had not taken an active part in ill-using me, or that I was not certain of Baker.</p>

I was on the opposite side of the way, ran across the road and took Baker, who was running - a young man stopped him: I took him back to Little George-street, and about two minutes after I was at the watch-house Roberts brought Brown in; I received a drum of figs in Vine-street - they had been picked up; the other drum was brought to the watch-house next morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

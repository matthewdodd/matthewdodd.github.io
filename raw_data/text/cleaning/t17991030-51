             at the water-side, and a number of other gentlemen who intrust their property to my care; I am answerable for it. On the 26th of September, I landed twenty-six casks of horse hair, containing three thousand two hundred and sixty-one pounds, in three hogsheads, at the <placeName id="t17991030-51-crimeloc291">Custom-house quay</placeName>

               <p>Q. What reason had you to suppose, that the horse hair you so found, was part of that parcel? - A. There had been no horse hair at Custom-house quay for six weeks or two months before that, I am very certain of.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was applied to immediately after this happened, to take the prisoners in charge; I had a deal of trouble to get Hester along; it was a very wet night, and I could not get a coach; he threw himself down in the dirt several times, till I got to Mark-lane; I pinned him up at the Corn-market a good while, till some people got me a coach; the other man was very obedient, and endeavoured to persuade the other, but he was very drunk, and I could not get him along; Hester afterwards said, I had not got the capital thief, for Shepherd was the principal; he refused to go with me till I got a coach.</p>

               <p>Robbins. I have no doubt but it is the very same hair that I weighed in the cask in the morning; it has every appearance of being the same.</p>
               <p>Miles's defence. I had been at work all night at night-work; I went down in the morning to see if I could get some work, I could not get any, and between one and two o'clock, being up all night, I went into this cane-room to go to sleep, when I came down they stopped me at the bottom of the ladder.</p>
               <p>Hester's defence. I have just the same to say, for I was at work with him and asleep with him.</p>

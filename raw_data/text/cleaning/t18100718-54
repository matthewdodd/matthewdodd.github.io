On the 13th of July, about ten minutes before six in the morning, I found a ladder under a small sash window over the stable; the window was broke, and the string that fastened the window in the inside was cut, and two wooden bars were wrenched down; and they came through a door into the stable, and the side door was broken open that went to the coach-house, and the coach-house door was left open; whoever got in must have entered in at this window. I missed a bridle, a horse's collar, a pair of boots, an oil-skin cover for a hat, a handkerchief pad, and several other things that are not found.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse the prisoner - A. I informed the constable, he took the prisoner with the things on him. On the evening before the property was lost, at half past-nine, I left the stable, with all the things safe in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man yourself - A. I saw the man about Hampstead; he worked about there the last winter.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday morning last, about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming towards town, he had got a bridle under his arm; when he saw me looking at him, he was endeavouring to hide this bridle, by covering it up with these things. I thought he had not come honestly by them; I took him in custody. He told me he found the bridle. I asked him, where he got the boots; he said, they were a pair of old boots he had worn when he was at work down in the country. I searched him, and found four large knives upon him.</p>

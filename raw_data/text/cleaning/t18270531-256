            . I live in Beaumont-street. In March last I owed Mr. Richards about 20l.; a person called and pressed me very much for it (I was not to have paid it immediately); he deducted a discount for prompt payment - I gave him a draft for 19l., on Coutts' Bank; (looking at a draft) this is it, and here is the person's receipt; 1l. 1s. 3d. was the discount - I do not recollect his person; it was a young man - I saw him write the receipt; it is signed "William Hopkinson for Mr. Richards."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Back, who keeps the George and Vulture public-house. On Saturday afternoon, the 5th of December, the prisoner came there, and asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin, and the day's paper—I gave him the paper—while he was reading it, a boy came in for change—I took a canvas bag out of the till, and gave the change—there was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, wrapped in different papers, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose—I think there were some half-crowns among them—after I had given change, ano<lb></lb>ther gentleman asked for the newspaper—I said he should have it as soon as the prisoner had done—the prisoner then laid it down, and asked for Friday's paper—I gave it to him, and then went with the day's paper to the gentleman who had asked for it—while I was gone, I distinctly heard money <hi rend="italic">jink</hi> in the till—when I returned, I saw the prisoner outside the bar, in the act of taking his hand from over the counter—I said, "You have robbed my till"—he said, "I have not"—I ran to the front door, and bolted it—on my return he knocked me down with his fist, and I think he must have tripped up one of my feet, I fell so suddenly—he un<lb></lb>bolted the door, and ran out—I got up, and hallooed "Stop thief "—he was then running in the middle of the street—he was brought back by a person—this bag was shown me afterwards—it had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, and one four<lb></lb>penny-piece—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in paper.</p>

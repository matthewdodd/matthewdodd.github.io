On the 11th of November, I was in Little Moorfields, a little after eleven o'clock in the morning—I saw the two prisoner, and another there, walk<lb></lb>ing round a cart—the one not yet in custody, got up in the cart, and tried to remove a truss—it was too heavy for him, and he got down again—he got up three times, and the third time he got it out; and with the assistance of Thomas, it was put on Shears's shoulders—all three went down New Union-street—the carman game out, and I told him of it—he went down New Union-street—went by Thomas, and the others, and caught Shears at the bottom, with it on his shoulders—I was at Guildhall, at Shears's examination, and Thomas was brought in there—he was found in Guild<lb></lb>hall-yard, waiting there; and I know him to be the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and get my living by jobbing. I live in Tothill-court, Tothill-street, Westminster. I stand at the foot of South-wark-bridge—it is a place where porters stand—I only know the prisoner Thomas, by seeing him in the King's Head public-house, Queen-street—I went there on the 11th of November, at a quarter-past eleven o'clock, to get refreshment, as I am in the habit of going there to seek for work—the prisoner came in directly after—it might be five minutes or so after—I saw him come in, and David Thomas, I mean to say, Thomas Davis, was with him—I stayed there till about eleven o'clock, having my refreshment—I have to wait there sometimes—I am told to wait there—I came out about ten minutes past one o'clock—Thomas was gone before that—he might be gone five or six minutes before—not much longer than that—I went out soon after he went out—I had no acquaintance with him.</p>

               <p>that day—he was not a porter there—he went out, I dare say, about ten o'clock—I left at ten minutes after one o'clock—he had been in there from twenty minutes after eleven till about one o'clock, having a drop of beer with Thomas Davis—I did not join them—I was only facing them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> Thomas was taken into custody on the 11th—the magistrate came to Guildhall, about a quarter to one—Thomas was apprehended from half-past one to a quarter to two o'clock, in the yard—I do not know the distance from Moorfields to Southwark-bridge—I went out of the justice-room door with the butcher boy and car<lb></lb>man, and directly the lad got into the yard, there were a great number of people there—I said, "Look round, and see if you see him"—he looked towards King-street, and said, "There he is—that is him, in that white coat and black whiskers"—when I took hint, he said, what did I take him for—he said afterwards, that he could bring forty people to prove where he had been the whole of that day.</p>

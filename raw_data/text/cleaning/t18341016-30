               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long afterwards was it when you saw it? A.

            . I am a baker. My brother is captain of the brig Jane - he wanted some donkeys to go abroad - the prisoner brought this donkey to my door - he said his father was a dealer in those sort of things - I said it was too small - he said it was very hard after he had laid out his money to take it back again, and I bought it of him for 9s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was it worth? A. Better judges then I am, said it was not worth 5s., but I suppose it was worth 7s. I had to buy a dozen - it was an open transaction.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it in going to Smithfield - I looked at it, and a young fellow said, "Do you want to buy one?" he let me have it for 7s. - the man was with me when the baker bought it of me: and when he asked if it was all right, the man stepped up and said he bought it of his father.</p>

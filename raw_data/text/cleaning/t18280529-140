I bought a truck of the prisoner on the 10th of April, to the best of my knowledge; I think it was on a Thursday evening, but I had met him before that in Cannon-street-road; he came up to me, and said, "Rees, I have got an old truck I will sell you," and on the Thursday he brought it to me, and I bought it of him - he asked 1l. for it, and I gave him 13s.; I never bought a truck before, but I have bought carts; I bought it in an open fair way, and kept it in the street; I afterwards met the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, and he said to me, "Rees, have you made away with the truck;" I said, "I don't sell turkies;" he said, "No, the truck;" I said, "What do you mean? I bought it of you, and have the receipt for it which you wrote at my house;" he said, "I was pulled up at Lambeth-street for it;" I said I bought it fairly. I serve shops with poultry - my name is on my door, and has been so for these thirty years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to William Oldham, of Union-street, Borough. On Saturday, the 14th of March, at a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Wood-street, opposite Pickford's yard—I had occa<lb></lb>sion to follow a cart loaded with tea chests and bags—I had a truck, with about five hundred weight in it, and a little boy with me, and a dog—I saw the prisoner take the truss, or bag, out of the cart, behind the near wheel—he; placed it at the corner of Maiden-lane—as soon as I saw him take it I was convinced he was a thief—I seized hold of him—he took the tea off the cart and deliberately put it at the corner of Maiden-lane—I then took him—the cart moved on to Pickford's—I kept the prisoner till a policeman came and took him—the cart had gone into Pickford's yard.</p>

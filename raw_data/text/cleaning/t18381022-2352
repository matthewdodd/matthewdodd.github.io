                  </hi>.—I am inn-keeper and coach-proprietor at the Boar and Castle, Oxford-street. I am a customer of Staff and Son—I had an article of them in January last—it came to a guinea—the prisoner called on the 24th of August, and asked for further orders, and was very pressing for them—I wanted a cover for a provender-van—he went into the yard, and said he knew what would do—I gave him the order—he asked me if it would be convenient to pay that little account, and I gave him a sovereign—he wrote this receipt for it in my presence—the bill had been previously left (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I did not write this, or authorise it to be written—I asked him what would be the price of it, and how long it would take to make—he said we should not fall out about the price, and he could not promise it under about six weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Who cried out stop thief? - A strange gentleman, and I was afraid to leave my place, for fear of being robbed of what I had below; and presently, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080073"></xptr>less than ten minutes, it might be five minutes, the property was brought back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it is possible that a person might have taken the opportunity while the door was open of getting up stairs? - Very easily. (The things produced.) On the counterpane there is a mark, Wissis. I know the curtains by the pattern.</p>

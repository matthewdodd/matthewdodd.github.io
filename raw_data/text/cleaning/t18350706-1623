                  </hi>. I am a baker and live in Oxford-road. I have known the prisoner about a year and a half—he lived as butler with a family which I used to serve—he came to my shop six or seven Weeks ago—my son was at home, and heard what passed—he came into the shop to my wife, and said he was now living at Stratford-place, with a family, and be wanted to have some biscuits sent to the house—he said Mrs. Cotton, his mistress, had dined out with one of my customers, and she was very foad of my bread; but the bread he could say nothing about at present, but we were to send the biscuits up before six o'clock that evening—I then went forwards—he said, "How do you do?" I said, "Very well" he said, "Can you give me change for a bill?" and believing him to be a respectable young man, I said, "Yes; "—my son was by my side, and whispered to me not to do it, but I did—I gave him change for a cheque, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my son went directly into the City to receive the cheque, but returned in less than half an hour without any money—he went so inquire if Mr. Cotton lived where the prisoner said.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the counting-house when the prisoner came to the shop—I went into the shop—he chose different sorts of biscuits, and begged them to be sent, about six o'clock, to Mr. Cotton's, 8, Stratford-place—while I was packing them up, he went into the parlour, and was speaking to my father—I followed, after finishing the biscuits, and found my father was changing the cheque—I advised him not to do it, in consequence of my suspicions on looking at the cheque, as the date was altered—any father said he thought it was good, and gave him the change—as the prisoner left, he said, "Be sure to send the biscuits by six o'clock"—I wished to go to the banker's immediately with the cheque—I went to Bosanquet's, where it was refused—I returned home, and mentioned it to my father, and went immediately to Stratford-place, to Mr. Cotton, and made inquiry—I met the prisoner accidentally about six weeks afterwards—he was on the opposite side of the way, in Regent-street—I recognised him immediately, but allowed him to pass me—he stopped, and looked in at a shop window—I passed him, then turned round, and found he had turned back—I turned into Castle-street, and saw him drinking a glass of beer at the bar of a public-house—I could not have a distinct view of him there, and let him come out again—he crossed over, and I saw that it was him—I followed him to Prince's-street, Cavendish-square—I touched him on the shoulder, and said I wanted him—he turned round, appeared rather confused, and said, "What for?"—I said, I dare say he knew—he said, "Let me go?"—I said no, I wished him to come to Oxford-street with me—he drew a paper from his pocket, which appeared the same sort of paper as the cheque was written on—I said, "You have got another of them, I suppose?"—he said, "Of what?"—I said, "You know very well"—he then put it into his pocket—a cab came by shortly afterwards—I asked the cabman to come down, as I wanted to speak to him, and in that time he put the paper into his mouth, and swallowed it—several people came round—I begged him to show what he was eating, but he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183507060026"></xptr>
               <p>not; and after he had swallowed it, he pulled out a piece of dry orange<lb></lb>peel, and said that was what he was earting—I gave him in charge for forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the alteration you observed, the figure "8" to "28?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should think bankers would refuse to take cheques when the date is altered—I advised my father not to cash it, on account of the alteration in the date—I do not think the prisoner heard me—he was two or three yards from me, and I spoke very low indeed I whispered very low—he could have gone out of the way if he liked I belive he was very anxious to get out of my way, or why should he pass me and turn back—I am not in partnership with my father.</p>

I looked at him and said nothing—he said, "Can't you let me go?"—I said, "If I let you go, I shall lose my situation, and then we shall neither of us have a situation"—I asked where he lodged—he would not bear again—I said nothing more to him but took him to the station-house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was dark when you saw this? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Not at eight o'clock? - It was not eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Who was with the waggon at that time? - The waggoner himself.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Where was you then? - As near as I am to you.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I deal in coals and wood.</p>
               <p>So does Mrs. Michael, does not she? - I don't know, she sells greens, I believe, and buys old iron.</p>
               <p>Don't you know she sells coals? - No, I do not, I am not master of her shop.</p>
               <p>How long has she been your next door neighbour? - I believe two years.</p>
               <p>You did not go up to the man, and ask how this happened? - I never spoke to him at all.</p>
               <p>Was you not upon a regular plan of watching Mrs. Michael? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you or had you not before this day formed a determination to watch Mrs. Michael? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner Michael's Counsel. I believe you did not like Mrs. Michael's coming there? - I did not dislike a good neighbour.</p>
               <p>Had not you a dislike to Mrs. Michael's coming there? - One does not like a person to take the bread out of one's mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the sacks they shot the coals out? - They were put into the middle part of the waggon; and when they came to Mr. Lancaster's they drew them quite forward.</p>

               <p>Is Church-street in the way for them to have come with the waggon? - No, a quarter of a mile out of the way; the witness Partridge came, and informed me of the transaction; and that if I would look into the waggon I should find the empty sacks; I bid them stop unloading, but they would not; I endeavoured to get up, but could not; I then went to get a light and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220077"></xptr>a chair, and by that time they had laid the sacks even at the tail of the cart; I asked them, what made them come the way they did? and they said the pavement was up in White-lion-street, and therefore they came the other way; I went to see, and found it was no such thing; there were 26 sacks in all: the woman was taken into custody, and she denied having any from this man; and said, she had in her house a bushel, or a bushel and a half.</p>
               <p>Partridge. Upon the woman saying to the Justice, she had but a bushel, or half a bushel in her house; says he, I am a pretty good judge of a bushel, I will go with you myself; I went with the Justice to this woman's house, and we looked and found the als under the window; the Justice asked her, what she had to say in her behalf? and she said, she was very sure that she had no such quantity of coals in the house, for she was obliged to send for a bushel on Saturday night at Mr. Hands's; then says the Justice, I can judge of a bushel, and I'll go and see myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was what you are talking of taken down in writing? - I believe it was; then I saw the coals measured, first in the cellar, there were about four bushels and a peck, and there was another parcel measured two bushels within about a quarter of a peck, in this hole; afterwards the Justice sent one of the men to fetch two parcels of coal, some out of this cellar, and some out of a room.</p>

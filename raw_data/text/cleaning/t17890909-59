               <p>I am a coachman; I was in Oxford-road at past eleven o'clock, on the 20th of August last, plying for hire; two gentlemen called me; I put them into the coach, and they ordered me to go to the Temple-gate,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090070"></xptr>opposite Chancery-lane; one gentleman ordered me to go to Tower-street; and as I was going round St. Paul's-church-yard, it was half past eleven; and a man about twenty yards from the end of Watling-street, meets me, and says, stop coachman, d - n you, why do not you stop coachman; he said so two or three times; at last, I pulled my horses in; the man came from Watling-street way; he chucks the trunk up before me, on the top of a shut-down boot, and jumped on the box himself; I went on, and there stood the chaise; and I called halloo, post-chaise boy, here is your trunk, and the man that has it; when he stopped me, I saw no post-chaise; the post chaise was just at the turning at the end of Watling-street, going into Cheap-side, when I came up; I was going along Watling-street; the chaise was in the church-yard; and I stopped my horses as soon as I came up to him; I told him there was his trunk, and the man that had it.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man that was on the box with you? - I cannot tell; it was a dark night, and the horses would not stand still; I delivered the man to the watchman, when he came up; I had no opportunity to take any notice of the man; I believe the gentleman himself came up and took the trunk.</p>

               <p>I heard a rattle, and I ran after it; when I came to it, this brother watchman had the prisoner fast by the collar; that was that gentleman at the bar; and the gentleman was bringing the portmanteau away from the coach to the house; we took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you sure that is the man that you delivered to the watchman? - I am; and I can positively swear that every word the coachman has uttered, is false; he says he stopped and called to the post-chaise boy, when I jumped out of the post-chaise; when I ran back, I met the coach a dozen yards or more behind my post-chaise; and the coachman had never uttered a word; I ran for the space of a dozen yards rather than where the coach was at the time; the coach was going on at the same time; I ran back and opened the coach door; at the same time, my chaise was a hundred yards off this side the china shop, the corner of Watling-street; which was as near as I can guess, directly opposite to where the fire was at Mr. Brown's; his coach was behind me, I fancy, a dozen or fifteen yards; it was not near Watling-street, in the manner he describes, by fifteen yards; it was four or five yards behind my chaise at the time; I opened the coach door; and after I had opened the coach door, and ran to the horses heads, the coachman stopped, and not till then; the coachman further says, he delivered him to the watchman; I positively swear I had him in my arms for the space of a minute or two, before any body came near me; and it was with difficulty that I could get any body to come near me; at first I had him by the collar with one hand, bringing my trunk, begging somebody to help me; then I called out for help; and Mr. Hoppy threw up the window at the time; then the watchman came after that, hearing the rattle.</p>
               <p>Newell. I can swear I received the prisoner out of Mr. Spode's hands, and not out of the coachman's.</p>

             sworn. I took Graham in custody on the 10th of April last between nine and ten at night, in Old Pye-street, Westminster, he was in the street, I took him to Tothill Fields prison for that night, I went and searched his lodgings in company with Smith, No. 16, Duck-lane, we found nothing there; on the following morning we went to Tothil Fields prison, and hearing the prisoner Graham had changed a shirt with a prisoner there of the name of Parker, they were both in a cell together, I asked Parker his reason for changing with the prisoner Graham, Parker replied that the prisoner at the bar was to be treated with a breakfast for so doing; I asked Graham his motive for changing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160027"></xptr>his shirt with Parker, he told me that when they went to bed at night they pulled off their shirts, and on the following morning they put on each others shirt in a mistake; Parker pulled off Graham's shirt, I produce it.</p>

               <p>Graham's Defence. I never saw the man in my life, nor where he lives, I do not know any thing about him; I happened of the boots in the night time, a wooden legged man gave me the boots, he said he could not wear them, he was an old pensioner like myself; the other things I found in a cart, I gave them to this young woman to carry, I did not know what was in them; going through the Park I met a young man that I knew, a shoemaker, I asked him to come with me, I went to a shop where I sell my boots and shoes, I said, my friend, if you will stop, we will have half a pint of beer together, I went into the shop, and asked the man if he would buy the boots, he would not buy them, he said they were not worth two pence, they were tore in the leg; I met with this young woman by accident, I know nothing of her, I gave her the things to carry.</p>
               <p>Grace's Defence. This here man met me, and gave me these things to carry, I did not know what things were in the bundle.</p>

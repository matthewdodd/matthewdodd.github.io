             was my journeyman. He was in my company on that Monday, from half-past seven in the morning till half-past ten o'clock at night - he was at work with me at a house in Stoke Newington - we worked by candle-light, and left work at half-past six o'clock, then went to the Maidenhead public-house, Battle-bridge, and there we remained till half-past ten; there were several other persons in the house, but no one in our company - I do not recollect seeing the landlord - I saw the waiting-maid - it is a house I chiefly use - Cole and I used to go there when he worked for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you so sure it was Monday, the 18th of December? A. Because I keep an account in my book of the work I do - I have no doubt that was the day - we worked there the day following and the Saturday before; I had been working there two months only - my apprentice, John Bond, worked with me; he is not here - he is eighteen years old - there is nobody here from the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAGAN. My Lord, this witness called at my house and merely stated that Cole was a very honest man, and he had known him a long time - he did not state a word about his being at work with him.</p>

            . Q. Did you call at Mr. Maclagan's? A. Yes; after I heard what had happened I called on Mr. Maclagan's, and told him he had worked with me the whole of Monday - I went on the Wednesday evening - I heard that evening there had been a robbery, but did not know when it had been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you told him he had worked with you the whole of Monday? A. He worked with me the whole of that day - I told Mr. Maclagan he had worked with me the whole of Monday; I told him so at his street door; I remember particularly telling him so there; no one was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he had worked with you on Saturday? A. No; I do not know that I had any particular reason for telling him he had worked with me on Monday, but I knew the man could not be at the place he was at, and the other place too.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I again ask you on your oath, whether you knew the charge was on the Monday? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect the Jury to believe you should mention that the prisoner was with you on the Monday; and yet you did not know the robbery was on that day? A. No, I did not - I only know that on the Wednesday morning I sent my boy to call him as usual, and he put his head out of the window and said he would follow us - we went on, he did not come, and in the evening I heard of the robbery when I came home; but I did not hear when it was.</p>

            . When I apprehended the prisoner, I asked him if he was at work - he said he had been out of work a good deal, and that on the Saturday night before he had had 5s. of his master and had not gone to him since.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAGAN. When this witness called on me, he came into the passage - my sister was at the parlour door at the time.</p>

            . Q. You say you told Mr. Maclagan at his door that the prisoner was at work with you on the Monday? A. Yes, I did - I did not see Mr. Maclagan's sister there - there was nobody there - Mr. Maclagan opened the door - I stood, and spoke to him - I did not go there more than once on any occasion.</p>

            . I was at the parlour door when Wilkins came to our house; he gave a loud knock at the door, which alarmed us - he came into the passage and I heard all that passed between my brother and him - he did not state that Cole had worked with him on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110071"></xptr>Monday - he spoke in a very rude manner - he said he came to give the prisoner a good character - he did not say a word about where he had been on the Monday.</p>

            . Q. Did not you send the girl down for the spoons, and I went and asked you to count them; and when I had got them all, you said they were perfectly right? A. It is not a word of it true; I never sent for them; you never asked me if they were right.</p>

I went with them, and when I got into the House I gave them a Shilling to get a full Pot of Flip: While we were drinking the Flip Wilson got her Hands about my Waist, under my Cloaths, and drew my Watch out of my Fob. I seized her Hand with the Watch in it; she dropp'd it down, and I took it up again and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket, and told them, I would stay no longer with them, because I saw they had a Mind to defraud me of my Watch. Wilson rapp'd out an Oath, and assur'd me, she scorn'd to use any Gentleman so ill; so I staid a quarter of an Hour longer, and she got about me again, and took the Watch out of my Pocket and gave it the little one (Solomon) who stood behind Wilson and me. 'Tis true, I did not see her, but I felt her, and my Watch could go no other Way; beside, I saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and Wilson sit together?</p>
               <p>Glasspool. We were upon the Bed together. - She and I were upon the Bed's-Feet. She threw her self upon the Bed's-Feet, and swore I should - have to do with her, and so she pull'd me upon the Bed to her, and as we lay together I felt her take the Watch, and saw her push her Hand by my Side, towards Solomon, who stood behind us at the Feet of the Bed. I would have got up immediately, but she had got her Arms about me, and held me fast, that I might not pursue Solomon. However, I made shift to slip out of her Arms, and I ran after Solomon; I saw her go into the next House, and a Jew being at the Door, I said, Sir, I have lost my Watch, and the Woman that has got it, is come into this House; and tho'I saw her go into the House with my own Eyes, yet the Jew would face me down, that no body was come in there.</p>
               <p>Wilson. When you found the Watch drawing out of your Pocket, pray why did not you lay hold of it?</p>
               <p>Glasspool. 'Twas done so suddenly, that I had not Time. - I stood at the Jew's Door a quarter of an Hour, and then she came out and run into another House; and while I was waiting at this Door, Wilson came out with her Petticoats over her Head, and went into the House where Solomon now was. I got into this House, and here they offer'd to be searched.</p>

            . Glasspool was at my House that Night about Ten o'Clock, and he had his Watch when he went away. The little Girl has got a Husband, one Solomon (a Jew) and he came to me and said, if the Man would not prosecute, he should have his Watch again.</p>
               <p>Wilson. The Man told me when he and we were together, that he had been in Company with some Women, and had lost his Watch. He wanted me to be concerned with him in a very sad, ugly Thing which I am ashamed to speak of, and because I would not consent, he said he would swear it upon me. He was very troublesome in our Court, and call'd Watch, Watch, and I got a Watchman and a Constable to get him home.</p>
               <p>James Hill. Wilson lived at the Waterman's-Arms, St. Mary Overies Stairs. (I come to give her a Character.) After that she liv'd at the African Coffee-House; she behav'd well, and was a clean Girl.</p>

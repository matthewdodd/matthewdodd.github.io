             The waistcoat was delivered to me at the Justice's; I had a little business to do, and I gave it my uncle to take home, and he had put it into his drawer, but it has since been taken away by somebody; I know that and the shirts were the prosecutor's property. The prisoner had got a watch, two rings, and a pair of silver buckels when taken, but I do not know of any he had before; he was taken up on the 14th of March.</p>

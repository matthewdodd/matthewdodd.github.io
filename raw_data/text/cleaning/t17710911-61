On the 25th of July I came down to send my boy into the city; I found him serving the prisoner at the bar. I went to serve her with some lace. She had a yard and quarter cut off, and another piece about two yards and a half; and after that she wanted some ribbons; I saw her fling the lace on the ground, between her and the counter. I came back and shewed her the ribbons, which she liked very well; she wanted to know what it came to. I measured it, and said it come to 39 s. She wanted to go out to get some more money. I suspected she had concealed this lace; she had stooped with a pretence to tie her garter. I wanted her to pay for the lace I had cut off. My wife came round the counter and said to her, you don't want to buy lace, for you have a piece under your arm; and as soon as she had taken that from her, I took hold of her arm, and said I believe you have some lace about you, and desired to search her. She would not let me; but said she had no more. I sent the boy for the constable, and when she saw him, she said she would give me what she had if I would not let the constable in; then she pulled this card out. The constable went away. I desired to search her; she would not let me. I then told her I would send for the constable again. I sent for him, and went to Sir

               <p>I am very innocent; I know nothing of it; they were found beside the counter; because I would not pay for the lace they had cut off, they charged me with the robbery. I had a guinea and a half in my pocket; he said before the constable came in, he would have me taken before the justice; I said it was only spite, because I would not have the two yards and a half that were cut off for me. It is very hard I should be so long in confinement, and innocent-in the affair. I buy and sell clothes.</p>

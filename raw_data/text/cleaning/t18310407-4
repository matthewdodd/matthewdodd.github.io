            . I am an officer of the Police. I met the three prisoners on the 15th of March, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, in Bermondsey-street, near Tooley-street, between three and four miles from Golden-square -Jones had got a coat tied up in an apron or handkerchief; Collins had a gown tied up in something - McMahon had nothing that I saw then; I asked Jones what he had in his bundle - he said a coat; I examined and found it was a very good coat, lined with fur - I asked Collins what she had; she said a gown, and it was so - I asked them where they had brought the things from; they said from Lisson-grove, and were going to take the coat on board a ship, that the gown was the woman's sister's - I told them I should take them to the station-house; they consented to go-in going along we met Hack, the inspector; he examined the coat and gown, and told me to take them on to the station, which I did - I showed the things to him there; I then searched McMahon, and found a gold watch inside her cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Who said they brought it from Lisson-grove? A.They all said so; the two women said they were sisters, and that Jones was their brother - she had the gown in her hand not concealed at all.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HACK. I am inspector of the Police. I met Allen in conversation with the three prisoners - he said he had stopped them to inquire what they had got; I put my hand into Jones' bundle, and found the coat was a very valuable one - I then examined the bundle containing the gown, which Collins said her sister had given her; I told Allen to take them to the station - I followed them there, ordered him to search them, and done up in the knot of McMahon's hair, I saw him find this gold watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070008"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the distance from the prosecutor's house to where they were taken? A. About two miles and a half or three miles, I should think.</p>
               <p>MRS. WARD. This is my watch; I had it a few days after McMahon came into my service - it cost about thirty-five guineas; it is no doubt worth thirty guineas - this is my husband's coat; I saw it that morning in one of the drawers in the bed-room - this gown I saw about two o'clock, laying on my bed; I did not miss any thing except the watch till the morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your gown? A. Yes - it cost nearly 4l.; I wore it but once or twice - the coat has been worn a good deal, but was very expensive when made.</p>
               <p>McMahon's Defence. The other two prisoners are innocent.</p>
               <p>Collins and Jones put in the following written Defence:- "On the 15th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, as John Jones and I were returning from the Olympic theatre, we met

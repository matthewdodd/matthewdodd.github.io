               <p>- Fletcher. I was on duty at Somerset-house on the 22d of January, and was stationed at the back of the Savoy. I saw two men, between ten and eleven o'clock at night at the water-side; I challenged them; they ran away at first; then one said to the other, D - n it, it is only the sentry. Then they came back; they passed me, and went among the craft. I know one to be Hart. I went back to my post, and in five minutes time the same two men came up, each had a sack on his shoulder; they went up towards the Strand; I followed them to the steps that went up to the Strand; Hart called me by my name. I said, I don't know you. He said, D - n it, don't you know Will. Hart? then I recollected it was a man I had been at a trial with. I gave information of it to Mr. Smith; in consequence of that, Hart was taken up; at first he denied it, afterwards he confessed that he and Field stole the oats, and sold them to a baker in St. Ann's-lane, Westminster.</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed this evidence respecting the confession, and that they sold the oats and some sacks at the baker's, but that the sacks had no marks.</p>

               <p>I am innocent; if I confessed any thing, it was when I was very much in liquor.</p>

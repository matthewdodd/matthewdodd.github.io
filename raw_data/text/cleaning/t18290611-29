               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You keep a public-house? A. No, Sir, there has been no licence to it for fifteen years; the prisoner was more like a charwoman than a servant - she slept in the house; she came there first as a lodger - I had a man in the house who worked for me; the prisoner had been there twelve days - I am certain I locked up these spoons the night before; these two spoons were on a tea-caddy - the bar door was locked outside; I got my dinner in the bar, and when I went out, I locked it up again, and shut the outer door - she was up stairs for what I know; her bedroom was on the first floor, over the tap-room - she slept in a room opposite mine; we slept in separate rooms.</p>

            . On the evening of the 19th of May, a man told me that Nelly had been robbing her lodgings- I went to a lodging-house and took her, about eight o'clock in the evening; I took her to a public-house, and found these spoons in her pocket - she said it was the cursed drink, and I do not think she was sober at that time; she said at first it was distress - I said that could not be, as she had had a sovereign at the Bench, on the Wednesday, which she said was to get some things, to come to live at the King's Arms, public-house, in St. Paul's-church-yard, and she was to return it in six months, instead of that she went and spent the money; she then said "Don't ask me any more questions, I am quite ashamed of myself."</p>

            . I am sixteen years old, and live in Ropemaker-street, Finsbury - my father is a turncock belonging to the New River company; I was an errand-boy, and left my place on Saturday last. On the 1st of December I was in a shop on Snow-hill, and saw Mr. Green within two yards of me; I saw the prisoner and two others behind him - the prisoner was taking out the handkerchief; they were all three in company: he took the handkerchief out of Mr. Green's pocket, and gave it to one of the other two, in a fustian jacket; I went and told Mr. Green - I ran with him, and never lost sight of the prisoner; I saw him, taken - the other two ran down the alley before him; I am quite sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You was in a shop, and there was a crowd and a cart? A.There was nobody to prevent my seeing them; a cart stood by the curb - Mr. Green was reading something; there was nobody but these three near him: the prisoner said at Guildhall that he would thrust a knife through me.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor brought the prisoner to my house; he was very rough, and swore at the boy and all of us - he said openly before the Magistrate, that he would thrust a knife into the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman named Wingfield said at Guildhall, that my name was Murray, which it is, as I had given my mother's maiden name; I certainly made use of the words in consequence of that, but did not say I would stick a knife into him.</p>

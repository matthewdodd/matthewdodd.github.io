E. He snatched that away from me; I cried out for help. The prisoner struck me three or four times; after that Mr. Webb came up; he secured the prisoner; I never lost sight of the prisoner. I saw Mr. Webb pick up the veil. The prisoner did not strike me until after he got the veil. It was a sudden snatch, the taking of the veil, and the miniature.</p>

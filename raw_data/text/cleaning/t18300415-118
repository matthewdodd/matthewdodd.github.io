On the 21st of February our premises were broken into, and these bridles and saddles were taken from the counting-house, where they were safe on the 20th, between five and seven o'clock in the evening, and at half-past nine the next morning I knew the place was broken, and the articles were gone - the bridles have not been found; I know this saddle by the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have no other mark on it? A. No - the maker is Mr. Hall; he is an extensive maker.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. I fastened his premises up about twelve o'clock at night, on the 20th of February; there were four saddles there then, to my knowledge; a man called me up between five and six o'clock next morning, and told me the premises were open - I came down, and found it was so; the door had been unlocked, and thrown open - I went into the counting-house, and missed the bridles; I did not miss the saddle: there were three saddles on the horse - I cannot swear to this saddle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not thrown down the keys to the farrier? A. Yes, between five and six o'clock in the morning, and then I went down and found the doors open - whether he opened them or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you threw down the keys did you go down? A. Not three minutes; he called to me for the keys, and then said the door was open.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 21st of February I stopped the prisoner in Holborn, carrying this saddle, concealed under his great coat, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning; I asked what he had there- he said a saddle, his own property, which he got from Mr. Biggs, at Brixton - I said I knew Mr. Biggs; he then said, "I brought it from my own place, at Brick-street;" I was going there, but a man met me, and I went with him to the prosecutor's - I found a pane of glass had been cut out of the window, and some one had got in; the door opens with a spring lock; a person not so stout as the prisoner could have got in where the pane was out - I took the saddle to Mr. Anderson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it is clear the prisoner could not have got in the window? A. I do not think he could- I cannot tell whether he got it from any one else.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had met a man in Piccaditly, who employed him to carry the saddle to Holborn, where he would meet him.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. ANDERSON. Q. Do you swear positively to the saddle? A. Yes; I do not believe any one has blue girths but us - I swear positively this is the saddle we lost.</p>

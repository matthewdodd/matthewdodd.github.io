            . I am in the employ of a pawnbroker in Guildford-street. I produce a table-cloth, five napkins, and a little toilet-box, which I bought of the prisoner on the 30th of August; I had before that, seen a book in his possession, with I Peel upon it - I heard of the robbery, and put the box by, expecting to see him again: he came some time afterwards, and asked me to buy some tablecloths which were in pawn: I said I would, and told him to bring the duplicate - he brought an affidavit of them, and I went and got them out; these are the articles - I saw L.P. on them: he came again at seven o'clock, as I had told him, and he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I went to the house, and examined the door; it had not been forced - it must have been opened with a key: I examined the box, and found it had been opened in a very coarse manner, by a chisel.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

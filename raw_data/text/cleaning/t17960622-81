               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Fletcher: Some time in the week preceding Sunday the 12th of June, I carried some of my things to the servant to wash. On the Monday morning they were gone, and the prisoner was gone; I went after him in order to recover my property; there was a person with the prisoner on the Sunday of the name of Webber, who had accidentally left his direction where he lodged, at No. 5, Derby-court, Piccadilly; upon that I concluded it was likely the prisoner would be there; I went after him, and when I got there and enquired where Webber lived, I suppose he had seen me, but he ran out of the court; I ran about two or three turnings after him, and took him in a stable-yard, I did not notice the street particularly; when I took him there was a person of the name of Limerick coming along, who went with him to Bow-street; he had two table spoons and some duplicates found upon him; Limerick belonged to the office.</p>

               <p>Andrews. I went to Messrs. Patmore and Berry, pawnbrokers on Ludgate-hill, with the duplicates; I think there were two or three; I delivered the duplicates to their shopmen, and they produced the articles at Bow-street.</p>

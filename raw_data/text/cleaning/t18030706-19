               <p>GEORGE WHITE sworn. - I am a mason, at No. 29, Windmill-street, Finsbury-square: On Thursday the 16th of June, I was looking out of my parlour window, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Poynder's yard, in Hill-street, with two boards on his shoulder, which appeared to me to be scassolding-boards; I saw him go to the corner of Paul-street, and put them off his shoulder; I thought he went into a house, but I could not see whether he did or not; Mr. Reeve's is the corner of Paul-street; in a few minutes he returned, and setched one more board; he took the saw a direction; then I saw him and another labourer go to the King's Arms public-house.</p>

               <p>- REEVE sworn. - I am a carpenter, at No. 5, Paul-street; the prisoner came to me between eight and nine in the morning of the 16th of June, and asked me if I bought old boards; I told him, yes; he brought me one; he asked me half a crown, and I gave him two shillings; then he brought me four more, I gave him nine shillings for them; and then two more, and I gave him five shillings and sixpence; then two more at five shillings and sixpence; and then three more at eight shillings and sixpence; I shewed them to Mr. Poynder, and he claimed them.(One of the boards produced and identified by Mr. Poynder.)</p>

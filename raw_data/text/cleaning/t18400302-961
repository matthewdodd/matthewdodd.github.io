                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Edward Anstee, a butcher, in Oxford-market. On the 27th of February, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner come and take from the board a breast of mutton and a piece of beef—he ran off—I pursued him to Tichfield-street—he first dropped the beef in the market, and then he threw the mutton over an area—a gentleman stopped him—he was brought back, and the mutton was found.</p>

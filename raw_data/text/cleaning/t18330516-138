             (police-constable H 150). I received information, and went to the work shop - I found the work had been cut off by a left-handed man, and I have ascertained that the prisoner is left-handed; I then went to several public-houses in search of the prisoner; but could not find him till ten minutes before one o'clock, when he was coming home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home at half-past nine o'clock- I went up stairs, but my bed was not made - Mr. Lee and his wife came home directly afterwards, and asked who was in the shop; I told them it was me - I then went and had a pint of beer, and when I was coming back, I was taken - this is the third time these people have been accused, and no doubt they have taken the silk and sold it - I have worked twelve months in their shop; they make yards and yards of silk and sell it.</p>
               <p>MARY LEE. I was robbed in a house I lived in before this one; I was out, and some one broke in, and cut the silk; but the neighbours stopped it; it was not taken away.</p>

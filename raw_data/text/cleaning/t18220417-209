             inhabited a house, belonging to me - I saw the lead work safe about a week before. I found the prisoner in custody with some lead. I then went to the house in Maida-vale, Paddington, and found all the pipes and edges stripped off. I saw it compared with the house, it fitted.</p>

            . I am a hay binder, and live in Charles-street, Lisson Green. I was at work in a rick-yard, near this house, on Monday the 15th of April, about ten or eleven in the morning, and under some rubbish I found a piece of lead, about a hundred yards from the house, and about two yards further I found more. I told Wallis, and watched, and about half-past seven o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner with it on his back, about a hundred yards from the place where it was concealed. I asked what he had on his back; he answered nothing - I found it was the lead; it weighed about 50 lbs. He took us back to the place, and shewed us where he had it from, and four pieces were left behind - it weighed in all 236 lbs. He said he was nearly all night getting it there. I saw one piece fitted to the roof.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Nevitt. I work close by the premises. I watched the place where the lead was concealed, and about half-past seven o'clock saw the prisoner come and take it away from the place. Langton stopped him - there was four more pieces of lead left behind. He said he took it off a house at Kilburn, and it took him nearly all night to get it there. I saw it fitted to the prosecutor's house, and have no doubt of its being taken from there.</p>

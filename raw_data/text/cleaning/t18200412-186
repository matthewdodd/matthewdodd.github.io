We had two pots of beer together, but finding he was no shipmate of mine, I went into another box - the prisoner then came and asked me to let her have some gin and water. I did not sit above two minutes there. She then went out - there was no other person on the same side as I sat. On the other side of the box there was a millwright. When I went out of the door she was there, and asked me to go home with her, which I refused. She then snatched my watch, and ran up a court; I ran after her, when two men came up and knocked me down. I went home and washed myself, being bruised, and described her to an officer, who apprehended her the same evening. The watch was afterwards brought to my house by a child, but not the seal. I am sure the prisoner is the woman, I have seen her before.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information from Mrs. Huxley that her husband had been robbed - he appeared to have been cut. He described the prisoner's dress and person. About six o'clock, I found her at the Blakeney's-head - I told her the charge, which she denied. He was not intoxicated, for he gave a clear account of the affair and of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along Cable-street, and met a sailor whom I knew; I asked him to treat me, and he said he had no money - this man came up and said he would treat us. I went to the Blakeney's-head to redeem a ticket which I had left with the landlady, she then detained me till an officer came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook of a ship. On the 20th of October, I fell in with the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway, about nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—she asked where I was going, and if I would go home with her—I went with her—when I went in, she asked if I would sit down—I said, "No"—she asked me to stop all night—I said, No, I wanted to be on board, and that I had no money—she said, "You have got a watch, go pawn it"—I said I did not know where there was a pawnbroker—she took me to a shop—I pawned my watch, and put the duplicate into my pocket, with the two half-crowns which I received—the prisoner was talking to a woman—she said, "Are you all right?"—I said, "I suppose it is"—she said, "Let me look at the duplicate"—I showed it to her—she said, "It is all right," and I put it into my pocket"—I have seen my watch since at the office.</p>

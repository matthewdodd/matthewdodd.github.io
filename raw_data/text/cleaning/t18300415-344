            . I am footman to Mr. George Davison. On the 12th of March I came with the carriage to Mr. Helps, Bartholomew-hospital, and then went to my master's town house, to fetch his great coat, which I put into the carriage, under the back seat; I left the carriage at the bottom of <placeName id="t18300415-344-crimeloc1862">Fore-street</placeName>

            . I live in the neighbourhood. This carriage stood at the public-house door, and nobody with it; I knew the prisoner by his using the house at the corner of the court where I live - I saw him open the carriage door, and bring out the coat; I was not two yards from him - it was a dark coat - he walked away with it; I went on an errand, and saw the coachman in a quarter of an hour, and told him; I should have called Stop thief! but I was in a great hurry to go on an errand.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 17th; Brown had given me information on the 12th - I went to look for a man named Thomas, at the Hinds public-house that night, understanding her to say it was Thomas, but it seems she said Thomes.</p>

On the evening of the 17th of May I was at work at the front window, and saw the prisoner at the door of No. 38, which is opposite; he was endeavouring to get the padlock off the door - I watched him, and saw him go to the end of the street, and then return to the door; he was still endeavouring to take the padlock off; he opened it about half-past eight o'clock, then went in, and shut the door after him - I informed Mr. Fenn, my landlord.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in Frith-street. On the evening of the 17th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, in consequence of what Farris said, I went over to No. 38 with a person who was then in my shop; I found the door ajar; I stood on one side, and the other person on the other, and in a few minutes we saw the prisoner coming out of the shop, with some tools under his arm, and some before him; I said,"My friend, what do you do here? who are you? do you work for Mr. Sawyer?" he said, "Yes, I am Mr. Sawyer's man;" I sent for Mr. Sawyer and the Policeman - the prisoner managed to lay the tools down on the bench, close inside the door - the officer came, and took him.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARRACK. I went to the door with Ferris, and what he has stated is correct; when the prisoner came to the door, and we asked what he was going to do with the tools, he shifted them before him - I said, "Where are you going?" he said, "I am going out;" I said,"Not out of here till somebody comes" - the officer took the same tools which the prisoner had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take two head planes to the station-house, and then say they were not them? A. I took none; the officer took two small planes at first, and then I said there were two larger planes, which he had in his hand - I went back, and pointed them out to the officer.</p>

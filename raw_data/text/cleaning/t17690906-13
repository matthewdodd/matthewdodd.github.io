            . I am a waterman. On the sixth of last month I had a charge of coffee at <placeName id="t17690906-13-crimeloc73">Fresh wharf</placeName>

He was watching for a merchant. I was sitting on a chair close by the coffee, rather heavy for sleep. I missed the prisoner, and asked the watchman on the key to lend me his lanthorn to look at the casks; going round, I found the prisoner up at the farther end, by the side of the casks. I found a hole bored in a cask of about six or seven inches from the ground in the bulge, and the coffee was running out, with an apron under to catch it; whose apron it was, I know not. The prisoner was about five or six yards from it. I laid hold of him, and found coffee in his pocket. He wanted me to let him put it into the cask again.</p>

               <p>I had been working there all day. I was asked to watch with a black man. The black man said here is coffee on the key, and it is a pity we cannot get some for our wives breakfasts.

             gave the black man a handkerchief. I was going round to do my occasions, and seeing some coffee lying on the ground, I took it up; after that I met this man with the black, he came up to the door, and said, Have you not something about you? I said, yes, some coffee, which I picked up. I saw no hole in the cask.</p>

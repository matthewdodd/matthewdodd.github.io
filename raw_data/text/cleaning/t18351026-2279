On the 19th of October, in the evening, I saw the prisoners at Charlton fair, in Kent—I watched them for some time, and saw them attempt to pick several pockets—I at last saw them go behind a gentleman who stood in front of a stall, and saw Freeman put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, take a handkerchief out, and di<lb></lb>rectly pass it to Cullyford, who was in company with him—I immediately took hold of Freeman; and Wild, another constable, took Cullyford—I told the gentleman what had happened—he went with us to the station-house, and gave the name of Johnson, living in Chapel-place, Woolwich—we could find no such person or place at Woolwich—there is Chapel-row, but we could not find him there—I am certain it was out of his pocket the handkerchief was taken.</p>

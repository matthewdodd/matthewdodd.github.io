                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to give any opinion from the taste of brandy, whether it is the same sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I can give a very good opinion—the exact strength of it must be tested by an instrument—this brandy from cask is a shade paler than the other—this may be a little tinged by the bladder—the taste is exactly similar—I believe them to be the same brandy, and finer brandy I believe was never tasted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is a difference in the strength that you cannot tell by the taste? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not enough to tell by the taste—the lightest is from the casks of course—the brandy in the bladder may be a little tinged by the bladder, and the loss of strength is accounted for by its being more exposed—this is the bladder it was in, and a nicer thing made for the purpose I never saw—this neck could be used with a gimlet—the bore of the gimlet is rather larger than this—this neck might be put in and turned down, so that an officer would not have discovered it—no wet would have escaped from the hole—I have seen a good many straight ones—I never saw one like this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion, from your knowledge, that this brandy was of the same bulk originally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say it certainly was—it appears to me to be the same liquor.</p>

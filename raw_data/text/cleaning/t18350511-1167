                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at St. Ann's, Limehouse. I let lodgings, and take in washing—in February last the prisoner came to my house, and said he was going to work in the West India docks as a permanent man—I let him a bed and room for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he remained seven weeks and five days—he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the first week—I said I was very much distressed, and could not board him without money—he said he would get a ship and go out as steward, and leave me his two months advance-note, which would set all to rights—he afterwards said he was going in the Antelope for Jamaica, at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—he showed me the note, and said he must have clothes, or he could not go—I advanced him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I let him have some clothes, which I valued at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked if I had a pen and ink—I gave him one—he said he would sign his name on the back, or it would not do—he signed his name and read it to me, and gave it to me as a just note for payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the note—I put it up stain in my drawer—the policeman came to me on the Saturday, and I gave him the note—he told me it was forged—the prisoner was then in custody—I got a waterman to take the note to the Antelope—the people there said it was a just note, provided he went out in the ship—I inquired for Edmonds the master, at Eltham-place, Blackheath, but could find nobody of that name—the prisoner wrote the large writing on the back of the note—I saw him do it.</p>

               <p>Yes; to Eltham-place—I saw Eltham-place written up, and I saw the tax-gatherer, who said he had no such name on his books—the prisoner owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time he gave me the note—I saw the Antelope lying off Deptford—I went before the Magistrate the first time he was examined, on the 4th of April—I never objected to go before the Magistrate—I did not say I would not prosecute him—he said he had been living with his father and mother before he came to me—he said he had prize-money coming to him—it was in consequence of what the policeman told me that I suspected it—I thought it was a just note before—I inquired for Edmonds at seven or eight houses—there are six or seven houses in Eltham-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner came to me at the station-house on Saturday, the 4th of April, and said he wished to give himself up for forgery; that he had forged a bill for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had given it to Mrs. Horncastle, of Limehouse—I went to her, and she gave me the bill—I went with her to Blackheath, and made inquiry for the master or owner of the Antelope, but could find nobody of the name of Edmonds—I returned to the station-house, and told him he had given me a <hi rend="italic">chase</hi> about the bill—he said, "I told you before you went that I wrote it myself, I put the first thing that came into my head; I did not know there was such a ship as the Antelope."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did this take place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Hoxton station-house—he seemed sober—he said he wished to give himself into custody for forgery—I asked him who it concerned—he said, Mrs. Horn<lb></lb>castle, at Limehouse, and described the street to me—my inspector was present—the station-house is half an hour's walk from Mrs. Horncastle's—I went down the river between Deptford and Greenwich, but could find no Antelope—I found nothing on him—he directed me to a house which I knew to be a brothel, and I found his portmanteau there—he desired me to take care of it—I found papers in it which I have not brought here.</p>

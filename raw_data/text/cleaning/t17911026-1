I left my house on Sunday the 14th of August, about six in the afternoon, it was then safe; there was no person in my apartments, which are separate from the other parts of the house, and has a different entrance; it is a house let out in different tenements; the landlord does not reside in it; I left my house, and double locked the door about five, or half past five, and all my windows. I returned about a quarter past nine, or before ten, it was rather dark, not quite dark, I could discern people so as to know them. When I came up to my door a woman stood upon the step, I saw the prisoner in the shop; I immediately seized him, and took him with assistance to the Talbot; when he was searched there nothing was found upon him, but in the struggle I took a child's skirt and stays from him. I returned from the Talbot inn, and I got a lodger to stand at my door while I went to the Talbot. I found my drawers broke open by violence, I lost a 10 l. bank note, and about 20 l. in cash, gold and silver, some guineas, some half guineas, crowns and shillings. I have never recovered any part of my property. There was violence on the shop door, the lock appeared to be picked.</p>

               <p>Who is your landlord? - Mr. Edmonds, two doors from me.</p>
               <p>You found a woman at the door, she went away on your coming up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about the stays at the Talbot? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Turner? - Yes, very slightly.</p>
               <p>Do you know Collyer? - Yes, I had a lodger of that name, the prisoner is acquainted with him.</p>

I have the fellow to this skirt, it is my property, I know it by being my own work; it was kept in a drawer that was broke open. I do not know when I saw it before, but I believe a week before; the value of it is about 18 d. the skirt and stays are attached to each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you call these things skirt and stay, or stay and skirt? - Sometimes one and sometimes the other, they are washed separate, but worn together.</p>
               <p>I suppose you call the thing which a child wears under its chin in the month a pair of stays? - No, I do not, I call it a stay.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow objected to the naming of the stays and skirt together, and said the indictment was erroneous. The Court overruled the objection.)</p>

I saw the prisoner running; I stopped the prisoner, he was taken to the Talbot inn, the prosecutor had hold of him at the same time; I saw the prisoner put his right hand in his pocket, and throw something away, it looked like a handkerchief or napkin. I heard something sound, I followed the sound, and picked up an instrument, it is called a crow, I believe it is the same instrument.</p>

On Christmas-day some property was found in the prisoner's boxes; she had been in his employ for about six weeks - she was going away; she opened her box herself, and the articles stated were found, there were ten yards of calico, some children's pinafores, a pair of nut-crackers, and other things; she said some were put in by mistake, and some she had given her - there were two table-cloths and some soap found in a bundle which she had taken to a place where she was going to lodge - we sent for the bundle: it was opened in my presence - she did not give any account of the table-cloths; they were not new - here is a swan stock, which is new, and that she said she bought at Broomyard, where she came from, but it has our mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were not some of these wrappers used in the shop? A. Yes. I had no particular quarrel with her - the apprentice had, but I had not; she threw the footman at my head, but I would not quarrel with her: her box had not been taken away and brought back again - there was a pair of gaiters in it; they had not been thrown away.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking on the deck of the Sincerity; the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I knew where the mate of the Ruse was; I told him, no, I did not know where he was, but I believed he was gone on shore; he said that he belonged to the Ruse, that he was obliged to sleep on shore the night before, on account of the master and mate having taken the key out of the batch, and he could not get below; he said, he was then come for his dirty linen to get them washed, but he could not get below, because the captain and mate were gone on shore; he asked me if I had a key that I could lend him; I told him, no; he said, if he had a hammer, he would break the lock; I made him no answer to that; at the time he was talking to me, a man on board the Ruse called out, and told him, he had found the key of the batch; he immediately left me, and went on board the Ruse; the vessels were both along-side the wharf, but they lay so near together, that they could get from one to the other; a few minutes after, Birch came down upon the wharf; I told him, a young man that belonged to his vessel had been inquiring for him; he told me there was nobody belonging to the vessel but himself and the master, and he asked me if it was the master; I told him it was not; he saw somebody on board the vessel, and he called to them, and asked them what they did there; the answer they made him, what was it to him; he said, yes, it was to him; I saw a boat go away from the Ruse directly; whether there was one man or two in it I cannot say; Birch immediately came over our vessel, and went on board his own, and he saw the prisoner at the bar on the deck of the Ruse, and he called me to come and assist him; I came to his assistance, and held the prisoner while he went below; he went below, and said, he had missed all these clothes; he took the prisoner away. That is all I know about it.</p>

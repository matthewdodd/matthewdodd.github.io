Between five and six o'clock in the evening, on the 31st of December, I saw the two prisoners and another in company - they passed the prosecutor's shop two or three times; Seelie then placed himself against the door - Raeburn stood on one side of him, and the other on the other side; they looked round three or four times, to see if any one was coming - Seelie then turned round, put his hand inside the door, and took out two pairs of stockings - he went away, and Raeburn went up to him and had his hat off to put the stockings in; Raeburn looked at them -Pritchard came up; I said, "They have got them;" we crossed, and they ran off in different directions - I ran and caught Racburn; Pritchard brought Seelie, with the property.</p>

               <p>Seelie's Defence. I left home to go to Kensington, and the Policeman ran after me; a parcel of boys ran by, and one of them dashed down the stockings at my feet.</p>

I was on duty in Clarence-street, Greenwich, on 30th May; Mr. Thame, the brother of the landlord of the Salutation, spoke to me—his person exhibited marks of violence, and he wanted the prisoner to be taken for assaulting him—I went with him to the public-house, he pointed out the prisoner, and gave him in charge—on my going towards the prisoner, he went down the steps at the water side, and went into a boat—some of his companions followed me, and told him to come out from the boat, and never mind the policeman—he then came up to me, and said, "I am the man; take me into custody, if you think you are able"—I said, "You must go with me to the station-house, and settle it quietly with Mr. Thame"—he said he would see me d—d first, and if I fetched all my force, I should not take him—I said, "You are very obstinate; give me your name and address"—he gave me his name and address—I gave it to Mr. Thame, and told him he must summon him—he said he knew nothing of him, I must take him—I went down and told the prisoner he must come with me—he struck me in the face, and ran off the steps on to the pier—I followed him to the pier, and he struck me again—we bad a <hi rend="italic">tustle</hi> there for a minute or two—there were some sticks used—I got several blows on my head, and was insensible—when I came to myself, I was on my way to the station—I found my head was cut—I was confined a month, and a fortnight of the time to my bed—I had not struck the prisoner before he struck me—he was the worse for liquor—my skin was broken, I bled a great deal—I have the scars now.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Eagle. On 30th May, I was going to the water-side to take a boat—I met Mr. Thame with his hand up to his eye—I went for the policeman—when he came, he was surrounded by a mob of people—the prisoner said he would not go, and all the force should not take him—he commenced fighting with the constable, first with his fist, and then with an instrument, either a cane or a mop—the constable was struck on the head and body—the persons who assisted the prisoner, jumped into a boat and rowed off—I and two officers got into a boat and rowed after them, but could not overtake them.</p>

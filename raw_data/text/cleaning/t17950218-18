Where is the locket? - I have it; I was going down Parliament-street, and there was a man before me, and I saw a small parcel lay, that was wrapped up in a brown paper, and I was going to stoop for it, and the prisoner stooped before me, and said, he had picked up a prize; I said, halves, to the prisoner; the prisoner asked me whether it was a usual thing to give half of what was found? I told him I had heard say it was; and then we crossed over together into the Park, and he met with an old gentleman, and he said he would go up to this old gentleman and ask him where the king's jeweller lived.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the old gentleman that you met with? - Yes, that is the old gentleman that we met with. Then we went to the chair in the Park and sat down; the other that was with this prisoner said he was a captain of a ship, and he said he had a friend in town, a gentleman of whom he could get the value that was in the note; the two hundred and fifty pounds that was in the bill with the locket.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the prisoner at the bar was the man that you met afterwards in the Park? - Yes, and then we went on and came into Oxford-street, we turned down a street on our left hand, and went in and had a pint of beer, and some words, I don't know what passed, and afterwards they went down to my house in Mortimer-street; all the party, the prisoner that was tried before, and the prisoner at the bar, and myself, and they had the hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only this one hundred pounds in bank notes, had you? - Only this one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what happened in your house? - They took them off from the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they on the table? - They had agreed to have the hundred pounds till on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Mr. Smith? - I know the woman; she came to our house, and her husband came with her; cur tap-room is kitchen and taproom altogether; it was the Saturday after Peters was taken up, I don't know what they came for, but seeing Mrs. Smith look a decent woman I asked her back into the parlour along with me, and when we were in the parlour she told me the business she came was relative to this Mr. Peters, that she would make it up for a hundred pounds, for she had promised the thief-taking men fifty pounds, and said she never should have known him, only the thief taking men said he was the person; she thought he was a much younger man, quite a smart young man.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to go to your house for all this? - I don't know; I see her a decent looking woman, I asked her into the parlour; I never knew any thing of her before in my life.</p>

            What is your reason for believing that he was there at Mayne's house? - I believe it, because I know he did go to Mavne's house, and Mrs. Smith said that she would not appear against him, for she only wanted the money, and could not tell whether he was the man or no, only what these thief-taking men told her.</p>

               <p>Q.

I spoke to Peters about it, and he said, he would not; then they told me it was to be an hundred pounds, and Lucas and Mayne were to have fifty.</p>

               <p>Q. Who told you so? - Lucas and Smith; we had a long conversation, and I am certain there had been two applications to the prisoner at the bar to make it up.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Smith. I know nothing further than this, that as we had been at the loss, we had better give it up than get into further trouble.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear of his having been taken up on this indictment? - On the Sunday morning he was taken on this charge, he came with Lucas and Mayne, the two officers, to my house; Lucas made this observation to me, that he thought I was somewhat interested for Mr. Peters, an account of an estate which Peters was entitled to, that I had advanced money on it, that they had just then taken him, and wished to know if I would either give a note or promise any sum of money; that Mrs. Smith had never seen him, and that they would undertake to turn him up before the magistrate, and they took him from my house to Mayne's, in Ratcliffe-highway, and told me that he should remain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180042"></xptr>there for two or three days, in hopes of my coming forward with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any body else about any business of this sort? - Lucas came to me after that, alone, I believe it might be six or seven days after; it was the day before he was going to have his examination, and he told me if I could procure him ten guineas he would endeavour to get him off for a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Peters; - Some years; I have a very honest good opinion of him.</p>

               <p>CHARLES THOROWGOOD. I am an officer of the City. I was on duty in Cornhill, and saw the prisoner, in company with another person, following a gentleman into Finch-lane, which induced me to watch them; they returned from that gentleman - I still watched them, and observed Mr. Tabor walking arm-in-arm with a gentleman in Cornhill, and at the corner of Bishopsgate-street there was a stoppage with the carriages; I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Tabor's pocket, and take out this handkerchief - I took hold of him: he turned round, and dropped it at his feet - I said, "What have you got here?" he said he knew nothing about it; his companion ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said, "You have got the gentleman's handkerchief;" I said, "I have not:" you said, "If you have not got it the other one has." Witness. I did not - it laid at your feet.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He saw the handkerchief five or six yards off, and pulled me to it; another lad, who was before me, had taken it, and threw it down - I bad been to Honey-lane with some brooms for my master; nobody was with me.</p>

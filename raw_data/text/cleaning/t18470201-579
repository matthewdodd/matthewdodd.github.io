On Saturday night, the 23rd of Jan., about half-past twelve o'clock, I was on my way home—I stopped at the corner of Market-street—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me to go with her—I said, "No"—I had gone there for a purpose of my own, and was in the act of adjusting my dress—she put one hand round my waist and the other in my pocket, and took out a sovereign and a half—I seized her hand, and the sove<lb></lb>reign dropped on the ground—I made an attempt to pick it up—she knocked me in the eye, and knocked me down—I called "stop thief!" and ran after her—she was stopped in Pread-street, and I gave her in charge—I am cer<lb></lb>tain I had a sovereign, three half-sovereigns and a shilling in my pocket, and I may have had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was perfectly sober.</p>

On the 23rd of Jan., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Pread-street, I heard a cry of "stop thief," and saw the prisoner run—I ran after and caught her—she got away from me, I caught her again and held her—before Mr. Hutchings came up, she said, "Pray don't stop me, I have not robbed the gentleman, he dropped the money in the street"—I kept her till Mr. Hutchings came up—a policeman came, and she was given into custody.</p>

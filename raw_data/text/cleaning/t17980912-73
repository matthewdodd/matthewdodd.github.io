             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a stable-keeper and post-master in St. John's-square; I was in Smithfield at the time this business happened; I was waiting in Smithfield to try to buy some cheap hay; I observed a man who went under the denomination of a coachman, walking along very well dressed, and a gay companion with him, that looked as if he was a lieutenant or a midshipman; they kept walking from Snow-hill till they got near Long-lane, by themselves, and sometimes one first, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see those two persons in Court now? - A. Yes, those are the two men at the bar; one of them I have known many years, I never saw the other before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the man that you knew before? - A. The prisoner, Atterbury, but I did not know him by that name before, I knew him by the name of Spungy; they walked on till within two rails of Long-lane, near the sheep-pens, called the rounds; before they quite quitted these rounds, there seemed to be a stoppage, and with that the short one, Dowles, took a short turn, and knocked up the prosecutor's bundle; I did not suspect that he had a shilling about him from his appearance; I did not take much notice, but saw the tall man, Atterbury, run away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near was he to the foreigner? - A. They were all three as close together as they could possibly be; when he turned round, the foreigner immediately made a great noise; I immediately ran up, I had not a dozen yards to run; I asked what was the matter; he took hold of his pocket, and said, me robbed of 41l. I then laid hold of Dowles, and said, Sir, you are a gentleman, but you are a party concerned, if this is a robbery, which I did not suspect it was; I held him a considerable time, while my acquaintance, a salesman, said, for God's sake hold him; they sent for an officer, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He shook very much, and said, me, Sir, and I said, oh yes, I saw you do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man, Spungy, the tall man? - A. He ran away down St. John's-street, and got clear off; he was not taken for seven or eight days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the tall man was one of them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him some years? - A. Yes, rather too well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were not there at the beginning of this transaction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you know there is 80l. reward if these men are convicted? - A. I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here before to day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were talking about buying hay and did not much attend to what passed, till there was a cry out? - A. There was no cry out till I made one, by laying hold of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You said to him, you are one of the men that I suppose is a party concerned? - A. No, I did not suppose it, I told him he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the prosecutor staggering along? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing remarkable in two men walking one before the other? - A. No, but they seemed to co-operate together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any body saying at the time, or the prosecutor saying to the short man, Dowles, that was not one of the men, and you made this reply, go along and be d-d? - A. I said no such a word.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you fairly, I shall call two witnesses to prove you did so? - A. I think you are very able to call two dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Having told you that fairly, I ask you again, did you or not make use of any expression similar to that? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120085"></xptr>Q. Did you not say, when a person observed that he could not be one of the men, that he was, go and be d-d? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The tall man was an old acquaintance of your's? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, you had known him a long time? - A. The town know him pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. The other young man was lucky enough never to be acquainted with you at all? - A. I do not know any thing of him, he had a little of it that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when he was searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon him belonging to the prosecutor? - A. I believe there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not run away, but was taken upon the spot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it you saw him do? - A. He knocked the bundle upwards with his hand, and immediately put his hand into the foreigner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see them converse together before they came up to the prosecutor? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see his hand in the pocket? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whose hand was it? - A. The tall man's; and he whipt his hand out again instantly.</p>

To the best of my recollection, it was the 2d, about a quarter before five; I had been in the Borough for my mistress, coming across from Cow-lane to Long-lane there seemed to be a bustle, and there was a foreigner very much intoxicated in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There was a little bit of bustle when you came up? - A.No, not before I came up; as I came along I saw him with a bundle and a stick across his shoulder, and I saw a young man passing by at the same time, in a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the young man before? - A. I never saw him, to my knowledge. As he passed by the foreigner, being in liquor, happened to turn round, and the stick slew up in his face, and as he put his hand to save the stick from going into his face, his hat sell on one side, and then there was a man immediately came and collared this young man in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that the immediate next thing that happened? - A. There was a man that passed by, and took something out of the foreigner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see that? - A. I saw the man take something from the foreigner's waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know who that man was that took something from the foreigner's waistcoat -Look at the prisoners, and see whether it was either of the men at the bar? - A. The man was pitted with the small-pox, I think it was something like that tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man appear to you to have been in company? - A. No; he was about a yard from the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Are you positive that the young man in the blue coat did not make the first attack upon the foreigner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were there, had you any conversation with any body? - A. Nobody in particular, only I gave my service so far, that I gave my address where I lived, and told them, if I could be of any service in regard of what I saw, I would come forward.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went the next day before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You live with Mr. Richards now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know who the young man was that knocked up the bundle? - A. The man that put up his hand to save the stick from going into his face, was that other young man at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Then what should have given him a shocking blow? - A. The end of the stick, it was a notched stick.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a stick do you mean by a notched stick? - A. I should know the stick again, if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a stick do you mean by a notched stick? - A. I do not know whether it was white or yellow.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it that you had seen that young man before? - A. Not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. From which way did he come to get to this foreigner? - A. He came from towards Cow-cross.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, any time in the month of August, being in Smithfield? - A. Yes. I was crossing Cow-lane, I had been in Fleet-market, there was a young man before me, as I was crossing there, in blue clothes, I was looking out after him, seeing how nice and clean he looked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in company with him? - A. Nobody at all; he walked along the side of the pens till he came to where there is a turning to go into Bartholomew-close; at the side of the haycart, there was a gentleman standing there, a foreigner, very much in liquor indeed, and he had a bundle on his shoulder; this young man was passing, and he put up his hand to prevent the stick going in his face; Mr. Plattin then came up, and collared the young man; I said to him, Sir, that young man is innocent of what you have taken him for, for I followed him from Cow-lane; Mr. Plattin replied to me, that I was an impudent b-h, I had no business with it.</p>

               <p>Q. And you are perfectly satisfied that that was the answer this civil Mr. Plattin made to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, if he has already told us, upon his oath, he made use of no such expression, he must have been incorrect? - A. He said so to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended the next day before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did attend, but the man that opened the door would not let me go in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the man at the bar - is that the man that you speak of? - A. I cannot say to the man again.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood close by him, you must recollect whether that is the man or not? - A. That young man I saw walk before me, in blue.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to doubt in just now? - A. I did not understand you, I thought you meant the gentlemen at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the tall man, I dare say he was not there? - A. I did not see that man then.</p>
               <p>Q. You will take an oath he was not there? - A. I did not see him, that young man was walking by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no tall man near him? - A. Nobody at all near him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see who took away the money from the poor foreigner's pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you do not know whether the bundle was touched before or after the foreigner was robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. All you say is, that there was nobody in company with that young man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not see the purse taken at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Plattin behaved extremely ill, I understand? - A. He abused me, and called me an impudent b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not see the property taken, how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120087"></xptr>came you to say to Plattin, that young man is innocent of what you have taken him for? - A. I saw that he was by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give your address? - A. I told the young man, if I could he of any service in speaking the truth of what I saw, I would.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Plattin). Q. Look at these two women - did you see either of them there? - A. I did not see them till about three minutes after, which is a good long time; this woman did come up with a brazen face, she went and saw them to the Compter, I did also; and I went to enquire the foreigner's character where they make the images, and they said he was a very honest man; her mistress came to me the next day to know what had happened, for she had lost a day; I mean this young woman in the green bonnet,

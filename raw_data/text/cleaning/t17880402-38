               <p>- ADAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an iron-monger in Grafton-street, Soho; being informed Jones sold things very cheap, I looked in at his shop, and saw a dozen of green handle knives and forks; I asked the price of them, he told me, 7 s. 6 d. I offered him 7 s. being sure they were stolen; the wife told me, I might have them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020059"></xptr>Was William there? - Not that I know of; I paid 7 s. for them; I took them with me to the Court of Conscience, there I examined them; I found the name of Roberts on the blade; I immediately went up to Mr. Roberts, and informed him, I was afraid some of his servants had robbed him; Holding was ordered up stairs, and Mr. Roberts and I taxed him with stealing the knives and forks, and selling them; I did not shew him the knives at first; he denied any thing about the matter first; when I pulled the knives out of my pocket, I told him, there they were, and we should produce evidence to prove that he had sold them; I said, it does not signify your denying the fact, for here is the knives you sold to the woman; the woman is coming up, and you might as well say what you had for them.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him any thing more than that? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by might as well? - That he might as well tell the truth as not, as it would come out.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be better for him? - No, I did not; he said, the woman gave him half a crown for them.</p>
               <p>What is the real worth of them? - Fourteen shillings; I told him, I thought he had robbed his master of a great many more things, and he said, he never took any thing else, but a quarter of a thousand of ten-penny nails; I asked him, what she gave for them? he said, she generally gave two-pence a pound; when he was before the Justice, there he made a confession, which was reduced into writing.</p>
               <p>Was any thing more said to him to induce him to tell the whole truth? - His master said, before he went before the Justice, if you want any mercy shewn you, tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you need not look for the confession? - At the Rotation-office, the woman said, it was false what he said, for she was to give him four shillings and sixpence for the knives.</p>
               <p>(The knives deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are stamped with my name in a very particular direction, contrary to what they are stamped in general; the man who made them, made a mistake in stamping them.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Holding seen the knives, when he said he sold them for two shillings and sixpence? - Yes, I had pulled them out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I afterwards got a warrant and searched Jones's house; there I found sundry locks, they are here; I think they are eleven or twelve; there is a mark on the papers, which I am sure is my man's marking; I found them at Jones's, on his shelf; we searched Jones's house the same morning Mr. Adams came to me, that was last Friday; one of the locks was a lock of the same principle as I found, only with iron wards, instead of copper wards; and one that was within the paper, had the key broke; I found two pair of scissars, I cannot swear to these; I found a dozen knives and forks, I cannot identify them; the prisoner Jones and his wife were both at dinner when we went in.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner Jones say any thing about them? - He said, he had nothing, nor knew any thing about them; he said, he was often out, and he believed when his wife bought any thing, she put it out to sell.</p>
               <p>Court. How many of the knives that were stamped in this way? - Three dozen, I have the other two dozen in my possession; I never sold any of these stamped in this manner, I am positive of that; I searched the prisoner Holding's lodgings, and there I found a thousand of nails, and two sets of iron screws, half a dozen spoons, and a grate, has my shop-mark upon it, in my own writing, and the screws have my shop-mark upon them, the spoons have not.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the grate? - I think it cost me fifteen shillings and nine-pence; there were fourteen or fifteen screws, about two shillings value.</p>
               <p>How did you know it was Holding's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020060"></xptr>lodgings? - It is within a very few doors of my house that he lodged; he took us to his lodgings.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it; I never knew any thing of the man in my days.</p>

               <p>This man came to me about two months ago, and asked me to buy a lock; I thought by its being dirty, it was an old lock; he pulled it out of his pocket, it was in paper; he said, he kept a shop of his own, and had sailed a little, and came up to London, and what little he had, he should sell; he had more of the same; I gave him three shillings for it; he came again at night and brought another; I gave him half a crown for that; I bought twelve locks of him: the last I bought of him was green handle knives, I put them at the door directly in the paper; that gentleman came by, and asked me the price; I told him, seven shillings and sixpence; (I gave four shillings and sixpence for each dozen of knives;) he offered me seven shillings, and I took it; these locks were all at the door; he told me, they were all his own property; the marks were on them; there came a shower of rain, I took these locks in and the knives; we were set at dinner; this gentleman came in, and asked me, if I had sold them knives to-day? I told him, yes; he asked me, if I had any more? says he, here is a dozen more; he said, did not you buy them of a squinting man? I was surprised, and said, yes; I said, I had bought some locks of him; they were on the shelf, and the gentleman said, they are mine; he took them all away; I was innocent of their being stole, as the child that is sucking at my breast; I never would have bought them for my family's sake.</p>
               <p>Court to Roberts. It is true what she says? - She never told us of the knives till we found them, or the locks; I found them on the table or the dresser, but she never told me there were such things.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her, whether she ever bought any other things of that man? - I do not recollect.</p>

In July last I was in the service of Mr. Charles Beosoft Breary, surgeon, of 73, Great Portland-street—Mr. Goldsmith lived there at that time—on the evening of the 8th of July I recollect Filbee carrying a parcel directed to Mr. Goldsmith—it was placed on a slab in the hall—after that the servant asked me if that was the parcel which had come from Binney and Richards—I said yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Breary. On the 8th of July, in the evening, the prisoner came to the house—I do not know the exact time—he rang the kitchen bell, and said he had called for a parcel which had been left by mistake from Binney and Richardson, of Old Bond-street—I went up stairs and inquired about the parcel—they said they knew nothing about it—I came down, and saw the parcel lying on the slab in the hall, with a boot upon it—I took it in my hand, went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and called to Smith to know if he had taken in that parcel about a quarter of an hour before—the prisoner said there was a boot outside it, but he did not want the boot, only the parcel, as he was going to take it to another place, and the right parcel would be brought shortly—I delivered it to him—he went away with it—he said he was sorry to give me ao much trouble, and wished me good evening.</p>

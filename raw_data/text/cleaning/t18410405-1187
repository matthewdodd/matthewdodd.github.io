                  </hi>. I keep a boot-shop. On the 5th of April I was in Adam-mews, Marylebone, and saw the two prisoners—I watched them, being attracted by their uneasiness—I saw they had a tea-caddy—Williams put it under the tail of his coat—they were standing in the Mews together, about sixty or eighty yards from the prosecutrix's house—I saw Drum<lb></lb>mond go towards Berkeley-street, and Williams towards Seymour-street—I followed Williams, and in Cumberland-street I saw Drummond come round the corner, and join Williams in Seymour-street, and Drummond threw a dirty handkerchief over the caddy—I followed to look for a police<lb></lb>man—Williams made a stop, and Drummond passed over across Seymour-street to the corner of Portman-street—I saw a policeman at the corner of Portman-square, and while I was telling him, Williams passed—the police<lb></lb>man followed him—Drummond looked, and saw the policeman, and both began to run—I saw the policeman take Williams—I ran after Drummond, and when I got to the corner of Portman-street, he turned round as if he had just come out of Oxford-street, and asked me what was the matter—I said I wanted him to go to the police-office with the other—he said, "Very well, I will go, but I want to go somewhere else"—I said, "You must go there first"—he appeared anxious to know what he was wanted for—I said, "I saw you throw the handkerchief over the tea-caddy"—he said he was sure he did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information from Neal, and went after Williams, who was carrying something under his arm covered with this handkerchief—when I got within five yards of him he threw it down, and ran away—I ran and caught him, and took the caddy up—he tried to get from me, and in Oxford-street he made another attempt to get away, and fell on an area grating—I saw him force a bag through the grating—it was given to me at the house, and contained four skeleton-keys and three latch-keys—Drummond was afterwards brought to the sta<lb></lb>tion by Neale—I found on him a few lucifer matches and part of a gold ring—he said he had never seen Williams before—on Tuesday I went to Miss Waddington, and found one of the keys opens her front-door.</p>

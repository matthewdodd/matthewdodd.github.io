            . I am a watchman, my box is in Lime Street. On the 21st of September, about half past four I was sitting in my box, I heard a terrible bustling, one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"come along, the road is all clear," I came out of my box and went down St. Mary Axe, and as they saw me three run away and one stopped with the basket, the prisoner, he had his knee against the basket, I asked him whether the basket belonged to him, he said no, he was coming by that way, and had just left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe who they were in Lime Street, or what they had with them. - A. They had a basket, so I took the prisoner up on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is one of these men. - A. There were four of them, I followed them, three run away, and this man stopped, I never lost sight of them. At the watch-house the prisoner said he was a lamplighter. This is the basket the four men had hold of it, one at each handle and one before and one behind it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that flat do you know it. - A. This is the flat that I had with me, it contained two quarters of pork, five calves' heads, and two plucks.</p>

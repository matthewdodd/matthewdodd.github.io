                  </hi>. I live at Stockbridge-terrace, Pimlico, I am not in any business. In the afternoon of the 20th of November I was walking up the passage leading from New-street to St. James's Park—the passage was very much crowded indeed—when I got into New-street I missed my purse and keys—the purse contained two sovereigns and one half-sovereign, four half-crowns, and three shillings—it was a very singular purse—it was folded up—when I got to the top, after I had been dreadfully squeezed by the prisoners, a person came up and said, "Have you been robbed?"—I said "Yes, of my purse and keys; I don't mind my purse, but I don't like to lose my keys"—I saw the policeman had got the prisoners, and took them to Bow-street—I said, "I can tell you what the coins were"—they counted the money, and found it was exactly the case—Watts said, "It is my money, it was taken out of my pocket"—I said I had the same—the money corres<lb></lb>ponded exactly with what I lost—the gold was gone, but the keys and silver were produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Co vent Garden-market, and live in Horse Ferry-road. On the afternoon of the 20th of November I was with James Jones in St. James's Park—I saw the prosecutor enter the passage which leads to New-street, followed by Watts, Richardson, and Batchelor—Richardson was close to his back, and Watts on the side of him, and Batchelor by the side of Richardson—as they were going up the steps into New-street, I saw Watts drop the three keys, which I now produce, from his left-hand—I picked them up—he was then close by the prosecutor's side—when he lifted up his foot I took up the keys—the prisoners turned—I was behind them, and they pushed me—I secured Watts, and gave him to Jones; then took Batchelor, and gave Richardson to a police man—Batchelor said he had done nothing.</p>

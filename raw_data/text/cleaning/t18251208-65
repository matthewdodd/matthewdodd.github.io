The prisoner's mother is his cook; he came frequently to the house, and was there on the 13th of November; on the 14th a table spoon was missed; I went to Bow-street, and got Thompson, the officer; we went to the Rose and Crown public-house, Allen-street, Clerkenwell, and found the prisoner there - he said it was his lodgings; we then charged him with the robbery; he said, at first, he knew nothing of the spoon, so help him God: but afterwards he wished the officer to withdraw; he took me by the hand, and wished me to be his friend; I said I would not promise that; he then said he had the spoon in a pair of stockings in his hat, and did not know why he took it; I took hold of the stockings and the spoon fell out - he said "There it is."</p>

             re-examined. I had suspicion some time ago, of some property being taken, either by the prisoner or the people who had the wash; I put the fork in the wash, and when I went to the house of the people who had it, the fork was found; I then told their little girl to take it home, and tell the other footman to give her 6d. for it. Various other property had been missed from the house.</p>

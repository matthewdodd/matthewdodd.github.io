               <p>Q. How long did she stay in the room? - A.Not long; she seemed in a tremble, and frightened, I do not know for why; I went down stairs to see if I could see her in the yard, I could not see her come up again; I had not been up long before two ladies came to ask for my lodger; I said, my lodger is not at home, for she has robbed me; one of the gentlewomen was the woman that gave her a character when she took the room of me; then she said, she has robbed this gentlewoman of the furniture of a four-post bed; I went down into the court, and sent for a constable; she never returned till the officer took her.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Nichols. About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 10th of April, the prisoner was in the shop with another young man; they asked to look at some socks - they did not buy anything then, but went away, and in about ten minutes they came back together, and while the other bought the socks, the prisoner stood behind him, and pulled the handkerchiefs out of the window; I saw him take them, he went out of the shop with them. I went to the door, but could not see him. Mr. Nichols came home about an hour and a half afterwards, and went with me to find the prisoner as he has stated. I am certain he is the person.</p>

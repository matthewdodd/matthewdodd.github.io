On the 13th of November I understood from one of my family that she was going to leave me in the evening; she sent one of the boxes out of the house between the hours of twelve and one in the day, while I was gone up stairs; that led me to a suspicion that all was not right. I went to Marlborough-street, got two officers; before my return she had sent her two other boxes away. I left the officer in the passage, called her into the parlour, and said

             I understand by my children that you are going to leave me, she answered yes, ma'am; I told her I desired to look in her boxes, she said one of my boxes is gone between twelve and one o'clock this day, and the other two I sent out this evening; that rather alarmed me; she said Mr. Buckel, a friend of hers, had taken a box at his dinner hour; she had lodged with Mr. Buckel, which caused me to go to him to know whether he had got the box; Mr. Buckel left his work to come in search of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the boxes at last. - A. She had sent them to a lodging room in Carnaby-street, nearly opposite our own house; the officer came in the parlour and searched her; after that I went to the place where her boxes was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the boxes at the lodgings. - A. Yes, and some of my property in them, and the broach; I have lost a number of things.</p>
               <p>Q. You found her three boxes. - A. Yes, and in them we found the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

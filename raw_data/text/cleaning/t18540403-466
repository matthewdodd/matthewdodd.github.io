                  </hi>. I am a woollen draper, at No. 118, Holborn-hill. The prisoner was in my employment—he left me in Jan.—on Tuesday, 7th March, I gave him into custody on a charge of embezzlement—he was taken to the station-house in Smithfield—I went there also—I was on horseback at the time, and I rode to the station—I there made the charge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030015"></xptr>
               <p>—the officer was told to search the prisoner—at that time I was standing with my back to the prisoner—I heard a report, and distinctly felt a ball pass over my head, or I suppose it was the current from the ball, but it went so sharp that I felt the pain from it for half an hour afterwards—I thought it had taken the skin off my head, but it had not; it left no mark whatever—I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner staring with the greatest possible astonishment to see that I had not dropped—I found that the ball had passed through the window immediately behind me, lower than my head—I was surprised how it could have got over my head without having hit it, but he stood a little higher than I was—the ball struck the wainscoting and penetrated to the extent of about an inch, the wainscoting being firm against the wall caused the ball to rebound—the prisoner was secured by the officer, and I saw a pistol in the officer's hands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police inspector</hi>). I recollect the prisoner being brought to Smithfield station on Tuesday, 7th March—he was charged by Mr. Umpleby with embezzlement—I was entering the charge, and my head was close to Mr. Umpleby's while I was doing it—just as I was putting down the amount, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I felt the bullet pass my head—it did not touch my head; I felt the sensation of its passing me—Mr. Umpleby was standing by the side of me, and it passed from the back of his head to the front of mine—I was a little behind him, leaning to the desk—I turned round, and saw this pistol (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's hand—he was in the dock at the time—that is higher than the place where I was standing—I went into the dock, and threw the prisoner down, and another constable picked up the pistol—I traced where the ball had gone through the window, and into the moulding—I have brought the bullet and the moulding too—after the prisoner was fully secured, I asked him why he wanted to injure me—I think I said, "What did you want to fire at me for?"—he said, "I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> On 7th March I had been down to Lower East Smithfield, and on returning home I was walking up the Kingsland-road; I happened to turn round, and saw Mr. Umpleby on horseback, and to avoid him I walked up this turning that he terms a court; he came up to me, and said, "What are you doing here? I have been looking for you for some time; I want to have some conversation with you;" I said, "Very well;" he said, "Where can you got" I then condescended to walk with him, I suppose pretty well a quarter of a mile, or nearly so, till we saw a policeman; he called him, and gave me in charge; we went to the police station at Smith<lb></lb>field; the charge was entered; the policeman was desired to search me; I had the pistol now produced in my pocket, and when the officer was told to search me I pulled it out of my pocket in a hurry to lay it down, and it exploded; the inspector called out, "Police! murder!" and sent for assist<lb></lb>ance, and I should think not less than twenty policemen came in, most of them with their jackets off, and each of them took a very active part, or tried to do so, in searching me; I had a pair of gaiters on at the time, and they were trying to take my boots off without taking my gaiters off; I could not help smiling at the time; I was told to stand on my legs; that accounts for Mrs. Marshall saying I was laughing; I might have smiled, for I could not help smiling to see so many able bodied men trying to get my boots off with<lb></lb>out taking my gaiters off; they searched me and found some money on me, and they locked me up; about an hour after I was locked up in the cell, inspector Teague came in, and said, "Now you seem a little more cool than you were a short time back, is there anything you want?" and he said to the housekeeper, who was standing outside, "Let the prisoner have anything he wants, any refreshment or anything of the sort," and pretended to make me very comfortable; he sent up stairs for a mattrass to lie upon, which I thought was very kind of him; he rubbed his hands, and said, "I don't know whether you meant this for me, but you gave me very short notice;" this conversation took place in the cell, I have no recollection of any other; I said, "It is not likely I intended it for you, neither did I intend it for Mr. Umpleby;" it is not likely, if I had intended it for Mr. Umpleby, that I should have said so to inspector Teague; Mrs. Marshall hearing Mr. Teagues statement at Guildhall, as a matter of course states the same thing, it is natural; having bought the pistol the same morning that I saw Mr. Um<lb></lb>pleby, it does not appear at all probable that I bought it for the purpose of shooting him with it; if I had intended to take his life, I should have been prepared weeks before, or days before at all events; having bought the bullet mould for the purpose of making bullets, it does not appear very much like intending it for one particular purpose; my object was to have left</p>

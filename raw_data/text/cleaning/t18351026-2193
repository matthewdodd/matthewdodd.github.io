                  </hi>. I live in Devonshire. In 1826 I was in Lon<lb></lb>don—the prisoner came to my house, and about three weeks after, he left this country—I followed him to Sweden—he had married my daughter in 1826, and then went to the Brazils—I followed him to Sweden, and bought a farm there for their use, and left them there for nearly two years and a half—I went over to Sweden again in August and assisted them with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I went over again a third time, as I heard he was desirous of selling the property—I found he had attempted to make a sale of two small por<lb></lb>tions of it—they had at that time two children—he was not in circumstances</p>

I first became acquainted with the prisoner, on the 30th of July—I was living at Hornsey at that time—he was teaching French in the family, where I was visiting—our acquaintance went on, and a marriage was contemplated between us—inquiries were made on the 13th of September, about a former marriage—before those inquiries my friends were favourable to the marriage, they afterwards changed their opinion, and forbid my continuing the intercourse—the prisoner said something about divorce that he had obtained—my father and brothers spoke to him about it—I was not present when it was first mentioned—I heard my father say he should decidedly object to a divorced husband, whether the divorce was legal or not, and I should not see him—I was induced to disregard that, and married him on the 17th September, at St. Clement Danes—it was with out the knowledge of my parents—I am twenty—three years old.</p>

               <p>had applied for legal determination about his divorce, but that I had higher authority than Lord Brougham, which was the 19th of Matthew, which said that a man shall not put away his wife but for adultery, and said, "Has your wife committed herself?"—he said, "No, she was as virtuous a woman as ever lived"—I told him the divorce was illegal, and that that was the result of the advice I had taken—I told him this on Monday, the 13th of September—he understood what I said to him—I said the divorce was not available in England—he said it was available all over the world, and said, "Well, I am a single man in the eye of the law, and can marry who I please"—I forbad my daughter having any thing to do with him, but they were married without my consent—I then wrote to Mr. O'Donovon, and about a week after I went to get my daughter away—Mr. O'Donovan went to her and saw her—the prisoner came to our house, and threatened, not only to shoot me, but to shoot through the window, and behaved very violently—I got a policeman to secure the house, and got a warrant for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My present means hinder me from the assistance of a lawyer, but from a pure conscience, and an English Jury I do not fear any thing—still I must notice the means adopted by my enemies to injure my reputation and character, by circulating false statements, representing me as a pretented nobleman and a villain, daily looking out for English ladies, to entrap them into marriage in this country, and divorce them in another country—I hope you will banish that from your minds—such malice will prove its own poison—I am the eldest son of Admiral Bruce, of Sweden, and, as such, a peer of that country—I was married to Miss O'Donovan in 1826—with this marriage I had three children; two born in Sweden, and the youngest in England—on the 19th of April, 1831, my first wife left me, with the children, to pay a visit to her parents, and by her father's persua<lb></lb>sion she never returned, having sworn never to see me more—the Baron----wrote to Mr. O'Donovan to know why he kept my wife from me. but I never could get an answer—in January 1833, I was over in my country—I had written to my wife many times to come over, but without an answer; and in the criminal court of Stockholm I sued her—a warrant was served on her on the 11th of March, by two witnesses—the service was duly acknowledged by her own signature, and afterwards attested—at the same time there was an exchange of mutual relinquishments of the conjugal rite, duly signed by the two witnesses—she did not appear at the court as required by the warrant, and the marriage was disannulled, with the privi<lb></lb>lege to appear in three weeks at the Court of High Justice, which I wrote to her to do, but she did not, and it was duly dissolved, but by the law she could come before the divorce was dissolved in the Ecclesiastical Court, but I got no answer—on the 22nd of April, 1834, the marriage was again lawfully dissolved by the Bishop, and in September, 1835, I was married to Miss Barber—I presume she is in this country, as she is in my country, my only wife—I have here a translation of the original decree of the Ecclesi<lb></lb>astical Court.</p>

            . On the 14th of August, I met the prisoner in Oxford-street, about twelve o'clock at night, and went into the Park with her; we were there about half an hour; I fell asleep, Dwyer awoke me, she was gone, and I missed seven 1 l. country notes, which were in my pocket, in a canvass purse, when I met her. We went in pursuit, and overtook her in Oxford-street. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have got my money." She said,</p>
               <p>"I have not." I picked them up between her feet - I did not see her drop them - I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. The notes have my hand-writing on them.</p>

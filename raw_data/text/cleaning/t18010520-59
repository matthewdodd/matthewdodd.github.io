               <p>Q. This gutter runs between the two houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. What number is this first house you speak of? - A. There is no number; the two houses are situated in a garden.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a gutter fastened on one side to one set of rafters, and on the other to another set of rafters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was turned up on one side, and not on the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then still the whole body of the lead was fastened to the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ISAAC BISO sworn. - On the 27th of April last, in consequence of information, I went to Clifton's house a few minutes before eleven at night; I saw two men upon the house between the two roofs, they were stooping down, as if at work.</p>
               <p>Q. What fort of a night was it? - A. I was a moonlight right.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, were those the men? A. I cannot positively swear.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRINCE sworn. - Q. Look at the prisoners, do you know their persons? - A. I do.</p>

Yes, I had seen them about on the 27th of April; I saw them upon the top of Mr. Clifton's house in the gutter; there are four ridges to the two houses; they were in that gutter that separated the two ridges of the furthermost house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see them do? - A. I saw them break in the shutter of the first of the two houses, and go in; I am sure it was the prisoners at the bar, for I stopped and saw them get up at the top of the house, and then they climbed over from the first to the second; I saw them taking the tiles off, and placing them upon the roof; then I saw them fold the lead over from the side of the gutter; I then gave an alarm to

             sworn. - I am a watchman; the two last witnesses called me, and I went and saw the two prisoners upon the house; they were stooping down, and appeared to me to be wrenching the gutter up between the two ridges of the furthermost house; I told them to come down or I would fire at them, I had a pistol with me; the clock went eleven just as I received the information, it was a very light night indeed; the prisoner, Henry, came down first; they made a way through the roof, and came through the cieling of the first house; I had him in custody about ten minutes, and he said I might take him where I pleased, for there were more in the house; I said, I was confident there was, and then

             came down, and with the assistance of John Prince I secured him; I left a person waiting at the house while I took them to the watch-house; upon my return, I went up, and found the gutter, between the two ridges of the first house, gone entirely, but that was gone two days before; I climbed over the roof to the second gutter, and there I found the lead wrenched up, and doubled over all along the ridge on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. So that in order to take away the whole of the lead they must have ripped up the other side? - A. Yes; they had taken off the tiles and had begun that; I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave them a good character. Thomas May, <rs id="t18010520-59-verdict332" type="verdictDescription">

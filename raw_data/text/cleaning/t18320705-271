On the 23rd of June, about ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner - I do not know in what street it was; she asked me to go home with her - I agreed to go; we went to a public-house, and had a quartern of gin, and then went to a room; I gave her 1s. 6d. for the room, but had no concern with her - I was tired, and fell asleep; when I awoke the prisoner was gone, and my money, watch, and box; the officer took the prisoner in a few minutes - I know she is the person.</p>

On Sunday morning, at half-past two o'clock, the prosecutor said he had been robbed - he was then getting nearly sober; I went in search of the prisoner, and found her; I had seen her with him at half-past ten o'clock - she denied all knowledge of the property, and said it was not her, but another girl.</p>

             (Police-constable D 32.) I assisted to take the prisoner - she objected to be searched by a man, and I was going to send for a woman; at last she said a married man should search her - I then untied the string of her apron, and this box fell on the ground; I took it up, and said, "What is in this?" she said, "Only a shilling;" I opened it, and found two half-sovereigns: she said, "Take one of them, and say no more;" I said,"We don't do business in that way;" I then untied the string of her flannel petticoat, and this watch fell down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

Presently I saw him put his hand into a pocket, and after that he stooped down. I put my hand upon the man's shoulder, and said, I believe you are robbed.

Mr. Newport appeared before the alderman, and swore to the handkerchief, but has not appeared since, so we have found the bill at our own expence. (The handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060010"></xptr> produced in court.) The prisoner said before the alderman it was his first offence, and hoped we would pardon him.</p>

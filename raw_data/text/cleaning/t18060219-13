               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in his room. - A. Yes, I was up one pair of stairs, I heard a noise in Waring's room I asked who was there; the prisoner said it is me; I went into the room, the prisoner was then sitting on the prosecutor's chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise was it. - A. It appeared to be lifting up something and letting it down again, I asked him what he was about, he seemed flurried and made me a foolish answer, said he was playing by himself; I came down stairs, and he followed me immediately, he went into the tap-room and I went into the bar and told my husband what I had heard. At the time there was a man that came into the taproom that fells pies, he came to the bar and asked change for a shilling; I examined the shilling, it was a bad one; I returned it to him; I watched him into the tap-room to see who he gave it to; I see him give it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said to the prisoner. - A. No; he returned again to me, and asked change for a guinea, my husband gave him change for the guinea; I watched him into the taproom, he gave the change to the prisoner, we was very much alarmed, we called the prisoner out to ask him how he came by that money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be alarmed. - A.Because I knew that the prisoner had no money, nor had he any for some time, we asked him how he came by the money, he denied having any, we searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assisted in searching him. - A. This young man, the witness, the servant and myself (my husband was not present) we found two guineas upon him, half a guinea, two seven shilling pieces, two guineas, two shillings and sixpence in silver, and a few halfpence; I took care of the money, and delivered it to Mr. Griffiths the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that you was alarmed, because the prisoner had no money; how did you know that. - A. Because five or six weeks before that my husband shipped him in a West Indiaman, he received a month's pay before he went; he returned again in little more than five weeks, and what money he took of the captain he had spent in coming home; he said he was discharged at Portsmouth; the captain gave him half a guinea, which he said brought him up, he said he had no money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(to witness) Who am I to blame for this; did you see me go to that mans chest. - A. I did not see you go there, I saw you sit there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to witness) Did you find any bank notes upon him. - A. No, he took something out of his pocket and put in his mouth, which he swallowed; we concluded it was the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was it that you searched him. - A. It was late in the afternoon, Waring was out at the time.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer, I produce the money which I took of Mrs. Ruach; I took the prisoner in custody; here is two guineas, one is bent, a half guinea, two seven shilling pieces, two shillings and six-pence in silver, and seven pence halfpenny in halfpence, which I gave him to buy him some bread and cheese in the morning; the two shillings and sixpence are good money.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Ruach) Whether that money that you gave the constable was the money that was taken out of the prisoner's pocket. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether one was a bent guinea. - A. I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This guinea I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have to say I have lost things in that house myself, I did not know where it went to. I lost one shirt the first day I came there, from inside the parlour, and the second shirt I lost was inside of the bar, and when I enquired about the shirt, the landlady said to my face, I had taken it out; I had not, why should I deny it, it was my own; if I had heaved it in the fire it was nothing to nobody. I know nothing about this charge, I got half a guinea from my captain, and half a guinea I had. I had two guineas and two seven shilling pieces given me in a bit of paper, when I went into the boat, as I was sick, I paid seven shillings to come up in the coach, and a shilling for the passage boat, and five pence I spent by the way, for a pot of beer; that woman says she knew I had no money; I gave her servant a seven shilling piece to change, she owes me a shilling of it now, I am in want of it.</p>

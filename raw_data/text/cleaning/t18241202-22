On the 13th of November, I left these articles in the stable, which I locked at eight o'clock at night I came there again at a quarter past seven next morning, and they were all gone; the stable window had been knocked in, and four squares of glass broken - a man might have got in at that opening; there is a door to the stable which opens into the yard. I saw one pair of my boots on Morgan's feet, on the Sunday week after he was taken; another pair was produced before the Magistrate. I have seen one of the stable dresses. I had seen the prisoner frequently at the house.</p>

            . I am ostler at the Holly Bush. I had been at Mr. Burgess's stables between nine and ten o'clock on the 13th of November, and left them locked and the window safe. I went there again at seven o'clock in the morning, and it had been broken; the space would have admitted any one into the stable. I saw the prisoner in custody at Highgate, about eight days after.</p>

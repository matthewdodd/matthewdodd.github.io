                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in King-street, Old Gravel-lane. Greenwood's public-house is right opposite my house—on the 14th of November, between one and two o'clock in the morning, Rip<lb></lb>pon called me out—I heard a till drawn out in Greenwood's house, and then rattling of copper money, and heard glass break—I sent Rippon in search of a policeman, while I waited outside—on his returning with the police<lb></lb>man we knocked at the doors, front and back-Greenwood came down in about ten minutes, and let the policeman and me in—we found somebody had got in through the sky-light-two squares of glass were broken in the sky-light over the bar parlour at the back of the house-as soon as I got in the policeman laid hold of Haley in the house, outside the bar—he said Davis and Marney had been with him, and escaped through the sky-light.</p>

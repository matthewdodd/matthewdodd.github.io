On the 11th of March about a quarter before seven in the evening I lost seven pair of stuff shoes, and two pair of leather shoes out of the shop, and two odd stuff shoes, and two odd leather shoes; I had just come into the shop, I heard something hit against the glass; my wife had a candle and she looked where the glass was that we make a show of, and she said, God bless me the shop is stripped, and I went and I missed these things, I jumped up immediately and ran out of doors, and by luck I went the right way, and ran about two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards, and I came up with a person who had got something under his coat, I saw him about four or five yards distant, I catched him by the collar and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100024"></xptr>my friend what have you got here? he said nothing; with that I catched hold of the shoes and said, my friend you have robbed my shop; that were the words I said; the shoes are here. (Produced and deposed to.) I kept the man and shoes till I delivered him into the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along the street; I came up out of the country for work; I was going by and there were two men ran by me, they dropped something and I did not know what it was, I went to see and picked it up, and this man came up to me and asked me what I had got there? I said, I had nothing.</p>

                  </hi> I am a grocer. I did live at 104, Praed-street, Pad<lb></lb>dington. On 22nd Jan., between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was in Panton-street—Wilson met me, and requested me to treat her—I took her to the One Tun, in the Haymarket, and she drank there—I afterwards went with her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to Pump-court, Westminster—we went to bed—I had seven sovereigns and two small silver coins, and a silk handkerchief—I secreted my purse and money under the bed, within half an hour after I entered the house—at half-past seven o'clock I took a sovereign out of the purse, and gave it her to get something to drink—I then put the purse into my waistcoat-pocket—she fetched some liquor in a stone bottle—I took some—I did not see that she took any—I fell into a state of stupefaction, but was partly conscious, and distinctly saw her take the purse, and two letters from my pocket-book, and the handkerchief off my neck—she made her escape into the passage—she was stopped by the pri<lb></lb>soner Clark, a dispute arose about the money—I was sufficiently sensible to recognise his voice—I could not catch any word distinctly—I <hi rend="italic">came to</hi> in about half an hour—I got off the bed—they heard me, and Wilson escaped from the house—I went to the room door, and saw her go out—I could see her without leaving the bed—Clark, and another man, came towards me—Clark said, "Who are you, sir?"—I said I had been robbed, and I believed he was accessory to the robbery—he said, "Let us have a search"—it was the same voice I had heard in the passage—we searched the bed-clothes and room, and found nothing—he went to a public-house, I went with him; the other man was with us, he abused me, and asked me to stand something to drink—I asked how they could expect that, when I had been robbed—I went to the top of the court, and found a policeman—we went to the house, and I heard Clark's voice up stairs—we went up, and found Clark—he was taken to the station, searched in my presence, and one of the letters which had been taken out of my book, was found on him—I was in a stupified state—I felt weak and very ill for a week after—there were two or three females at the One Tun—they drank with us, but I went away with Wilson only.</p>

I gave him nothing but 1s. when he enlisted; he was to receive 7s. 6d. of the bounty when he passed, 2s. 6d. before the Magistrate, and 50s. when he joined the regiment - the girl he names is the person he keeps; the serjeant offered her a sovereign to find out where he had ben spending the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told the Magistrate he was intoxicated.</p>

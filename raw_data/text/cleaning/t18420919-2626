                  </hi>. I am a law-stationer, and live in Bedford-row. On Saturday morning, the 27th of August, I got partially intoxicated—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and rode about for a considerable time with a female—between four or five in the morning I got to Mr. Gurney's house in Farringdon-street—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man demanded 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I offered him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and called a policeman—I took some sovereigns out of my left hand trousers pocket—the police<lb></lb>man got change for one—the prisoners were there at the time—after pay<lb></lb>ing the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man I think I returned four sovereigns to my pocket—I am</p>

               <p>sure I Had three sovereigns after that—I remained in the public-house for half an hour—I and the prisoners were standing at the bar talking and drinking, and suddenly Edmonston hit me a tremendous blow in the face, which knocked me down, blackened my eye, and loosened one of my teeth—immediately after I found one of their hands in my pocket—I believe it was Edmonston'i—I called out not to let them go, as they were about making off—a policeman was fetched and they were given into custody—I missed my money—no money was returned to me.</p>

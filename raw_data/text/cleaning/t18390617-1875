On Saturday night last, about 11 o'clock, I was opposite a butcher's shop in the Broadway, Westminster, seeing what I could purchase—I had my money in my right-hand pocket—I felt a hand leaving my pocket—I turned sharp round, and saw the prisoner making away from me as fast as he could—I felt in my pocket, and missed 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which had been loose in my pocket, in shillings and sixpences—I told my son, who was with me, to follow the prisoner—I followed as fast as I could, but a female caught hold of me and entangled me—the</p>

I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner pass my door in a great hurry, followed by several people—he was forced to turn back, it being no thoroughfare—he fought his way back—I heard the renewed cry of "Stop thief!" and stopped him—he resisted very much, but I kept him till the policeman came and took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Count of the Russian Empire. On the 2nd of Septemper, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I had a purse, con<lb></lb>taining ten sovereigns, in my coat pocket—I felt a very slight touch at my pocket, but should not have looked round, but a gentleman behind slapped my shoulder, and said, "There is a man running away with a purse, which he took out of your pocket"—I saw the prisoner turning the corner of Chancery-lane—I called, "Stop thief, "and he was stopped, and the purse was afterwards produced.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher. I was in Carcy-street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw a neighbour running after the prisoner, calling "Stop thief"—I followed him into Searle's-place, and there he hit a young man (with an instrument)who attempted to stop him, and nearly knocked him down—he then went down Little Shire-lane into Ship-Yard, where he threw the purse into a shop, and in about a minute he was secured—and as the policeman brought him back a woman brought the purse out of the shop, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

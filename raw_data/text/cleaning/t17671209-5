I am a broker; the prisoner brought one of these blocks to me about seven at night, on the 2d of November; he asked 5 s. for it; then he said I should have the iron at 2 d. a pound, and the brass at 6 d. I took and put them down in my back parlour, and went out at the back door and got a constable, and came in again, and told the prisoner I had a suspicion that it was stolen, and gave the constable charge of him; in going to the round-house, he attempted to get away; when he was in the round-house, I asked him where the fellow block was; he said he would tell me if I would not hurt him; I said, I could not promise him that; then he said he had thrown it away in Broad St. Giles's; we went there with a light and found it; I asked him where he had them; he immediately said he stole them from Lord Hertford's, and that they were Mr. Philips's property.</p>

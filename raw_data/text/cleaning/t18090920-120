            . I am a watchman to the London dock company. On the 3rd of September last, in the morning, between the hours of six and seven, I went over the casks of brandy, I could not see through the casks of brandy, the heads were so close; I got upon the casks of brandy, and I saw the prisoner's head of one side; he arose from under the boodge of the cask and ran away. I saw the man distinctly and knew him well; the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go from that part of the cask where you saw him rise from - A. I did; I saw two bladders, one had a quill in it, it was in the cask; I dispatched a person to give our officer notice of it; one of the officers came, I shewed him where he had been, and gave him the bladders with the brandy in them; one was partly full and the other was filling from the cask.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200061"></xptr>Q. Was there brandy in the cask - A. There was, and there was brandy in both the bladders.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of September, about twelve days afterwards, do you remember seeing the prisoner - A. The watchman on that station cried out for help, I ran with two watchmen to assist him, when I came within a little distance of him, I said that is the man that robbed my station of the brandy, I am positive that the man I saw apprehended on the 15th of September, was the same man that was taking the brandy on the 3d. I gave the bladders to Watkins.</p>
               <p>WATKINS. I am constable of the London docks. I received these two bladders from the last witness, they contained brandy, about 3 gallons in the two bladders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the cask - A. Yes, there was brandy in the cask.</p>

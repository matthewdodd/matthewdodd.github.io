            . I met the prisoner on Saturday night, the 8th of May, about nine o'clock, at the corner of Tothill-street; she wanted me to go to the Almonry - I said that was a blackguard place, I would not go there; she then took me to No. 45, <placeName id="t18300527-64-crimeloc341">Duck-lane</placeName>

            . On the Sunday morning the prosecutor came and said he had lost some property - I went to the apartment, but no one was there; Hommerston gave me the medal - the prisoner came in the evening, and was taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this young man - he gave me a quartern of rum, and then we went home; he went into the yard, and staid half an hour - he then came in, and said he had forgotten something; he went back, and was counting money - we went up stairs, and then he said he was thirsty; I went for some water, and there was none in the yard - I picked up this medal; I went to the witness for a pint of water, and told her to mind it for me.</p>

            ? - A. A child of three years old. On Easter Monday last Mrs. Freeman went out into Fore-street for half a pint of split pease; Mr. Freeman was out at work; she had not been gone out long before I heard a noise; I did not give it a thought, as it was a very windy day, till I heard it again; I was cleaning myself, without a handkerchief; I threw a petticoat over me, and saw the prisoner run out with his apron full of clothes; it was about half past ten o'clock in the morning; I ran out after him without a handkerchief, and with my petticoat in my hand, and the mob went after him; I did brush him, but I could not hold him; as he went along, running, he threw the things into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In New-court, Ropemaker's-alley, Cripplegate; the prisoner was brought back; I am sure he was the same man; the things were brought back, I did not see them picked up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not said that you never saw me till after I was brought back, two hours after the affair happened? - A. It was not an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he get in, do you know? - A.

These goods were not all at Mr. Windsor's; the greatest part of them were; there was some part of them at Mr. Bunn's, some at Mr. Hop's, and some at Mr. Watson's; all I found at Walson's were pawned in the name of Scott; I have now some duplicates I found in the prisoner's trunk; after I had seen the goods at the pawnbrokers I returned home; when I had been at home an hour or two, I received a letter from my man servant,

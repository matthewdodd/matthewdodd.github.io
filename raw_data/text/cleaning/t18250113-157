The prisoner lived in my service for seven months - I never gave her authority to pawn these articles - here is a gold doubloon, a nutmeg-grater, a decanter, an opera glass, two shifts, a tablecloth, and other things - they were locked up in boxes in the garret, where the prisoner slept; I live on the first floor. Mrs. Liggins keeps the house - I cannot tell her Christian name - I left home the beginning of June, and returned the first week in August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not on your going into the country leave me one sovereign, and tell me if I wanted more, to pawn those things you least wanted, and you left me the keys of your boxes? A. No; I left her board wages sufficient for her living. I have paid some bills since, which she has run up while I was gone; I was not quite five weeks gone - she had 2 s. 6 d. a week, and the use of my furniture; she appeared to be perfectly satisfied with what I left her. I have paid 1 l. for some coals she had in while I was gone.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 30th of October - I took her to Marlborough-street, and left her there till the prosecutrix came; she asked me to let her go to get some beer, and she got away - she was not taken till the 5th of December. These duplicates were found upon her.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutrix had desired her to pledge property if she was in want of money during her absence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MATILDA TOWNSEND. Q. Were you not compelled to part with some things when you returned to town? A. Certainly I was, but not the articles stated in the indictment. The prisoner had pawned the chain which is round my neck, for 4 l. - I was obliged to pawn another chain for 6 l., and I took this out again; she never gave me the 4 l. which she had pawned the chain for.</p>

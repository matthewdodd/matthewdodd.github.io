                  </hi> I am a tailor and draper, and live in Mon<lb></lb>mouth-street, Birmingham. In the beginning of July the prisoner came to my shop, and selected a coat and trowsers—he requested the coat should be put by and left a shilling on it—the trowsers he wanted to take away—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered in payment this check for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be drawn by Lord Skelmersdale—he indorsed this one the back of it, "Pay to Mr. Findley, C. Wheeler"—from the smallness of the amount I suspected it was not genuine, and I said it was not regular to take these things in busi<lb></lb>ness, but if he would leave it I would remit it to my brother—he agreed to that at once, and he showed me this letter enclosed in an envelope—he called on the Saturday evening afterwards, took the trowsers, and I paid him the balance, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was there any objection on my part when I brought the cheek, to give my address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the slightest—it was my proposition</p>

               <p>that you should indorse it, and you agreed to it—I did not sufficiently examine it to know whether the indorsement and the body of the check are the same writing—I sent it up to my brother to get it cashed—I believe your address was found to be correct—I made no enquiry as to who or what you were—I had a young man in my employ who went by the name of Frederick, he is not here.</p>

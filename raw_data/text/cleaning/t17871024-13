               <p>Prisoner Mackey. I met my fellow prisoner in White-horse-yard; he asked me to partake of a pot of porter, which I accepted; he said he was going to Mr. Bailey's shop to look at some pattern waistcoats; I had a shirt in this handkerchief, and went with him; Mr. Bailey gave him some patterns; we came out, he went back for some needles; I waited for him; then we came up White-horse-yard, into Bedfordbury; we were consulting to have a pot of beer, and Mr. Bailey came up.</p>
               <p>Court to Lewis. Are you quite sure you saw Mackey drop this piece? - Quite sure.</p>
               <p>Who was with him at the time? - Mr. Bailey had hold of his arm; I did not see any body else have hold of him; there was a mob of people after them; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240016"></xptr>another person who saw; him drop it; he said he lived in Villar's-street, York-buildings, and the next morning there was no such person to be found.</p>

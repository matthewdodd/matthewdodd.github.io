            , he keeps the George and Crown - I know the prisoner by his frequently coming to the house - I saw him come with the prosecutor on the 18th of June; I served them with two pints of porter which the prosecutor paid for - the prisoner went out and returned in ten minutes; he then went out again and staid about a quarter of an hour; he then came in and sat down by the prosecutor - there was no one else with the prosecutor, he was asleep, his head was laying down on the table - the prisoner asked me for a glass of gin, but he did not drink it, he went and sat down by the prosecutor for twelve minutes or a quarter of an hour, he then got up, drank his gin, and went away; I know the prosecutor had a hat on when he first came in, but I don't know whether he had when the prisoner came in the second time - I remember the prisoner asking me for water, and I referred him to the pump, but he did not go to the pump, he sat down by the prosecutor - some women came in, but they did not sit down, no one else went into the box - when the prosecutor awoke, he said he had lost his hat; I said, perhaps the young man had taken it, he then complained of the loss of his money - I saw the prisoner the next morning about five o'clock, with a good hat on; I did not notice his hat the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How large is the bar? A. It is a good size; the box would hold about six persons - our house opens early, we have a good many cab men in a morning - I know no one came into the bar that morning for I never left it; I was cleaning up - about three women came in at different times; I do not know whether they were women of the town - I do not know whether the pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170031"></xptr>secutor was there asleep; the box is rather hidden from my view - I know the women did not go to the box - the prisoner came there the next morning, nearly tispy, and offered to change a hat.</p>

            . I am servant at the George and Crown. On the morning of 18th of June, I went in the bar for a pail of water; I saw the prisoner and prosecutor sitting close together in a box, the prosecutor was then asleep - I afterwards went to the pump again, which was about a yard from where they sat; the prisoner had some silver in his hand, and a pair of white gloves; he was counting the silver and keeping it under the table, because I should not see it - the prosecutor's head was laying on the table, I cannot say whether he was asleep - I saw the prisoner go out in a short time, but I did not see him return.</p>

             (police-constable E 141). On the 19th of June I took the prisoner - I went with him and the prosecutor to the magistrate; in going along I was asking the prosecutor about it and the prisoner said I had no right to ask him any questions; I said, I had a right to ask him any, but the prisoner none - the prisoner at first said he knew nothing of it, but he afterwards said he was very drunk.</p>

            . No, you was there when I went in with a young man named Wheeler, you was the only person there - I did not go to any public-house in Hart-street, or to any other house till we got to Broad-street, and there you asked me to treat you again; I said I was out of a situation and could ill afford it, but I would give you some beer - I was never at the tread-mill with Wheeler; I was once kept back on a parochial affair, and there I saw him, and I recognized him again at the public-house.</p>

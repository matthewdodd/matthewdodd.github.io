                  </hi>. I am a laundress. On the night of the 19th of January, between six and seven o'clock, I had been to a public-house with my cousin; and while I was there, the prisoner came in—I wanted to get my cousin home, he being rather forward in liquor; and pulled out my purse to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and in the public-house to pay for what I had—I got a cab at the door, and sent my cousin home—when I went out the prisoner followed me, I was going to pay the fare before my cousin got in—the prisoner then snatched the purse, and ran away some distance—I gave an alarm, and he was taken—I got my purse again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Little Coram Street. I was in Holborn, and heard the exhausted cry of the prosecutrix saying, "Stop him"—I asked what was the matter?—she said a man had robbed her—I saw a man running across the road—I said, "Is that him?"—she said, "Yes"—I crossed, pursued, and took him—it was the prisoner—the policeman took him, and he gave him the purse—the prosecutrix was thought to be in liquor that night, but it appeared to me she was excited by her long run.</p>

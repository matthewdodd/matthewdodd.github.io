On Friday morning, I believe it was April 11th, I was in the market between eleven and twelve o'clock, and a man offered me some coats for sale; those produced are five of them—I was about a quarter of an hour bargaining for them—I bid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and was asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not purchase them—master tailors and journeymen are in the habit of bringing clothes there for sale—I saw Hyams in the market that morning and afternoon—I was not present at any sale of them to him—I have known him dealing in the market twelve or fourteen years (<hi rend="italic">the policeman Ward here stated that the witness had been in custody for receiving stolen property</hi>)—I have never been charged with receiving stolen goods—I have been locked up; the Lord Mayor de<lb></lb>tained me, and sent the officer for my eight witnesses—he brought them, and the Lord Mayor discharged me—it was a charge of buying two ribs of an umbrella in this market—they were given to me as a sample—Sergeant Kelly reported the result of his inquiries to the Lord Mayor.</p>

I went the next morning to the house where he used, there I found him; I asked him what he had done with the frock ? he said, he knew nothing of it; he was for going away, I said, he should not; he then went to the table and took up this knife, (producing one), and said, d - n your blood, if you touch me, I'll cut you down; I drew back, and he ran out; I called, stop thief, he was taken and brought back; then he said, if I would let him go, he would let me know where the frock was; and as we were going up Ludgate-hill in order to go to Guild-hall, he said the same; I said, he should not go, if he would let me know of fifty coats; so ever after that he has denied his knowing any thing of it.</p>

            . I went into Mr. Dormer's house, and the prisoner was going in; Town had occasion to pull off his coat, and he threw it into my lap; the prisoner at the bar snatched it up. I said, what are you going to do with the man's coat? He went out directly; then I called and said, that man has got Town's coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it made of?</p>
               <p>E. Dukes. It was a fustian coat, with white plate buttons on it.</p>

               <p>I went to that house, and called for a pint of beer between nine and ten o'clock at night, I staid there near a quarter of an hour, and saw this last witness there, and several more; I called for a quartern of gin, and paid for it, and for the beer, and went out at the door; and the next morning Mr. Dormer came to me, and asked me after the man's coat; I said, what man's coat? He said, the coat you stole last night. I was eating some bread and butter, and my knife in my hand; but I never offered to cut him, or any thing like it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM THOMPSON. Between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 2d of September, I was coming from Tower-hill; I met a woman, who asked me to go home with her; I said, I would, provided she would behave well to me, being a stranger; I went home with her, and gave her a shilling to get some liquor - she went down stairs, and never returned - that was not the prisoner; I pulled off my jacket and put it beside the bed, and laid down to see if any body came - a little while afterward, the prisoner came, and said, "Young man, you can't stop here, my husband and two children are coming to sleep here;" I got up, and said, "Where is my jacket;" she d - d me, and said what did she know about it, but she would take me to the girl who brought me there; I followed her to many holes and corners - she tried to trip up my heels, and got from me, and ran in doors - I sung out for the watchman; he came, but could not find her not the jacket; I cannot tell how long I laid on the bed; I suppose not more than a quarter of an hour; I laid dozing there; I was a little in liquor; I saw some person come into the room, but did not get up to see who it was.</p>

               <p>Jan. I was at the Post-office—I had previously procured this letter with the Birmingham post-mark on it, addressed to Mr. Tyrrell, Bank of England, London—Mr. Russell, another inspector, was with me in the assistant-inspec<lb></lb>tor's room—I saw Mr. Russell inclose a sovereign in that letter, and a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note of the Edinburgh Bank—before the sovereign was inclosed in the letter I marked it on the obverse side, and Mr. Russell marked it on the reverse side—Mr. Russell sealed the letter with coloured wax—this is the sovereign—my mark is a dot, on the head side, after the word "Rex"—I have a me<lb></lb>morandum, which I made at the time, of the mark, and it answers the de<lb></lb>scription of the coin—the date of the coinage was also taken down—the letter, with the sovereign in it, was placed in this other letter, directed to "Mr. F. Morgan of Birmingham, to be left at the Angel Coffee-house, next door to the Bluecoat-boy, City-road, Islington, London"—I then sent for Henry Rice, the superintending letter-sorter, and gave him the letter, with directions to place it among the prisoner'sletters in the Inland-office—at that time the letter, with the sovereign in it, was certainly placed within the folds of the other—it was allowed to fall into it, so that it could not be perceived, and it could not shake out—the prisoner was on duty that morning—I went to the Angel Coffee-house, where the outside letter is directed—I got there about ten minutes past nine—I was not acquainted with the landlord up to that time—I stated to him why I came—about a quarter of an hour after I had been there the prisoner came—that house is within four or five doors of the first house at which he delivered any letters—he delivered this outside letter to the landlord, who immediately gave it to me—the other letter was not then in it—I saw the prisoner deliver this to the landlord, and without losing sight of it, I received it from him—I then went to the Bank of England, and saw Mr. Tyrrell, to whom the inner letter was directed—I as<lb></lb>certained that he had not received the letter—I was on duty at the Post-office next morning, the 30th—John Arthur, the letter-carrier for the Bank of England, received instructions to bring all letters directed to the Bank of England to me that morning, and had done so up to eight o'clock, about which time he brought this inner letter, directed to Mr. Tyrrell, saying he had just found it on his desk—he gave it to Mr. Boydon, another assistant-inspector—I was not there at that moment, but I received it within a minute afterwards—it was then sealed, but it had been opened—it was not opened in my presence—Mr. Rackley, another assistant-inspector, showed the letter to the prisoner, who was sent for as he was leaving the office, about a quarter-past eight in the morning, and said, "Have you seen that letter be<lb></lb>fore?" or, "Do you know anything of that letter?" or words tantamount to that—he said he knew nothing about it—Mr. Rackley replied that he had evidence that the letter had been in his possession yesterday—the prisoner's seat is about six or eight yards from Arthur's desk—there are ten or twelve letter-carriers' seats between them—the sovereign is my own.</p>

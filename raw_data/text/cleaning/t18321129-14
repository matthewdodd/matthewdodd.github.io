On the 27th of November, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came to look at some goods; he was sitting down at the counter - he was there about twenty minutes; he looked out goods to the amount of 6l. or 7l., and handkerchiefs among them; he went out, saying he was going to the Jerusalem coffee-house, and would call on his return - I suspected him, followed him out, and stopped him two or three hundred yards off, and said I thought he had taken a piece of handkerchiefs, which did not belong to him; he had looked at these handkerchiefs, but had not selected them; they laid within his reach on the counter; he was very much agitated, and said he thought I was mistaken - he went back to the shop with me, and I took the goods out of his great coat inside pocket - he was speechless when I found them; he had not paid for any thing, nor taken the goods away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite ashamed of my situation; I might have put them in my pocket, for what I did buy, intending to return - I offered to take him home with me and pay for all the goods I had, and convince him I had no dishonest intention; I should have got the money where I was going.</p>

               <p>MR. ABLETT. After he was detected he offered to pay for the goods - he had not sufficient money with him; those he ordered were a very large pattern, and these are very small - he said he was going a short voyage.</p>

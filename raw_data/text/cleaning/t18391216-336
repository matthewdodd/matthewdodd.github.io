                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Byers, who keeps the Life Guardsman public-house, at Knightsbridge. The prisoner came into our service on Monday, the 11th of November, and left last Saturday week, when the policeman took her away—she was to have 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we had her character from the Licensed Victuallers' Protection Society—she came on Monday, and asked my leave on the Friday or Monday after to go and fetch her clothes, as when she came she brought nothing but what she had on, except an old bonnet box—she returned the same evening in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and brought a new trunk—on the Satur<lb></lb>day after I heard my husband had lost some money, and I said to her, "Mary, your master has lost his purse, have you seen it?"—she said, "I have seen master give change"—I said, "When did he give change?"—she said, "In the parlour"—I said, "To whom did he give change?"—she said she did not recollect whether it was in the parlour or at the bar, but she had not seen it since—on the Saturday she was given into custody—that was three weeks after she came to the house—I saw her box when she was searched—she was present, and threw the things out of the box herself—she came to a piece of paper among the things, she rubbed it up in her hand, and the policeman said, "What is this? I must know"—she said it was a piece of wedding-cake—he took it out of her hand with great difficulty, and when he had undone it, it turned out to be a sovereign and a half—there was a pair of new boots on the table—she persisted in it that she had never bought any thing since she came to our house—I said, "Mary, there is a new pair of boots, and I saw yon with a new pair on"—she said, "Did you, ma'am, I had them before 1 come to your place."</p>

On the 14th of November, about eleven o'clock at night, I went up to bed—I took my coat and waistcoat into my bed-room—I hung them over the end of the French bedstead—in my waistcoat-pocket there was a scarlet silk purse, with thirteen sovereigns in gold, and there might be half-a-so<lb></lb>vereign—I missed the purse on the 16th, the Saturday following—Mrs. Byers getting up first, I always consider she takes my money and locks it up—so on the 15th when I got up, I thought nothing of its not being</p>

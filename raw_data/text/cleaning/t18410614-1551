                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker, and live in Regent-street. About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 12th of May I was in Holbon—the female prisoner came running up to me, and asked me to give her something to drink—I said it was very late, I did not think she could get any thing at that hour, as all the public-houses were closed—she said, "No, we can get some there," pointing over to Gray's Inn-lane—I then crossed Holborn near to Gray's Inn-lane—she was by my side—as I was crossing I put my hand into my waistcoat pocket and missed my purse, which contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, three sovereigns and a half wrapped up in the note, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other end—I did not detect the abstract-tion of it—I bad it safe five minutes before, because my coat was buttoned till the female prisoner came up to me, and had it been taken before that my coat must have been cut through—I had taken out my purse at the corner of Farringdon-street, to pay for a pint of ale, which was not more than five minutes before I missed it—I said nothing to the prisoner at the moment I missed it, I was so astounded to think it was gone so suddenly and so adroitly that I paused for a moment—she said, "Well, won't you go and give me a glass of something?"—I said, "Nonsense, you have taken my purse; give it me back"—she said, "I have not taken it; give me in-charge"—I said, "Very well"—I crossed the road with her, and gave her in charge to a policeman who was standing opposite—I was sober—I have never seen my purse since.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of May, I was in Holborn by Holborn Bars, standing there with coffee to sell—I keep a coffee table there of a night—about half-past two o'clock I saw the female prisoner and the prosecutor go past my coffee-table, and saw the male prisoner standing by Holborn-bars looking towards Gray's Inn-lane, as if he was looking for some one—I saw the female prisoner put her left hand behind her, and the male prisoner received whatever it was with his right—he then went across the road as quickly as he could, and put his hand</p>

On Wednesday morning, the day after this transaction, the prisoner Jeremiah came to Smithfield station with two plates of hot beef-steaks, and asked for Norah Sullivan—I asked whether his name was Jeremiah Sullivan—he denied it—a man standing alongside of him, said it was his name—I asked him to step inside the station, and told him I had information that he had received part of the property stolen by the female prisoner, which he denied—I said I should search him, and asked whether he had got any money about him—he made no answer, till I began to search him—he then said he had three sovereigns and some silver, which he had brought out to go to mar-ket with to get fish—I searched him and found three sovereigns, three half-crowns, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—nothing was found on the female—I searched the male prisoner's lodging at the address he gave, and the people there said they had not seen him or the female for three week—I do not know whether they are married.</p>

               <p>What watch was it? - A silver watch with a steel chain; I asked for my watch, she abused me, and said, I was not worth a watch; she and another girl that was in the room, then shut me out into the street; I called the watchman, and he made them open the door, and took her to the watch-house; my watch was found at Mr. Fleming's a pawnbroker's, in Drury-lane; his young man is here.</p>

               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch with a steel chain and three seals; Jones desired me to pawn it, for his wife was in the watch-house, and desired me to take the seals off; I pawned the watch at Mr. Fleming's for sixteen shillings, without the seals; I then went to Mrs. Jones in the watch-house, and the prosecutor was there she said he had accused her of robbing him. I was going to give her the money, and she said no; I afterwards gave her the money, and the duplicate, and the seals.</p>

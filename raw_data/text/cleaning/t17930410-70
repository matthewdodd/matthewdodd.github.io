               <p>Prisoner. Between six and seven o'clock, I came through a thoroughfare that leads out of Windmill-street into Panton-square, in going down to the bottom of the street that young man arrested me and said, I broke his master's window; I was detained there three or four minutes, and I might have been let out of the shop, if I had had money enough; and when Mr. Faulding came, then they went out, and they said, they lost a piece of bed furniture; Mr. Faulding said, his window had been broke before, by his servant, by some accident or other.</p>

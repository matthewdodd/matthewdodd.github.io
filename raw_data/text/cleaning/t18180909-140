On the 15th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner asked me to let him go into the yard to look at the water-pipe, which he did; he then went into the kitchen, and asked me for a piece of string, to measure the pipe under the fire-place - I gave him some. He said he was going to take up that, and put a new one down - He pretended to be a plumber. He left, and said he would come at one o'clock to do it. He went into the kitchen, and took a brick from the fire-place with a hammer which I lent him. I said he should have brought his tools with him; he said he would fetch his mate, who was just round the corner. He returned after that, and told me to move a chest; while I was doing it, I turned towards the fire-place; the young man whom he brought in, was assisting me - He let go, and told me to move it farther round-both ran up stairs. I immediately missed the watch from the fire-place, and have never seen it since. I saw the prisoner on the Friday following - I am sure he is the man. I gave him in charge.</p>

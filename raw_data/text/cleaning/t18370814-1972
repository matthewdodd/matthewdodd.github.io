I am a seaman, and belong to the ship <hi rend="italic">David Lyon.</hi> On Thursday, the 28th of July, I met the prisoner and another in a public-house—I gave them two or three pots of beer; they proposed to go altogether to bathe in the Cut—we all three went—I stripped off my clothes to bathe—the prisoner went in first—I left my clothes on the ground—I had got change of a sovereign at the public-house—the prisoner might have seen that—I had 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and more—I had six or seven half crowns, and six or seven shillings—the prisoner came out of the water about ten minutes before me—then he and the other dressed, and when I came out of the water, they were gone—I came to my clothes, and missed my jacket, and handkerchief, and money—it was a yellow and red Belcher handkerchief—I had bought it new that day, and the jacket too—I have seen neither of them since—I went to the police and told them of it—the prisoner was taken in about an hour after—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of the persons—I know his face—I have lost all my property—a boy had told me something.</p>

I remember on this Thursday being near the Cut—I saw the prisoner there—he went in to swim, and then he came out, about ten minutes before the prosecutor—he went to the prosecutor's trowsers pocket, and took out something that appeared to me like silver, and a Belcher silk handker chief, red and yellow—he put it into his own pocket—there was another with the prisoner that went away—I saw the same sort of handkerchief hanging out of the prisoner's pocket—I told Smith of this—I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

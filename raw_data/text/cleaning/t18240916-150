As I was going to work about twenty minutes before six o'clock, in the morning of Monday, the 16th of August; I saw a man go into Mr. Haddon's house, and two other men stood waiting for him outside. I stood talking to a shopmate of mine, and the man came out of the house again with a copper tied in a brown cloth, and the three went away together. I am positive to the persons of all the prisoners. I think Shields was the one who brought the copper out, he was not in the house more than two minutes; they all went up Baldwin-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160060"></xptr>together. I followed after them, but did not raise any alarm; by the time I got half way up the street they were returning without the copper. I did not see were they had disposed of it. I did not speak to them. nor give any information till night. When I left work I then went and enquired who was the landlord of the house, and told the people at the green shop of it, and then went to Mr. Haddon and told him, when the prisoners returned. Avery had the cloth under his arm, which appeared to me to be the same that the copper had been taken away in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Where were you while this was going on - A. I was in the causeway talking to Hook; he is not here. We, each of us, had a load, and did not attempt to stop them. I told my shopmates of the transaction, and the next day I saw Avery and Battams passing my shop, and had them taken up. If I had stop them that morning I must have put down my tools, and might have lost them. I swear that it was a copper; it was not tied so close but I could see that.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman to Mr. Haddon; I was not in the house till the day after the copper was stolen, and had not seen it. I saw it applied to the place, and it appeared to me as if it had been taken out of that place; the mortar was broken round the edges; it seemed to fit exactly, as if drawn from the brick-work: the house is in Winkworth-building, in the parish St. Leonard, Shoreditch.

I had not seen the copper for three weeks or a month. I saw it on the Tuesday or Wednesday after it had been stolen, in the possession of the officer; it is mine to the best of my knowledge: it evidently appeared to have been recently taken from the place; the prisoners are strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you given up this building to any one - A. No, nor assigned it to my one. I did not see it fitted, but every copper would not have fitted the place, because there are some indentures in it, which I had seen.</p>

I live in Old-street, about two hundred yards from Baldwin-street; it was brought between nine and ten o'clock in the day; I believe Shields to be the man who brought it.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. By what do you know him - A. I am only speaking to his dress, which was similar to the prisoner Shield's, but with a blue apron on. The copper had the same mark as any second hand copper would have had.</p>

            . My husband is a coppersmith, and lives in Old-street. I was called on Monday morning about ten o'clock, by the last witness, to purchase the copper - he is my shopman - only one man came with it. I asked Smith if it was fit for use, he said No, it was only old copper; he then weighed it - it was near 16 lbs., but there was a good deal of dirt and soot, which generally adberes to second-hand copper. I paid for 15 lbs. at 8 d per lb. the person gave his address</p>

            . I am headborough of Shoreditch. I found the copper on Tuesday morning, about half-past eleven o'clock. I was at a public-house, in Teuter-row, City-road, and heard that two men were coming down who had taken the copper. Fordham was with me and pointed out Avery and Battams to me. I told them they were my prisoners, and the charge was about a copper; they said they knew nothing about it. I took them to the watch-house - Shield was not taken till the second examination I went to Mr. Haddon's house, and in the kitchen there was a lid of a copper; the carpenter put the copper into the place, there was a little bend in the top of it, he turned it round, and it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The carpenter seemed to understand it very well. - A. Yes; the carpenter was at work, and the prisoner passed his shop, and then he came to me and told me of it: I saw the shopmate of the carpenter about a week ago, and gave him notice that he might be wanted here - he said he did not wish to trouble himself about it.</p>

            's house. On Sunday, the 17th of October, I opened the parlour windows; they were open till the afternoon - a shower came on about four o'clock, and I went and shut them; I then went down to the house keeper's room under the parlour, and while there I heard a noise in the parlour; the windows were closed, but not bolted; my brother was with me, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"That sounds like somebody over our heads, we will go and see, and shut the shutters" - we went to the stairs, and I heard the street door slam, as if somebody was going out; I am sure the street door had been locked. When I got to the parlour the door was wide<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280048"></xptr>open; I had shut it when I went down, about an hour before - I looked at the windows, the sash and the blinds were then open, and a chair stood under the window, with wet footmarks upon it; an oil painting had been taken from a little recess. A chair had been moved to the sideboard, to enable a person to get it down. I went all over the house, but found no person, nor anything more gone. I have seen the frame of the picture since, at our house, when it was brought by the officer - as soon as I saw the frame I thought it the frame of that picture. I have lived there five or six years, and have dusted the picture and looked at them very often.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 18th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to St. Giles's, after some persons, and on going up Bainbridge-street in a court on looking over a window shutter, the two prisoners, sitting in a room; I tried the door, and it was locked - I told them to open it, and they did so; there was no other person in the room. I observed this picture frame concealed under the bed: I questioned them concerning it, and they said they knew nothing about it. I asked if they lived there: they denied that at first, but Jones afterwards acknowledged that he lived there. Conley said he came in with a girl to drink tea with Jones; the tea things were set for two persons only. Jones was behind the door, and had got his coat off; he said he had been changing his shirt. I took them to the office, and took the frame to Mr. Sturt's house on the Friday following; I saw the mark where the frame had hung on the wall; it fitted exactly - I looked at it very attentively for ten minutes. The moment I took it to the house the last witness said that was the frame of her master's picture.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Sturt's house on the Tuesday after the robbery; I found footmarks on a chair, and on a small ledge under the window, and on the sideboard. I heard on the Thursday that the men were in custody; I went to Clerkenwell-prison, and asked them what they were there for; they said for bail. I asked Conley what he knew about the pictures - he said nothing; I then desired him and Jones to pull off their shoes, which I took to Mr. Sturt's, and they exactly corresponded with the marks of feet in the house. One pair of shoes has nails in them, and the other has not.</p>

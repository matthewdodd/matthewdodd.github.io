On Wednesday morning the 10th of June, about the hour of eleven o'clock, I came out of a house called the Blue-last, <placeName id="t18070701-33-crimeloc202">Cock-court, Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Which pocket was it. - A. My left hand side pocket; I felt her take it out of my pocket, and the moment that I disengaged myself from her, I charged her with the robbery; I called the watch; I observed just as she had attacked me the watchman was standing within two or three yards of her, of the name of Bennet; he did not take charge of her, but another watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180707010034"></xptr> came up of the name of Cromack, he took charge of her, she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your pocket book - A. That I did not see; after she took my pocket book she put her hand behind, she passed it behind her I believe to the watchman Bennet; her head was situated so on my left shoulder so as I could not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your hands at that time. - A. My hands she artfully kept down.</p>
               <p>Q. How - A. By the method she used she clasped me round my body.</p>
               <p>Q. If she kept your arms down with both her hands, I do not know how she had one hand to spare to take your pocket book. - A. She got her left arm around my waist, and placed her body so close to the right arm, that both my arms were kept down; she laid hold of my left arm by her left arm, her arm was round me; she was taken to the watch house and searched by Cromack; nothing was found. Bennet has since absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. How long had you been at this public house. - A. I might be there doing a little business with a friend, about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking had not you. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were perfectly sober. - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. What line of life are you in. - A. I am a traveller; I deal in silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you travel for. - A. I am now collecting for a friend in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this. - A. About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your pocket book. - A. I have not; I had seen the note five minutes previous to my coming out of the house.</p>

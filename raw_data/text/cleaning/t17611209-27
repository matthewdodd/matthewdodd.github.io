He staid with me about six or seven weeks, and went away on the second of December instant. Last Sunday morning, when my maid got up, she found a casement open, which I knew was shut when I went to bed. I missed about a bushel of flour out of a sack in the kitchen, two cheeses, a loaf of bread, and a pair of stockings from off a line.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your house was made fast over night?</p>
               <p>Twyford. It was; I bolted the door with two bolts between nine and ten o'clock. A neighbour of mine had lost an empty sack on the Saturday, and he was inquiring about; and at last the prisoner was found in a barn, about a mile and a half from my house. There I went and found about half a bushel of flour, a loaf of bread, and a cheese, and my stockings on the prisoner's legs. I knew the stockings to be my property by a hole at the heel, and the bread of our own baking. He owned before the justice that he took these things for want of victuals.</p>

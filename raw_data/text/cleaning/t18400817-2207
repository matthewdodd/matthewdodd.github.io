                  </hi>. I am a carpenter. On the 18th of Au<lb></lb>gust I was nearly opposite St. George's church, in the Borough, between one and two o'clock in the morning—I had been out on business—I had been drinking, but was sober—the prisoner and three females were stand<lb></lb>ing talking—as I passed, the women spoke to me—I turned round, and had no sooner turned, than the prisoner snatched my watch out of my pocket, and had it in his hand—I snatched it from him again, as he held it up by the chain—he then ran away some thirty yards, and ran down a little passage, which is no thoroughfare—he returned—I collared him, and gave him to the officer.</p>

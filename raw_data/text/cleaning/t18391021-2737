                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in Bell-street, Maryle bone. On the 21st of September five or six men slept in the same root with me—the prisoner slept in the adjoining bed—I had the articles stated under my bed, carefully wrapped in an old handkerchief, to keep the dust from them—I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock, and got up at half-past four o'clock—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed my clothes—this is my handkerchief, and the only thing that has been found.</p>

I met him in Oxford-market, on the Wednesday after the Saturday on which these things were lost—when he got sight of me he turned and ran away—I crossed into a court, and he came in at the other end of the court—he turned, and was going away—I called Jack, what are you afraid of me for?"—when he came up, I said, "served the old man a nice trick, in taking his things"—he said, "Does he know that I took them?"—I said, "Of course he does; nobody left the room but you "—he asked what he valued them at—I said, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he said he had parted with the whole of the things but one handkerchief which he pulled out of his pocket, and said, "I must make away with this, I should not like to be taken with it on me "—I kept him talking some time, thinking I should see a policeman, and said if he would walk</p>

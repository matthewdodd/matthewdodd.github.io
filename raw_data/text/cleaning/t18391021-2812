                  </hi>. My father keeps the Cart and Horses public-house, in Clerkenwell. The prisoner came to the house on the 3rd of October, in the evening—I do not know at what time he came in—he had been in the house before the disturbance took place—in the course of the evening there was a disturbance, and I went into the tap-room and saw him quarrelling with some people there—I begged him to be quiet—he answered, "It is not my fault"—I said, "Well, sit down, and take no notice and be quiet"—I left the tap-room again—I again heard another noise, and entered the room again—I then saw him standing by the fire-place, and a chim<lb></lb>ney-sweep standing by the door with a little blood on his face, as if he had been struck by somebody—I again begged of the prisoner to be quiet, and not to ill-use the sweep, for he was tipsy—he said I had nothing to do with it—I said I had a good deal to do with it, for there was a disturbance in the house, and I could not suffer such conduct there—he then threatened to strike me, and used very bad language—I was frightened, and said, I supposed he took advantage of me because my father and brother were absent—I came out, and sent Miss Smith for my brother John, who lives next door—he came in, and requested the pri<lb></lb>soner to go out quietly—he insisted on being served with a pint of beer—I told him I would not draw him any more—my brother sent for a police<lb></lb>man—during this time he was calling my brother names, and wrangling with him—I cannot state what he said—he was saying he would not go out—the policeman Bullock came as I was standing at the door—I called my brother to the door, and he gave the prisoner in charge—the Policeman asked me if I would appear against him if he was taken to the station-house—I said, "Yes"—Bullock then went into the tap-room, and what</p>

               <p>he said to him I cannot say, but he came quietly from the tap-room door to the street door, and there I saw him scuffle with Bullock, apparently trying to throw him down, and by and by I saw Bullock bleeding—finding there was no other policeman near to protect him, 1 called out "Police," as loud as I could, and assistance came—after the mob had dis<lb></lb>persed from the door, a man picked up a knife, which I looked at and re<lb></lb>turned to the man, and told him to take it after them—it was a white han<lb></lb>dled pocket-knife, with the point broken off—I cannot recollect what I or my brother said to the policeman when he first came, but I think my brother said be had been attempting to strike me, and making a disturbance in the house—I cannot say what time of night this was—it was before ten o'clock, but we had no clock in the house, as it was gone to be repaired.</p>

I am brother of last witness—I was sent for, and came to the house—I found the prisoner there—he wanted some more beer, my sister would not serve him, and I told him to leave the house—when, I came in, she complained that he had threatened to strike her—I can hardly remember whether that complaint was made in his presence, but to the best of my recollection it was—she said he had threatened, if she did not serve him with more beer, to knock her head off, and when I came in be wanted more beer—I told him to leave the house—he said if I offered to meddle with him, he would knock my head off—I then sent for a police-man—Bullock came—I told him to take him away, as be had threatened me and my sister—Bullock told him he must go with him—he went out of the tap-room door with him quietly—when he got to the street-door, just stepping out, he put one arm round Bullock, and <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> him in the face with the other hand—I suppose it was with a knife, but I did not see it, I saw blood flow immediately all over the prisoner from Bullock—Bullock held him for some minutes after he was stabbed—they struggled—the prisoner put his legs between Bullock's, as if to throw him, but Bullock turned him on his back before he left him—other policemen came to his assistance after some time, as I called for the police—he was taken away, and Bullock was taken to the surgeon's—I was not there when the knife was found.</p>

I said there was a young woman lived with me, but she was not at home - I got a light, and took it up; we went into the room - he shut the door, and bolted it; he said, "Put out the light, and come to bed" - I said, "I beg your pardon, what are you going to give me?" he said, "I have only a few halfpence, but you need not be afraid to trust me till to-morrow" - I said, "That won't pay my rent;" I sat down on the bed, but would not go to bed.</p>

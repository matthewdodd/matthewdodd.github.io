                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in High-street, Shore<lb></lb>ditch. On the evening of the 1st of December I had been to Ratcliff-highway, and purchased 28lbs. of moist sugar, and 8 1/2 lbs. of lump—I had the moist sugar on my shoulder, and the loaf sugar in a handkerchief in my hand—the prisoner accosted me in Brick-lane, and said, "You seem to have a very awkward load there"—I said I had—he said, "Are you going far?"—I said, "To Shoreditch"—he said he was going that way, and would assist me in carrying one parcel—I said I was extremely obliged to him, and gave</p>

On the 30th of November, about half past eight o'clock in the morning, I was taking down the shop shutters, and saw the prisoner go into the shop alone - I was outside; he went to the counter, lifted up the flap, and pulled the inner sash of the window back; I saw him stoop into the window, take up these silk handkerchiefs, and put them into his hat - he had fifteen or eighteen of them; they are India silk - he put his hat on and stepped back on the stool, then went back again into the window and took more; what he could not put into his hat he put between his coat and waistcoat - he came out at the shop door, and there I caught hold of him, called for assistance, and he was detained; twenty-nine handkerchiefs were found on him - I know them to be master's - he had about fifteen in his hat; he said nothing.</p>

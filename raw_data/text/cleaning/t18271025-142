On the 25th of September, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the street, and asked her to buy a piece of cloth - we went together to her house - she appeared the owner of the house. I showed my goods there - we could not agree about the price. I then went to the <placeName id="t18271025-142-crimeloc826">Pickled Egg public-house</placeName>

I told the landlord - he then took my pack into his care - I was tipsy. Next day I missed a piece of handkerchiefs, containing seven, and a shawl. I was sober when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went there at her invitation? A. I went in, and she followed; I drank at her expense - I do not know how long I was there, I believe about two hours. I gave her nothing, I am sure; I do not remember how much I drank; I saw her take the two handkerchiefs, and put them into her pocket, before I got quite intoxicated; I took them from her - she then said she took them out of a lark. I continued drinking with her - she drank a good deal.</p>

            . I keep the Pickled Egg. The prisoner and prosecutor came to my house, and had a pot of porter and two quarterns of gin; they called for more gin, but had no money to pay for it; they called for more gin, soon get money; she went out, and came back again twice; before she went out the second time I went into the parlour, and took the prosecutors's pack up stairs, as he was not able to mind it; he came into the tap-room soon after, and pulled off his hat - he said he had lost two handkerchiefs, and accused me of robbing him; I said, "I don't think you have been robbed at all - you have got two handkerchiefs in your hat now;" he said, "Yes, but there should be four;" I said, "If you have been robbed I can find the woman who was with you." I went out, received information from one Moore, and went to a pawnbroker's in Wardour-street- I found some property, and in about an hour I found the prisoner in the street, close by my house; Kelly did not then know that he had lost more than two handkerchiefs; I went home and asked if he had lost any thing else - he then described the other handkerchief and shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they drunk? A. Yes; Kelly was turned out of the office that night, because he was drunk; the prisoner might be the worse for liquor; she said she had done nothing with the handkerchiefs. she went out at first between five and six o'clock; she was sober then.</p>

I was at the Pickled Egg that night, but not in the room they were in - I heard the prosecutor charge her with taking two handkerchiefs; I thought it frivilous, and asked if he had cut two off the piece - he said he had; I said, "I suppose you cut them off to give to her;" he said,"I did not intend to give them to her - I laid them in her lap to take care of for me."

                  </hi>. I was under-butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald, who lived in Belgrave-square, in the parish of St. George's Hanover-square; his lordship died in the early part of Thursday morning, 11th May—Howse was his lordship's house-steward. On Friday evening, the day after his lord<lb></lb>ship's death, I remember seeing a tall man, who I did not know, in company with Howse in the butler's pantry, where a portion of Lord Fitzgerald's plate was kept, in consequence of some repairs that were going on; the chest that was stolen was in that room—I did not notice which way the man came in—I first saw him in the room—I did not notice which way the man came his back towards me—I was standing by the table in the pantry—he came in backwards—I saw no reason for that—there was nothing to account for his coming in so as not to show his face—I did not take that notice—on his coming in I left the pantry—Howse and he came in together—I returned to the pantry in about fice minutes, and found them still together—Howse said to the other man, "I think this pantry is larger than yours;" he said, "No, I think not"—he then took him into the plate-closet, and said, "You see we have had this done up for the old man, but it is no use now"—this was about half-past six in the evening—on the following day we were to be mea<lb></lb>sured for our mourning—no time was fixed for our being measured, that I know of—some directions were given to the men-servants by West, about being measured—I went up among the rest to be measured—just before I went up to be measured I went out for some beer—I went out by a door that leads into the area and up the steps into the street—that door has a spring-lock to it—when I went out I pulled that door to, so that the lock caught—there is an iron-gate at the top which was not kept locked, which opens into the street in the ordinary way—I think there is an iron-railling on this cross piece (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the position on a model of the premises</hi>)—I was gone about five minutes—I returned in the same way—I found the area-door fast as I had left it—I rang the bell, and smith the butler, and West the porter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120050"></xptr>
               <p>opened the door—the door was again closed, I am sure of that—about three minutes afterwards I went up into the dining-room to be measured—I found all the men-servants there except Howse—as I was going up I saw Howse standing on the mat at the bottom of the stairs—he said, "Why don't you go up to get measured?" and I went—he stopped there—I had been about two minutes in the dining-room when I heard an alarm of the robbery of the plate—I went down stairs—I saw Howse at the bottom of the stairs where I had left him—he said, "Here is one of your boxes of plate gone"—I then ran to the pantry—Howse followed me—he told me the box was gone from where it stood—I was looking to see which box it was, and he said, "There, it stood there"—I said "Yes, and you know it, it was full of silver plate"—there were several other boxes of plate there—the box that was taken was No. 8, and I think there were 9, or 10—there was nothing outside the boxes to tell to a stranger which contained the silver plate—they did not all contain silver plate—this was a small chest, it stood on the top of another one—it was full of silver plates—I do not exactly know how many silver dinner-plates were in it—when I said to Howse, "Yes, and you know it, it was full of silver plate," I turned round and looked at him, and his hand shook and his lips trembled—he said "Humph!"—I then ran into the servants' hall and got my hat to go to look after the men—I do not know what Howse did—I left him in the pantry—I did not see him make any effort to go in suit—I had been in the pantry, I should say, three minutes before I went out for the beer—the chest was then safe—I had occasion to go to that plate chest a short time before this occurred, to take out the silver plate which was used in administering the sacrament to Lord Fitzgerald—I re<lb></lb>turned that plate into the chest on Friday morning—when I returned from fetching the beer I noticed a chaise-cart standing near the railing, and a man with it—I took no particular notice of it—it was standing on the side next the area that I went up, by the curb-stone, opposite the area-gate—I did not notice it when I went out—I am sure it was there when I returned—there were some repairs going on which had made it necessary to have the plate in the butler's pantry, instead of in the room where it was usually kept—I was there the chief part of the time superintending the repairs—I did not hear Howse give any direction with respect to the repairs—there was to have been an iron door put up, and about ten o'clock, on the morning of the robbery, I heard Howse say to Smith, "We will not have the door put up to-day, as my lord is lying dead, I do not think it proper"—the workmen had been at work on the Friday, but not on the Thursday—the effect of Howse's direc<lb></lb>tion would be to stop any workmen coming on that part of the premises on that day—no workmen came—Howse saw the men at work there on the Friday.</p>

               <p>look at his face—I think there were ten boxes of plate altogether—some of them contained gilt plates—I think there was one gold plate in the box that was stolen—all the chests were in the pantry—the one this stood upon was on the ground—this was the top one, and the smallest of the two—there was valuable plate in the one below it—I do not exactly know the chests Nos. 3 and 7—none of the other chests contained plate of greater value than the one that was taken—I should say it was the most valuable of the lot—it was more valuable than the larger one, which stood below it—when I entered the service the plate was all counted over to me—there is a door at the bottom of the area steps, and another door leading into the passage between the still-room and the steward's-room, and that passage leads into the main passage, which goes from the housekeeper's room to the kitchen, but there are no steps to that area—there is a sort of curve or scroll in the iron railing of the area, leaving a space through which a man might drop down into the area, and by that means get to the centre door—the area runs round the house—one part of it fronts Belgrave-square—it is a corner house—that centre door was always kept shut until that morning, and all that morning it was open—it was opened to go out to clean boots and shoes, and shut when we came in again—it is sometimes kept open on a fine day to admit air—that was often done of an afternoon—the area gate was kept locked at night, but not in the day—anybody could unlatch the area gate, and come down to ring the bell below—I have known Smith about eight or nine years—it was through him I was introduced to Lord Fitzgerald—no other servant was engaged while I was there—I do not of my own know<lb></lb>ledge know who was in the habit of engaging the servants—I was certainly much agitated at the time of the robbery—I was quite astonished and con<lb></lb>founded at this plate having been taken away in broad day light.</p>

                  </hi>. I was porter to the late Lord Fitzgerald. About twelve o'clock on Saturday, the 13th of May, I received from Howse orders to send the servants up stairs to the dining-room, to be measured for their mourning—I was then down below in the passage near the servant's hall, at the bottom of the steps—about ten minutes after I received a second message—he said, "Why have you not sent the servants up into the dining-room?"—I said, I could not find them—I had not sent any one then—I went into the pantry to look for Thorpe, and then into the area, and looked in all the vaults, the three vaults that were open—the others were closed—I then saw him coming down the area steps with a pot of beer in his hand—I let him in—the door was fast before I let him in—no one could get in except they were let in by a person inside—Thorpe gave the beer to Smith—Smith opened the door—I told Smith at the time that they were all to go to the dining-room—I told Thorpe and Smith to go up to be measured—I went to the servant's hall, and then went up to the dining-room by myself, and they followed me—Howse was measured first, and he left the room directly afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I was butler to the late Lord Fitzgerald, and had been so about four months. The plate was usually kept in a closet for tie purpose, but, in consequence of some changes taking place, it was removed into the butler's pantry, about ten days or a fortnight before his lordship's death—on the Friday, the day after his lordship's death, Howse came into the pantry—I told him the men had come to work, which I thought was very improper-he said. "Why?"-I said, "Why, his lordship is lying dead in tne house, and I think it very improper for men to be at work, in the pantry, particularly, when such an event has taken place"—he said there had been an estimate made out for it, and it must be fulfilled—I said I thought it was very improper-however, the workmen went on—I told him I had also been to Mr. Cane, the executor, to tell him that I thought it improper the men should be at work at such a time—Howse said if Mr. Cane gate him one order and me another, he did not understand it-after this the men went on with their work that day—on the Saturday Howse told me that the men would not be there that day to put up the door, which was an iron door that was to have been put up to complete the closet—the box that was stolen contained fifty-four silver dinner plates, seventeen gilt dessert plates, two round official silver boxes, 1 think, I am certain there was one; twelve plated soup plates, and I think some others—I do not know, without I had the inventory, whether there was not some other plated dinner plates, I think there were, and a papier mache plate—I do not remember Howse making any observation about one of those boxes—the morning after his lordship's death, Howse remarked to me, in the pantry, that one of those boxes ought to be his, turning round to the plate chests that were behind us—I supposed him to mean, (I do not know why I should do so, certainly, but I supposed him to mean) a small box con-taining dessert things, which I had merely given into my charge, but had not signed my name for—when I entered the service I signed a receipt for the plate—that box was given into my custody at the time I signed the acknow<lb></lb>ledgment, but it was not in the list that I signed for—we were talking together about his lordship's death, and one thing and another—I brought some sherry down from the upper drawing-room—Howse helped himself to a glass, turned his head round, and said, "One of those, that small box, ought to be mine"—he said nothing further—I saw the plate-chest that was stolen safe in the pantry that Saturday morning—about twelve o'clock, or a little after, on that day, West gave me directions, as from Howse, to go into the dining-room—I went up directly-I found Howse and Woodbridge there, a man named Wright, a pic<lb></lb>ture-dealer,</p>

WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who had the custoday of the plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in my charge, with the under butler's—I was well acquainted with the contents of the various chests, by looking over them and counting them—I think there were about twelve chests altogether-the chest that was taken was rather smaller than the others—I should not think any of the other chests contained plate of greater value than the plate taken—I would not take upon myself to swear there was not, but I will swear it from the size of the box—I think there was not any of greater value—I think there was one chest that contained silver articles exclusively—it contained spoons and forks, and everything appertaining to the use of an establishment—there were entre dishes and covers—I do not think there were chests there that would weigh considerably more than the one which was removed, but I will not be posi<lb></lb>tive the persons taking this plate out of the pantry would to pass the housekepper's room, on the left-hand side, and the still room, on the left-hand side—(the still-room is used for the maid-servants—there were two house-maids and a kitchen-maid—there was also a cook and the housekeeper, but they had no business in the still-room—there were five female servants alto<lb></lb>gether only three used the still-room)—they would then pass a passage that leads to the area, on the left-hand side—they would also pass Howse's room and the servants' hall, to get to the area—the pantry is as close as possible to the housekeeper's room—they would not have to pass the kitchen; that is at the extreme end of the passage—they could get out at the area gate without</p>

               <p>passing the kitchen—I do not think a person could open the door of the house<lb></lb>keeper's room and the door of the butler's pantry at the same time—I could not do it, because the distance is rather too far to extend—a man with very long arms might do it—the cook has lived in the family about three months—a per<lb></lb>son named Mark Denton called on me that morning on business—he is a servant that had gone to the situation I left when I came to Lord Fitzgerald's—Mr. Cane was in the house that morning—he slept in the house that night—I believe he was in the drawing-room at the time the tailor was measuring the servants—I did not know the tailor, only by seeing him there that day—I understand he was brought there by Mr. Cane's order—I do not know who usually made Howse's clothes—I do not know who made his clothes before—I do not know that it was not Howse's tailor that was there that morning—Howse never complained about my leaving the doors open—I have never heard that he has complained of my doing so—I have heard him complant of the doors being left open—he has never complained to me or in my hearing that it made the property of the house insecure—he did not assign any reason for complaining of the doors being left open.</p>

                  </hi>. I was housekeeper to Lord Fitzgerald, and should have been so fifteen months on the 21st of this month—I remember being in his lordship's bed-room on the Saturday morning after he died—I heard the call-bell ring about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—it turned out that it was for me—I went down stairs to the dining-room—I then saw Howse, and found it was him that had sent for me—at that time he was being measured for his mourning—after he was measured, he told me I was to go up to the back drawing-room, to Mr. Cane, and speak to him about the fe<lb></lb>males mourning—he came out of the dining-room, and told me that—I left him, and went to the back drawing-room for that purpose—Howse went down the stairs, across the hall, down the kitchen stairs in a hurried way—when I had seen Mr. Cane I came down stairs immediately—I was a very short time with him—I had got about half-way down the kitchen stairs when I saw Howse at the top of the three stairs, going towards his room along the passage—I went before him towards his room—I said, "Now, Mr. Howse, I will speak to you"—I had frequently been in the habit of speaking to him in his own room before that time—when I got to his door, he said, "No, go, go," and put his hand in this way, in the direction of my room—that had the effect of pre<lb></lb>venting me from going into his room—I went to my own room—he followed me—I got into my own room, and commenced speaking to him about the mourning, and he said, "I must have a pen and ink"—I told him that was not necessary—he said, "Yes, I must"—I said, "Mr. Howse, you don't want it, for I will do justice to the utmost"—he went out of my room—he said he wanted the pen and ink to set down some things that I was going to tell him about the mourning—he said he must have a pen and ink—he opened the door about half-way, and pulled the door gently after him by his hand, not as any one else would do, catch it sharp after them—he kept the door in his hand till he got out, and pulled it to—I could have seen what was passing in the butler's pantry if the door had been opened—I do not think I could have seen him where I was sitting—if I had got up from my seat I could have seen into the passage—at the time he said he must have a pen and ink, there was a pen and ink in my room, which he had used occa<lb></lb>sionally, and even brought two or three persons in occasionally to use it in my room—after Howse had gone out of the room, and drew the door to, I heard footsteps of more than one person—it could not have been more than a quarter of a minute after—it appeared against the mat of my door, between the two doors, the mat of the pantry door and my door—the noise was a sort of a shuffling of feet—it is a stone pavement—it was a sort of shuffle which people make when carrying something heavy on a stone pavement—he returned to me I think in about half a minute after I heard the noise—he came in, shut the door, went to my table, and took the pen and ink off it, with his back towards me—he did not bring in any pen and ink for which he had left the room—his hand shook violently, and his face was very red—he looked excited—I was just commencing the conversation, and the cook, Mrs. Williams, came to the door—I heard her footsteps coming to the door—he made two strokes with his pen—he made a mark on two pieces of paper, which I understood him were bills, and that he had brought something wrong—I cannot exactly say what he said—when the cook came into the room she was going to say something—I said, "Now go, we are talking," and she</p>

               <p>went out again—she returned again in about half a minute, and said "Mr. Howse, have you sent a box of any kind out of the house, for two men have carried it up the area steps?"—he said, "No"—I asked her what kind of box—she said, "A box something like a plate chest"—I said, "God bless me, run and stop it," and I got up immediately—I went out into the passage and called the men as loud as I could call, not being aware that they were up stairs—the men came down stairs—I think Thorpe was the first—I do not know what became of Howse—I do not recollect seeing him again till after Mrs. Williams came into the house again from the street—when I left the room, I think I must have left Howse and Mrs. Williams in it, but I am not quite sure—when the alarm was given, Howse seemed very excited, and still his hand trembled—on my return I found him in the passage with a gentleman, and followed him up the passage with the policeman No. 5, of the B division—I said, "Mr. Howse, it was you, and you only, that let the men out of the pantry with the plate"—I did not hear him make any reply—on the Thursday evening, the evening before this, I remember a tall man, of sallow complexion and dark hair, coming to see Howse, and Howse took him into the pantry—I heard him talking there—I think it must have been about half-past six o'clock—I am not quite certain—it was between six and seven—I had never seen the man before to my knowledge—I heard them talking about the quantity of plate that was in the pantry, and then I heard him show him the plate closet, which he said had been fitted up—I did not see him do so—Howse said to the other man, "I suppose your master is going to have one fitted up like it?"—after that he brought him into my room, and intro<lb></lb>duced him—he said, "Mrs. Parker, Lord Fitzgerald's housekeeper, my friend"—the man made a remark about the airiness of my room—it is a very large room, and very airy—after he returned from my room he went along the passage, and said to Mr. Howse, "What door is that?"—I did not see the door he pointed to, if he pointed at all, but Mr. Howse replied, "The wine-cellar door"—that is one of the doors in the passage, and next adjoining the butler's pantry.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT TALFOURD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you had been there about fifteen months; were you hired by the year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was only stopping to oblige Lord Fitzgerald—I was not a permanent servant, but continued from week to week—I was in the same house with the family of Vincent Eyre, Esq., eight years before Lord Fitzgerald came, and he wished me to continue with him as his housekeeper—Howse was the house steward—he had the superintendence of all the servants—when he came to the house, I gave him master keys, two of the wine-cellar, and two of the plate-closet leading out of the pantry, which would enable him to open them at any time, and look into them to see that all was right—he had the entire confidence of Lord Fitz<lb></lb>Gerald—I was only in Lord Fitzgerald's room once or twice during his last illness—on two days I was in the adjoining room, and backwards and for<lb></lb>wards occasionally—Howse was in the room, looking through the curtains when poor Lord Fitzgerald died, and he was ordered to go out of the room by Dr. Tevan, for it disturbed his lordship—I had not heard his lordship take leave of him just before that—I did not hear him speak to him.</p>

               <p>agitated myself at the time I found the plate-chest gone—the call bell is in the lower passage, about opposite Howse's room—it is rung from the passage, on the basement story, just at the one end of the Passage that goes into my room, at the further part of the passage from my room, near the kitchen—when I heard the bell ring I was up two pair of stairs—three pairs from the area—I had gone up into that room about twelve o'clock, and I was there when the bell rung—when I came down, I saw Howse in the act of being measured by the tailor—I do not know whether he is the tailor that usually made the servants' things—Mr. Cane was in the back drawing-room at that time—that is on the first floor from the sitting-room, above the dining-room—I went to Mr. Cane, and received some directions, then I went down the first flight of stairs, and so down towards Howse's room—he was on the three stairs that come up from the passage to the kitchen—he was not coming down the same flight of stairs as I was—there was a pen and ink in my room, on a large side-table at the left-hand side of the fire-place, not standing in the centre of the room—I generally settled my business with him in his own room, and when there we had a pen and ink—he had two pieces of paper when he went out, and drew the door after him, and he brought them in again with him—I do not think it was more than half a minute from the time he went out till he returned—I could not say quite—it might be a very little longer—I have been remaining in the house since my lord's death, and so have all the servants—we have been talking about the loss of the plate among ourselves, saying what an awful thing it was—we have no great deal to do there now—we have frequently talked the matter over together, about what we had each seen and heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say Howse made you no answer when you spoke to him about the loss of the plate; did not he say, "Have I not often told you not to leave the drawers open?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not to my recollection—I can swear that did not pass—the first time I was at Queen-square I did not name about the shuffling of the feet—I forgot it—I did remember it, but I omitted saying it—I did not remember it while I was giving my evidence, but I did before and after—it slipped my memory at that particular time—I had mentioned it before that to my fellow-servants—I think I mentioned it to Smith the but<lb></lb>ler—I am certain I did to the cook.</p>

                  </hi>. I was kitchen-maid in the late Lord Fitzgerald's house, and know the butler's pantry in which the plate was kept.

                  </hi>. I was cook in the service of the late Lord Fitz<lb></lb>gerald; I had been so three months on the 27th of May. On the Saturday on which this plate was stolen I was in the kitchen all the morning—I re<lb></lb>member Mary Hawkins coming there about twelve o'clock, or half-past, to put the potatoes on—she did so, and left the kitchen in a few minutes after<lb></lb>wards—when she came into the kitchen Mr. Bull was there—he remained there till after the alarm of this robbery was given—when she came in to put the potatoes on she went to stir the fire—I had some rice-milk to make, and I said, "Don't stir the fire, Mary, there is plenty of time to put on the pota<lb></lb>toes"—she said, "No, there is not, it is half-past twelve"—I said, "Half-past twelve! so late as that?" expressing some surprise—there is no clock in the kitchen, there is in the passage—I did not look in the passage—Mr. Bull made some observation—I followed Hawkins out of the kitchen—the was about two or three yards before me—she closed the door after her, and I opened it to go out into the passage directly after she went out—I went to look for Smith, as Mr. Bull wanted to go away—when I opened the kitchen door, the area door was shutting, and I saw a man's hand on the door, shut<lb></lb>ting it—he was outside the door—I heard a box or something knock against the door—I opened the door, looked into the area, and saw two men carrying a box up the area steps—when I first saw them they were going up the three steps that go up first of all into the area—they are close to the door; then you come to a straight piece before you come to the steps again—they were on those steps when I saw them—their backs were towards me, and part of their sides—they were carrying it between them—they proceeded with it along the area till they came to the steps—they then went up the steps—they turned when they got to the bend of the stairs, and I then saw Fuller's face—he was the first man—he went up the steps backwards—I had not known him before—I should think the other man was about five feet nine or ten inches high, a very fine looking man—I thought I had seen him in the house, although I</p>

               <p>did not see his face—the box was a square one, and had the appearance of a plate-chest—it appeared to be heavy, from the manner in which they carried it—Fuller is the man whose face I saw; and it struck me directly, when I saw the other man taking the box, that he was a friend of Mr. Howse—I thought it was the man who had come to see Howse the evening before—I shut the door when I saw the man's hand on the area door, and I went to tell Mrs. Parker I wondered what Mr. Howse had been sending out then, because something struck me it was wrong—I then went to Mrs. Parker's room—Mr. Howse was sitting there—Mrs. Parker said, "Now, just go, we are talking"—I left the room, went to the pantry door, and knocked at it—no one answered—I looked in, and then ran from there to the servants'-hall, knocked at the door, looked in there, saw no one, ran back to the housekeeper's room again, and said, "Mr. Howse, have you sent a box" or "a box of any sort away?"—he said, "No,"—(I did not stop in any of these places, I went as quick as I could)—I said, "Will you just go into the pantry and see?"—he did so, and said, "Yes, there is one gone"—I ran out into the area, went to a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man that was stand<lb></lb>ing just opposite, and asked him something—I think I saw Howse standing by a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when I was making inquiries—a policeman came in a few minutes—I gave him a description of the persons I had seen take the box away—I said to Howse, "I think, Mr. Howse, I have seen that man, the tall, dark man come to see you"—he did not make any answer—I said nothing more to him at that time—afterwards I was with him in the housekeeper's room, and told him it was a very shocking thing—he said, "Yes, it is very shocking"—I said, "Mr. Howse, it looks like a planned thing"—he said it did—I said, "The men must have been in the house"—he said, "They must"—I said Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liam Russell's servant called out of the window and said she had seen a cart there for an hour—he said, "As for that I have seen two carts standing there all the morning"—Mr. Smith said, "Mr. Howse, if you had seen a cart there that looked suspicious, why was not you on the look out?"—he said he did not take notice of them—he grumbled something to himself, but I cannot say what his words were exactly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you often been in prison before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in Horsemonger-lane before, and I paid my debts—I was in the Queen's Bench, when his lordship presided, for horsewhipping an attorney—I think that is nearly all the prisons I have been in—I can tell you—I will go into the history of my life—I was committed to the Queen's Bench, by the sentence of the court, for the assault on the attorney, and I think about twenty-five years ago I was tried for an offence which I will not name here, because there are ladies pre<lb></lb>sent—it was for an assault, and I was honourably acquitted—those are the only times I have been in prison—I was never in prison for fraud, conspiracy, or perjury, or for keeping a gaming-house—I was indicted, as I tell you, for horsewhipping an impudent attorney—I have never been in the habit of giving advice where persons could dispose of stolen property—I never mentioned the names of persons who would purchase—I cannot say whether it was be<lb></lb>fore or after I mentioned those names to Howse that the wine was fetched—I am very poor, Mr. Serjeant Talfourd—I have got eleven children—there is no great crime in poverty, I think, in this country—I have done some profes<lb></lb>sional business for Howse—I wrote to him before he called on me—I cannot say how soon after I wrote to him he called on me—it was very soon after<lb></lb>wards—it was not a month—I cannot say whether it was a week—I should say it was a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your object in writing to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I have known the man a long time, and I respected the man—I knew him when he was in the Navy—my object in writing to him was not to borrow money—perhaps I said I regretted to hear of his difficulties, and should be very glad to see him; or something of that kind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-dealer, and live at No. 88, New Bond-street. I had desired Fuller to call on me on Saturday, the 13th of May—he came about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, with a horse and van, and a man to remove pictures—they were packed up in the van, and they left about a quarter or twenty minutes to twelve as near as I can guess—I was before the Magistrate three different times ready to be examined.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Fuller's service as carman, and live in Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road. On Saturday, the 13th of May, I went with Fuller to Mr. Chaplin's, in New Bond-street—after we left Bond-street, we went together as far as the end of George-yard, which leads from George-street into Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, close to the prisoner's house—we there parted—he was to send a lad down with money for coals—after I had received the money for the coals, and victuals for the horses, I went towards Hendon, and Fuller went towards his house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years of age. I know Fuller—on the Saturday before he was taken into custody, I saw him at his door about a quarter to twelve o'clock, and asked his permission to ride in his cart—I went in the cart with him into Portugal-street—he had a bag of wood in the cart—we went to the house of a gentleman named Manson in Portugal-street—I know the time, because I saw the clock of Grosvenor chapel in South Audley-street—it was five minutes to twelve by it—he delivered the wood to a female-servant of Mr. Manson's—we then went round the other side of the square, came down Duke-street into Oxford-street, and so into George-street—a man named Dunn, who is in Fuller's service, put up the horse and cart in the stable—I then went home to dinner.</p>

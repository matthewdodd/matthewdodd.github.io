                  </hi>. I am a proctor, residing in Doctors' Commons, It is exceedingly difficult to limit the extent of the Arch<lb></lb>discese of Canterbury—Baltic-street. St. Luke's is in the peculiar of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in all cases of practlee—I have no means of judging but by the rules of the Court, in taking out administration—I was employed with my father to take out letters of administration to Henry Roberts, deceased, with the will annexed—I produce the letters of administration, with the will annexed, which were extracted by us—they are issued from the Registry of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, as the peculiar is exempt from the jurisdiction of the diocesan, from the circum<lb></lb>stance of the deceased being possessed of property both within and without the peculiar—he left bona notabilia, within the province of the Archbishop of Canterbury—the letters of administration are dated 16th of May, 1835.</p>

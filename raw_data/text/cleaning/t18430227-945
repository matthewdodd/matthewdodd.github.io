                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Griffiths, and live in Cornhill. I am in partnership with Margaret Evans—about a quarter to two o'clock on Sa<lb></lb>turday, the 11th, of Feb. the two prisoners came to look at some shawls, and they talked to each other, saying they could get them cheaper at Silver's—there was a bundle of silk handkerchiefs in the window, about twelve pieces—Thompson took two pieces from the middle of them and buttoned them under his coat—I suspected they were thieves, and saw the ravelling of the hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs—I unbuttoned his coat, took the handkerchiefs, and threw them be<lb></lb>hind the counter—Darrell came up and knocked me down—I am certain Thompson is the man that took them, and he ran away—our porter followed Thompson, and my partner took hold of Darrell—when our porter caught Thompson in Finch-lane, he said he had only broken a window, but we had no window broken.</p>

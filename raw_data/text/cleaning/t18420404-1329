On Tuesday, the 24th of March, there was a knock at the door—I answered it, and saw the prisoner—he asked me for a tuscan bonnet to be cleaned, and said he came from Mrs. Squire's, in Tottenham Court-road—I left him below in the hall, with the door shut, and went up stairs to</p>

On Thursday, the 24th of March, I was in Grafton-street East, near Gower-street, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner, and two other boys, named Stanton and Cooper—I saw Stanton go to the door of No. 27, Grafton-street East—he appeared to be answered by some one from the area—he then went away, and joined his companions—they then went down Gower-street—I did not see to what house they went—I afterwards saw Cooper and Stanton waiting outside No. 27, Gower-street, walking up and down by the door several times—I went to the corner of Store-street, and watched them—in a moment afterwards I saw Cooper running along Store-street, with an umbrella in his hand—I ran after him, and caught him—he dropped it, and said, "It was not me, it was not me, I did not do it"—I took him and the umbrella to the house where Chandler was—I did not take the other two boys.</p>

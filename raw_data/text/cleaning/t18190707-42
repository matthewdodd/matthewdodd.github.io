I followed her up stairs, she opened the door, and I went in - I took my watch out, and put it on the floor - I looked round for the place, and immediately missed my watch, she was shutting the door; I ran after her, and said she must have it, she said she knew nothing about it. A person came up, who I took for the landlord; she wrenched herself out of my hand and got off - I followed, caught her at the door, took her to the watch-house, and gave her in charge. She denied it, and said she would be searched if I would leave the place. The constable ordered her to strip, and she unpinned her things. When she came to her under-petticoat she began to be very slow; she put her hand under her petticoat, got the watch in her hand, and the constable took it out of her hand.</p>

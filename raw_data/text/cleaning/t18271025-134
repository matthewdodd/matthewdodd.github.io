            . I am an upholsterer. I went to Mr. Hopkins' shop, No. 60, Shoreditch, between the 5th and 11th of July - I cannot tell the day - the prisoner attended to me there; I bought of him four pieces of chintz, and ninety yards of bordcring; I had selected them nearly a week before, in his presence, and under his direction; I told him to lay them by for me, and when I went again he produced them; I asked him for a piece of striped chintz; he got the key, and went up stairs at No. 62, which also belongs to Mr. Hopkins; I there chose one piece, and brought it down; I was to give 18s. for it; he made me out this bill (looking at it) - it is in pencil, but the same writing is on it as when he gave it to me; he made out no other bill that I saw - the three pieces of chintz were 1l. each, and the fourth 18s.; I bought a piece of brown holland for 25s., being 6l. 3s. together; I paid him six sovereigns and three shilliags; these remnants are part of the chintz; I afterwards went there again to purchase more of the same; I did not see Mr. Hopkins, but in consequence of my going there again he came to my house, and I showed him the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you any receipt? A. No; I swear this did not happen before the 1st of July - there is no date on the bill; my attention was not called to it before September; I did not at first recollect when it was, till I looked at some documents - here is one of them - it is a bill which I sent with some goods - it is dated the 9th of July, and is for a couch, which I covered with some of the chintz; I swear the purchase was before the 1st of July, without referring to any thing - the couch was made all but the chintz.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain it was after the 1st of July? A. I have no doubt of it whatever.</p>

The prisoner was in my service about fourteen months; I discharged him in August, as I took stock then, and found a deficiency of about 500l. - it was his business to attend in the shop, and sell goods; we have private marks on the goods to denote the price; when he sells goods, it is his duty to make out a bill, and give it to the next young man to sign with a letter - each shopman has a letter to describe him - the prisoner's letter was P; he was also to make out a cheque, and take to the desk to deliver with the money to the cashier, who receives the money, enters it in a book, and files the cheque; the prisoner also had a small book, in which he should enter the cheque - he left his cheque-book with me when he went away in August. In consequence of information from Jones I examined his cheque-book from the 5th to the 11th of July - here are entries, but none of 6l. 3s.; the bill produced is his hand-writing - there is no letter on it to denote its having been examined by another; I have my cash-book, which is balanced every night by the cashier; the shopmen then call over their own books, and if that differs from the cash-book, reference is made to the cheque file; there was no mistake of 6l. 3s. at this time; Jones produced some chintz to me - I saw the mark on it - the three pieces should have been sold for 35s. each - they cost me 31s.; the striped chintz should have been 37s. 4d. a piece - he bought them at three guineas less than the original cost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You keep several men? A. Yes; each man has his own department; as soon as they write a cheque they take it with the money to the desk; they always take them singly, not five or six together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If another customer comes in and takes his attention, may he not sell again, and make another cheque? A. No; he puts down the amount immediately, and goes to the desk with it - I never knew such a thing happen; the desk is not six yards off - I never knew a cheque dropped; one transaction is always settled first.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you often found more money in the till of an evening, than has been entered? A. There has been 2s. or 3s. - I never had two cheques brought to me at once - I did not say so at the office.</p>

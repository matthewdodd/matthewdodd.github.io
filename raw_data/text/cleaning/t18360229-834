                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-row, in the parish of Saint Matthew, Bethnal-green, near the Bird-cage. I have a fowl-house at the end of my garden—my garden is surrounded by a wall at the bottom, and a wooden fence at the two sides—the fence is all round my ground—I had five hens and one cock—on the 21st of February they were all safe at six o'clock, in the fowl-house—the same evening between eight and nine o'clock I heard something—I went to the bottom of my garden, and found it had been broken into—the wall was broken down, and the gate of the fowl-house broken open, and my fowls were missing—I found them at the station-house—these are them.</p>

I live in Bird-cage-fields, Bird-cage-walk, and am a rope-manufacturer—I was going into the field about eight o'clock that evening—I heard the fowls—I stopped a few minutes and heard footsteps, and stopped—the prisoner, and two others walked towards me—I walked on before them—I went to a neighbour's house, and left my jug for my beer, and then they got on before me—I followed the prisoner, who had the fowls in a bag, to Warren's-place, Hackney-road, where I met a policeman, who took him, when I told him he had got something which I thought did not belong to him.</p>

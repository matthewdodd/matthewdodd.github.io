I and my son had taken a contract to build a house in High-street, Woolwich—the materials of the old house were ours—I had seen the premises almost every day before the 5th of September, but I could not see where this lead was—it was behind a chimney on the roof, out there</p>

I am a sweep—last Friday week I met Fraser on the road—I knew him by living beside him at Woolwich—he asked if I would carry this property, which he had in a bag—I did not know what was in it—we went along till we came to a marine store-shop—I carried it into the shop—he went in and spoke to Mrs. Burbage, who was in the shop—I was going to pull it out of the bag, but Fraser said, "Don't pull it out"—he asked whether she would buy it—she said, "No, not without a receipt"—he said he would give a receipt of his own—she said sit would have nothing to do with it—he then said, "Boy, take it up, I will take it to the person I had it of"—I took it, and the officer took me with it—Fraser was with me at the time.</p>

I was in company win Fraser, and from what Watts said I went to the Duke on Horseback public-house and took Bennett—he said he had received the lead from some young man whom he knew by sight, not by name, and could not tell where to find him—on the Monday following I went with Watts to the house, and we found this lead exactly corresponded with that left on the roof—I found no lead on Bennett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Defence.</hi> On the 5th of September Bennett came to my house in the evening, with a bag on his back, and some lead in it—he told me it did not belong to him, but a man he was well acquainted with would come in a few minutes and see it weighed—as soon as he was gone I went to Mrs. Burbage's, to assure myself whether I should buy it or not—she would not have any thing to do with it, and I told the boy to take it back—I said I would go and bring the man that brought it to my shop, and return it to him.</p>

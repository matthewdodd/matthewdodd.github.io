            . I am a Bow-street constable. On the 21st of May, about half-past two o'clock, I was in the <placeName id="t18180617-109-crimeloc616">Strand, near the end of Norfolk-street</placeName>

I immediately crossed the Strand, went down Norfolk-street, overtook them about a hundred yards down, and made a catch at one of them; he got out of my hand, and all three ran away. I pursued through different courts, at last the prisoner fell down, and as he fell he threw the pocket-book from him, to the left; I secured him with my right hand, and with my left picked the pocket-book up, which contained the property stated in the indictment.</p>

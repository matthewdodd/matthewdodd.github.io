               <p>JURY. Q. Is your private mark on it? A. No; not now - I cannot tell whether there was one when this was in the shop - we generally put them on gum tickets, which are apt to come off - I put a piece of this pattern and colour on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many pieces did you put down the second time? A. I cannot say, there was only one of this pattern - I know every pattern we have in the house - I cannot tell how many pieces we have- there are five piles about a foot high - if a handkerchief was taken I should miss it immediately, though there were twelve or fifteen pieces in a pile - the young ladies I mentioned it to were those who serve in the shop - I know this piece, as it had been in the window about three months before, and the part that was uppermost, when it was folded, was rather faded - I remember putting this particular piece in the window - I cannot say whether it was on the top of the pile or in the middle - I cannot find any trace of the gum mark on them - I missed this piece and another - the one I first missed has not been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been giving the jury and me to understand that you missed this piece? A. I missed this, but this was not the one I missed first.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you talked about your knowing it by its being faded, and by the fold, why did you not say that you did not mean this one? A. I have not had an opportunity - the prisoners were minutely searched for the other piece, but it has not been found - it was a British twill, a shell pattern, and a scarlet colour - I described it to the officer - I think there was only one young lady in the shop when the prisoners were there - she was twenty yards from me - but there were more when I missed the handkerchiefs - I did not see this piece found on the prisoner, but I saw it in about a quarter of an hour - I could not swear to it, but I went back and missed it from the shop - I cannot now swear it is ours, but to the best of my belief it is.</p>

            . I am a relation of the prosecutor's - I was in his shop - I saw the prisoners there - I received information - I went out and sent for an officer, and when the prisoners came out I was at the door with the policeman - he took them in charge - Anderson made a violent attempt to get into the shop again, and so did Johnson, but I prevented it - Anderson said he had bought the handkerchief, or a handkerchief, and he ought to be treated like a gentleman - I followed them to the station-house and watched them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you that from the time they left the prosecutor's till they got to the station-house you were behind them and watching them? A. Yes; I do not believe they dropped anything in the street, but they might in the police-office - I saw Anderson searched there, and nothing was found on him; but Johnson went down with the cook, and she might have been bribed to take anything.</p>

             (police-constable D 74). I was at the station-house when the prisoners were brought in - the man was searched, and after looking under the woman's cloak I took her down stairs, where a woman searched her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200029"></xptr>while I stood at the door; she found nothing on her - I was not satisfied, and took her to another woman, and as I was directing her to search her, she dropped this piece of handkerchief; I took it up and said, "What is this?" she said,"It is what you are looking for."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Johnson said, "This is what you are looking for?" A. Yes, I stated that before the Magistrate; I suppose it was taken down - there was nothing found on Anderson which the prosecutor claimed - I did not find anything dropped in the station-house, nor in the room below, but this piece.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. When the officer came and stopped me, I asked for what - he said, "I will tell you at the station-house" - I said, "This is the shop I have been in," and I wanted to go in, as I did not like to be stared at in the street - Mr. Wood put his hand to my bosom, and shoved me back, and said, "I shall not allow you to come in, you must go to the station-house" - I went, and was searched three times, and then twice more down stairs - after that, the shopman brought some handkerchiefs down and said, "Here are some handkerchiefs for you, do you know these?" - I said, "All the handkerchiefs I have are my own, and the one I have paid six shillings for."</p>

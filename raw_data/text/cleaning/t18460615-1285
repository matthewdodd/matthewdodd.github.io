                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-court, Union-street, Whitechapel. I advertised to procure a situation as cook and housekeeper—in consequence of which I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To E. L. Madam,—If you have no objection to change your situation in life, I should be happy to coramuaica with you on the subject. I am from New York, a widower, have one daughter. I am a merchant, and have also land there as well as in England. I am well aware this is not the usual mode of addressing a lady on this subject, but I know no one hardly in London, and my time is very short here. Pray write without delay, and be assured this is no trifling hoax, to J. M. Tubb's Post-office, Regent-street, Langham-place, when if you can per<lb></lb>mit me to call, it might be more satisfactory than auy other correspondence. I am, Madam, your's obediently, J. M." In consequence of this letter I went to South-street, Grosvenor-square—I there met the prisoner—he said he was the person who had written to me, and he produced my answer—he represented himself as an American merchant, a man of good property—he said I should meet with a respectable man; and as 1 had no tie in England, I said I should have no objection—I was at that time lodging at No. 1, North-terrace—the prisoner called there the next day—I had several other interviews with him—the result was, we agreed to be married at St. George's, Hanover-square; but it being rumoured about that I was going to New York, I was arrested by somebody I owed a debt to, on the Tuesday as I was to have been married on the Thursday—I soon got out from the arrest, and the prisoner and I arranged that we would be married at Manchester—we did not wish to be married in London, as it would make him subject to the debt—that was about the middle of Jan.—I went to my lodging, and slept there one night—I afterwards removed to a coffee-house in the Commercial-road—the prisoner went there with me—we were not married—he lived there with me for a fortnight—we then went to Duke-street, Gosvenor-square, and then to another coffee-house—I then went to Paris, to receive some money—I was absent a fortnight—I then went to the Rainbow coffee-house wilh the prisoner—I paid the expenses all this time—he represented that his property was all in bond at Liverpool, and it would be attended with great loss to enforce the sale of his goods, by putting them in the hands of other parties—I had received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Paris—I arranged with the prisoner to go to Liverpool—we were to go on the 10th of April, but on the day before that, the 9th of April, he went out and promised to be back at twelve o'clock, and 1 did not see him any more till the 18th of May—I advertised again on the 15th a May to get a situation, but I reversed my initials that time—I received this letter in answer—(<hi rend="italic">read.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, In consequence of this letter J gave directions, and got the prisoner apprehended—I was sure from the representations it was the same party—when I was in Paris I trusted the prisoner with part of my money to take care of, and he kept it—I remarked that I had got my pocket picked twice io London—on the Wednesday before Good Friday he was going to lay out some money for me—he then appeared to have twenty-five sovereigns of mine—he was to take some clothes out of pawn of mine—he returned, and said he had taken them out, and left them in the box somewhere in Whitechapel, but I never was able to find them—I had left some things in the box, but not many—there was a bonnet and feather, a boy's shirt, and pair of trowsers—previous to our leaving for Paris, he asked me to make some money on my things to pay expenses—I had left the box at the Omnibus coffee-house, Commercial-road—I never delivered that box to the prisoner, but he got possession of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are a solicitor? A. Yes, I was clerk to Silvester and Walter, but left them in August - I am on the roll of attorneys; it might be about five o'clock in the morning when this happened - I have two or three times a week to get up at half-past two o'clock; I had had a glass of ale, and a glass of gin and water at the Yorkshire Gray, in Brydges-street, and it was there I met Smith - I had 2l. 2s. in my pocket when I went out, and a few halfpence; I was robbed of 1l. 15s. - I had 3s. 6d. left in my pocket and some halfpence; I am not in the habit of going to houses of this sort - I did not object to the man being in the room; I did not say "I will have two any how," and then catch hold of Martin - I did not after I lost my money go into the room for half an hour with Smith.</p>

I heard the cry, and found the prosecutor at the house - he charged the persons there with stealing from him a sovereign and a half, and two half-crowns; he had his senses, and described all the circumstances as he has now - I found the prisoner Martin and Smith there; I took them all, and went in search of the man, but could not find him - there was a passage through the house, so that a person could go through; Cooper denied the charge, but in going to the station she said if we would go back we should find the money under the chair, but it has not been found - she offered the prosecutor 5l. to let her go, and offered me the same; the other two were remanded three times and then discharged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I would sooner have given 5l. than such a thing should have happened - when the prosecutor went into the back parlour, Smith said to him,"Will you come into the bed-room, for the sofa is not fit to sit down on;" when they were in the bed-room there was some quarrel and Smith called me - I went to the door; I found it locked - Smith said, "This man is quarrelling with me and using me very ill;" I said, "I am sure you should not, if you are tipsy you should not ill use her;" she then took his coat and waistcoat from the nail - the prosecutor and her stopped for the money which fell down; the prosecutor said, "It is my money."</p>

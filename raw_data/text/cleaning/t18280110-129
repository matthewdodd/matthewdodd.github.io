               <p>THOMAS WOODROW, JUN. I live with my father, Thomas Woodrow, a shoemaker, of Grub-street. On the 1st of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was carrying a parcel for Richard Burton, my master, a <rs id="t18280110-129-viclabel671" type="occupation">silk manufacturer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How broad is this place? A. It is narrow - two people cannot pass at the entrance of the court, but afterwards I could have passed him, if he had not pushed me back; he walked on when the other had escaped; Windmill-street and Tabernacle-walk both lead into one, and some people call it all Windmill-street.</p>

            . I am a watchman, and work at a cow-yard in Tabernacle-walk. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and Murder! I ran towards the spot, and saw this boy, who had hold of the prisoner's arm; he begged of me to take him, as he had been robbed of his master's property, and he had prevented his going after them. I took him into a public-house, and got an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he make any resistance? A. Not that I saw; there were one or two people about - I do not think he could have got from the boy; there is room for two people to pass in the passage - it is narrow just at the entrance.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer. On Saturday evening, the 1st of December, about half-past six o'clock, I was going home, and saw the prisoner and two other men walking; I followed them three hundred yards at least; when they got near the Tabernacle, they made a sudden start, and almost immediately I heard a cry of Stop thief! and Murder! I crossed over, and went down a passage leading into Windmill-street; at the end I saw this boy holding the prisoner; he said, "For God's sake stop him, for he has robbed me;" and then said, "He stopped me from going after the thief."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance were you from them? A. A very little way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and went down the passage; the lad caught hold of me, and said I had robbed him; and when the gentleman came up, he said I had stopped him.</p>

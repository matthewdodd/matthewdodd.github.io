                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Wright, of Union-buildings, Hackney-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; it is his dwelling-house. On the night of 2d Oct., I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I was the last person up, I left the house secure—I am not certain that the kitchen window was fastened, but I am certain it was shut, it goes very hard—when I got up in the morning I found that the window was broken, it is a leaden casement—I found the lead pushed out just against the fastening, enough to get a hand in—I missed from the front room two coats, a hat, a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and a pair of silk gloves—from the kitchen I missed a pair of boots, a shirt front, a cap, a pair of spectacles, and a silk handkerchief—I had seen them all safe on the Sunday night, except one silk handkerchief, which I put in the basket on the Saturday night—I know the prisoner by sight, he lives at Mr. Longstaff's, whose house is at the back of ours—I know this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is my son George's—this other coat is my husband's, and these spectacles also—I am certain they were safe in the house the night before.</p>

On the morning of 11th Nov., in consequence of some information, I went to the house of Mr. Longstaff—I saw the prisoner there, and took him into custody—I told him it was for breaking into Mr. Wright's house, and stealing two coats, a hat, and spectacles—he said he did not do it all himself, but he had taken the things in at the window—Mr. Longstaff handed me, in the prisoner's presence, two coats and a hat, he told me he found them in his box—Mr. Longstaff pointed out a box to me—I asked the prisoner if that was his box—he said, "Yes"—I opened it, and found in it this pair of spectacles—I had pre<lb></lb>viously been to the prosecutor's premises and saw footsteps, and some flowers broken down in Mr. Longstaffs garden.</p>

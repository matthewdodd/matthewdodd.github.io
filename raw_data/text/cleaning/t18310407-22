On the 3rd of March I had a load of cheese loaded at the Steel-yard, Thames-street, to go to Aldgate - my foreman loaded it; I was not present - an officer afterwards gave me information; I saw the cheese produced when the prisoner was in custody; he was a stranger to me.</p>

             MORGAN. I am a constable. On the 3rd of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw a waggon standing in the middle of the road, opposite Aldgate church; the prisoner and four or five others were standing about the pavement, opposite the waggon- I passed them, went on a few yards, and saw one of them go behind the waggon, take something out, and give it to the prisoner, who was towards Church-court, and I caught hold of him; the others ran away - I found this cheese on the prisoner; he said, "Let me go; I did not take it."</p>

            . I drive Mrs. Andrews' waggon - I left the waggon, but was never out of sight; I saw a cheese had been shifted, and stopped to see if I could see any body about - I was going to get into the waggon when the officer called to ask if I had lost any thing; he had the prisoner in custody, with the cheese - I am sure it is one of those cheeses I had in my waggon, as it was marked No. 5, in a diamond.</p>

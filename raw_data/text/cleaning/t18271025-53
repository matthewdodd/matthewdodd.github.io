               <p>JOHN DOUGLAS CLOSE. I live at Kilburn. About half-past seven o'clock on the evening of the 24th of October I was walking through <placeName id="t18271025-53-crimeloc335">Holborn</placeName>

            . I live in Lincoln's Inn-fields. Last Wednesday, about half-past seven o'clock, I was in company with Whittingham, on the opposite side of the way to Mr. Close, and saw the prisoner attempt his pocket several times - two others were with him; the prisoner put his hand in, and tried to pull something out; when they got near Kingsgate-street, one of his companions ran back - we crossed over; Whittingham laid hold of one of them, but he escaped; his hat fell off in the scuffle - I picked it up, and the handkerchief was close by it - I gave it to Whittingham; I secured the prisoner; I am sure they were all three together.</p>

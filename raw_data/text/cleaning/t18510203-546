                  </hi>. I and my husband occupy the house 18, Ramsay-street; Mrs. Dearn is a lodger of ours; she occupies the front parlour. On 2nd Dec. I was in my room up-stairs—some one called me, and I went down—the street-door was open—I looked out, but saw no one—I locked the door, and was going up-stairs again, but heard Mrs. Dearn unlock her door—I stopped—she opened it, and asked me to come in—I hesitated, knowing that a woman frequently came there in liquor—she said, "Do come in; it is not the woman you think it is"—I went in, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor, leaning her head against a bed-stead—Mrs. Dearn said some one had cut her throat—she appeared insensible—I asked her who did it—Mrs. Dearn said, "Mrs. Parnell can say"—she said, "I struggled hard"—Mrs. Dearn asked me if I would stop while she went and fetched some one—I said, "Yes"—I looked at her throat, and saw three or four scratches, and a little blood smeared over them—I asked her to tell me who did it, but she made no answer—she appeared quite insensible—just after that, two men came into the room, and Mrs. Parnell fell from the bedstead, where she was leaning, under the table, and said, "George Hopwood, I never did you any harm"—George Hopwood was not one of the men that came in—it was men<lb></lb>tioned in her hearing that a policeman was coming—she appeared insen<lb></lb>sible, but I do not think she was, because she kept speaking between</p>

               <p>whiles—I was just outside the door, in the passage, and heard her say she wanted to speak to the policeman—a policeman came, and went in—I heard her telling him where Mr. and Mrs. Hopwood lived, but did not notice the direction, as it did not concern me—it was in Ann's-place, I know—I saw the policeman taking it down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you alarmed when you went into the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I felt rather alarmed; I examined her throat, because Mrs. Dearn told me it was cut—I do not know how long Mrs. Dearn had been in the Toom—I saw no blood about the prisoner till I lifted up her chin, and looked at her throat—I had never seen Mr. and Mrs. Hopwood before they were let out on bail—I gave evidence for them last Session—I did not count the scratches on Mrs. Parnell's throat, but there must have been four or five—the blood that was smeared over them had come from them, but there was no blood running at the time—she remained at the house till the next night, lying on the bed, with her clothes on—I do not know whether any one sat up with her; I did not—I heard no screams in the street that night, or any noise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a velvet-weaver, at 25, Sale-street, Bethnal-green, adjoining Ramsay-street—I produce an instrument called a <hi rend="italic">trebat,</hi> used in weaving velvet—it cuts the wire out which we work upon—it hat got a groove in it—it has to be regulated to a great nicety.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the prisoner's throat on 2nd Dec., and found three parallel incisions on it, as near as possible equidistant—they were slight, skin deep—there was a redness of the skin on the anterior portion of the front of the throat like a band, by pressure on the part; it was not blood—I consider it was done by a guarded instru<lb></lb>ment—I suggested it might be a scarificator, something like a cupping instrument—(here had been an instrument equally as sharp as this used; it could not have been made with the hand—it might decidedly have been caused by this <hi rend="italic">trebat,</hi> but then it must have been passed across the throat three times, which would account for the redness—one bad gone a little over the other—it appeared to me to be done with a fork, it was an incised wound.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were three parallel lines; could they have been occasioned by a person who was-struggling with the prisoner at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might have been, but I think it would not have been so parallel if there had been much struggling—the whole of that neighbourhood is sur<lb></lb>rounded with weavers—I found the prisoner on the bed, unable to speak; the front part of her dress was covered with blood—I took no means of ascertaining whether her insensibility was feigned or not, because I thought it was real—I dressed the wound with strapping—I saw her again at nine o'clock, and again next morning—she was then removed to her lodging in Underwood-street, and was better, but was still in bed—I attended her occasionally until last sessions, first for about five or six days running, and then only every other day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the appearance of her neck be an adequate cause for her insensibility? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; from the wounds being inflicted, and from the excitement—I found a small red coral necklace on her neck—blood might have been on it without my noticing it—the wounds were sufficient to warrant my visiting her again that evening at nine o'clock, or</p>

               <p>I should not have gone—she was not insensible then, because she spoke to me—she was not entirely recovered.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean she had not entirely recovered her senses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had her senses, but being in a debilitated state from previous excite<lb></lb>ment, she required some time to think before she answered a question—I considered she was in such a weak state as to require stimulants—there was a great deal of hysteria about her—alarm will cause that—I called next morning at ten o'clock, or half-past; I made it my first visit—I found her in bed, and re-dressed the wound; she was very hot and feverish, with a very excited and rapid pulse—she appeared to be in a weak state, and I thought it would be unsafe for her to attend at the police-court, and gave a certificate to that effect—she was removed to Underwood-street that morning, and I visited her there next day—the wounds took about a week to heal—hysteria would account for a person speaking a few words while she was insensible, but she would not be able to carry on a conver<lb></lb>sation—she would be likely to make a pertinent remark in the midst of hysteria—hysteria can be assumed, and frequently is, but I was called suddenly in, and my impression was, that she was insensible from real causes—I saw no symptoms but what might result from weakness and excitement—I do not think she could have inflicted the wound herself, unless she was left-handed; but in a struggle it is difficult to say—in my judgment it was done from the right to the left.</p>

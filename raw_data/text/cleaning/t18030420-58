               <p>Bly. When I searched him, I laid the money down in the Office; I turned my head, and he endeavoured to secrete the marked half-crown; I took it out of his hand; when I searched him, I found, concealed under his coat, this silk handkerchief. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Huggins.) Look at that money? - A. I am perfectly sure this is the half-crown that I lost; it has the letter G upon it; the other I believe to be mine; it has a head on one side, and is plain on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is my own money; I took it at market either the night before, or that day, I am not sure which; I buy fowls, and retail them out; Huggins said before the Magistrate he could not positively swear to that half-crown.</p>

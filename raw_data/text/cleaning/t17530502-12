            . On the 20th of April I came home, and was inform'd I had lost a large quantity of iron, and that Trow was stopp'd in Noble-street with it on his back, and he was had to a publick house, near mine. I went to him, there was Mr. Goodwin with him, he told me he stopp'd him in Noble-street; the iron was at his house. (Produced in court and deposed to.) I believe I lost much more than I have found. I have got about three or four hundred weight again, the prisoner confessed he had taken it, and seemed to be very sorry, and said he was persuaded to it. I had employed him in pulling down these houses where he had the iron, and had discharg'd him but the day before. He said also there were two other persons concerned with him: in consequence of this he was carried to the Compter. We tried to take

After carrying him to the Compter we found out his house with a great deal of difficulty, We asked his wife leave to go down into the cellar, to which she consented, and the constable went down stairs with a candle, there we found two bags of iron, which Trow had said they had taken away that morning, that is Stansley and Price. There was also a great many other things, which I knew to be my property, though I have not laid them in the indictment. Then we went to my Lord-Mayor and told him what we had found; he desired me to get Price before him to be examin'd. When he came there he told my Lord that Stansley and Trow had that morning call'd him up, I think a little after four o'clock; that they three went to this place of mine, and that he went with a great deal of reluctance. When they came to the door he believed either Trow or Stansley broke it open, he thought it was Trow, and he himself was on the other side of the way; and that the other two went up stairs, and brought down three bags; and that he took one and Stansley the other; that they both persuaded him to let them be at his house till after breakfast time, and promised they'd fetch them away; that they brought them, but as they came not for them, he threw them down into the cellar.</p>

            , her husband; I had frequently lost money, I did not know how it was lost; in my presence, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060005"></xptr>eleven o'clock on Saturday the 26th of March, my wife marked two half crowns; when she went up stairs she found that her pockets had been moved, and the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. What pieces were they. - A. Two half crowns; I went up stairs to bed, and found they were gone; I saw her mark them and put them in her pocket just before going up to bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You went to bed. On the next day what did you do. - A. In the morning I got Mr. Mason the officer; I told him the circumstance; we went up stairs and knocked at the prisoner's door, she opened the door; I told her that I had lost money from time to time, and I had suspicion that she had taken it. Mr. Mason asked her whether she had any objection to shew what she had got in her pocket; she pulled out some money, a knife, and a key from her pocket; then she hesitated about pulling out any more; Mr. Mason told her he must search her; then she pulled out a purse; Mason took the money from the purse, he took out the two half crowns; I immediately knew them.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the two half crowns. A. Mr. Mason took them in his possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were these half crowns that were taken out of the parse the half crowns that you had so marked and put into the pocket of your wife. - A. Yes, I am sure of it; upon their being found, the prisoner said it was her own money; I desired Mason to search further, I was sure there was more money; he went to search a box, which the niece said was her's; the prosecutor, when she found Mr. Mason was going to open it, said it was her's; in the box was a little red trunk, containing a quantity of silver, and a one pound note in a paper box; in a silk glove was a large quantity of guineas and some notes; there were two of the notes with my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is not pretended that these notes were lost at the same time, the only loss that evening was two half crowns; it is not affected to be said that any thing else was lost at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you miss the notes at that time. A. No, before.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen the half crowns that were found upon the prisoner. - A. Yes, I am certain they were mine, they were loose in my pocket.</p>

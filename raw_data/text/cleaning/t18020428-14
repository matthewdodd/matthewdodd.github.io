             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness; I lost a great many things; the first thing I missed was a card of black lace, about twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of that card of black lace? - A.Six guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you miss any other card of black lace? - A. Yes, I missed a quantity of brown striped sarcenet, I should suppose about twelve yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that? - A. I should suppose about two shillings and six-pence a yard; these are the only things I recollect missing myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss them from? - A. We only missed them by searching; there was a small piece of white lace missing, I understood Miss Jones had taken it up stairs; I enquired of her for it, and she said she could not tell where it was.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. On Thursday, the 8th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue in your house till the 8th of April? - A. Yes, Mr. Sowerby made a mistake; it was April, and not March; she staid in the house till the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss the card of black lace from? - A. I missed it from the lace-box, on the 8th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you looked into that box? - A. I cannot exactly say; I had not an idea that such a thing was gone; it might be more than a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A.No; we found other things which I had not missed.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to imagine it was the prisoner who had taken these things? - A. Being informed that she had taken a bit of white lace up stairs, I asked her for it, and she said she could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she admit that she had taken it up stairs? - A. Yes; she said she meant to card it, and had put it in her bosom, and took it up stairs; the sarcenet was found in a small box of her's; a lady's pelice had been cut off it; I brought it down stairs, and asked Miss Jones if she had taken that up too, and she said, no, she had bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had the care of the sarcenet ever since? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at it, and say if you are sure that is the sarcenet from which the lady's pelice was cut off? - A. Yes; this is the place where it was cut from; here is another piece of sarcenet that I found in her box; I thought I had some like it, and I sent for my own, and found this piece join it exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that piece here? - A. I have;(Produces it.) I had desired Miss Jones to go up stairs with me, and let me see her box; I found a number of pieces of muslin and a variety of triffling articles.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the goods in question? - A. On the 8th of April; the other articles are pledged.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the persons who had the care of those things - who missed them? - A. All the young people.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. Here is one, Miss Wilson; every young person in the house has access to all those articles; when a dress is wanted, they go and take what they want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Miss 
               <persName id="t18020428-14-person113">Jones</persName>
             the loss that you had sustained? - A. Yes, and she said she did not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make that communication? - A. On the 9th; she cried very much, and gave me three duplicates that morning, and said, that was all that she knew about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the duplicates? - A. Eighteen pair of stockings, two table-spoons, and twelve pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of receiving these duplicates, go to the pawnbrokers? - A. No; the pawnbrokers are here.</p>
               <p>Q.Who is Lockwood? - A. Mrs. Lockwood is my mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This young lady came to you in December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She came to improve herself in her own line of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been in the business before? - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer her services for wages, or upon a premium that she was to give you to learn the business? - A. Upon a premium; she was to give me at first twenty pounds, and she was to stay three years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was she to learn? - A. Mil<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280010"></xptr>linery and mantua-making; but, before it was finally settled, I thought it too long, and we agreed that she should pay thirty pounds, and stay one year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was that paid? - A. She said it was not quite convenient for her father to pay it till the last day of February.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have the conduct of your business? - A.Sometimes more, and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q. How many, from the month of December to April, were concerned in the management of your business, under your control? - A. Six.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, if any customer were to come to your shop? - A. It is not a shop; it is a private house.</p>
               <p>Q. If any customer came to you, they might all have the control, and serve your customers? - A. Yes, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you there were fourteen yards, you suppose, of black lace? - A. No, I said I thought about twelve, but I was not quite certain; it is point ground lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, in your line of business, you had a large quantity of black lace? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one card, I suppose? - A. Yes, a great many cards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken stock shortly before? - A.It might be six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.There was nothing particular in your black lace distingushable from other black lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither can you tell us, in the course of six months, how much you might have sold? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When these things were taken, the probability would be, that they might have been taken at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As you cannot ascertain the exact quantity, you cannot, of course, six the value? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Have you measured the card of lace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Can you state, that that card of lace positively had not been sold in your shop during six months? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You can venture to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Miss Jones was crying at the time, and shewed great contrition? - A. At first she denied it; then she gave me three duplicates, and said, that was all; and afterwards she gave Miss Wilson two duplicates.</p>

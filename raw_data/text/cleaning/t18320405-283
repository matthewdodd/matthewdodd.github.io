On the 17th of March I was at Chelsea, at the committee meeting of a benefit society; I had 16s. 6d. in my pocket when I left the public-house - I was perfectly sober; it had just turned eleven o'clock when I left; I thought it too late to return to Harrow - I saw a young woman in the street, who directed me to a lodging in <placeName id="t18320405-283-crimeloc1660">Royal Hospital-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you take 8s. from a strange man? A. Because I had no money, and was obliged to return to Harrow, or lose my place; he called himself the prisoner's brother - it was given not to appear against them the next day; I told him I was obliged to go down to Harrow, and promised not to appear - I am married - the benefit society meet at the Green Dragon; they do not let beds there; I have no doubt the woman who directed me to the lodging was a prostitute; she took me to the room which she said she had to let - she had the key of the room - it is on a straight stair-case, leading to rooms, without any outer door; she lighted a candle, and left me; I did not put the candle out; I considered the first man who came in a respectable man - I was afraid to ask him to help me secure the prisoners; he said he was owner of the room; I said then I had been deceived - I had him taken to the watch-house, thinking as both ran away down stairs, they were both bad; I never said I could not swear to the man who took the money - a woman was present when I took the 8s. - that is her (looking at a woman named Graham): I did not say in her presence that I could not swear to the man - I have been a witness in this Court twenty or thirty times, or I may say fifty; I belonged to Bow-street at that time; I have been here once since I left Bow-street; Mr. Birnie discharged me from Bow-street, because it was my duty to be up all night at the office, and a gentleman came and asked my assistance in recovering his daughter who was going to be taken away - I left the office with him; Sir Richard was angry, and discharged me; the gentleman was a musician in Lord Liverpool's service -I was never prosecuted on any account; I could not tell that the woman I asked for a lodging was a prostitute - she was talking to another girl.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did any familiarities take place between you and her? A. None at all; I did not expect to see her again - Graham gave the man the 8s, which he gave to me; I took it as part of what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Wood. He said he could not swear to me. Witness. I never said so, nor any thing of the kind; I did not say the girl who took the room sent the man up to rob me, nor that I had treated her with brandy-and-water.</p>
               <p>Wood. I had been drinking with that woman all that day, and the prosecutor met her and gave her drink. Witness. The prisoner is not the girl who was with her.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner Jones running away from the prosecutor about one o'clock at night; the prosecutor called out Police, Stop him! this was about fifty or sixty yards from the house - I ran across, and asked the prosecutor what was the matter; in consequence of what he said, I followed the prisoner up a court, and found another man there; he parted from Jones, and jumped over a wall; I laid hold of the other man first - I knew a house Jones frequented; I went there, knocked at the door, and the female prisoner's brother said, "Who is there?" I found Jones in the house, laying down by the door with his clothes on -Wood then flew out, and laid hold of me; she bit my knuckles - Jones then collared me; I sprang my rattle, and had a hard matter to secure him; my hand was bound up for a fortnight - this woman's name is not Graham, but Dockerty; the prosecutor charged the prisoners with this offence, and the man who jumped over the wall, with not assisting him to recover his money; the magistrate discharged him when Jones was committed; he told the prosecutor he would murder him - the prosecutor gave the same account at the watch-house as he has now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Snowsell quite sober? A. He was; the house he was robbed at is not a notorious house; there are some respectable people lodge in it, and about two women of the town; I never knew any body go into that room - there may be twenty rooms in the house; I have not been looking for the woman the prosecutor met in the street; I know her, she is a prostitute, but does not walk the streets - she lives with a man they call her husband, and he is the man I took for ordering the prosecutor out of the room - I found a knife on that man, but no money.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery. Snowsell perjured himself on the trial of Richard Cummins, in 1825.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I am innocent.</p>

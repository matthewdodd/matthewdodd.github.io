            . I am a hackneyman. On the Sunday morning in question, about half-past seven o'clock, the prisoner came and knocked at my stable door; I was not up - I had known him seven or eight years; he had been in respectable situations, at Lady Murray's and other places - he brought this harness to me; he asked 18s. for it- I asked whose it was; he said, it had been given to him by a young man who he had done some work for - I said I did not want it, but he begged me to let him leave it with me till he could get a customer for it, which I did; this is it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a man had given him the harness to dispose of, and that the stable was free of access to every body.</p>

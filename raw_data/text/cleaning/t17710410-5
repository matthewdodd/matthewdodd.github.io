Last Thursday evening, between six and seven o'clock, I had brought up the goods mentioned in the indictment, into my own room; I turned the key of the door. I went down, afterwards, into the cellar. I heard the cry of Stop thief! Mrs. Dunbar's clothes! I came up stairs, and saw them stop the prisoner. I saw the goods in a basket in the passage.</p>

            . I was going over to Mrs. Dunbar's, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I met the prisoner, and another man, with the basket; one had one handle, the other the other handle; the basket had wet linen in it; they were coming out of Mrs. Dunbar's doors. I looked up in the prisoner's face, and said, What do you do with them clothes? He made no answer. I called out, and collared him. The prisoner was just out at the door. I gave a stroke at the basket, and it dropped. The other dragged me two yards: I hollowed out, Stop thief! The other ran away. My husband came down, and asked me where the clothes were. The prisoner ran up the court, and then stripped himself. I am sure he is the man. My husband and Mr. Winder went up the court; the prisoner was coming back again.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177104100006"></xptr> I said, That is the man. They laid hold of him. The court is not a thoroughfare.</p>

            . My wife cried out, Stop thief. I ran up the court. I saw him in his shirt, without a hat; his blue jacket lay upon the ground near the wall, and his hat lay at a door: I took him there: I brought him up the court. Mrs. Bevistock said she was sure he was the man. There was no other man in the court. I had hold of his left arm when Mrs. Bevistock spoke to her husband to take care of him.</p>

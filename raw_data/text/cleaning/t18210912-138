            . I am servant to Sir H. Lushington. I heard an alarm given, and found the prisoner standing in his room. I asked his business, looked round, and found he had collected all this property together, and laid it on the chair. I asked what he was going to do with them he began crying, and said he was a poor fellow out of place, and came to ask us to give him something; I asked which way he came; he said, through the window - I found a bag by the things - he said, it was his; I asked if he was going to carry the things away in it, he made me no answer. I sent for an officer, who took him - the table-cloths are my masters. I have the coat and waistcoat on - a shirt and pair of breeches belonging to me were among them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you swear I got in at the window - A. You said so, my clothes hung behind the door before he came, and the cloths were in a different part of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked the servant if she left the window open - she said, she did. I came in at the door and asked a man if he had any boots to sell; he said come in - the brewer rang the bell, and the woman called out</p>
               <p>"Oh, my G - d, here is a man in the house" - they found nothing in my basket - he took the bag out of the basket.</p>

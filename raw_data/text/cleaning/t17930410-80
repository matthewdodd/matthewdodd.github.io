               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Cox's house? - Mr. Cox lives a good way off in Parker's-lane; the prisoner at the bar is one of the men that was shoving the caravan along; I have known him four or five years, he works sometimes in Drury-lane at Mr. Lucas's and goes with a Jack ass; he does any thing.</p>

               <p>Collings. I saw it again the next morning, it was brought down Parker's-lane close to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watchman there when it was brought? - I don't know; I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Court to White. What did you do with the caravan when they left it? - I left one of the girls to mind the caravan while I went down to the watch-house, and then I went down to Mr. Cox's and called the watchman to help to take it down to Mr. Cox's.</p>

               <p>Burn. I can swear to the caravan; the prisoner was taken up at twelve o'clock the same morning immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was you to him at the time you discovered him drop the caravan? - I was not so far from him as I am now; I have known him these three or four years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming through Brokers-alley, I had been to my aunt, coming through, Mr. White collared me, and said, you and five or six more have been dragging this caravan away; says he, you shall go with me to the watch-house; I never saw or knew any active part of the caravan; I was coming from my friends.</p>

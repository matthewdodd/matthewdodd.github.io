               <p>SUSANNAH RUSH. The prisoner is my sister. She came to our house, to stop, the latter end of November; on the 11th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, having received information that the house was robbed, I went home, and missed the articles stated in the indictment - they are worth between 8l. and 9l. - I had seen them all safe that morning, in my box, except the pelisse, which hung in the bed-room, where the box was - I saw that safe; I did not see the prisoner again till the 14th, when she was at Queen-square Office; she then had one of my gowns on, also my Leghorn bonnet and shawl; my only motive in appearing against her is to keep her out of the streets - she has been that way for six years.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge, at a lodging-house, No. 5, Duck-lane, Westminster. Slyfield sent for me there; she was standing in the passage. I asked what room she occupied; she took me up stairs, showed me her room, and in a drawer there I found a duplicate; the prosecutrix claimed the clothes she had on: after her examination, I was taking her to Tothill-fields, and asked her what had become of a pelisse and Prayer-book - I did not threaten nor promise her any thing; she walked on, and in about five minutes said they were at Mr. Well's, a pawnbroker, at High-street, Kensington, and that the duplicates were all destroyed. I went to the prosecutrix's house, in Leader-street, Chelsea, and took her with me to Well's; they there produced three gowns, a Prayer-book, and one or two more articles.</p>

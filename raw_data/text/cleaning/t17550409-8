            . I am wife to the prosecutor; I hung up these two gowns about twelve o'clock, March 21, in a garret, and Mr. Sergeants came and informed me one was at his house. I went and found them, one pawned, and the other Mr. Sergeant's servant had bought. We got a constable, and took up the prisoner (who they said brought the gowns there) and took her before justice Gore, there she said she bought them in the court in Chick-lane, of a little woman, in a brown gown, about two o'clock that day I lost them. She said she wore one on the Sunday, and pawned the other on the Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Wyatt, a journeyman tailor, and live in Queen's-row, Palmer's Village, Westminster, in the parish of St. Martin's. We rent the house, and have lodgers—he is the housekeeper—the prisoner is a jobbing bricklayer, and was at work at our house on the 16th of February, and had been so about a fortnight—nobody was at work in the house besides him—we have no servant—we had three lodgers at that time—on Shrove-Tuesday, the 16th of February, I left home at eleven o'clock in the morning, and returned at half-past eight o'clock—my hus<lb></lb>band had gone out before me, and got home before me—I left the prisoner in the house—we have three rooms to ourselves, the kitchen, parlour, and second floor front room, which is our bed-room—I locked up the bed-room when I went out, and put the key on the mantel-pieces, in the parlour—I locked the parlour door, and had the key in my pocket—when I came in I found my bed-room door pulled too but unfastened—the prisoner was not there when I came home—all my lodgers were there—I examined my drawers in the bed-room, and missed the property stated in the indictment—they were all our property, and worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the pri<lb></lb>soner did not come to work next day—his work was not finished, nor is it finished now—every thing was safe in my drawers when I went out—I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somerset-place, Palmer's Village. On Tuesday, the 16th of February, I was going towards home, between five and six o'clock, and saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—I was passing by, and he had got a bundle in his right hand, and the tea-caddy under his arm—his hat fell off—I am perfectly certain it was him—it was about fifty yards from Wyatt's house—I picked up his hat, and saw something white in it—I do not know what—I put it on his head. and said."That contains too much to put on your head"—he replied, "I am drunk"—it appeared to be a French polished tea-caddy—I turned my back round and saw him go to the top of Wood's brewhouse, in Buckingham-row.</p>

Last Shrove-Tuesday I was at the top of York-street, at Mr. Glover's public-house, and saw the prisoner—I had seen him two or three times before—I think it was from five to six o'clock, but I cannot exactly say—he came into Glover's with a bundle in one hand and a French caddy in the other—he was with a soldier—he called for something to drink, and laid down a French dollar—he picked it up again and laid down a five-shilling pieces—I asked him if he was not our bricklayer—he said, "Where?"—I said, "Palmer's-villages"—he made no answer, but drank what he called for, and went quickly off—the soldier went out with him—I heard of the robbery next morning—the public-house is about a quarter of a mile from Wyatt's.</p>

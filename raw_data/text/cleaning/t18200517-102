On Saturday, the 13th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, he came in to be paid, I observed his coat looked bulky, took a piece of soap out, and found about a pound between his jacket and waistcoat. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house; he immediately took off his hat, and there was two pounds and a half in it; I then went to his lodgings, and there found two pounds and a half more of the same soap - it had only come in at four o'clock that day. I also found nine pounds of yellow soap. He begged for mercy.</p>

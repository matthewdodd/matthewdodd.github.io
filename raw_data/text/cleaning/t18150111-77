It was as safe from security at the Custom House as it was in the cart, I had an iron hoop put round it by a porter at the Custom-house quay. I afterwards saw the case on board the ship; it had then the hoop round it; the hoop had been raised, and the nails that were originally clinched, were drawn up, and the top of the case had been raised up as if by a crow, and some of the articles had been taken out.</p>

             COOPER. I am porter to John Oliver, a Lighterman. I received this case, at the Custom house quay. The case was so full that it bursted out and started the nails. I sent for Mr. Dubious; I told him I thought proper to put a hoop round it, to make it secure; he told me to do it; the bottom of the case bulged; I sent for a cooper and had it done. I paid two shillings and two pence for doing it; he put an iron hoop round it in my presence; I saw it in the lighter, and afterwards in the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it secure when you saw it in the Lighter - A. It was put on board the Martha lighter, a deck lighter, belonging to Mr.

            . I am foreman to Robert Oliver. I was at the wharf when the package came and I was present when it was put into the Martha lighter, a Deck lighter with lock and keys, Stewart had one key and Fenn the other, every man on board a lighter has a key of the Deck; the two prisoners only has the charge of the Deck; the lighter went away from the Custom house quay between two and three o'clock on Tuesday morning. After they had delivered the goods both of them returned about one o'clock; they came on shore; I asked them whether they had got the receipt for the goods he said the mate would not give him the receipt, because he had not a duplicate. I made out a duplicate on the Wednesday; he went to the ship again; Fenn did; I gave the duplicate to him, he and Stewart returned; I asked him for the receipt, he said the mate refused to give him the receipt, because one of the cases was a little broken.</p>

            . I belong to the ship the Amelia; I was on board on the 27th of December, when the two prisoners came with the Martha lighter.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time did the lighterman reach the ship - A. Some time in the forenoon. I went into the lighter to bear the case off from knocking the sides of the ship; when I come out of the lighter, I went on the Deck; I saw the case in slings; Fenn and 
               <persName id="t18150111-77-person680">Stewart</persName>
             both assisted in unloading, they were both in the hold. I saw them strike the case once or twice with a mallet, or something of that kind; he gave it a harty blow two or three times. I took particular notice it was along the side of the case, the boatswain of my ship asked me what we were doing, the boatswain heard the knocking; the package was afterwards brought, and the whole contents of the lighter was brought on board our ship, and the lighter rowed away. The boatswain observed a hole in this package; I called to the man; I am sure they heard me; they answered me. They did not come back, they asked me what I wanted with them, I said the boatswain wanted to speak with them; they said he should have spoken before.</p>
               <p>DOMINE DEHOURST. I am a boatswain of this vessel. I recollect the case coming on board on the 27th of December; I heard a knocking in the lighter, and this case afterwards was brought up, and as soon as this case was brought up I had it placed on the Deck. I observed a piece broken off the corner. I and Miller hailed the lighter, the men in the lighter did not return on our calling them, I told them to come on board, one of the cases was broken, I shewed the mate the condition of the case, these goods was put on board the ship on Tuesday; on Friday I saw Stewart at the office; Fenn came on board our ship on Thursday: I shewed him the case, he said the case did not come on board our ship in that state. I asked Fenn for a duplicate, when first I took the things in, he said he had got none it always was customary to have a duplicate; and then the mate given a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dehourst. Were you present when this case was opened - A. I was, the carpenter and master opened it. I looked into the case, there were a deficiency in it; there were a vacancy inside, near the place where it had been broken open, the case remained in that situation until Mr. Dubious had seen it; we had fourteen men on board, all the men saw the case had come on board with a crack in it; the case was always kept in the hatches, none of the men could get at it, the hatches were locked.</p>
               <p>MITCHEL, The case was opened in my presence in the ship, and at the police office, a great part of the things were missing.</p>
               <p>Mr. DUBOIUS, I examined the case; when I packed the case it was quite full, so much so that it bulged, and when I saw it at the office, there was a vacancy; all the articles in the indictment were missing, and the articles had been replaced; I had balls of cotton like them in the package.</p>
               <p>Mr. MITCHEL. I took Stewart into custody; I went with him to his house; below, in the front room, on a table, I found this ball of cotton; and up stairs, in this paper, in a bag hanging up, I found these balls of cotton, eighteen balls of cotton, and in another bag, fourteen balls of cotton. Jennings found these pincers; I compared these pincers to a mark on the inside of the case; one end of the pincers is bent, as if used in raising that part; the pincers exactly fitted the hole in the corner of the case.</p>

I went in company with Mr. Waller to the Martha lighter, on Friday the 30th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I waited there until Stewart came; I asked Mr. Waller for the key of the lighter, he gave him the key; I, in the presence of Waller, searched the lighter; I found these three boxes of cotton among some rubbish, covered over with two or three handspikes, tied up in this paper, and a pair of pincers in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110045"></xptr>locker.

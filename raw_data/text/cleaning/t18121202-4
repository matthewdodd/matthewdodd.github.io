               <p>Q. Do you know what was in it - A. I do not. I had the care of it. On the 21st of August, about half after six in the morning, I saw the lock of the stable broken off. It was swinging by one nail.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the stable door before - A. At eleven o'clock on the over night, on the 20th, I locked it myself, and at half past six on the 21st, I came and found it open. I then went up stairs, and found the box broken open. The cord was broken in three places. I took off the cord, and opened the box. I examined my own box, which was not locked. I missed a pair of patent cord new small-clothes, a pair of leather breeches, and two jackets.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen these - A. Upon the afternoon before. I had one of the jackets on, the day before. I had put them into the box on the 19th.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the bundles did you - A. No. I there obtained some information. I did not find him at the Blossoms inn. I searched for him from place to place, at last I found him in Bristol. I got a warrant, and went for him myself. The prisoner was then in prison. I told him I was happy to see him there. He asked me for what reason. I told him, because he was secure. I brought him up to London by the mail. He asked me, what it was about. I told him, for robbing the stable. He said, he was not the man. I told him that we thought that we had satisfactory proof of it. He then made no answer. I brought him to town, and took him to Marlborough-street office. When I got him to town, being early in the morning, we went into the Marlborough Head, to have a pint of beer. He asked me, if it would be any satisfaction to me to hang him, or transport him. I said, it would be no satisfaction to me. He then said, that the only thing he could do to make me a recompence was to enlist in any regiment. I then asked him where my things were. He said, if he informed me where they were he could see my intention was to throw him into prison. If I would permit him to enlist he would make every thing comfortable. He then wanted me to take his handcuff off. At that moment the officer came in. I told him to take him away, and lock him up, and he was committed for this. I found part of my things at Mr. Turner, pawnbroker, John-street, Golden-square. I found one bundle pledged in the name of Bennett; a pair of leather breeches, and two jackets my own; and I also found another bundle, the property of

On Sunday, I went to the Blossoms inn with the prisoner. He had nothing with him. When he went there he called for some parcels that he had left, and he paid his fare with a Bristol note. They were two bundles wrapped up in handkerchiefs. He carried one bundle, and I the other, as far as St. James's-square. I then gave him his bundle. I went to my lodging, and I saw no more of him.

            , esq. On the 22d of August, I saw the prisoner at my lodgings about half past nine o'clock at night. He took this frock out of the bundle, and offered it to me for sale. I had seen him before. I believe he was a servant out of place. He offered me this frock. He said, as I was a new married man, it might be useful to me. I did not purchase it of him. I told him I should leave that for my wife to do. This is the frock. I know the frock by the lace. When he offered it me for sale I took it in my hand, and looked at it, and when I saw it at Marlborough-street I had no doubt of it being the same frock he offered me. I am sure it is the same frock.</p>
               <p>Friend Lawrence. The person that brought that frock brought the other things, and he pledged them all together.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Pilben. The frock is mine. The petticoats and the shifts are all mine. I made them, and marked them, and these things were in the box, that I entrusted in West's care, and a great many more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Brighton with intention of getting a situation. I lived with captain Fraser, at Gibralte. At the time I was in Brighton, looking out for a situation, I met with a friend. He took me to the prosecutor's stable. The prosecutor accuses me of taking the things out of the stable. I never went up stairs, nor was I there unless some person was with me. On the night of the robbery. I was in the prosecutor, West's, company, until eleven o'clock, and then I went to bed, and then I came from Brighton to London, and then I understood there was a letter for me at Mr. Todd's. I called on Mr. Bennet. He went with me for the letter. I took a Bristol note out of the letter, and went and paid my fare, and received my bundles. I went down to Bristol, and got a situation on board a ship. One day I came on shore, two officers took me; they said, for a forgery. The prosecutor wanted me to go into the artillery. I am totally innocent.</p>

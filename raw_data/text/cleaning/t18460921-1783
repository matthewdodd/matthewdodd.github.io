                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>.) On Friday afternoon, the 28th of Aug., a little after three o'clock, I was in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner with a little boy, the witness Watson's son, coming in a direction from St. John's-street, with an eight-day clock under his arm—I saw him go up to the witness Watson in the market—they went away together some distance, and then separated—I went after the prisoner White—the constable went after Watson—I stopped the prisoner, and asked whose clock it was—he said his own—I asked where he got it—he said he won it at a raffle about twelve months ago—he did not know the name of the person he won it from, nor the name of the street—while talking, Watson was brought up, and the prisoner said Watson would own it—Watson said it was his clock—we took them both to the station—Watson had taken the pendulum from the prisoner's hand when he joined him in the market—I took them both from the manner in which they acted.</p>

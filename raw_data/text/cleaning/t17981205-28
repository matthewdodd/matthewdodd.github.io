             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Parker, in Fleet-street. (Produces two shirts, six pair of hose, and ten handkerchiefs.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who pawned these things? - A. A man, in the name of Thomas Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner at the bar the man? - A. I cannot recollect the man; the woman prisoner brought the parcel first, and I asked her if they were her's; she said, she would fetch the person they belonged to; she went and fetched a man in, I cannot say whether that is the man or not; I asked him if the property was his, and he said, they belonged to a brother-in-law of his that was deceased; there were opened in her presence; there was one handkerchief marked with a name at length.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if she had that in her hand? - A. Not in my presence, she had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tyrrell. This is a handkerchief that is marked at full length; I believe they are all mine.</p>

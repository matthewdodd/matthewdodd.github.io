               <p>THOMAS-WILLIAM DAWSON sworn. - I am shopman to Messrs. Dawson and Bryants, Cheapside; I was crossing the way to Lombard-street, on the 1st of February, I heard the lady say, this man has got my purse, I immediately looked round, and saw the prisoner with the purse in his hand, I took him by the collar; in giving the purse to Mrs. Jones, a guinea rolled out of it, and it ran on the ground before him, as he was going away, the prisoner took it up.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know any thing of a half-guinea? - A. I did not see a half-guinea; I took him again, and told him he had got the guinea, he denied it positively; I still kept hold of him with a great deal to do, he gave me the guinea out of his mouth, I returned it and the purse to Mrs. Jones.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jones. The half-guinea, I suppose, was dropped, I never found it, I am sure it was in my purse at nine o'clock, I had not used my purse afterwards.</p>

            . I live in Round-court, and close toothbrushes. I received nine dozen tooth-brushes, to complete, about a week before Christmas, for a person at Mr. Jaters'; next day the prisoner came to enquire if I had got them - and told me to get them done by Sunday, and he would call, and pay me; I finished seven dozen by Sunday. The prisoner called, paid for them, and took them away with him. Before I finished the rest he brought me more - he found the hair and handles. On the 3d of February I gave Goodluck six dozen, which the prisoner brought to me.</p>

About seven weeks ago the prisoner came to me and asked me to draw some tooth-brushes for a person named Hill, who lived in Castle-street; I told him I could not draw; he left about nine dozen - Smith fetched them away; he afterwards asked me to finish some for Mr. Hill. On the 30th of January, Smith brought me some, which I cave to Goodluck.</p>

            . I sell tooth-brushes, and live in Lockhart's-court, Saffron-hill. On the 26th of December the prisoner brought me about a gross and a half of toothbrushes. He said he lived in Fletcher's-row, Islington. I was to sell them to the shops, and gave him 3 s. 6 d. a dozen, and was to get what I could for myself - I paid him about 1 l. The prosecutor came to me, and I gave him half a gross, which were left - the prisoner said he made them himself.</p>

            . The Prisoner nursed me in my lying-in, and robbed me of every thing that I had, but the shift on my back. I have lain in but fifteen days to day, and was hardly able to come out; and I had not a farthing left for me nor my babe. She gave the child some stuff to sleep, and she did sleep two days, and never waked; she gave me something to sleep, and I slept all that afternoon, and the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake?</p>
               <p>Harris. About half an hour after two on the sixth of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the nurse then?</p>
               <p>Harris. She was gone. I sent for my brother, and she was taken up the day before yesterday.</p>

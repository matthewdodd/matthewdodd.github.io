            'S Defence. On Saturday evening, about eleven o'clock. I rode to Hampstead, which I always do at night to clear the turnpikes. When I got to Pickersteed Mill I stopped till Monday evening at ten o'clock, and then set off to Round Head. I wrapped myself in a sack, and did not see a soul till I got to Kingsland; then four or five men passed me, called me, and said they had something for me to take to town. I asked what it was? they did not exactly give me an answer, but said it was very heavy. I said I would have 10 s., and they said we should not fall out about that. When I got to Golder's-green my horse was very tired, and I hired one of a poor man at North End.</p>

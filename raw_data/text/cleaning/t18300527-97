On the 18th of May I hired a coach, and told the coachman to go to Torrington-square, where my young mistress was; this property belonged to my master, and was in a bundle, which I put into the coach, and got on the box; the prisoner was standing by the coach, talking to the coachman, when I hired it in Tottenham-court-road - the robbery took place in <placeName id="t18300527-97-crimeloc527">Gower-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you tell the Magistrate the prisoner was not the person who took the bundle? A. No - the doors of the coach were shut; I do not know how any one could have got the bundle- I did not hear the doors opened; the coach was driving slowly on - I do not know that there was any hole in the coach; the prisoner did not say he picked it up - I do not think it impossible that it could be got out; I was on the box with the coachman - the coach did not stop; this is the bundle.</p>

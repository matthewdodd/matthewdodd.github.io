I at one time possessed a share in the Wheal Mary Anne Mine—I had it from the prisoner—I had disposed of that share I think two years before last Dec.—I am acquainted with the character of the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—this letter, dated 10th Dec., purporting to come from a Mr. Boaxe, is not my writing; I believe it is the prisoner's writing; I did not authorize him to write it in my name—it is offering the share for sale—this second letter agreeing to accept the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the same writing; it is not mine—I did not authorize the prisoner to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a share—I was not at that time the owner of a share—this transfer bears the signature of William Davey Boaxe—it is not my writing—I did not authorize the pri<lb></lb>soner or any one to sign it—it is an imitation of my writing—I cannot say whose it is—the body of this assignment is like the prisoner's writing—I believe this other letter, and this receipt to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

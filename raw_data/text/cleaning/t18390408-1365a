                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Walker, of Chandos-street, Ca<lb></lb>vendish-square. On Saturday morning, the 6th of April, the prisoner Lewis came to sweep the kitchen chimney—I had two sovereigns, four half-crowns, and ten shillings, in a drawer in the kitchen, which was not locked—I had seen it safe on Friday afternoon—I left Lewis in the kitchen alone, for about two or three minutes at the outside—I missed all my money about eight o'clock that evening—next morning I got a policeman, and went to Chadwick, the prisoners' master—I saw Lewis there, and asked if he had opened any drawer to look for a fork, as the forks were kept in the next drawer to my money—he said he had not—I said I had lost some money, and suspected he had taken it—he said he had not—his master asked him to let him look in his pocket—he said, "I have got some money, but I found it"—his master said, "Where?"—he said, "Twisted up in a piece of paper by the Cross Keys mews"—he produced one sovereign, two half-crowns, and five shillings, being exactly half the money I had lost—I gave him in charge—Chadwick asked him how much money he found—he said he did not know, but that was all he had—Chadwick asked if he had told any body about it—he said he had told Greenham about it, and he (Greenham) was to have half of it that day.</p>

I saw them come in, there was nobody in the shop, I was in the passage. Elizabeth Green asked me if I had got a shift; I shewed, her a shift, that would not do; she then asked me if I had got any stays; I shewed her some, they would not do; then she asked me if I had got a piece of keyseymere, to mend small clothes, I fetched her some that would not do; I looked round and missed some waistcoats out of the window. I told them I had got nothing that would suit them; they went out, they moved very slowly, I pursued one of them; I saw Elizabeth Green drop a waistcoat from between her clothes. I took them both back into the shop, they dropped three more. I cannot say which of them dropped the other three. These are the waistcoats, they are my property; they cost me six shillings and sixpence by the marks. I sent for an officer and had them taken into custody. I never left the shop, I sent for the things as they called for them; I had an eye upon the window, I saw the waistcoats moved out of the window. There was a time when the prisoners were in the shop that I had not my eye upon them.</p>

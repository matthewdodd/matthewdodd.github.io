               <p>Q. Were these sacks empty or full - A. They appeared to be full, or partly full; but I did not observe particularly; they were brought by a man that appeared like a corn chandler, or a farmer.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him put the sacks into this cart - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you observed him for any time - A. I did not; I was in a chaise cart, waiting for a friend of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. You were conversing together at that time - A. I was not conversing with him when I first saw this man; he was in the market purchasing the hay.</p>
               <p>Q. You were waiting his return in the market - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you call upon him - A. He came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must be close to the cart - A. No; I was not close to the cart, I was at the head of the cart, the men were not at the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, if your cart was two or three yards off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140067"></xptr>your cart must be near to them. Now this was not in Goswell street - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Now if there should be any difference between you and them where they took in those sacks of corn, I suppose they are the most likely to remember than what you are - A. I should suppose so;</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of looking into the corn in your master's loft in the morning - did you know the stars of the corn when you left the yard - A. Yes, I saw it in the course of the day; when I returned I discovered the corn which was in a bin in the loft diminished six or seven bushels; I missed that quantity, and a sack of my master's was missing; the sack was in the loft and laid by the corn; I informed Mr. Bishop, our foreman; he sent for Mr. Griffiths, the officer; when Mr. Griffiths came he proceeded to search the cart, there was one sack with corn in it found upon the top of the cart, concealed under the dung; - they shot the cart up and two more sacks fell out containing oats; one of the sacks belonged to my master; the three sacks contained about seven bushel three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tollson or Lebeck say anything to whom it belonged to - A. They said if they had any corn it belonged to them.</p>

            . Q. On the 14th of June last, was you servant to Mr. Brede - A. Yes; he is a cooper, he lives in Church lane, Whitechapel. To go into Mr. Severn's yard they must come into our yard. On the 14th of May, between three and four o'clock, I saw Tollson and Lebeck in Mr. Severn's yard; I saw Tollson come out of Mr. Severn's stable, with one sack of oats on his shoulder (I saw the sack examined afterwards at the office), he carried it to Lebeck; Lebeck was placing the dung on the cart; at the same time Tollson lifted it up as high as ever he could, and Lebeck pulled it up on the cart and laid it on the copse of the cart till such time as he had made a hole in the dung, and then he put the bag in the dung.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did the sack appear to you to be full at the time he raised it up - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you saw this - A. My young master called me, he was looking through a hole that was in the palings, I looked with him; right opposite that hole is the stable door; we could see them and they could not see us.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether or not, they brought any thing in a sack in the yard - A. I am certain they did not; they had nothing but empty sacks and a bit of bay tied up with a hayband.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when they came in with the cart - A. I suppose it was a little after three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>COURT. If there had been any full sacks in the cart, must you not have seen them - A. Yes.</p>

            . I saw him on the 14th of May going up the steps of Giltspur street compter about twelve o'clock; about ten minutes after twelve I was talking with Mr. Fisher, a sheriff's officer, No. 8, Old Bailey; he came there after he had done with Mr. Fisher; I saw him cross the way and go to the Rose. In about two minutes after that I followed him into the Rose in the Old Bailey. About one o'clock I saw him again in the Old Bailey, near Fleet lane. I saw him again about half an hour after that in the Old Bailey, and I spoke to him; that was about half after one o'clock; I saw him again at the Fortune of War, the corner of Cock lane, a little before three o'clock; I was in company with him from that time till half past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it was Saturday the 14th of May that you saw the defendant. - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How long have you been an auctioneer - A. Eight years; and I carry on the business of a broker and dealer in coals at Hosier lane; my wife carries it on; I generally go to see the coals measured out, and I sell a great many more than she sells; I have sold two hundred and ninety five chaldrons of coals since the 1st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a great many sales since January last - A. No, only one; I sold a vessel at Portsmouth, that was before January; I have valued two or three persons in public houses; I have not had a sale since then. Before January I had one sale, the John and Elizabeth, but I gave it to another man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner before June - A. Perhaps six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you subpoenaed on the trial of Tollson and Lebeck - A. No, I was not; I did not attend before the grand jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You were upon good terms with the defendant - A. I never changed a shilling with him; I was neither upon good terms or bad terms with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in short, you were upon good terms - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it happened that he arrested a friend of yours of the name of Williams - A. He was no friend of mine; he was a man I knew; that was on Friday the 13th.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you sworn that it was the 14th - A. He was arrested in the city of London on the 14th, and on the 13th; I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you swear that you saw him at the Rose in the Old Bailey; is not that the fact; attend sir; because you know Williams was arrested on that day, that is the reason you know it was the 14th.</p>
               <p>COURT. Give a plain answer to a question - is that your reason for your knowing that Maybrick had arrested Williams on the 14th - A. I saw Maybrick on the 14th, and that is my reason for fixing upon that day, because Mr. Williams was arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told me that you were always upon good terms with the man; I ask you whether you did not say, because he had arrested Mr. Williams on that day, that you would put him in the pillory one day or other - A. So help me God, I never said that in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps you have never been in prison - A. I never was in Newgate a prisoner; I never went there to see the prisoner Maybrick.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in Newgate - A. Certainly, I have, but never a prisoner there; I have not been there for these twelve months, then I only went to see a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been to the prisoner and proposed to him that if he would forego his claim in the action of Williams, you would not appear on this prosecution - A. Never, for Mr. Williams is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been indicted for perjury - A. Yes, and they never met me; it is five years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you indicted here - A. Yes, but it was removed by a certiorari; Mr. Morley was the attorney for the prosecution; it was not-moved by my desire; Mr. Const had a brief of mine. I wish they would try the cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you ever said in Nightingale's presence, that you would put this man in the pillory - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the 14th or the 13th, that you saw the prisoner at the Rose - A. On the 14th.</p>

I would have no dealings with him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020064"></xptr>these two women were standing by me, they spoke to him; they offered him 5 s. one of them offered him 5 s. 6 d.

               <p>How did the women know who you were? - They knew me dealing in the lane; I cannot say how they could send to me; they sent down to the public-house as nigh as I can guess, where I use; the people of the house know my name; they sent a bit of a note.</p>

               <p>You are sure that window was shut when you went out? - I am quite positive of that, and the hats were on the window-seat.</p>

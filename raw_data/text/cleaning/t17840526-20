               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an attempt to commit a robbery without an actual taking from the person, the party attacked; the law having said the intention was not a crime for which a man could be indicted, by the act of the 7th of his late Majesty it is changed, and if any person should with any offensive weapon assault, or should by any menaces or in a violent manner demand any money, goods &amp;c. he shall be transported for seven years, the question is whether this case does not fall within the express provision in this act of parliament.</p>

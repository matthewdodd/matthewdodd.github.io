On the 2nd of August my attention was called to the prisoner - he was in the street, with my sugar-tongs in his hand, and was showing them to another person - I had not seen him in my house, but he might have been there - the tongs were taken from my bar - when he saw me he ran away - I had heard the other one say, "Did you get any thing?" - the prisoner then put his hand in his pocket, pulled out the tongs, showed them to him, and said, "It is all right, come along" - they then ran off - I pursued and took the prisoner - he had no tongs then, but they were found - these are them.</p>

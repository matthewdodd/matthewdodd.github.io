               <p>How do you know it is Yostus's house? - Because some of my men lodge there; Yostus came out with them, and the carmen walked in the middle of the road, and Yostus on the pavement, up as far as Bond-street, and then they joined in company together; when they came out of the house, the two men went back to the waggon, and put both the empty sacks into the waggon, where they took them from; they were both taken from the first waggon; I took my horse, went to Mr. Wylde in Thames-street, and informed him, and went back to Tyburn-turnpike to Mr. Kinloth's, and I saw the men there, and the coals all shot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel, to Mr. Wylde These coals you have been speaking of were loaded over night? - They were.</p>

               <p>Did you order coals to be brought to you on the 7th of April? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any coals on that day? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any brought into your house? - I cannot positively say; I saw nothing, I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me put you in mind of your situation: a man lodges with you, and stands charged here with receiving stolen goods, and these goods, evidently the property of Mr. Wylde; remember you stand here in a very intricate situation yourself? - I heard somebody go down stairs, I was ill in bed, in the morning early, I cannot positively say what time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have a good many lodgers in your house? - I have, about eleven.</p>
               <p>They have not all separate places for their coals? - They generally keep them in their own rooms; there is a vault in the cellar for the first floor, and one for the second floor.</p>
               <p>Court to Levi. When was you first informed of this? - Not till Mr. Sharpe informed me.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the coals? - I did not see the coals at all.</p>
               <p>When you heard of this, had not you the curiosity to go and look if any coals had been brought in or no? - I did not, I did not like to bring myself into trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you went the only way to bring yourself into trouble; is this man a lodger at your house? - He is, and finds his own goods.</p>
               <p>What part of the house does he lodge in? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court to Sharp. Have you seen whether there had been any coals fresh put down into that cellar? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock the same day, when the two Mr. Wyldes came up to my house, we went down to the cellar, and there was the appearance of two sacks of coals fresh shot.</p>
               <p>Did you see the landlord of the house? - I did, I told him particularly of it; but I believe he did not go down to see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How do you know it was Yostus's apartments where the coals were seen? - His wife told me they were his coals.</p>
               <p>Now if they had been carried into that house, and you had been shewn a quantity of coals, without this information, should you have known there were two sacks? - I should, I am very well used to them.</p>

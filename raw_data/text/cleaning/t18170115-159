             came to my house and took a second floor, she was to pay 3s. per week, she said they were for herself and sister, who was coming from Norwich. Rudd came to the house, she said he was her brother-in-law; I supposed him and Murrell to be man and wife. They all came to the lodgings on the 30th of December, in the evening, I objected to taking three of them, King was to go away and Murrell and Rudd to live there, and King was to come in the day-time to assist her sister, they left on the 14th, at seven o'clock in the evening. King passed my door with a bundle, I followed her, and said, I suspected it was some of my property; she said, it was nothing but her own dirty linen; she said she had not robbed me, and objected to go back to my house; while I was talking to her, Rudd and Murrell passed us; she said, she wanted to go to speak to them, and I said, I would go with her; she took me to the back of the house, just by St. Agnes-le-Clare; she then got out of my hands, and dropped the bundle and a small basket, which Murrell had given her, and ran away; I picked them up, but could not overtake her. I found the bundle contained two feather pillows, which were mine; I went into their room and found the bed stripped, and the things stated in the indictment gone; I have seen all of them since, except the looking glass.</p>

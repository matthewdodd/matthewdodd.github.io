I said, I'll take you to another shop. I considered he was very young, and I was sorry to take him before the Justice: I told him, if he would tell me what other things he had taken, I would let him go about his business; he declared this was the first thing he ever did, and wish'd he might die if he did any other thing. I took him before Justice Welch, and told the Justice I thought he had robb'd me of something else. I told the Justice, as he was young, I intended to take him home, and give him a little dressing, and let him go. The Justice seemed agreeable: I took him home, and did so, and sent him about his business: the next morning I got up and look'd over the shelves, and miss'd two pair of leather breeches, and a pair of cloth breeches: I went to Justice Welch, and told him my suspicions of the mother: he granted me a warrant to take up the boy. Before I took him before the Justice, I ask'd him if he would tell me what he had done with my leather breeches; he would not acknowledge any thing. I took him before the Justice; there he would not own to any thing. After he was committed, the runner ask'd me to give him something to drink. While we were drinking, he began to talk to the boy: he told him he would take his hand-cuffs off, and he should be indulged in the prison all in his power, if he would tell the truth: at last he said he would tell him when he came to prison. No, said the runner, you had better tell me now; then he told me he had stolen two pair of leather breeches, and they were pawned in Oxford road for 9 s. He and the runner went for them, and brought them. I described them before they were opened, and I swore to them before Justice Welch. (Produced in court.)</p>

Under the pressure of my unfortunate situation, I do here, before you, and in the eyes of God, solemnly assort, I knew not of my first wife being alive, but had every reason to think her dead; I was well informed of the late Act, that made the crime I now stand unfortunately charged with, felony, when I married my second wife; and, if I assure you that she had nothing to bring me in marriage, I hope your Lordship will exculpate me from any finister views; all I have to hope is, from the mercy of your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, who, I trust, will discriminate the intention of my action.</p>

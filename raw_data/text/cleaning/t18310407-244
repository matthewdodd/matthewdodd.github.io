             COX. I am a Police-officer. On the night of the 4th of April I was in St. John-street - I saw the prisoner and another come out of the <placeName id="t18310407-244-crimeloc1308">Pewter Platter-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He took you to the yard where he said he found the harness? A. Yes, but I had seen him come out there - this was about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Samuel Ewins, a bookbinder, who lives in Duke-street, Smithfield - he has a coach-house in Pewter Platter-yard. On the afternoon of the 4th of April I fastened the door of the coach-house, leaving this harness inside it - I found the door broken open, and the padlock broken; this is his harness.</p>

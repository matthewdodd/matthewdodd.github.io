I came home about ten o'clock, and went up-stairs at about a quarter to eleven—the first-floor bed-room door was then shut—I went to my room which is the same as my mother's, and remained there a few minutes, putting away my bonnet and shawl—the drawers were all safe then, and the alarum also—it rang very loudly when I went into the room—when I left the room I shut the door, I did not lock it, sod came down to the bar—I locked the staircase door—from about twelve I assisted in the bar—the prisoner White was not then there—about twenty-five minutes to one, the barmaid left the bar, and went down the passage to the yard to the kitchen to get her candle to go to bed—I saw her come back again—she unlocked the staircase door and went up—im<lb></lb>mediately after, she came running down again, opened the staircase door, stood there, and beckoned me across the bar, and while I was talking to her, White passed me, coming from the passage door leading to the yard—he shook his head in my face, and said, "Oh! Miss Foxall what is the matter?"—I said, "Mind your own business, do not bother me"—he had a dark coat on which came up to his face, and his arm and side were white—he went out immediately—there were several persons in the bar—I went up-stairs, found the first-floor room door and window open, my mother's room open, and) the drawers lying about the floor in confusion, and the alarum bell-wire put—when I went up, and came down before, the lower-room door was shut—from the time I came down till the barmaid went up, no one had the key of the staircase—on the following Saturday, in consequence of what the barmaid told roe, I went into the bar—I did not then see White there, but I ran out and saw him, and took him by the arm at the corner of Little Queen-street, and said to a policeman, "Policeman, take this man into custody"—the prisoner said, "What for?"—I said, "For robbing our house of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Thursday night"—he said, "Miss Foxall, I have not been into your house these three days"—I said, "Not been into our house these three days; did you not ask me what was the matter? and did not you leave a letter at our a house?"—he then came. back to the house, and then said, "Miss Foxall you must be mistaken"—I said, "Policeman, I am quite sure as to his being the person; take him into custody"—a man named Haskins has lodged in our house, sometimes in the lower room, and sometimes in the upper, and White has very often come after his brother, and when we asked him who was his brother, he said, "I mean Haskins."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Model Lodging-house, 27, King-street, St. Giles's—I am a school-assistant, out of employ—White lived there also, and occupied the next bed to me. I remember the Thursday evening previous to his being taken on the Saturday—I was in the kitchen; and about ten o'clock White complained of the closeness of the place, and I walked down Holborn with him—on the way, he met a gentleman; stopped and spoke to him a few minutes, and we returned to the lodging-house about half-past ten—about eleven, he borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a man named Bumbury, clerk to a barrister in the Temple, and went out to get some<lb></lb>thing for supper, he returned in about ten minutes with some bacon and potatoes, and we had supper together, and I went to bed about a quarter to twelve—the prisoner came a few minutes after—I am able to say that from the time of his bringing in the supper and going to bed he did not go out—I saw him go to bed—three others slept in the same room, in separate beds—White laid awake talking to me and Hall till nearly two, when I went to sleep, and I believe the prisoner also—I awoke about nine or ten next morning, and found him in bed—he and I were in very dis<lb></lb>tressed circumstances—I know Haskins, he is an organist—he has a brother—I have seen Roberts at the Sun and Punch Bowl, but do not know him in any other way—in the morning, a fellow-lodger came to White and took his coat away to pawn it—the person who pawned it brought back something to eat, of which I partook—I did not have any of the money.</p>

Bolton-house, Turnham-green—I have not been in regular employment since—I have been employed by Mr. Haskins—I do not know that he lived at the prosecutrix's—I have heard that he slept there occasionally—he lives at Mr. Green's, 89, Leather-lane, tallow-chandler, who is also an auctioneer, and has an office opposite the Mansion-house—Haskins is organist at a chapel in the Hackney-road, of which I do not know the name; he is also a teacher of music—I have written notices of a musical book for him, which were stitched as advertisements in the reviews and country newspapers—to the best of my knowledge Has<lb></lb>kins still lives at Green's—I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for writing the notices, which I was paid at Mr. Green's office—I had received sundry small sums from him in the last two months—I have not received all he owes me yet—he is to give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all I have earned in the last two months—I may have received about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it before the robbery, and sundry small sums—I have always said that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what he was to give me—I will not swear</p>

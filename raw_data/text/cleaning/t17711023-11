               <p>Prosecutor. These are mine, here is my mark upon them, in my own hand writing. I took him to Sir John's, he said it was the first offence he had done, and hoped he should be forgiven; he said he had a wife, at down-lying; he said, on the Wednesday following, he was roving about almost mad for want of money, that his head fell through the window, and the handkerchiefs fell out, and he picked them up; there were five other handkerchiefs I find pick'd up, which a man put in his pocket, and they have never been heard of since. I advertised them, but have not been able to recover them.</p>

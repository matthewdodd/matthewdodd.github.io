                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Rushworth, a milk<lb></lb>man, who lives in Upper Charlton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 14th of April, I was in the parlour at the back of our shop—I heard a noise, like the sound of my till being taken—I looked through the window, and saw a boy, with the till in his arms, and he went down the street—I went out as fast as I could, and cried, "Stop thief"—he dropped the till, and I took it up, and brought it in—there were three shillings in it, some sixpences, and some pence and halfpence—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper altogether—the prisoner was brought back by John Turnbull—I had not seen the boy so as to know who he was, when he went out of the shop.</p>

I was at the door of a house, No. 14, Charlton-street, on the op<lb></lb>posite side to the prosecutor's—I heard Rushworth crying, "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running, with a till in his hand—as he came to where I was, he dropped the till—I pursued, and took him—he did not run above six or eight doors—I am quite certain it was the prisoner dropped the till.</p>

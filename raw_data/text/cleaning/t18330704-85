            . I am a watchman of Farringdon-within, and live at No. 6, Holiday-yard, Creed-lane. On the night of July 4, at half-past ten o'clock, I was in Butcher-hall-lane and heard the cry of, Stop thief; the prisoner ran by me down the lane, in a direction from Newgate-street; I immediately ran after him - I stopped him as there was no thoroughfare where he ran - I took him to the watch-house, and he handed this watch into our inspector's hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I attempt to rescue myself? A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say at the Police-office, that you saw the watch in my hand? A. No; the first time I saw it was at the watch-house, I believe, but I was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040072"></xptr>confused; there was nobody but him near me - I did not state before the Magistrate, that I saw the watch in your hand; not that I recollect.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Butcher-hall-lane, and am inspector of the watch. On the night of the 4th of June, I heard the cry of Stop thief and saw the prisoner running towards Christ-church-passage, which is no thoroughfare; I helped to stop him, and the prosecutor said, he had been robbed of his watch - I laid hold of one hand and the watchman of the other; he wanted to get his hand at liberty, and at the watch-house I let go of his hand, he put it into his trousers pocket, and took out the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long elapsed from the time of your taking me till you got me to the watch-house? A. Not two minutes - I did not see the watch till I got to the watch-house.</p>

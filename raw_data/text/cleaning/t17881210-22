On the 7th of November, we all left the shop together, about half past eight; I saw no more of the prisoner; I came the next morning about twenty minutes after seven, and not seeing the prisoner, I enquired of the apprentice; he said he was not come; I was impatient, and about nine, I received a letter from a man from the New Prison; I went with him to the New Prison; I found the prisoner there, and I said, Abraham how come you here; he said, I was catched by the runners last night, with some nails in a bag; I immediately said to him, not your master's nails I hope; the prisoner made answer, yes: I said Abraham I never thought this of you; which way and when did you get them out of the shop; he said a paper now, and a paper then, at a time, in his pockets: while we were talking, a person came down, who said he was an attorney, and said by G - d this is a critical matter, you must stand this man's friend, or he'll be hanged: I said I could not conceal the felony, and I would have nothing to do with it till Mr. Sparrow came to town; on the Saturday following, I was sent for to Mr. Wilmot's, and I went there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, prisoner's council. You always thought this man to be honest. In which way are these nails put in the shop? - They are put in partitions in different quantities: it is impossible we could miss them.</p>

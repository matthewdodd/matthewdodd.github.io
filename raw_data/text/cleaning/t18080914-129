               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner, before - A. I never saw either of them before I saw them in that house; there were some indifferent women in my company; the prisoner Brown came and abused me; I called for some liquor for the women; what it was for I do not know; I paid for it, they wanted me to go with them home; I told them I would. Brown told me he wanted to speak with me in particular; I went out with them; they got me into the Seven Stars; the landlord of that house is a German; I sat down there and treated the prisoners; the liquor overcame me. I laid my elbow on the table and clapped my hand to my head, and fell asleep; when I awoke I asked the landlord if I owed any thing in the house, he said no; I put my hand in my pocket, I could not find a farthing. I had the pocket book in my pocket; but the note and money were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was gone out of it - A. A five pound note, half a guinea, a seven shilling piece, a shilling, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>- THOMPSON. I am a caulker. The first time I saw Mr. Glynn was at the Black Horse; he and Brown were together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Brown - A. I had seen him the day before. We had something to drink there; then the prisoner, prosecutor, and me, went to the Bee Hive, there we had half a pint of gin between us; we went from there to the Seven Stars, we had there a pot of ale and some gin; the prosecutor was pretty drunk; it was between five and six o'clock when we were in the Seven Stars; this Brown set of one side of the prosecutor, and the girl at the bar sat on the other side of him; she got up and took a seven shilling piece and a shilling out of his pocket, and he pulled his watch out; I got up and told the landlord of it; I went out backwards, and when I came in again Glynn was gone out of the house; directly I went to the Black Horse after him, and told him he was robbed; he was drunk and did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober - A. I was disguised in liquor, but fresher than he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present and saw this watch and money taken from him publicly - A. Yes; there were eight or nine girls in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of it been found - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the watch after he took it out of his pocket - A. I do not know, I am sure, I saw him take it.</p>

            . I am a sea faring man, just come from the East Indies. Last Tuesday night, I had been up to the India house for my wages, I went over London Bridge; when I was going by the platform, Rotherhithe, I met Brown: he asked me whether my name was not Charles Seale, he said shall not we go and have something to drink; we went into the public house and had a pot of beer and half a pint of gin; when we had drank the liquor, he said he had no money to pay for it, but he said he had a good watch; he said will you buy the watch; I said yes, go home with me to my house; he said he wanted three guineas for it; I said what is the number; he said I should not look at the number of the watch; the watch had a black string and seal to it.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the next day, on the Wednesday; on searching him I found a bank of England note, two seven shilling pieces, five shillings and sixpence in silver, and a few halfpence. I asked him how he became possessed of this bank note, he told me he took it for a run down voyage to Gravesend. On my looking at the note I found it was not issued from the bank at the time he stated. The next day he said that he had taken the note from his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Rotherhithe Wall from Nightingale lane - A. It is the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched him, did you find any watch about him - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What was the maker's name of your watch - A. Tobias.</p>
               <p>Smith. Before I apprehended the prisoner I called upon Mr. Tobias, I asked him if he had sold this man a watch; he said yes, he had given five guineas and a half for it.</p>

All I can say in regard of this gentleman, I was in company with him, I was drunk along with him all the morning; there were a great many women of the town along with us, and this young woman was along with the rest. Robert Thompson was with us; we got groggy, and we parted; I know nothing of the charge.</p>

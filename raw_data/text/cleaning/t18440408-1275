                  </hi>. I am the Wife of David Andrew Barnard, a copper<lb></lb>plate printer. On the 2nd of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking on Finsbury-pavement, and a female felt my pocket—I turned, and saw her—I walked slowly on purpose for her to pass me, but she did not—I went on till I came to a picture shop—I stopped there a minute or two—I saw the prisoner, another man taller than him, and the woman who had touched me before—they were till three conversing together—I walked on about a dozen doors, and then I saw my gown move in front, with a sort of waving motion—I turned, and saw the prisoner with my gown tail in one hand, and my bag in his other hand—my bag had been in my pocket not a moment before—it had six half-crowns in it, and four shillings—the prisoner ran across the road—I called, "Stop thief," and saw him stopped in about a minute or a minute and a half—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

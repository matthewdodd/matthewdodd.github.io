I am in partnership with my brother Arthur—we are wholesale upholsterers in Monument-yard, City—the prisoner Neale was occasionally employed on the premises as packer, but not a regular servant—the policeman called at our warehouse a few days since, and showed me a quantity of horse-hair—I did not know we had lost any, our stock is so large—I can swear to the bag it was in, as our property—we always sell it in bags—I could not swear to the hair, but have not a doubt it was ours—since the policeman called we have missed several bags of hair—the bag produced has my private mark on it, with the cost of the hair—the bag has not been sold—when we sell a bag of hair, we take a brush and rub out the mark, and it should not be here if sold.</p>

On Tuesday, the 21st of Jan., I met the prisoner Neale in Paris-street, Horsleydown, three-quarters of a mile from Monument-yard—he had a bag on his back, which seemed very heavy—I followed him a short distance, and saw him go into the female prisoner's house, under the archway of the Greenwich railway—he was there about ten minutes, and came out without the load—I asked him what he had taken in there—he said some sacking that he brought from Ludgate-hill, that Mr. Ragget engaged him—I asked what he had under his coat—he said it was a handkerchief—I asked him to allow me to see it—he said he should not—I said I should take him to the station—he then pulled this large bag which I produce from his breast—there was nothing in it at the time—it was under his coat—it had the appearance of the bag he was carrying just before—he said it was the bag he had carried the sacking in—I gave him to another officer, went to Nicholson's shop, and asked if she had bought any sacks that morning—she said "No"—I asked if a bag of anything had been brought there that morning—she said, no, there had not been a soul there that morning—the constable brought Neale into the shop—I asked Nicholson if she knew him—she said, no, she had never seen him before—I went to the back of the shop, and found some curled horse-hair in a sack—I then went up stairs—she followed me, and I asked her if she had any horse-hair in the place—she said she had not a bit—I came down again, and in searching among some matting I found a bag of matting thrown over this sack—I pulled it out, and there was 1 cwt. of horse-hair in it—she said it belonged to Mr. Caddel—I asked her how it came there—she said she did not know—she then said it had not been brought there ten minutes—I asked who brought it—she said she did not know—I asked whose sack it was—she said it was the sack he brought it in, and she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the porterage—it weighed 1151bs.—the sack found on the prisoner was identified by the prosecutor.</p>

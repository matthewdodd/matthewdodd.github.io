               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. What o'clock was this? A. As near as I can recollect, twenty minutes or a quarter to eleven o'clock at night - I had been to Mr. Pullen, an attorney, in Gloucester-street, Hoxton - I had been having a pint of half-and-half with a person named Rice, who lives in Dove-row - nothing but malt and hops was in the half-and-half, I presume - I passed Keith as I was on the curb, and he stood near the houses - I did not observe whether he was drunk, but he struck me first - I turned back, and laid hold of him instantly - it was not till I laid hold of Keith that Steel interfered - I had not struck Keith - I seized hold of him - I was surrounded by them in all quarters the moment I laid hold of Keith - I had an umbrella with me - I did not lose it - I kept hold of it - I became insensible when on the ground - my umbrella was lying by my side when I came to myself - I might have used the umbrella in the irritation - I swear I did not strike Steel with it - if I struck any body, it was Keith - I certainly struck him with it - I cannot swear whether I struck him once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure when you imagined you struck at Keith, you might not have struck at Steel? A. I am, because the others were behind me, and I could not strike them - when Keith struck me I collared him immediately - whether the others came to his rescue or not, I cannot tell - when I was down, I felt my breeches tugged at - I had hold of Keith with one hand - there was a great scuffle - I felt their hands right inside my clothes - I swear I distinctly felt their hands at my fob and right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to Duff's father that, at the trial, if he would give you 10s., you would endeavour to get her off? A. Never; they have offered it to me, and a friend of Steel's has offered me a sovereign while I have been here this morning - I have seen Daniel Ryan and Peter Duff - I never said I would undo at the trial what I had done respecting the female prisoner - I struck Keith once with my umbrella, and may have struck him twice; but I was on my back in an instant - there was an attempt to get Keith from me.</p>

            . I live in Ann's-place Edward-street, Hoxton, and am foreman to Deacon and Co., carriers.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the beginning of this? A. No; I went to his assistance when he called out - there was no confusion when I went up, except the three people who were attacking him - there were other people on the footway - his umbrella was found near the cap - I had enough to do to hold Keith - I cannot say who took the hat; for, in assisting the prosecutor, I lost sight of the prisoners when they left him.</p>

             GOODE. I am a carrier, and live in Holywell-lane. On Tuesday night, about half-past ten o'clock, I was going to Shoreditch, and nearly at the top of the lane, a person passed from towards Shoreditch church to the opposite side - he had something in his hand, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150074"></xptr>he placed on the step of a door - it was a hat - I could not see the man's face - this is the hat.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FELL LEWIN. I live in Church-street, Shoreditch: I am foreman to a bootmaker. I went to the corner of our street to take a little fresh air, and observed, across the street, two or three individuals having an altercation, as I thought - they were standing up - I did not observe any thing more, but looked another way - I then heard the cry of "Police, police" - I looked round, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Steel striking him with his fist - I thought it was a mere lark, or I would have run over - one of the prisoners ran away - he had no hat on - Steel immediately followed, but not so quick as the first - I crossed the road to stop him, when the policeman came up; and we both caught him at the same time - there was a general attempt to rescue him, by four or five individuals - more assistance came, and he was conveyed to the watch-house - and, on the way there, Duff endeavoured to excite others to rescue him, and called the prosecutor names - I gave her in charge - I ran back to our shop - a young man followed me, and begged me not to go against the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw a dispute as it turned out afterwards to be? A. Yes - it had hardly commenced when I got there - some of them seemed to have an altercation - I did not hear any voices - they seemed talking - I turned round, and heard a call of "Police" - I looked round again, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and Steel striking him - he was secured without being out of my sight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Describe what you call a lark, or altercation? A. I saw the prosecutor knocked down, and struck when on the ground; but still I thought it was a lark - it was all done in an instant.</p>
               <p>MR. DAWSON. Q. Did you see the prosecutor striking with his umbrella? A. No; but he might have done so - it was done in such a hurry - I went to his assistance when I saw Steel strike him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you in the habit of calling a man being knocked down and beat a lark? A. In that neighbourhood, there are many sprees of young men getting drunk and larking and scuffling, but not done in that way - the prosecutor was bleeding profusely from the face.</p>

             (police-constable H 43). On the night of the 13th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in Shoreditch, and saw a scuffle between three or four men - they fell in the road - I ran across the road, hearing a cry of "Police," and saw the prisoner Steele get up and run away - he was on the ground - I pursued and took him - the prosecutor and two other witnesses came up - I asked what was the matter - he was covered with blood, and said he had been knocked down and attempted to be robbed - this was in Steel's presence - Steel said nothing to it - I was going on the road to the station-house, and got a few yards when Keith came out of Holywell-lane, and was immediately recognised by two witnesses - I took him into custody also - an attempt to rescue was immediately made, by five or six; and the female prisoner was one - she hung round my neck, and round Keith's neck - she was afterwards taken into custody - the prosecutor gave me this cap at the station-house, and Keith claimed it - and again at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from the place? A. The road is fifteen or sixteen yards across - I did not see the beginning of it, till I saw them all fall in the road.</p>

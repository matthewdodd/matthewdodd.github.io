            . I live at No. 73, Paradise-street, Lambeth. On the 15th of August, 1820, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18220220-96-crimeloc518">the Strand, opposite Southampton-street</placeName>

I had a gold watch in my fob, with a gold chain and seals. I endeavoured to get into the British Press office, but they kept shoving me about from one side to the other, some of them crying out,</p>
               <p>"The Sheriff." Mr. Sheriff Parkins was passing in his carriage; about that time I felt them pulling at my watch, I resisted, and in the struggle, I could imperfectly distinguish the face of the person who was pulling at it. The watch was buttoned in my fob, they tore my breeches in getting it out; the moment they got it, he gave a signal, and all dispersed in a body. The prisoner has a great similarly in countenance to the one who took it, but I think he is an inch and half shorter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your opinion is, that he is not the man. - Q. Not the man who robbed me.</p>

            , ESQ. I was passing in my carriage at this time. On first coming from Bridge-street, I saw a large gang, and kept my eye on them all through the street, and as we came through Temple-Bar, somebody was hustled, and opposite Southampton-street there was an interruption, by carts going along, and there was a considerable noise close to my carriage window. I looked that way, and saw Mr. Middleton hustled by the same gang. An officer had got hold of one of the gang, and was knocked down, and the man rescued - he came very near my window, and I had a full view of his face - he was very well dressed - that was not the prisoner, but he went off in company with the prisoner, as I believe; he came out of the crowd with the man, and accompanied him along the street. I do most certainly think the prisoner is the man. I described him to an officer - I will not swear that he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200052"></xptr>the man - I never saw him again till the day His Majesty last went to the House of Lords - he was then taken on this charge.</p>

            . I am a constable of Pancras. I was with Taylor in Bridge-street, and saw a gang of about eighteen - we followed, and watched them through Temple-Bar. I was behind the Sheriff's carriage, and saw Mr. Middleton endeavouring to get into the True Briton Office; he was surrounded, and being hustled by a gang. I called Taylor, and pushed in among them, and collared a man who had Mr. Middleton's pocket-book, and was putting it under his coat - that was not the prisoner - the pocket-book dropped, and I was knocked down; and he got away. I cannot say positively that the prisoner was there at that time. I apprehended the prisoner the last time the King went to the House, from a description given me by Mr. Parkins. I had seen him several times after, but was not ordered to apprehend him before.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I was in company with Colton, and saw the gang in Bridge-street. I know the prisoner was in the gang there, and in Fleet-street. I do not think I noticed him beyond Temple-bar - I was abreast of Mr. Middleton when he was robbed, but could not distinguish the prisoner then.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKINS re-examined. After he was apprehended, and before he went before the Magistrate, he sent a messenger requesting to see me - I went and saw him at a public-house opposite the office. I asked what he had to say - he solicited my consideration for his wife and family. I told him I could have no consideration for them - I must perform my duty, and that I hoped he would prove himself to have been somewhere else on that day - he said he could not.</p>
               <p>JURY, to COLTON. Q. When you apprehended him did you recollect his person as being one of the gang - A. Yes; I had known him many years - he was one of the gang.</p>

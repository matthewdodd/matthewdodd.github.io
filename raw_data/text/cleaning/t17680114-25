            . I am a stationer, and live almost opposite Mr. Gordon; he came to me about the 15th or 16th of last month, and said he had reason to suspect his till had been robbed more than once, and he suspected his porter; he proposed to mark some halfpence over night, and leave them in his till unlocked, and desired me, if he came for paper, to keep the money I took of him by itself; he had not an opportunity to, put it into execution till the 19th; on that morning he sent his young man to desire me to be in the way; the prisoner came and asked for a quire of gilt paper, with which I served him; this was about 8 o'clock, he paid me in ten pennyworth of halfpence; Mr. Gordon came over, in I believe three minutes after, and I showed him the halfpence; these are the identical half-pence, (producing six pennyworth of halfpence;) about three o'clock Mr. Gordon and I went with the prisoner to my Lord-Mayor, and produced the halfpence before his Lordship: they have never been out of my possession since, nor mixed with any other money; (the Court and Jury inspected them, and found them marked as described by the prosecutor.)</p>

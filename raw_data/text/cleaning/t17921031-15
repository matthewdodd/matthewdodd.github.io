               <p>On the 17th of October I lost two hams; about a quarter before eight in the evening, the prisoner and another came and asked me for a quarter of a pound of cheese; the man threw down a shilling hard on the counter, and it fell down behind the counter; in picking up the shilling, I saw Newman was reaching something out at the door, and I could not think what it was; they were the only two hams in the shop; then Newman laid hold of another ham; as soon as I saw that, I ran round the counter, and cried stop thief! Newman ran out of the shop; they got one ham clear off, the other they dropped; I never recovered the ham again; the hams were both together in the shop, in one place; when the prisoner ran away, he ran about thirty yards; I lost sight of him; when he was brought back, I knew him to be the same man; he offered me two guineas to let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. - It was between seven and eight in the evening when you lost your hams? - Yes.</p>

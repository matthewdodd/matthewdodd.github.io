I observed, as she turned by the cardinal, it was mine; I took hold of her, and charged her with the robbery; she and her husband denied it; they said they would go and shew me where they bought the cloak; when we came near St. Giles's church, the man ran away as hard as he could; we brought his wife home to our house, then we went to Justice Fielding; she said her husband gave her the cardinal; after that the prisoner was taken up for much such another fact; I went to him in New Prison, there he told me one of my gowns was at Mr. Pain's in Bow-street, the other at Mr. Burch's in Fox-Court, but the last could not be found. I asked him how he got into the house? he said he got in at one o'clock, the devil put it into his head; and he lifted up the flap of the door, where the beer goes down, and got in, it was not very strong. it might easily be open'd with a chissel; when he was in the cellar he could easily get up into the house. (I found the till, in which the money was, on the floor.) He owned he took the things out of the house. (A gown and cardinal produced and deposed to.)</p>

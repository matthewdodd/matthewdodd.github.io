On the 6th of November, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked to see some stockings. I did not like the looks of him, and therefore refused to shew him any, What, says he, do you think I want to steal them? I said, I had nothing that would do, and beg'd he would go. He turn'd about, and took 11 pair of women's stockings out of the window. He ran away, and I call'd out, Stop thief. He was taken in the street; but was out of my sight when taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jones, and am matron of the Female Asylum at Camden-town. The two prisoners were inmates of that institution-Wood acted as my servant, and had admission to my rooms—on the 24th of July I saw a cap opposite the stairs—I then went to see if any of the females were gone, and three were gone—I missed ten sovereigns and one half—sovereign, which had been in a box in ray room—the prisoners ought not to have left without notice—I have not found any of the money since—I had seen it safe the same morning-Ford had not an opportunity of going to the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Woodford</hi>. The daughter was there the same evening that we absconded—Mrs. Jones left the key in the hands of the sub-matron, and she might have gone to the box. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable 11</hi> 104.) On the 26th of July Woodford came to me at half-past nine o'clock, and said she wished to resign herself up to me, and that she and two other girls had stolen ten sovereigns and a half from the matron of the Asylum at Camden-town—she said she planned to steal it on the 22nd, and executed it on the 24th—that they took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to Kent-street, and in going along they divided the money—the half—sovereign was to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and get drink—that when she got there she got drunk, and went to bed—that the other two robbed her, and went away.</p>

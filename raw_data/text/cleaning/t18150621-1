            . I am a printer. I was returning home from my work, when this affair happened. I saw the prisoner running, and heard a cry of stop thief. He was pursued by the last witness. I tried to stop him; he struck at me, but did not hit me, because I stumbled back against a door-way. He passed me, and ran up Plough-court, into Carey-street; upon which, I pursued him, crying stop thief; he turned to the right, towards Chancery-lane. Two gentlemen were coming along with a lady, and he ran across the way, and put his back against the wall. I went up, and took him, and he asked for mercy, and that is all I know.</p>

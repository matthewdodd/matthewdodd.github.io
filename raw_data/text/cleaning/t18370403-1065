                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and live in Crown<lb></lb>place, Mile-end-road. I was in the Commercial-road on the afternoon of the 21st of March, and felt a twitch behind me—I turned round, and caught the prisoner about a yard from me, in the act of putting my handkerchief into his trowsers pocket—I secured him.</p>

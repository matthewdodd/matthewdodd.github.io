               <p>Q. In consequence of this you wrote to him? - A. Yes, and I received another letter before he came to Marlow, wherein he informed me he was coming into the country, and he would make Great Marlow in his way back to town, for half an hour's conversation, he said, would do more than a week's correspondence by letter.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this letter he came to you? - A. Yes, he came in about nine o'clock in the morning; he said his name was Moreton, and acknowledged this letter; I then began talking to him, about this bill of 75 l. 16 s. 7 d. I wanted to get discounted; I asked him upon what terms; he said he knew the nature of these things, he must not charge any more than 5 l. per cent. but he must charge the expenses down to Marlow; he then asked me to let him have the bills; I said I did not like to part with the bills out of my possession; he then asked me for a copy; I sat down and wrote him a copy; he stated the inconvenience of doing a bill of 75 l. he only having a hundred pound in his possession, he wanted me to make it up a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. In the letter he sent down to you at Marlow he said he had got 120 l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you wanted discounted was a bill of 75 l. he wanted you to give him a bill of 25 l.? - A. Yes, to make up the hundred; I asked him to sit down, and write me the form of the bill for 25 l. he refused, and begged me; I wrote it, and he named the person to whom I was to promise to pay it, which I think was

               <p>Q. When Moreton came, did he seem to take any notice of Spraggs? - A. No, nor Spraggs took no notice of him; Spraggs kept walking backwards and forwards; we went into the Old White Horse cellar, over the way; we set in the coffee-house there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person there? - A. Not one; when we sat down I asked him whether he had got the money; he said he had, twice; I then took out the note of 25 l.

               <p>Q. When Moreton held up his hand, did you see Spraggs then? - A. I did, but before I got out of the door they both disappeared.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You never heard any thing of your bills afterwards till in point of fact Moreton was taken up? - A. Never: On the 13th of December, near three months afterwards, I came up to London; I was walking up Parliament-street with Mr. Goldsmith, and met Spraggs in Parliament-street; I challenged him with his name; Spraggs said, do you want to say any thing to me; I said, no, but here is a friend of mine does, pointing to Mr. Goldsmith; with that they both talked together, and I walked a little way behind them; I heard Mr. Spraggs mention Mr. Ticken's bills; I went up to Mr. Spraggs, and told him my name was Ticken; Mr. Spraggs said, if possible, he would get my bills back again; if I would behave like a gentleman, he thought probably he might do something for me; Mr. Goldsmith made an appointment to meet him the same evening at eight o'clock, at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; he refused to give his address.</p>

               <p>Q. You say in your way to the door you saw him make some motion with his hand that you thought was directed to Spraggs; on your seeing that, which side of the way was Mason? - A. He was crossing; I saw them within two yards of each other; it appeared to me that they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether they went one way or separate ways? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. When Mason came out of the White Horse cellar with the bills, did you hear him say where he was going to? - A. He said he was going into St. James's street, and that he would be with me in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you go? - A. In fact, for a minute or two, I did not know what to do; some time elapsed before I did any thing; when I came out of the door of the White Horse to look after him I had left my hat; I went back to get my hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was it necessary for him to have crossed the street, in his way to St. James's street? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. He did cross the way to where Spraggs was standing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew where you lived because he had been at your house? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You never after heard of him till you saw him at Bow-street? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean to part with the bill without the money? - A. By no means.</p>

               <p>Spraggs's defence. I would wish to state all the transaction that I know about this business. Gentlemen of the Jury, I am implicated here in a very disagreeable manner, of stealing a bill; I know just so much of stealing or swindling a bill as any gentleman in Court. I unfortunately, about twelve months ago, got acquainted with Mason; the first of my acquaintance with this man was in Newgate; I paid some money for his discharge, and from some circumstances I relieved him, and after I relieved him, he, not having it in his power to pay me, used to come backwards and forwards to do some things for me; sometime last September he came and told me about Mr. Julian, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180501090043"></xptr>had transactions with him; what transaction, I said, can you have with Mr. Julian (for I would not take a bill, nor even a Bank-note from the hands of Mason;) this Mason said to me, Mr. Julian will accept a bill of thirty pounds, provided any person will draw it for me; I 
               <persName id="t18050109-46-person490">drew</persName>
             a bill on Mr. Julian for thirty pounds, I never had the least intention to discount it at first or last, whatever Mr. Julian had. After I had done it, I thought I should be implicated without any benefit; I went to Mr. Julian to know the transaction of it; Mr. Julian told me the particular transaction, for at that moment I meant to burn the bill; I saw Mr. Alley afterwards, and it was agreed that he should pay the five guineas; I then went to Mr. Julian with the bill, and he gave me five guineas; he told me about Mr. Ticken, of Marlow; I said, what have you done with it; he said, there is a warrant at Queen-square; I said, I know nothing at all about Mr. Ticken's bills, nor shall I trouble myself at all about it. On the 13th of December, as I was coming up Parliament-street, I met these gentlemen, and after we had passed each other ten yards, he came up to me, and asked me if my name was Spraggs; I said, yes; he said, do you know a Mr. Moreton; I said, no; he said, do you know Mason; I said, yes, I would give five guineas to see him; Mr. Ticken said, have you heard that he has got a bill from me; I said, I have heard that he has got a bill from a gentleman of Great Marlow; he said, can you render me any service in getting that bill, for I find that you have got Mr. Julian's, if I could get him the bill he would behave like a gentleman; I never told him I would, if he would behave like a gentleman; he said it first; he said, seventy-five pounds was a great deal of money to lose; they wanted me to meet them at their lodgings in the City; I said, that is a great way, cannot we meet nearer; I appointed to meet them at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; I told them, if I could render them any service I would; I went there; Mr. Goldsmith and Mr. Rivett came into the coffee-room, and said I must go along with them; Mr. Rivett began searching me in the coffee-room; I said, do not expose me in the coffee-room; they took me to the Office, and Mr. Ford asked me what I knew of these bills; I said nothing, but that I heard that that man had got some bills from Mr. Ticken, of Great Marlow; Mr. Ticken gets up, in a kind of surprize, and said, now I am satisfied Mr. Spraggs knows something about this business, as I have not mentioned any thing about the other bill of 25 l. no, not even to my wife; that, he said, he drew at Marlow, payable to one Holmes, and that he voluntarily gave Mason, but he catched up the other, and ran away; I was committed for re-examination, but Ticken swore positively that he saw me in the street both before and after Mason took the bills. Now I declare to God that I never was in the street at that time; Sir

             asked him how he came to know that my name was Spraggs; he said, from the description that Mr. Julian gave of me; I was recommitted, the bill was due on the 20th of December, to see whether the bill would be presented for payment; and when re-examined again, the bill was not presented for payment at that time; Mr. Ticken was particularly asked whether he had endorsed the bill; he said, no; the bill not being endorsed by Ticken, it was said that Mason could not have stole it; Sir

             said, there was a something stole, but nothing to go to a Jury; he should commit Mason fully, and me on suspicion; and he said, Ticken had no occasion to trouble himself so much about the bill, as he had not endorsed it, it could be of no use to any person but him; Mr. Walker was still a debtor to him as before.</p>

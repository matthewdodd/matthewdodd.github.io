                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the family of Dr. Edwin John Quickett, of Wellclose-square—these two silver spoon are his property—I know them by his crest on them—on the 23rd of January, about twenty minutes to eight in the morning, I saw the prisoner on the kitchen stairs—I am sure it was he—he said he came to look at gas—the house is lighted with gas—he was taken into the front kitchen by the cooks—she is not here—I did not see him go into the kitchen—I was in the dinning room at the time, but I saw him on the kitchen stairs coming up—he had been down—he said he wanted to go into the dinning room, to look at the gas—I went with him into the dinning room, and he lighted the burners of the chan<lb></lb>delier—he then followed me down into the kitchen and asked me for the steps, which I gave him—he then went up into the dinning room with me—said "Good bye," and went away—the back kitchen—is opposite the front kitchen, they are separated by a little narrow passage; the doors were open—the salt-spoons were in a little cupboard in the back kitchen—I had seen them there the night before—I missed them about half past four o'clock in the afternoon, after the prisoner had gone—I saw them afterwards at the station—the prisoner said he came from Messrs. Platow, they are gas-fitters</p>

On Saturday evening about half past nine o'clock, I was called to the shop of Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker, and found two salt spoons on the counter—Mr. Russell said in the prisoner's presence that he did not know weather the prisoner came honestly by them—the prisoner said he bought them six months ago, in Long Acre—I took pos<lb></lb>session of them, and took him to the station—I made inquiry, and on the 25th went to Dr. Quickett's—the girl saw the spoons and identified them—they were the spoons which I produce.</p>

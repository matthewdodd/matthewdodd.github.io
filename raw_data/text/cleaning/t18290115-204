On the 17th of November the prisoner came in, and said he was very thirsty, and wished me to fetch him a pint of porter, which I did; I was gone about five minutes - these things were in a box down stairs; he went away about ten minutes after I brought him the porter - it was about twelve o'clock in the day; I did not miss the things till next day - there were other things in the box; nobody but the prisoner had been in the house - my friend came home about an hour afterwards; I remained there myself till I missed the things - the house was secure at night - I found it so next morning; I saw the things when he was in custody two months after - there was nobody in the house to take them but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Did you meet the prisoner in the street at your first acquaintance, and he go home with you? A. No; he promised me marriage, but I discovered after he was taken up that he has a wife - I understood so before he was taken; I cannot say I was ever particularly fond of him - I gave him several things to send down into the country ready for our marriage; these are not those articles, and what I did give him was for our own use, not to run away with - I never slept with him in my life; I once lived servant in Noble-street, Foster-lane he was not allowed to come in there; he visited me frequently at Mrs. Powell's - I did not give him these things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You gave him some other things for your common use, expecting to become his wife? A. Yes; these were taken without my knowledge.</p>

            . I keep the house, No. 4, Bell-square. I have known Chandler five years; the prisoner visited her for three years - he represented himself to be single; I discovered that he was not single before he was taken up, and told Chandler when the things were stolen - I did not know it before they were stolen; he was to come on the 18th, to go out with her to buy the ring and the licence at Doctors' Commons - I heard him say so; he did not call -I did not see him again till he was in custody, on the 3d of January: when he did not come, I went to make inquiry at Mr. Wild's office, in College-hill, where he had once lived, and they told me he was a married man; Miss Chandler had given him some things to send into the country for the wedding - I think it was on the Thursday before the 17th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were to go to his father's in Norfolk? A. Yes, I had left the prosecutrix in care of my house on the 17th - I never knew any thing wrong of her; I never saw the prisoner at her place in Noble-street- he never staid at my house after nine o'clock, as my husband goes to bed early.</p>

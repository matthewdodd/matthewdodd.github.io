The prisoner was my gardener.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 23d did the prisoner at the bar come to your house. - A. He did, he came about seven o'clock, he said will you buy some small pieces of lead, I said let me see them; he with the assistance of a porter brought in an enormous piece of lead; the piece that came in first was from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds weight, it caused me to suspect that it was not honestly come by. I told him that I could not very well weigh it, he must leave it; he said that he particularly came to town to get money for some clothes that he owed for, he said if you cannot weigh it guess at it; this of course made my suspicion stronger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any cart there. - A. Yes. (The lead produced.)</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a plumber living at Harrow. - A.Yes, I am employed at Mr. Hamilton's house; the lead now in court I had ripped from a gutter, it is deficient at one of the corners; I am positive it is Mr. Hamilton's lead. I saw one other piece stand upright in the coal hole on the evening of the 22nd; that was also gone on the 23d.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is your brother in law. - A. He is a bricklayer, he lives in Bayswater, he went into Middlesex hospital; he sent to me if I would sell this lead for him it would be of service to him; I had taken some lead to Mr. Wilkins before he bought it of me this time. I borrowed Chapman's house and cart on Tuesday evening, I turned the horse into the field till the morning, and then I brought the remainder of the lead to Mr. Robinson's, I drove the horse up to the door, he gave me half a guinea, I returned in half an hour, he was not within; I came presently after again to his house, this was the third time, I called, I might have gone away if I would, I immediately went to Robinson's house after having a pint of beer; they had a constable then aud detained me.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Putman) What day was it you saw the lead in Mr. Hamilton's coal house. - A. On the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Wilkins. - A. On the Saturday after I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Wilkins) Was the lead that you shewed to Mr. Putman the same as you received from the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>

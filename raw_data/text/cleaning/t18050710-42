               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. Never; she told me my petticoat was hanging down; she asked me if she should pin it up for me; I told her, it would do very well while I got home; I had my child in my arms and a bundle in my hand; she insisted upon pinning my petticoat up; I said, hold my bundle while I change the child into my other arm; when I had got my child on my arm I looked round, and saw her hand was in my pocket-hole; I put my own hand down to feel in my pocket, she pushed my hand away; I put my hand down again into my pocket, and I missed my pocket-book directly; I told her she had got my pocket-book; she said, she had not; she pulled several other pocket-books and tobacco pouches out of her pocket to satisfy me that she had not got mine; she said, that she had not got mine about her; I asked her where she lived; she told me, she lived at No. 1, Cock-alley; I went up there after her to No. 1, and there was no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. She went away and left you did she? - A. Yes, she went up the alley and I went after her, but there was no such a person lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did she go by then? - A. Taylor; she did not tell me any name at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your pocket-book again? - A. No, nor my money; I had my pocket-book in my pocket that very minute; I saw her hand in my pocket, she pushed my hand away, and said, she was not going to take any thing away from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At that time I was in St. Clement's workhouse; Mr. Alcock let me out and let me in again; I had only been out to buy a pennyworth of tea.</p>
               <p>- GEARY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the parish of St. Luke's; I heard the prisoner confess at the Office, that she had been along with Mrs. Monk on that day; she acknowledged that Mrs. Monk had accused her on that day, but that she had not taken her money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty of either; my father came up and asked Mr. Latham if I had been out; he said, somebody had enquired about me; Mr. Alcock said, I had not been out above five minutes; Mrs. Monk said, she would come up to me; and the next day my father met her in the street, she said then, she would not mind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your father? - A. My mother is here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Taylor.) Are you the mother of this prisoner? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not her father here? - A. I left him at home at work; we live at No. 1, New-court, Quaker-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you, or any of your family been in the workhouse lately? - A. No; I have four childeren; I have got none in the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Alcock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever sent any of the children to the workhouse? - A. That big girl, she is fourteen, she was in the workhouse last November.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you send a big girl like that to the workhouse, she is able to get her bread - what business is your husband? - A. A Shoemaker; her father has learnt her to close shoes lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when Mrs. Monk was robbed? - A. A woman came up to my house about six weeks before Christmas, she asked me if my girl was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutrix.) Did you ever see this woman before? - A. Yes, on the 28th of November I went up to her house, I found it out that night after I had been to Cock-alley, I went to see the girl, I wanted to know whether she was the same girl or no, but she was not there.</p>

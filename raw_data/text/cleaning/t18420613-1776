                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Smith, of New-street, Old-street, in the parish of St. Luke—he keeps the house. On the even<lb></lb>ing of the 2nd of June I was washing in my kitchen, and left my street-door open—I fancied I heard a noise on the staircase, and moved the kitchen-door to look—I saw the prisoner coming down the passage, and said, "Where have You been, sir?"—he said, "I have been to Mrs. Jones"—I have no such person in the house—my suspicions were excited—I said, "You have been to my drawers"—he made no reply, but endeavoured to pull me into the street—I laid hold of a bundle which he had under his arm—after standing a little while, he got from me, struck me in the eye, and dug his nails into my wrist—I cried, "Stop thief!"—a lodger in my house, overtook him directly he got from me—the bundle contained two gowns, a shawl, and a yard and a half of silk—the other things were on his person—these are all my husband's property.</p>

I was standing in the street, Phillips said to me, "Stop the thief, Mr. Ash"—I stopped the prisoner as soon as possible—I saw him running from them—I clasped him in my arms directly—he was about fifty yards from Mrs. Phillips, he was in sight—I saw him turn round the corner, and took him against the church-wall—he said, "Don't stop me, for I've done nothing amiss"—I said, "There is a cry of Stop thief," and I shall not lose You—we had a great struggle—I got him down, and delivered him to the policeman—I saw him searched, and three brooches, some seals, two pocket-handnkerchiefs, and three skeleton-keys were found on him.</p>

             acknowledged she had the watch, and offer'd that one Warrington should pay me a shilling per week.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man ?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I am, but I have not lived with my wife for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I had been drinking a little cheruping cup, and they pick'd me up. I ask'd the way to the Old Bailey, they said they would shew me; they took me to a house; then I gave Cleverton a shilling to fetch some beer; she said the mistress of the house would not suffer beer to be brought in without sixpence for the use of the room. I was not concerned with either of them; they went to tye my hands, and got a handkerchief and struck me with it after they had pull'd down my breeches. I said, I did not like that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pewters. I attended at my Lord-Mayor's with Cleverton after she was committed. She said she would endeavour to find out the person that pawned the watch, if he would give her directions where she should send it to him.</p>
               <p>Cleverton's defence. I met the prosecutor on Ludgate Hill, and carried him to the house of Mrs. Williams, a disorderly house in Stonecutters-Alley; he paid sixpence for the use of the room; he had no beer. He ask'd us if we had any rods ? We said no; and if he would have any he must pay sixpence for them. This other young woman had a handkerchief, which she tied a knot in; he said she was a fool, and did not know how to tye a knot to flog a person with; he took it and ty'd 2 more knot in it; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175601150018"></xptr> as he had no money, he gave me his watch to pawn, and when I went he kept Gray, and would not let her go.</p>
               <p>Gray's defence. I met the prosecutor and Cleverton on Ludgate-Hill; he ask'd me to go with them. We went to Mrs. Williams's house, and he gave Cleverton the watch whilst I was flogging of him; and when I had obliged him, he said you bitch, where is my watch? I said, did not you give it the young woman to pawn. This man keeps a very disorderly house in Bishops Court, in the Old-Bailey.</p>

Burchell came on the 3d May, about 1 o'clock to look at my lodgings for a lady, he said he wanted a wine and coal cellar and the first floor - he went down stairs to look at the house, and was in the front kitchen, he opened a closet, and asked me for some paper to put down the terms - I said I thought he could recollect twenty-five shillings a-week, he still asked for paper, and I gave him some - he placed the inkstand on a shelf which the ring laid on - he went away, and in about an hour I missed it - he did not hire the lodgings, and was quite a stranger. I saw him again that evening, and asked if he was the person who had been to my house - he said he had never seen me before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BURCHELL. Q. Did not you take the inkstand off the shelf? A. I cannot say; but you put it up - the ring was by the side of it; I had seen it safe that morning - nobody but him had been to the house.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman. Blake and the prosecutrix came and told me they were robbed. Burchell came up - and they said "There is the very man going to my gate." I went over and asked who he wanted - he said Mr. Saunders. I said two ladies over the way, wanted him, (Austin was with him). I brought them over - the ladies identified Burchell positively - and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

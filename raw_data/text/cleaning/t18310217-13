On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, I went to bed about a quarter-past eleven o'clock; the house was then fastened - two female servants and the boy were up when I went to bed; one female servant and the boy are here - it is my invariable practice to examine the doors myself every night; I did so that night - they were all fast; a little after six o'clock in the morning, the boy came up and alarmed me - I went down stairs, and perceived every thing in the front parlour in very great disorder, and a great deal of property gone; there was about 300l. worth gone - I looked over the house, and on going down to the back kitchen, I found an entry had been made at the back door, by cutting a piece out of the door and unbolting it; I had seen that door myself overnight - it was then safe; when it became day-light, we found a ladder from the adjoining house to mine - the two houses join within about four feet; there is an addition of a back room built out at the next house, and at the back part of my house is a yard covered in; the houses are not quite close together - on the back room, which is built out from the next house, I saw some pieces of cuttings of scarlet cloth, by which I suppose the property was taken out that way; I had scarlet cloth in my house - I saw footsteps on the snow, leading to the back of an empty house in George-street; there appeared a good many footsteps - I then went round to the empty house, and saw a female named Woodward, who had the care of it; in the back room coming from that yard, there were several pieces of scarlet cloth and a quantity of wadding, which some of the dress coats that had been taken from my house had been wrapped up in - I found them in the room of the empty house, leading from the yard to where I traced the footsteps, and in the kitchen of the empty house, I found three silver spoons belonging to me - I went into the front kitchen there, and saw there had been the same sort of work at the door of that house as well as mine; a piece was cut out of the centre of the door where the bolt was, exactly the same as mine - that is the door leading from the kitchen to the stairs; there was no mark of any force having been used to any of the outer doors of that house, no appearance of their having been broken open - I returned home, and sent to Marlborough-street Office for Ballard; I missed from my house a full dress coat for the West Somerset Yeomanry, worth about 30l., a full dress coat for the Grenadier Guards, worth upwards of 30l., and the front part of the embroidery of a coat for the Coldstream Guards; I missed altogether about thirteen coats, I think five epaulettes, between sixty and seventy yards of woollen cloth, more than that of kerseymere, and about twelve yards of velvet - that was all my property; some of the coats were made for gentlemen, and not sent home - also a pair of boots belonging to my servant, David Webster: I should know my property again - it was all safe there on the Wednesday evening; I questioned Mrs. Woodward, who was looking after the empty house - she is not here; I was present when Coy and Thompson were apprehended by Ballard - they had property belonging to me in their possession at that time; they were apprehended in Dean-street, Soho, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the Saturday following - Coy had a bundle, with two pieces of scarlet cloth in it; Thompson had a kind of a hand-basket with two coats in it - I do not think any thing was said at that time; I know the cloth belonged to me, and one of the coats - we got a warrant to search a muffinbaker's shop, in Hanway-yard, kept by the prisoner Gast; the officers Ballard, Goddard, Schofield, and myself went there on the Saturday - Gast was in the house, and while we were searching, Ellis came in with a bundle: Ballard took him into custody, and on opening the bundle there was a coat in it belonging to me - we only found in Gast's house about eight yards of cloth belonging to me, in three remnants; we then went to No. 11, Tottenham-court-road, kept by the witness Thompson, a hosier - Ballard, Goddard, and myself went in, and in the front attic of that house we discovered a great quantity of my property; there was all the embroidery of the regimental coats, the epaulettes, five or six other coats, a quantity of blue cloth, and two regimental coats - the whole of them were my property; there was a great variety of other property, which was not mine - I saw nothing of the prisoner Thompson there; they are two distinct persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No - my house was broken open on the Wednesday night or Thursday morning, and I went to Gast's house on the Saturday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was at home - I believe he is married; there was a family there - I have heard that Ellis is Gast's son-in-law, and lodged in the house; at least when we took the black cloth found there, it was asked whose room that was in, and it was said to be Ellis' - the eight yards were cut or torn into three pieces; I think it was on the second floor - there are no back rooms; I was down stairs at the time, but when I came up it was on a chest of drawers - I think it had been found before I got up; I was called down once or twice; Goddard and Schofield<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170017"></xptr>were in the room - I did not find it; I have the head ends of it, and the list to compare with it, and have a private-mark on one piece - my name is not on it; he certainly could not tell it was mine by any mark - I did not know Ellis before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many persons sleep in the house? A. Myself, my wife, three female servants, five children, and a boy; the next house was not empty - it was a house in George-street; a door inside that house had been broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that towards the back part of the premises? A.No, the front - I cannot tell whether the door of that house had been closed the night before of course; I found the inner door broken the same as my own door - Ballard was present when we took Coy and Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say at that time nothing was said? A. I said I did not hear any thing pass.</p>

I went to bed on the Wednesday night, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock - I do not know whether I was the last person up; the house was safe - I got up next morning about a quarter-past six, and was the first person up; I sleep down stairs - the first thing I saw was the parlour door open, which is on the ground floor; I sleep on that floor - that door was shut over night; I saw it shut - I saw the cases the regimental coats were kept in were standing open and empty; Mr. Chambers' great coat and another coat laid on the floor - I immediately went up and alarmed master, who came down; I went with him into the back kitchen on the area floor, and saw a piece was taken out of the door and a hole made to put their fingers through to undo the bolts; the door was open - I went to the front kitchen, and the two female servant's drawers were open, I missed a pair of boots of mine out of the cupboard - on the Friday Goddard and Ballard brought the prisoner Clifford to master's house: I saw him in the parlour - Ballard told him to take one of the boots off which he had on; he did so, and Ballard asked me if they were mine - I said they were; he had both my boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the same night into the back kitchen again after the examination? A. I was walking through the back kitchen in the dark - it was dusk; I kicked a boot before me - I got a light, and found the fellow to it; they did not belong to me - I inquired of all the men in the house, and they did not claim them; I delivered those boots to Ballard - they were very old ones, and I had only worn mine once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not Clifford say, in your presence, that he had bought the boots at the Three Compasses, New-cut, Lambeth? A. No, he did not: I did not see the other boots put on his feet - I do not know of their being an inch and a half too long for him; Mr. Chambers did not, by any promise or threat, attempt to get any confession from Clifford.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I went to Mr. Chamber's house on the Thursday morning, and saw the front parlour in great disorder; the things were laying about - the epaulette boxes and things were about; I requested Mr. Chambers to show me which way he conceived they had got in; the entrance of the house was effected through the sky-light of his workshop - it is an upright sky-light; the window opens at the side - it was open; it could be opened very easily - there appeared to be no fastening to that; it opened and shut by pullies from the inside - it could be opened from the outside by a person putting their hands on the frame and pushing it down; there was a string hanging from the inside of the window, by which they could let themselves down, and then descend into the house by a flight of stairs - the strings belong to the window; they could let themselves down into the body of the shop, which is about ten feet, by taking hold of the cord - they then had to descend a flight of stairs, at the bottom of which is a door communicating with the back kitchen - a hole was cut through that door in the corner, just above the bottom stile, sufficient to admit two or three fingers to work back the bolt; it was some holes bored, and then broken through - it had been bored by a large gimblet of this description(producing one), which is broken, and part of it was found on Mr. Chambers' premises; it was given to me by Mr. Chambers' servant - here is the broken piece; this hammer was given me also by Webster, I think.</p>

            . Outside the sky-light, in the snow, was the print of a person's feet standing and moving about, and marks of their fingers where they had laid their hands in different parts on the top of the sky-light and different parts of the window; there were the marks of persons' feet going over the back premises of other houses to the empty house in George-street - they had to cross one person's premises entirely to get to it; there were the tracks of three or four persons, and in the yard of the empty house were a great number of foot-marks, and in the back room of the empty house I saw some wadding and cuttings of scarlet cloth laying about - I then proceeded down stairs in the empty house, and found a door which communicates from the front kitchen to the foot of the stairs, cut just above the middle stile, where there was a bolt to fasten it; a hole had been bored, and then broken through, so as to admit fingers to get to the bolt to unfasten it the same way as the other, and on the board of one of the windows, inside, was a great quantity of tools belonging to a bell-hanger who had been working at the house at bell-hanging - there were no marks on the door there, but on going into the front area there were marks on the wall of a person's toe, as if a person had scraped it by dropping down into the area, and a mark of one heel in the snow, close up against the wall, and at the window which was nearest to the cistern, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170018"></xptr>were marks of a person having got in at that window, the shutters of which were not fastened: I then inquired for the person who had charge of the house, and from information received from Mrs. Woodward, I went in search of the prisoner Woodward, at No. 9, Fullwood's-rents - he was not there; I searched the room, and left Goddard there - I saw Goddard there myself till eleven o'clock; on the following morning, Friday, I went with Goddard to No.53, Cirencester-place - Goddard proceeded up stairs, and brought Clifford down to me in the shop, and upon asking him a few questions I desired him to put his feet up, and said, "Where did you get these shoes?" he said,"I bought them;" I said when - he said yesterday; I said where - he said over in the New-cut; I said where there - he said in the skittle-ground of the Three Compasses, kept by a man of the name of Pople; I asked what he gave for them - he said 10s.; I asked if he knew the person he bought them of - he said No, he did not, he was a stranger; I asked if the landlord was present - he said No; I asked if the pot-boy was - he said the pot-boy came in and out, he did not know that he saw him; I asked what he had done with his old ones - he said he had thrown them over the bridge into the river as he came back; we then took him to Mr. Chambers', showed 
               <persName id="t18310217-13-person271">Webster</persName>
             the shoes, and he claimed them as his - we then took him to the office, where I desired him to take off the shoes he had then on, and to put on one of the old ones which I had received from Webster; the shoe itself was evidently too long for him, but the marks of his toes evidently came where the marks of the toes were in the shoes - here are marks of Jumps or bunions on the shoes at the same place in the old shoes, which were found, as in the new ones, which were taken off his feet - there is the same tread.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean on the upper leathers, or on the soles? A. On the upper leathers; in consequence of information received I went with Goddard to Rupert-street, on the Saturday, and after waiting a considerable time I saw Coy go into a house; he came out in about half an hour, went down into Princes-street, from there to Wardour-street, and then returned home again to Rupert-street, and after stopping in doors some time he came out, and proceeded at a fast pace, walking fast, and running up to Mr. Young's, Marshall-street, Golden-square, just by Carnaby-market; after some time he came out again, and proceeded faster than before - Goddard and I followed him through Soho-square, across Oxford-street, and into Hanway-street- I did not see him go into Gast's house myself, but after waiting about an hour and a half Goddard left me, and before he returned I saw Coy come out of Gast's house, with a bundle under his arm - he had no bundle when I followed him before; I ran out from where I was standing, and in Oxford-street saw Coy, and then, for the first time, I saw Thompson in his company - he had a basket in his hand; when I got out of Hanway-street they were about the middle of the street, talking together; I had not seen them join each other - Mr. Chambers was with me - I allowed them to go on down Dean-street, as far as Walker's hotel; I then took hold of Coy, and Mr. Chambers secured Thompson - we put them into the hotel immediately; I secured them, and requested Mr. Chambers to go for a coach, which I put them into, and took them to the office; I told Coy at the office there had been a robbery committed, and a great quantity of cloth stolen; this was not taken down in writing - I said did he choose to say any thing about it, he might do as he liked; I untied his bundle, and found it contained this scarlet cloth - he said he had got it of young Gust, and that Gust lived at a muffin-shop in Hanway-street - that he received it from him in the bakehouse, and he was going to sell it for him, for the purpose of getting a few shillings - I asked him if he knew any thing about any coats; he said he did not; I asked if he had been offering to sell any coats to any person - he said No, he had not - that Thompson had two coats to try to sell, but he knew nothing about them; I asked if he knew any thing about any cloth - he said he did not; I desired Goddard to see what Thompson had in the basket, which he did - I had no conversation with him about it; Coy, at the office the same evening, pointed out Ellis as the person he had received the scarlet cloth from; this was in Ellis' presence: I do not think the Magistrate was there, but at all events it was not when any deposition was taken; the Magistrate lives in the house; a message was sent up to say that they were ready, and I think it was before he came down; I am, however, sure that it was not taken in writing - it was said in Ellis' presence, and he made no answer to it; we proceeded to get a search-warrant, and went off to the house in Hanway-street - the prisoner Gast was making muffins at the back part of the shop; I told him we had a warrant to search his house - he asked for what; I told him for woollen cloth and other articles, and while I was searching the front parlour he said, "Well, but what are you searching for?" and shortly afterwards he said, "But I have not seen the warrant;" I showed it him - he wanted to copy it; I said I could not stop to give him a copy at that time; Mr. Chambers, Goddard, and Schofield were up stairs, searching; I was down stairs in charge of the door, and after standing there some time Ellis came in - he had this coat, tied in this handkerchief, under his arm; I said,"Here I am, waiting for you - what have you here?" he said a coat; I said, "Where did you get it?" he said, "I bought it;" I asked of whom - he said of a man named Jones, but he did not know where he lived, he had only seen him at a public-house; I said, "Where were you when you bought it?" he said at his own house - I said"What house do you mean - do you mean this house here?" he said Yes; in a short time time I sent Goddard down to the office with him, and in consequence of what had been found up stairs I told Gast it was necessary he should get ready to go before the Magistrate, to give an account of the things found in his house; he cleaned himself for that purpose - a female came in, and in consequence of information we went to No.11, Tottenham-court-road, and there saw Mr. Thompson, the witness - we asked if he knew Ellis; he took us up to the front attic, where we found a large quantity of woollen cloth; here is a blue cloth in one piece, and four coats, one of which is not finished, three epaulettes and the military dress coats, as stated in the indictment - they were tied in a bundle, and the epaulettes with them; they have been shown to Mr. Chambers. On the Monday following, in consequence of information I received, I went to the house of Mr. Smith, Hop-gardens, St. Martin's-lane, and there received from Mrs. Smith a quantity of cloth and kerseymere; on the 14th Mr. Thompson delivered to Goddard, in my presence, ten yards of velvet.</p>

Yes- I believe he has done so for some years; Ellis said he resided there, but the room which was pointed out as Ellis' had neither bed nor bedding in it; it was a second floor room, on the right-hand side going up - there are no back rooms; I searched the shop and parlour, but found nothing applying to this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You found the tools of a bell-hanger at the house in George-street? A. Yes, a great variety of tools; I did not take the bellhanger up - I went to the Three Compasses, and found Pople kept the house - he is here; Coy said he had the cloth from Gust, at the muffin-shop where I had seen him come out - I did not apprehend Ellis in consequence of that; we were determined to search every place he came out of with property; he said Thompson had two coats, which was true - I do not know Thompson to be a dealer in muffins.</p>

             - I staid there till one o'clock in the morning of Friday, but he did not return; about nine o'clock on the Friday morning, I went with Ballard to No.53, Cirencester-place, and in the two pair back room I saw Clifford dressing himself; I desired him to come down - Ballard asked him several questions respecting the shoes; I heard what he said, and what Ballard has stated is true - the next day, Saturday, in consequence of information, I went with Ballard to No.27, Rupert-street, and after waiting some time saw Coy come out; we followed and watched him into the house of Mr. Young, in Marshall-street, but before that I had gained ground on him, and went and told Young I thought he was coming there; he went to Young's, and stopped there a short time, then came out, and I saw him go into the house of Gast, in Hanway-street, and some time after I received charge of the prisoner Thompson - I had been watching in Hanway-street some time.</p>
               <p>Q. When Coy went into the house in Hanway-street, did not you go in? A. No, I remained watching, and afterwards went to the Police-office, where I received charge of Thompson - he had a basket; I asked if it was his - he said Yes - I opened it, and found it contained two coats; here is one of them - I asked who he got them from, and after some little hesitation he said from a person named Gust - I afterwards asked what he was going to do with them - he said to sell them, and if he sold them he was to have 5s. for his trouble; I afterwards returned from the office with Ballard, Schofield, and Chambers, to Gast's house, in Hanway-street, and in searching the second floor room, on the right-hand as you go up stairs, I found three pieces of black cloth - I asked whose room it was, and was told it was Ellis'; it had no bed in it - the cloth was on the drawers, tied in this handkerchief; it is three remnants - I came down, searched Ellis, and took him to the office; I found upon him about 8l. in money, the key of a clock, and a variety of small keys; I returned to Gast's house, and from information, I went with Chambers and Ballard to Thompson's, in Tottenham-court-road, and found the property described by Ballard; after I took Ellis to the office I showed him to Coy - Andrews, the officer, who had him in custody, was present; the Magistrate was not present - it was in the clerk's office, and before the office hours; the clerk was not writing, nothing passed - I afterwards locked Ellis up. and then went and asked Coy if that was the person who he had the cloth from.</p>

After that, in Ellis' presence, about nine o'clock that night, while the Magistrate was sent for, but before he came down, we had the prisoners in the office, ready to be examined, both Thompson and Coy nodded their heads at Ellis, and said that was the person they got the things from - Ellis saw them nod, and heard it, but made no answer; on the Monday following I went with Ballard to Smith's, and received three pieces of kerseymere from Mrs. Smith; I got information from there that some blue cloth had been sent from there that morning to Mr. Eccles, in Spring-gardens, and I got from there two pieces of blue cloth; that is blue cloth which Ballard has not spoken to - it is here; I got it from Eccles the same day; on the 14th I received ten yards of velvet from Mr. Thompson, of No. 11, Tottenham-court-road.</p>

            . I am a woollen-draper, and live at No. 4, Hop-gardens, St. Martin's-lane. I have known Coy about two months - I am not acquainted with him, and had not dealt with him; he called on the 3rd of this month - I believe it was on a Thursday - he brought some cloth and kerseymere for sale; there was a good deal of it - it was in five pieces altogether, three of kerseymere, and two of cloth; he said he had them to sell, that they were not his own, they belonged to a master tailor - he asked me to buy them, which I agreed to, and measured them; I was to pay 10s. 2d. a yard for the cloth, 3s. 10d. for two of the pieces of kerseymere, and 3s. 11d. for the other - it was broad cloth; I think I paid him 24l. odd: after folding it up I put it on the shelf, with my own goods, and on the Monday morning I took two pieces of the cloth to Mr. Eccles, of Spring-gardens - I gave the other three up to Mr. Chambers and the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you carried on business as a woollen-draper? A. These fifteen years - I do not know that I am in the habit of buying of people who bring things in; I certainly have often bought of people in the shop - the broad cloth is not fine Saxony; Mr. Chambers is considered a respectable and fashionable tailor; I can buy very good cloth for 15s. a yard - I have given 28s. for some: this might be about 16s. a yard from the manufacturer, but things are bought and sold cheaper for want of money - this is very narrow cloth, and there would be an allowance for that; I could buy it for 16s., for cash, and should be allowed a yard in the score.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that you were dealing honest by giving 10s. 2d. for it? A. I knew no more of its being dishonestly come by than a child unborn - I am pretty well acquainted with the quality of cloth; it may be three inches narrower than the common broad cloth, which is usually thirty or thirty-one inches, this is twenty-eight or twenty-nine - I was never in trouble; I am sure of that - I have invoices to show my respectability; I was never charged with any offence at any time or place, and was never in custody, or charged with having property improperly in my possession belonging to another person - I was accused of a something once, but I had nothing to do with it, and never was in custody; I forget who accused me - what you allude to I believe was about a Mr. Chambers or Chamberlain, a laceman - I had some lace in my possession, which he claimed - I do not know how much there was, on my life, nor the value; I do not deal in lace - I neither bought nor sold that; Mrs. Smith had taken it to ask the value at a customer's - it had been brought to our house; Mr. Chamberlain afterwards had it - I do not know what the value was; it was twelve or fourteen years back - I did not deal with it; I was astonished to find it in my house -I know how it came there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did the lace come into your possession? A. A man brought it to my house to know the value - I told him I did not know the value; Mrs. Smith took it to a customer of ours; he took it to Chambers or Chamberlain, where it was lost from, and he claimed it - I never bought it, nor agreed to buy it; I did not know the value.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I have known Coy ever since he was born. On Saturday, the 5th of February, he came to my shop, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he brought some black cloth, and asked if I would purchase it - I told him I did not want any, but asked to look at it; he untied the handkerchief - I examined it, and found it to be three remnants - I asked what he wanted a yard for it; he asked me 10s.; I said it would not suit me, and that was nearly as much as it was worth - he then asked if I wished to buy any new coats, and told me they belonged to a master tailor, who wanted money, and they were to be sold cheap - I asked what they were; he said one was a very handsome black frock coat, which had a velvet collar, and was faced with velvet in front - I asked what price the person wanted for it; he said 2l. 8s. - I told him it would not suit me, and he went away, taking the things with him; I had not heard of the robbery in Maddox-street at that time - he had not got the coats with him; about an hour after that Mr. Chambers called at my shop and described what he had lost - I gave him information, and about three o'clock Coy came again; he brought no coat - I had previously been to his father's to tell him I wished to see the coats; he came to my shop, and I agreed that he should fetch the coats for me to look at - he promised to be back in half an hour with them, but I saw no more of him till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you cannot be mistaken in his identity? A. No; the cloth might be worth 12s. or 13s - there was a yard and a quarter of inferior, which I said I would give 10s. for.</p>

            . I am a writer and ornamental painter. I have been acquainted with the prisoner Woodward about two years; I do not know his mother, nor where she lived - I never heard from him; I had some conversation with him, about a month ago or rather more, in the street, at the corner of Charles-street and Oxford-street - I met him, and asked if he was going to stand something to drink; he said No, he had got no money - I said how was that, and told him he was gammoning me (he is a tailor, I believe) - I asked if he had any thing to do; he said No, he had done very little for a good while - he said he must get some money somewhere or other very soon, and that he had tried to do something at his mother's, but it was no go, or something to that effect - I said, "Take care you don't get transported;" that is all that passed - this was a week or eight days previous to this robbery - I cannot exactly state the time.</p>

            . I live next door to the empty house in George-street. On Wednesday night, about halfpast twelve o'clock, or rather Thursday morning, I saw a person standing with his back against the door of the empty house, talking to a Policeman - I will not take my oath who it was, but I certainly think it was the prisoner Woodward; I did not know him before - I did not know whether he had any thing to do with the empty house; I only saw him while I was knocking at my own door, and going in with a friend - on the following morning when I heard of the robbery I went to Mr. Chambers' house, and saw the condition of the premises, and the remnants of cloth on the top of the premises they had gone over.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Friday, after the robbery, I went to Woodward's lodging, No. 9, Fulwood's-rents, Holborn - he was at home, and told me they were his lodgings; it was a first floor front room: I asked if his name was Woodward - he said it was; I asked if he had a mother keeping a house in George-street - he said he had: I asked when he saw her last, when he was there - he said he saw her on the Wednesday night about ten o'clock - I asked if he had any objection to inform me where he had been since that time; he said that was his business, not mine, and he should say nothing till he got before the Magistrate; I then took him into custody, searched him, and found 5s. 6d. on him - I then took him to George-street, to the house his mother had been keeping, for Irwing to see him, and then to the office; I found no property - he gave the Magistrate an account where he had been, which was not taken in writing at that time; he said he had been along with a man named Rogers, at No. 28, Great St. Andrew's-street - I went, and ascertained that he had been part of the time with Rogers, who has since absconded; as we went along I told him I was taking him before a Justice - he asked if the house had been broken into in which his mother lived, and whether it had been robbed; I said No, it had not been robbed, but they had gone through that house, I believed, to a house at the back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long before had it been ascertained that this house had been broken? A. On the Thursday, and I took him on the Friday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Ellis made no defence.</p>
               <p>Clifford's Defence. I assure you I was at home on the night of the robbery; I went home about eleven o'clock -I came out next morning, when I was brought out by Ballard - the shoes I was found in possession of I bought where I stated, paying 10s. for them, and if I had perpetrated the act I might have escaped; Mr. Chambers, on my being taken to his house, promised if I would inform him where to find his property, or to bring to justice those who committed the offence, I might take his word, as a gentleman, he would do what he could for me; and afterwards, in the Magistrate's private room, he told me if I would tell him where to find the property, he would not prosecute; in this he was checked by Mr. Conant and the officer, who used every means to draw from me where the property was, but I knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Coy's Defence. I called at Mr. Toft's, George-street, Hampstead-road, on the night of the robbery, respecting a parcel he wished me to take to the City, to go to his son on board the Duke of Sussex, off Gravesend. I went there with a young man named Cummings; we got to Toft's about ten o'clock, supped there, and did not leave the house till twenty minutes to twelve - I brought the parcel away with me, went home to bed, got up next morning twenty minutes before eight, took the parcel into the City, and called at Alexander's music-shop, which supplied the ship with music, to ask a young man if the vessel had left Gravesend; he said if I went to Phillips', the agent of the ship, he could inform me - I went to the East India-house; the porter said he had not come, and directed me to a man whom I could not find; I went to the Steam-packet office, paid 3d., and had the parcel booked - I asked the young man there if the ship had left Gravesend; he said he could not tell. but if it had, the parcel would be returned, as he had another one in the same way - I left, and was going to Toft's to tell him the parcel would be returned if the ship had left; I had to pass Ellis' door, and accidentally called to ask him how he was, and he asked me to sell the cloth and kerseymere, which I did - he went with me, and waited till I came out of Smith's, and I gave him the money, which I received of Smith - I have the young man at the music-shop to prove I was there.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. Goddard stated that he had found two coats in the hand-basket covered with crumpets, which is false; he took me to the office, opened the basket, and found the coats - be found eight crumpets in my pocket, which I was going to take home to tea; he took four from me, and gave me the rest - he put the crumpets into the basket himself.</p>

            . There were some crumpets in the basket, and some in his pocket; I think about eight in all - he said he had them from Gust, who had given them to him to eat.</p>
               <p>Thompson in continuation. On the fourth examination Ellis admitted that he gave me the two coats to sell for him - I have been in the habit of going to his house several times; they have bought upwards of 5l. worth of hardware and cutlery of me, and said they should want more - I called at the house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Gast's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen. - I have very little to say in answer to this charge, in which it seems I am supposed to be implicated, because Ellis is my son-in-law, having an apartment in my house; that he had so, I do not deny, but I had no knowledge of any property being there that did not belong to himself, much less any that had been improperly come by, and when it is considered that three small pieces of black cloth, and those lying on the drawers, are all that were found in that apartment, or in any other part of my house, I rely that your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170022"></xptr>Lordship and the Jury will readily conceive that I had no knowledge of the transaction that has been discovered. I have not had the slightest participation in any portion of it, or any of the property stolen, and I trust, a tradesman like myself, who has borne all his life a good character, will not be found guilty of any crime upon such evidence only, as applies to me in this case.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You passed from half-past nine till nearly half-past twelve o'clock in his company - where were you before that? A. At Mr. Barnet's public-house, North-street. Tottenham-court-road - I was there from eight o'clock; Coy joined me soon after nine; I have known him for ten years - I am a bricklayer; he is a military cap-maker - there were three or four persons in my company at Barnet's; nobody went to Toft's with us - Toft and his wife were there; we staid till nearly twelve; I knew Toft before - he was not exactly an acquaintance, but I have been to his house a number of times; I went that night, because Coy asked me to accompany him, and as I had nothing to do, I went merely to keep him company - nobody was with us; nobody joined our company coming back; I am no relation of Coy's, nor connected by marriage with him.</p>

            . I am the prisoner Clifford's sister, and live at No. 53, Cirencester-place. I recollect his being taken into custody - I recollect the evening of Mr. Chambers' robbery - it was Wednesday; he came in at eleven o'clock that night, and did not go out again till ten the following morning - he slept in the second floor back room: we do not occupy the whole house - my mother lodges there with me; I am sure he did not leave the house that night - the officers who searched the place are aware that he could not leave without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not? A. He would have to go through the room I sleep in if he did; there are only two rooms on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170023"></xptr>floor, but he cannot get into his room without coming through mine; it is the same room as mine - he slept in the same room with me - he was not with me long, and we were making shift for a short time.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How many floors are there in the house? A. Three, and two rooms on each; my brother slept in my room that night, and my mother also - it is not a very large room; there are only two beds in it - they are single beds; they are what are called covered bedsteads, turned up in the day - my brother had been in the habit of sleeping there, and I and my mother also; it had been a common thing for the last fortnight; he had slept in the same room with us for the whole fortnight; before that we were differently situated, as I was in business - I had a shop and apartment - I had left them and taken this apartment; I have lodged there for three months, but my brother had only been with me a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us where he had been sleeping before that time? A. He was not with us before that; he was not at liberty, he was in trouble - he came home as soon as he got at liberty, and I will answer for every hour of his conduct since; I can give an account of wherever he has been during that fortnight, at night, and for the day also, because he never went out, except he went on business for me, or that we knew where he did go; when we sent him any where we knew where we had sent him, and when he returned he accounted for the time he had been gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house besides yourself, your mother, and brother? A. A young person who was at work for me - her name is 
               <persName id="t18310217-13-person288">
                  Emma

            ; she is a stay-maker - that is my business; she slept up stairs, in the back attic - there were a great number of other people in the house, but they knew nothing of our affairs; when my brother came in that night my mother and Emma Adams were in the room - I was at work, making stays, but put it down to let him in; my mother was not doing any thing - she is sixty-one years old; Adams was at work in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you said, when first examined, that the prisoner must necessarily go through your room to another - now you tell us that he slept in the same room? A. So he must go through the room I sleep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he slept in it? A. Yes, and of course he must come through it to go out; the beds were in the room we sleep in - we have only one room on that floor; my mother and I slept in one bed - the prisoner came in at eleven o'clock that night; he had gone out about four - I did not go with him; I only know where he went by what he told me; he told me he had been to the New-cut, and I had sent him to the New-cut to buy some steels - I gave him half a sovereign to buy them with, and he returned without them; I asked for the money - he told me he had given it for a pair of shoes, which I scolded him for; I had supped when he came back, and so had the rest of us- we seldom take supper, but I took a crust of bread and butter that night; my mother took no supper, nor Adams either - my brother most likely went to bed without supper, for he is in the habit of doing so; I cannot tell whether he had any, I was minding my work - if he had supper he did not lay a cloth for it; he breakfasted with us next morning, and was made a prisoner at ten o'clock, in the room - I was in the act of scolding him for buying the shoes when the officers came; I do not know what sort they were - I only saw them on his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shoes or boots? A. They were up to his ancles. I believe.</p>

            . I am the mother of the last witness, and of the prisoner - we live in Cirencester-place. The prisoner had lived with us for about a fortnight before the officer took him - I live with my daughter; I recollect the circumstance of my son being taken; I heard of Mr. Chamber's robbery - my son came home on that night, (Wednesday,) as near as I can say, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, because after eleven there is no admittance to the house without making a greatnoise with the bells - every person answers their own bell; I recollect his coming home - he slept in the same room with us; we made a convenience to have him sleep in the same room with my daughter and me - he went to bed, and did not leave the house till after breakfast the next morning; I cannot say the hour, but it was after breakfast - I have not the least reason to suppose that he left the house from the time he went to bed till after breakfast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the prisoner been living in that house? A. It might be about a fortnight, over or under - we were not long there ourselves; we were there before he came - we moved in, I think, on the 17th of November; I and my daughter moved there - Emma Adams is in the habit of coming occasionally to assist my daughter - she does not live with us; my son slept in the same room with me and my daughter every night during the fortnight - I would not permit him to have a lodging till we all removed together: when my daughter had work to do in a hurry, Adams would stay perhaps all night to be ready in the morning - when she staid she continued at her work; she has not slept there since we have been in that house - she often did at the other house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she staid and worked during the night? A. Yes, my daughter was pressed for work at this time, but Adams did not stay there the whole night; I went to bed and left her at work - she never slept in that house to my knowledge; there are three or four different families live in this house, but none of my family but myself and daughter have any apartment there - we rent but one room, and pay 3s. 6d. a week for that one room, and for a few old things being in the kitchen; my daughter went down to let my son in that night, and so did I - I heard the bell ring, and did not know she was gone before me; I saw him come in, and saw him go to bed - I never have any supper; I do not know whether the others had - I believe they had a cup of tea in the dead of the night, to keep their eyes open; my son had no supper, for he went to bed before me - I left the girls at work; he did not get up early next morning, just in time to have breakfast; we breakfast between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he came in between ten and eleven o'clock, how long had he been absent? A. I really cannot say, I believe it was after tea that he went out - he drank tea with us about five o'clock, went out after tea, and was absent during the rest of the time; he was at home all the morning, I believe, but I am out and in on my daughter's business - I was at home all Wednesday morning, and so was he; he was not out in the fore part of the day at all.</p>

            . I am a stay-maker. I know Mrs. Clifford, her daughter, and the prisoner - they live in Cirencester-place; I heard of a robbery at Mr. Chambers' the beginning of this month - I remember the prisoner Clifford being taken up on the Friday; I have come to speak of what occurred on the Wednesday night - I was at Mrs. Clifford's all day on Wednesday; I am acquainted with Miss Clifford - we worked in the same shop for two years; I recollect the prisoner coming home that night - I cannot say at what time exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time? A. Between eight and nine o'clock - he had been out once or twice during the day; he came home between eight and nine, or I think not so late- it was about eight; I do not recollect his going to bed that night - I staid there till it turned twelve o'clock, and left him in the room; I left him up, I am sure of that - it had turned twelve o'clock; I had to go home as far as Little Chesterfield-street, and it was near one when I got home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been there much for some time before? A. Yes, working for Miss Clifford - I had been there for the last month, but not regularly every day, because I work for a shop; I always go home to my lodgings - sometimes I go about eleven o'clock, sometimes twelve; I frequently staid late, as when I went to her it was always in a great hurry, and I always staid till the work was finished - I always went home; I had seen the prisoner for a fortnight before, when I was there; there were two beds in the room, but only one bedstead - the other bed was piled upon chairs; the bedstead was a shut up one - he was out once or twice during the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he had been out when he came back in the evening? A. He did not go out till after tea - we drank tea between five and six o'clock; he came home about eight - I did not hear him say where he had been.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know where he was going? A. I believe I heard his sister send him to her other sister, Mrs. Davies, in Chapel-street, Soho, to borrow some money, I think - I did not see any money given him by his mother or sister; Mrs. Clifford was up when I went away - that was about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock; the prisoner was up, and so was Miss Clifford.</p>
               <p>MR. CHAMBERS. I have looked at the whole of the property produced to-day, and have not the least doubt of its being all mine - one piece of the kerseymere I cannot swear to, but I believe it to be mine; every one of the others have something which I can swear to them by.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you any private-mark on the broad cloth? A. I have the headings, attached to which is the list, and that corresponds; neither of the blue cloths are of the best quality - one cost me 17s. 6d. a yard, and the other 21s. 6d.</p>

            . I noticed two or three stitches on the side of the boot being dropped, and this boot is so.</p>

            . When Clifford stated that he gave 10s. for the shoes, I asked who gave him the money, and he said his mother gave it to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you state this to the Magistrate? A. I stated it to the clerk - it was not read over in my deposition; I should not have thought of it if I had not heard the witness make her statement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clifford. It was said at Marlborough-street that the articles stolen were hawked about for sale at different public-houses, and is it not as likely that I should have bought them at the Three Compasses, as at any other place? I did not say I bought them in the skittle-ground; it is false; the shoes it is said are too large for me, and have marks of being worn by a person with corns or bunions - I should wish the Jury to examine the shoes I have on now; I have worn them a fortnight. Mr. Chambers employs a great many men, and they, I believe, are in the habit of wearing slippers - might not the shoes have been left behind by some of them?</p>

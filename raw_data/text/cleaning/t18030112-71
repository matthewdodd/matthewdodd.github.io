               <p>EDWARD LEES sworn. - I am serjeant of the first regiment of soot guards; the prisoner is in my company, and has been upwards of seven years; I called the roll over on the 25th of December, at Portman-street barracks, a quarter before nine, when I saw Clarke somewhat in liquor, but not so much so as he affected to be; I saw a chain of a watch hanging out, and knew he had no watch of his own at that time; at nine o'clock I went to deliver the report, and saw the prosecutor, who complained of having lost a watch, which Thomas Clarke had taken; I went back, and found Clarke half undressed; I told him to put on his shoes, which he was about to do, and stooping down, I observed him convey something not to his own bed, but to one four or five yards off; I immediately took it up, and found it to be a watch, which I have here. (Prisuces it, and identified.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live at Ratcliff-cross Stairs. The prisoner was my apprentice—about the 9th of December he had been absent for a time—on the 17th of December he got up in the morning, and I missed a pair of boots—on the 14th of January his brother brought him to me—I said, "What have you done with the boots?"—he said, "I have sold them for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a shop at the top of Rag-fair"—I said, "Should you know that shop again?"—he said, "Yes"—they were worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they were not new ones, but were newly soled and heeled—these are them.</p>

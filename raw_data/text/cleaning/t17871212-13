            ; and when he came I called the prisoner into the parlour, and said, Rachel, I am very sorry I have to speak to you on the subject I am going to do; she says, what is that? I said, I have reason to suspect you are dishonest; says she, what makes you think so? I never took any thing that was your's in my life; I said, I have reason to think that you have; says she, who has told you any thing? I said, it is no matter who has told me any thing; I have reason to suspect it, and I am sure you have, and I must insist now on looking into your box, which she seemingly readily complied with; we went to go up stairs; the young woman ran to go before, I called to her, Rachel, stop; let us all go up together; she readily unlocked her box, and the first thing that were presented to view, were the two sauce boats; she was going to take them out; I took the things out of the box, and gave them to the officer; my wife owned the things that were her property, and they were given to the beadle; he has them now in his possession; when all the things were taken out of the box, we came down into the dining-room; I wrote down on a piece of paper the different articles the girl had taken; then the beadle took them into his possession, and the girl to the watch-house; when the prisoner went before the Justice, she signed a paper, and made her mark to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said to her before she put her mark to that writing? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Was any promise of any kind made to her? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Any threat? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Was it read to her? - It was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120032"></xptr>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Who guided her hand to make the mark? - The clerk.</p>
               <p>The woman did not know what was doing? - She heard what was read over; it was read very distinctly, and in the presence of the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Had not you said before that, come, Rachel, confess all, and you shall not be hurt? - I never said any such thing. (Shewn to him.) I swear I saw her mark it.</p>
               <p>And you can swear that is the paper you saw her make her mark to? - I can.</p>
               <p>Did you witness it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Is not that your hand writing there? - It is not here.</p>
               <p>You said you witnessed it just now? - No; I did not say I set my hand to it.</p>
               <p>What is there particular in her mark? - A cross.</p>
               <p>You know her mark pretty well if I am not misinstructed? - On the other side there is my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Were the very words taken down? - It was put down that she acknowledged to the things; I cannot particularly say, whether the Justice signed that or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. So this young woman had lived five or six months in your family? Yes.</p>
               <p>And she came to you with a very good character; and kept it till the good woman was in the straw? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>That is a time when good servants, pretty ones particularly, lose their characters, and at that time you began to have a little matter of suspicion? - I was uneasy in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Of course there was a nurse in the house? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>The nurse is always a gossip; did not the nurse tell some nonsensical stories about you and Rachel; it was very natural for the master and Rachel to have slanderous things said of them when the good woman laid in? - I do not know I am sure, I am sure I do not.</p>
               <p>Indeed you do? - I insist upon it I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not be positive; there was a new guinea of a new coinage received in the shop while the good woman was in the straw? - Very probable; my shop is a retail shop.</p>
               <p>Did not the nurse say, that Rachel had that new guinea? - Not that I know of; I never heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Did not the nurse say it? - I know it is not true.</p>
               <p>But they will say things of poor women; that you and Rachel were walking arm in arm in Covent Garden together? - I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>In a word, did not the nurse tell some nonsensical stories that made the good woman a little matter jealous? - There was an uneasiness in my mind.</p>
               <p>No curtain lectures about it? - Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>When you got Rachel into the parlour, did not you say, if you will confess you shall not be hurt? - I never said such a syllable, nor such a word, nor a word like it.</p>
               <p>Where were these things kept that you found? - They were kept in a row where my wife was.</p>
               <p>In the room where she lay in? - Certainly, the most part.</p>
               <p>In what part of the room? - There was a chest of drawers and another large chest in the room.</p>
               <p>The nurse in course was pretty generally in that room? - She was frequently there.</p>
               <p>Were these things there when your wife was brought to bed? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But Rachel, till the down-laying bore a very good character? - Yes; she did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did that young woman ever hint anything of that sort before? - Never; I mean to say, that I never heard such a thing mentioned till now in this court.</p>

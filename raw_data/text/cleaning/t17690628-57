I asked him how he came by that malt. His answer was, a man at St. Catherine's Stairs's had hired him to carry it down to Cherry Garden. I asked him to whose house; he said he did not know, but there was a man waiting there for it. After some prevarications I told him he must expect no favour; he was the first I had caught, and I having been robbed several times, I would punish him. At last he said, It is a folly to deny it, the fact is too plain, and go I must, and I'll tell you the truth. He then said, It is your malt; I stole it out of your barge. I'll go with you and shew you which barge it is. He went with me in the same boat, and shewed me the particular place in the barge where he took them from, and there they were missing.

At the time More was committed, he sent Mr. Segwick down to his house, and told him this sack was upon the top of his house. I heared Harris confess that he stole this sack.</p>

            . I am a constable for the parish of Mile-End. On the first of June I had a warrant to search the house of More. The door was fastened, a person with me saw a door open, and he got in and catched More getting over a wall from his back yard. Then I began to search. I found nothing in the lower room or the chamber. In the garret we found five bushels of rye in a sack. There was a mark upon it, but no name. We took More to Sir

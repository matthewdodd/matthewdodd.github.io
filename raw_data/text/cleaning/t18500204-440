                  </hi>. I live at 14, Pearson-street, in the parish of Shoreditch. The prisoner was my servant, and left about a week before Christmas, saying she had broken her arm; but I have found out that that was not the case—on 17th Jan., about twelve o'clock, she came to see the children, and left between five and six—next morning my man brought in from my chopping-house a box which had contained my money—I imme<lb></lb>diately missed the box, which I had seen safe six weeks before, containing four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes and two sovereigns—we found the prisoner that evening at home, in Sidney-street, Commercial-road, where her mother and sister lived—the officer went in first in plain clothes, and let me in—I said, "Ann, you have robbed me"—she said, "Me! I have not done such a thing"—I told the officer to search—she said to him, "Officer, can I speak to my master?"—h said, "You can if I am present"—she said, "I hope you will not hurt me if I give you up the money?"—I said, "I will be as lenient as I can to you with the Court"—she gave me ten sovereigns and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it to the officer—I saw him search the cupboard—the prisoner and her sisters were all huddled together round the cupboard—I searched the cupboard, and found in it these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I identified, having told the officer the numbers of them before—the box had been kept in another in my bed<lb></lb>room, which I found still locked—somebody must have unlocked it and locked it again.</p>

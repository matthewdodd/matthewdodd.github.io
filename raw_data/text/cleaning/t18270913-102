On the 14th of August, I was on duty at the top of King-street, and saw Yowband and another woman running up a turning; the prosecutor came up and said "They have got my watch,""Which?" said I - "Those two women" said he. I ran and took Yowband in Bird-in-hand-court. I brought her back, and he said, "You have got my watch;" she said,"You know what I have got." I said, "If you have got it, give it him;" she then said she had not got it - he gave charge of her, and I took her to the watch-house, She then said she had given it to a woman named Smith, whom I went to take, but could not find. I cannot swear who was the other woman that was with her.</p>

I went and found Smith's husband in bed, but she was not there; next morning, I went to Hall's, in Vine-street, and found this duplicate and a snuff-box.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>DAVID JONES. I reside at Peckham, but when in London, at No. 15, Size-lane. On the afternoon of the 26th of November, I was going through a little passage leading from <placeName id="t18311201-200-crimeloc1070">St. Michael's-alley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the prisoner in the watch-house afterwards? A. Yes; I did not then say that I knew him by his swivel eye; I said by the cast in his eye - there was a great rush of people about me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long had you had him in hold? A. I suppose a minute; I had a full opportunity of viewing his face; there was a gas-lamp at the end of the passage, and a hair-dresser's-shop at the corner; I have no doubt of his person.</p>

            . I was in the George and Vulture tavern, in St. Michael's-alley, on the 26th of November, a little after five o'clock; I heard an alarm, and saw the prisoner running - I caught hold of him, and delivered him to Mr. Jones; the prisoner's companions came round me, and gave me a blow on the back of my head - I speedily recovered, and saw them struggling at the corner of the alley; the prisoner dropped his hat, and ran - his companions got between Mr. Jones and him, and they got away; I had such a view of him as to be able to speak to him positively - I should think he was taken within three or four minutes; I had a good observation of him while his hat was off.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Were there many persons passing? A. There were men and boys passing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How many persons were in the street altogether? A. I cannot say, there might be ten or a dozen; it was darkish, but the lamps were lighted - the place was light enough for a person to see; I took hold of the prisoner, and no one else -I did not observe any thing of a cast in his eye; I heard Mr. Jones say something about his eye here, but I never heard him say so before; there were from twelve to twenty persons in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long afterwards did you see the prisoner in the watch-house? A.Immediately as he was brought in.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. It was a gold watch; a gold seal and chain - I should think they were worth 20l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was taken to the watch-house? A. Yes - his hat was brought in, and he owned it; his observation to me was, "I am not the thief;" Mr. Jones was sitting in a chair in the watch-house - the prisoner said, "I am not the man," and Mr. Jones said, "I know you by your swivel eye," or some such observation - the prisoner said he had no cast in his eye, and he appealed to me; I said I had known him for some time, and there was a peculiarity in his eye-sight - there is a fulness about his eyes; they stand rather out - if you have ever seen a person of his description, I should think you would know him again; he was running fast - I had known him for some time.</p>

            . I am an agent for Scotch ale - I live in Cornwall-road, Stamford-street. I have known the prisoner five years; he owed me a little money. On Saturday week last, I met him in Gracechurch-street; I went across the road, and told him I thought he behaved in a very ungrateful manner - we had some angry words, and I told him if he did not pay me the money, or some part of it, I would give him in charge of an officer; I laid hold of him by his breast coat, and he walked with me as far as Bell-yard - he then put up his hand, knocked my hand off, and ran up Bell-yard; I followed him till he came to St. Michael's-alley - there was a crowd, who were hallooing Stop thief! or something of that kind; I saw the prisoner's hat fall from his head as he turned the corner.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Laurel-street, Chelsea; I deal in building materials - I do not know the prisoner. On Saturday evening, the 26th of November, I was with Mr. Hill, a solicitor; we went through Bell-yard, into St. Michael's-alley - there are a great many little alleys and turnings there, and there were a great many people - it was quite light; as I went into St. Michael's-alley there was a crush of people, and I was pushed a little way forward towards the wide part - I heard a gentleman say, "I have lost my watch, Stop thief!" several persons at that time passed me - I seized one, who appeared to be the suspected party - I exclaimed, "Here he is! I have got him!" I was then struck several times - I was struck over the nose, and the man I had hold of got away; he had himself struck me, but I do not know whether he struck me on the nose - he got away from me, and I followed him as well as I could; I dare say a dozen persons at least followed with me - I had an opportunity by the light of the court of observing the man I caught hold of, and I noticed that he had a cross-eye; he looked with one eye towards his nose - his right eye was fixed towards his nose, it was a squint; the prisoner certainly is not the man I took hold of; when that man got from me he went the way I had come, through the narrow part of St. Michael's-alley, through Bell-yard, and into Gracechurch-street; I followed him to the corner, and there lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a solicitor, and live at No. 119, Fore-street, Cripplegate. I was in company with Mr. Anderson; just as we were coming from the narrow part into the wide part of St. Michael's-alley, Mr. Jones, the prosecutor, called out that he had been robbed of his watch - several people passed at full speed; Mr. Jones followed a person who was running, and a porter in a white apron stopped him, opposite the George and Vulture door - a violent scuffle ensued, and the porter was knocked down; the man he had hold of broke loose, and Mr. Anderson caught at him with one hand - he broke from his hold; he caught him again, and held him nearly half a minute - a scuffle ensued, and several persons struck Mr. Anderson; among the rest the man he had hold of struck him, broke from him, and ran down Bellyard; he then eluded our pursuit round some coaches - we returned back the same way, and heard that a man had been taken in Cornhill, which was the contrary way to that which the man we saw had run - I had observed that that man squinted; he had a strong cast in his eye; there was a gas-lamp over his head, and he turned round under the gas-lamp - I had a full view of his face; the prisoner certainly is not the person.</p>

             BROOMHILL. I am beadle of Whitechapel. I was in the watch-house, and saw Peter Hall there, and Mr. Jones, the prosecutor - I remember Mr. Jones told the prisoner he knew him by his swivel eye - my attention was called to him from that circumstance; I looked at the prisoner's eyes, but I could not perceive it - the prisoner denied any knowledge of Mr. Jones' robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you any thing to do with the apprehension of the prisoner? A. Yes; I took him in Finch-lane, about half-past five o'clock, on Saturday week; a great many persons were following him - I had no knowledge of him before; he had no hat on at the time - I do not recollect seeing any thing of Mr. Harris, Mr. Anderson, or Mr. Hill - I can only recognize Mr. Jones, the ticket-porter, and the street-keeper; the other persons might have been there, and I not see them - there was a rush of people; I saw the prisoner running; I crossed, and took him - he said, "What do you stop me for? I have lost my hat in pursuit of the person;" I did not see him go near any coaches; I do not know who brought the hat in.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. JONES. Q. Did you lose sight of the man after losing your watch? A. I never lost sight of him from the time he took the watch out of my pocket till I was pushed down, after the rescue, and after I had followed him the second time; he lost his hat between the time of the robbery and my losing sight of him in Bellyard - I only lost sight of him, because I could not run<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010096"></xptr>so fast; I was a little agitated, but I should think not more than four or five minutes elapsed from the time I lost my watch till the prisoner was taken - I left my residence at five o'clock, the whole of it was over, and I went home by the six o'clock coach.</p>

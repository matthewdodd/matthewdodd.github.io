I missed a great many things at different times, I never suspected her of taking them; I wanted my gown to put on, I asked her for it; she told me she had forgot to wash it, and she had given it a woman to wash. I went to the woman and asked her if she had got the gown; the woman hesitated to tell whether she had it or not, at last she said the prisoner had been to her and told her that she had forgot to wash it, that she had left it in a tub; she told her, to tell me that she had got it. I then asked the prisoner for the key of her room; she refused to give it me; my husband insisted upon her giving it him. When she was going to give it him, she pulled out something from her pocket and put it into her stays; my husband took hold of her hands and told me to feel in her pocket; I took out eight duplicates of the things that I have got; she absconded; she was afterwards taken.</p>

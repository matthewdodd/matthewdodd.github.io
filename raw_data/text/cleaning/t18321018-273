I heard the prisoner going up stairs about eleven o'clock at night - I was in bed on the second-floor, and said, "Joe, is that you?" he said Yes - I heard him open the door of the room this property was in; and as he came down, seeing a light through the crack of the door, I said, "How is it you have a light?" as we never allow one - he said he had been to take some things up stairs, and in about an hour I heard of the robbery - when Hoskins was taken, he said he gave the property to Baker to sell, in Field-lane - I had seen the watch that evening, and had it in my hand - six handkerchiefs were missing from a lumber-room, opposite the room the watch was in.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. I am a constable. On the 26th of October, I was standing behind a brick clump, and saw the prisoner come by with a bundle on his head - I asked what that was, and I found it was wet linen; he said he was going to a brick clump for a pair of trousers - I took him; he was about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's - it was about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

This property was hanging to dry at my house; here are two sheets, a counterpane, and a shawl - I hung them out at three o'clock in the afternoon, and missed them at seven; I never saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was crossing by the back of the White Conduit-house - I picked up this bundle, and said I would take it to a Policeman, but I could not see one till I came to Liverpool-road, when I saw two Policemen going behind the clump with two girls; I went to get a pair of trousers, which had been given me by a lady, but they were not quite dry - I told the Policeman I found these things.</p>

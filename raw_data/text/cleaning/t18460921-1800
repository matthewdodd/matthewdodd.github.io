                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at Mr. Gurney's, the Coachmaker's Arms, Marylebone. On Monday, the 17th of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was in the bar, attending to customers—(the prisoner came to the bar, and asked for a glass of spruce—I served him—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign—I examined it—I found it was a good one, and gave him six half-crowns, four shillings, two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and four halfpence—he drank the spruce, and asked me if I could give him a half-sovereign instead of the silver—I gave him a good half-sovereign and he gave me four half-crowns—he then said he had some halfpence and wanted 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and putting 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had given him, asked me for a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—in doing that his hand came near to where the half-sovereign was lying—it was on the same part of the counter—I gave him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece for the halfpence—he then asked me to give him silver for the half-sovereign, which was then lying on the counter—I looked at it, and it was not the same I had given him—it was a bad one—it was much darker in colour, and had a smoother appearance than the one I had given him—I can swear it wai not the same—I said it was bad—he denied it being bad, he snatched it off the counter and left the house as soon as possible—the Sun and Sportsman in High-street is not more than ten minute's walk from our bouse.</p>

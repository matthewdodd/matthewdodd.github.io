                  </hi>. I am a wax an tallow chandler, in Lime-street. On Saturday, the 15th of October, at about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if Mr. Beach was at house—I said "Yes, he is; my name is Beach"—he then handed me this note—it was folded, but had no seal or wafer—I read the note—he said it came from Mr. Harris—I turned the leaf over, thinking the cheque might be on the other side, but I found no cheque there (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"60, Fenchurch-street, 15th October, 1836—Dear Sir, I have just purchased a horse of the bearer, it is too late for him to get the cheque cashed at my banker's—if you will do it, or get it done for him, you will oblige, yours, Charles Harris"—I asked the prisoner if he had the cheque with him—he said yes, he had, but he did not produce it—I then said to him I was very sorry, but I could not accommodate Mr. Harris at that moment, having paid my cash in to my banker's and all that I had in the house, in the shape of money, was a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a few sovereigns—(Mr. Harris is a medical man, and has attended my family for some time)—the prisoner asked me if I would write Mr. Harris a note to that effect—I</p>

               <p>I did so, and handed it to the prisoner—at that time I had no suspicion of it being a forgery—I was not acquainted with Mr. Harris's hand-writing—as the prisoner was going out, he said, "It is of no consequence, I am going to Gravesend in the morning, but it will detain me a few hours"—the next morning would be Sunday—that observation caused me to sus<lb></lb>pect something was wrong, and I gave my shop-boy, William king, directions to follow the prisoner—the boy soon returned, and in consequence of what he said, I immediately called on Mr. Harris, but he was not at home—when I did see him, I communicated what had taken place, and showed him the note—on the Monday morning, at about eleven o'clock, I was sent for by Mr. Harris—when I got there, I saw the prisoner, and said, "That is the man that presented the note to me on Saturday morning"—I am not aware that the prisoner made any reply—I have not the least doubt of his being the same man.</p>

I am one of the cashiers in the house of William Esdaile and others, Mr. Harris was a customer of ours in October last—on Monday, the 17th of October, this cheque was produced at our house, about eleven o'clock in the morning, by the prisoner—I passed round the counter and said, "Have you presented this for payment?" He said, "I did," (a communication had previously been made to our house by Mr. Harris)—I informed the prisoner he must accompany me to Mr. Harris, the drawer of the draft—he did not offer any opposition—he accompanied me—I took him by the arm, but not to use any violence—we went towards Fenchurch-street—our banking-house is in Lombard-street—we went in a direction away from Smithfield—after going some distance, the prisoner said, "I hope you will not detain me long, for the coach leaves town in five minutes, and I am going by it"—I expressed my regret, but said he must accompany me—in Fenchurch-street he said, "Had we not better return to Smith<lb></lb>field, that I may endeavour to find out the person who gave me the draft?"—that was the first time I heard him mention Smithfield—I said, no,</p>

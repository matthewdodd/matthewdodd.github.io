                  </hi>I am a labourer. I was at the Inverness Arms pub<lb></lb>lic-house at the latter end of July last—I saw the prisoner in the tap-room in the morning—I had slept there that night—he asked me what o'clock it was—I took out my watch—he said, "I should like to have that watch, it is a handsome watch, I would give a sovereign for it"—I afterwards went to a friend's house, the prisoner followed me and my wife and two females—we afterwards went to another public-house—the prisoner sat on one side of me, and my wife and another woman on the other side—I was fatigued after a long journey, so I put my hand to my head, laid down and went to sleep—when I awoke, the prisoner and my watch were gone—I spoke about it—he was taken the next morning in the same public-house where I had met him first, but my watch was not found—he was remanded twice and then discharged—he was afterwards taken again, and my watch was found at the pawnbroker's—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the two seals were gold, but they are gone—I had had the watch nine or ten years—I am sure it is mine.</p>

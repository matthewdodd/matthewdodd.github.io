                  </hi>. I live in Crab Tree-row. About ten minutes to eight o'clock on that evening, I was coming with Croucher, and saw six boys look<lb></lb>ing into the prosecutor's shop—the smallest of them went in twice, and brought the glass out the second time—the other five were standing at the corner of the gardens, watching—the prisoners are two of them—M'Carthy was at the window, and Martin received the glass from the little boy—they then went down Cooper's-gardens—I went in and told the young man—they were taken the next morning—I new them again—I had seen them before, and am sure they are them.</p>

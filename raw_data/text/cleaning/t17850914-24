               <p>Prosecutor. These are the handkerchiefs that the black brought, some we charge at three shillings, and these eleven linen handkerchiefs were thrown down an area where she ran by; they were in the shop when she was in it, I put them in the window in the morning myself.</p>

               <p>Did you see these handkerchiefs in the shop at that time? - No, not at that time, I saw them in the morning, I did not miss them at that moment, I suspected her, and I kept her in suspence as long as I could, till somebody came into the shop; she told the price of some lawn, I told her it was two shillings and two-pence; she asked me to take two shillings. I told her I would cut her half a yard for one shilling; she went out of the shop, and my master brought her back, and she went away again, and the black brought the handkerchiefs.</p>

She asked me to carry that bundle to Darkhouse-lane, and she would give me a shilling; she said she had to call at Fenchurch-street. I went with the bundle. Some of these watchmen stopped me: they let the woman escape: I saw her put her hand in her pocket, whether to give them any thing or not, I do not know. I said to the officer of the night, I do not know what is in the bundle, the woman has escaped, he said, I must take you to the compter, says I, I am very agreeable to go to the compter, I was brought before my Lord Mayor on the Monday, I said, I hope you will advertise, that the owners of the property may be found, and my innocence found, the next morning Box the constable and three women came to the Compter, and told me, if I could make them up the value of eight or ten pounds I should be cleared, I told them I could not, then says one of them, we shall have the reward.</p>
               <p>Court to Box. Is that true? - No, the first day he went very easy.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to the Compter? - I went with Mr. Tisdale, they knew him by living in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Court to Box. Who went to the Compter? - Mr. Quick and these three women.</p>

               <p>When you was at the Compter, did Box propose to him as he says, that if money was advanced to him, he should be got off.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Skinner, on Monday the 15th, in the morning, I found the ware-house doors open, I took particular care to lock it on Monday, on Tuesday morning I found it open again, and while we were looking about, the patrol came and asked if we had lost any tobacco, we could not miss that particularly.</p>
               <p>(The tobacco produced by the constable.)</p>
               <p>Constable. I have had it at the watch-house ever since.</p>
               <p>Brooks. It is damaged tobacco, and over pressed, it has laid a long while with us, and it is dry.</p>
               <p>Wilson. I swear to the tobacco, it was a particular hogshead that we could not manufacture, it was not to the sample, it was rather damaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140143"></xptr>But there might have been other damaged tobacco? - Yes, but it has gone through my hands so often, that I am clear in this tobacco, I could have said it was his tobacco if there were fifty hogsheads.</p>
               <p>Do you know the bag? - I know particularly well moving that tobacco, and I covered it with that bag; I know the bag going through my hands so many times, but there is no particular mark, I cannot swear to the bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Council. You say very fairly you cannot swear to the bag? - No.</p>
               <p>If you had seen this unmanufactured tobacco, where it might have been mixed with a great many other casks, would you have ventured to swear this to be your master's? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>You might distinguish this from that which was not damaged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what does this differ from any other hogshead of damaged tobacco? - There might be some like it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had fifty bags of them, I cannot swear to the bags, I know the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Skinner, I shall not despair after this, to hear a man swear to a tumbler of water; be so good as to give some reasons to the Jury? - This tobacco was sent to me on the 15th of November, and opened in the month of November, and there it has laid ever since, and there is never a manufacturer in London would keep this tobacco so long in the state I have done; I can swear to it among twenty hogsheads, I certainly know it as well as if it was a fixture to my house, and marked.</p>
               <p>Now you argue that no other manufacturer in London would have kept it in that state? - Because it is an article they use more than I do; this is a tobacco for snuff, I have more of this sort than I could use.</p>
               <p>Will you undertake to swear this is not Fletcher and Yeates's? - No, it was not, because it was in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>I do not like to treat a man of character, as I am obliged to treat you; do you know, of your own knowledge, that it is not Fletcher and Yeates's; their warehouse as I recollect, is within two or three hundred yards of your place? - No, it is more than that.</p>
               <p>I ask you as a man of conscience, knowing that they had at that time tobacco of that sort, can you say it was not this? - This is dry.</p>
               <p>Do you know theirs was not dry? - I do not.</p>
               <p>For all you know, they might have had some precisely like this? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>I do believe that you have the most conscientious persuasion it is your tobacco? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I will be bound for it you have; but I must advert to my old course, I see there is no discriminating; will you venture to swear that is your tobacco? - I will.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, in what does that differ from the tobacco, which you know was in possession of Fletcher and Yeates? - Because the case was packed up loose.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I know this tobacco by the quality of it, I believe it to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Supposing a man had been found with this tobacco, at the warehouse of Fletcher and Yeates, could you have sworn then it was Mr. Skinner's? - No Sir, no such thing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming along, and a person asked me to take this to Islington for a shilling, they had some in a handkerchief, and they asked me to put some into my pocket, he was a stranger to me; I asked him his name, and he told me his name was Farmer, I could not rightly tell, but I was glad to earn a shilling, I am as innocent as a child.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I live in Villers-street, Strand. On the 1st of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18170917-166-crimeloc838">Norfolk-street, in the Strand</placeName>

I saw three men behind me. About a minute after, I saw a man on the opposite side of the way, lay hold of another-at the same time, immediately before me, another man was laid hold of, they were the prisoners. I saw the one on the other side of the way throw something from him-it was the prisoner, Hanshill. He was broughht over to me, and I accused him of taking my handkerchief; I missed it it was produced. The prisoners are two of the men I had seen following me - I looked them in the face.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I saw Mr. Dickinson, and another gentleman, going up the Strand. I watched the prisoners and another man for ten minutes before they followed Mr. Dickinson. I saw Hanshill go before the other two, nearer to Mr. Dickinson; they looked round two or three times, and attempted his pocket. I got on the other side of the way, and saw Hanshill take the handkerchief out; the other two were close behind him, to prevent his being seen; he turned round, spoke to them, and made off over the way. I seized him; the handkerchief was in his hand, he threw it away-Thompson came and picked it up. The other man got away-Forbes seized Stanfield.</p>

Mr. Dickinson and his friend came by, and they followed them. I saw Hanshill go up; the other leaned over to conceal him, as if his hand was in Mr. Dickinson's pocket; I was on the other side of the way, farther off than Guy. I saw Hanshill run over the way, Guy laid hold of him; the handkerchief fell from his hand, and I picked it up.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, on the 2nd of Aug., I was in Plumtree-street, St. Giles's, in the act of taking some silver out of my waistcoat pocket, as there were a few holes in it, I was putting the silver into my purse, when Lloyd came down bv my side, and snatched the purse out of my hand—it contained eight half sove<lb></lb>reigns and one sovereign, which I had been hoarding up for some time—she ran down the street—I was running after her for about seven yards, when Seager came and threw me down.</p>

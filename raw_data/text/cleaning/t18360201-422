I was in Leadenhall-street—I saw both the prisoners for about two minutes—I saw the prosecutor passing, and Donohue took the white handkerchief from his pocket, and was handing it to Day—I ran across and laid hold of them—the gentleman took up the handkerchief—Day was holding out his hand to receive it, when the other took it—they were both connected—they appeared to have one common purpose.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Friday-street. On the 23rd of Set<lb></lb>tember I met the prisoner and another woman near St. Bride's church, Fleet-street, at half-past twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner spoke to me—I do not remember what she said—she began hustling and pulling me about—I pushed her away—she would not go—I crossed the road—she came to me again, and put her arm round me—I pushed her away again—she then ray away—I missed my watch when she was gone—I took the other woman, who was in company with her—I went the next morning to a house in Shire-lane—the prisoner saw me, and ran backwards into the privy—she came out, and I gave her in charge—I have never seen the watch since.</p>

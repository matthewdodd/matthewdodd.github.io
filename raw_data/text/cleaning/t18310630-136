On the morning of the 22nd of June, at halfpast one o'clock, I was going to my lodgings, and saw the prisoner talking to some man; the man then left her - she came and asked me to go with her; I refused - she still kept talking to me, and said she wanted to speak a word to me - I stopped a minute, and she put her hand up to my breast, and took my pin out of my handkerchief; I accused her of taking the pin - she denied it: the Police-constable came up - I told him she had taken the pin; he took her to the watch-house, and took this pin, which is mine, from the back of her gown.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of a pin - I took her to the station, and found this pin in the back of her gown; she denied that night that she had had it, but she said the next morning she could not think what could induce her to do it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is quite false - I never said such a thing, Witness. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had taken her to a house of ill-fame, and given her 5s., which he afterwards wanted back, and gave her in charge, but that he must have placed the pin in her gown himself.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HOSIER. I did not enter any house with her, nor ask her to go.</p>

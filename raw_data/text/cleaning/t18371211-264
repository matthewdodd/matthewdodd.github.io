                  </hi>. I am a publisher and printseller, in partnership with Richard Hodgson, in Pall-mall. On the 8th of December I received in formation, and missed nine copper plates and one steer plate, which I had had in my possession—they were for a work of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in the course of publication—they would cost upwards of one hundred guineas to replace—from information I received, I went to Mr. Morris, in Holy well-street, Strand, and found the plates there—that was last Friday, the 8th of December—I have no recollection of the prisoner—the plates had been returned from the printer on the 5th of December, and the last time I saw them they were lying on the counter in my shop.</p>

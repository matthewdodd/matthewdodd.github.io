I looked over into Rhodes' fields, and saw a great number of people; the prisoner and two others came out of the gate; I seized the prisoner, and he knocked me down; I got up, and pursued: I caught him again in about a hundred yards from the place, and kept him - he called for assistance, and one of the other two had a large stick, which he was about to strike me with; I took out my staff, and when they saw that, the other two ran away: I saw what I believed to be a hundful of skeleton keys thrown into the river by the prisoner; he said, "Take them," and threw them up - they all spread, and went into the river; I found this screw-driver on him.</p>

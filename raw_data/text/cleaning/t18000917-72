               <p>Q. Who provides them? - A. My mistress, and they are all delivered into my care; they have never been found since; we described him to the different inn-keepers; I saw him about a week after, at the White-hart, in the Borough; I knew him again immediately; I was in conversation with him some time, and I am very sure he is the same man; my mistress was with me when I apprehended him, and when he saw me, he put his handkerchief before his face, and blinded his eyes; he had a blue apron on like a gardener, when he came to our house, and there was such an apron found upon him when he was taken.</p>

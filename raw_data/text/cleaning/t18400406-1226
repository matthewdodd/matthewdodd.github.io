                  </hi>. I live at Cock Foster, near East Barnet. I met the prisoner Rees at the Green Man tavern, at Barnet, and Peat was with her—it was on a Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock—I was sober—Rees asked me to give her some drink, which I did, and then she asked if I would go with heir—I said I did not mind—we went to the footpath that leads over to Barnet—we left Peat in the house—I had then two half-crowns, two shillings, and three halfpence in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket—I gave Rees 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and while I was with her I felt her hand feel<lb></lb>ing about my pocket, and immediately I missed my money—I took hold of her, and intended to give her to a policeman, but I could not see one—Peat then came up, rescued her from me, and knocked me down with his fist—he said, "You accuse her of the money"—he gave me a blow in the eye—he took her away, and went away—a policeman came up and took them.</p>

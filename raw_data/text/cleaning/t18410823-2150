                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street, and am in the employ of John Warner and Sons, brass-founders, in Jewin-crescent. The witness Dedross was in their employ—on the 3rd of August I found two brass, weights laid behind a basket in one of the rooms—I told Ford of it, marked them, and left them in the same place—about three o'clock I stopped the boy Dedross—Mr. Charles Warner came up and took him into the counting-house, and Dow, the constable, took him away—I saw the officer pass me, with one of the weights in his hand, which I had marked in the morning.</p>

               <p>of Messrs Warner. I remember, on the 3rd of August, Ford taking the brass weight out of my breast—I had stolen it out of the warehouse—I had some conversation with Mr. Warner about it, and went to the station—I afterwards went with the weight to a marine-store shop belonging to the prisoners—I had been there twice before—I saw them both—I took the weight to them, and they said they did not give so much for new weights as they did for old—they did not both speak at the same time—I spoke to the female prisoner—the man was at the door—I showed the weight to the female prisoner—she asked what it was—I said, "A four pound"—she said it was not a four pound, it was but a three pound—the male prisoner was near enough to hear what she said—she gave me 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave the weight to a girl who was in the parlour—there is a partition put up between the shop and the back room—the girl was in the back room, and the woman too—I did not observe what the girl did with the weight—nothing more passed between me and the female prisoner—I said nothing to the male prisoner at all—they knew who I was, because I had been there before—they knew I came from my masters, and that I took such things from my masters—they had asked me when I was there before why I did not bring more than one or two pounds at a time—I told them where I came from the first time I went—they asked me where I came from, and I told them I came from Messrs. Warners'—I told the man and woman both—when I sold this weight she owed me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the last time I went, and she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it, which made 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave the money to the policeman when I came out—there were three policemen at the comer house all but one from the prisoners, about twelve yards from the shop—when I gave them the money they went into the shop, and I followed them in—I heard what was said—the policemen asked where the weight was they had just bought of me, and they denied it, and said they had never seen me—I was in the shop at the time, so that they could see me—the female prisoner said it one time, and the male prisoner another—the female spoke first—she said she had never seen me before, and that she had just come from over the way from buying a herring, and that I had never been there, and never taken any weight—the male prisoner told the policeman to search about the place, and said he never saw any weight come in—the policeman searched about the place, but could not find the weight—the policemen then went up stairs into the bed-room, and they took the prisoners and me to the station.</p>

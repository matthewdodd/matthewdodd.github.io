            . I am servant to Mrs. Wiggett. I had just opened the shop, and the two prisoners came in, and asked me to show them some ribbons: I handed a box of ribbons down. May agreed for half a yard: I cut it off, and was going to put the box up, and the other prisoner said, he must have a little bit: I asked him, What colour he chose to have? he said he would have it the same as the other. While I was measuring it, Mr. Gagnon came in, and asked May whether he had not got more ribbons than he had paid for? May said, no. Then my mistress came in, and other people, and the ribbons were found in May's pockets, which were in the box when I set it before them.</p>

            , my apprentice, Jack, look sharp after them fellows, they look more like thieves than horses; it is my opinion they are going to steal something: I was talking to a customer, and my apprentice said they were looking at some ribbons; presently he said, There! they have put some in their pockets now: presently he said, There, there! they have taken some more: then I said to him, come over with me: we went into the prosecutrix's shop, and a carpenter followed us: I said to May, what is that you put in your pocket, friend? he said, Sir, I have nothing in my pocket. I took him by the collar, and he shuffled his hand into his right hand pocket, and took out two rolls of ribbon, and slipped them into the box: I immediately laid hold of them: (He takes up two rolls, one purple, the other blue and white): these are they: said I, you villain, you have stole them. I put my hand into his left-hand pocket, and pulled out the other roll of green ribbon; then he said, he did not mean to steal them: I found nothing upon Stanley. Then I sent the carpenter for Mr. Clay, the high-constable: they both begged for mercy, pulling their hats off, and said, you are a young man as well as we: you don't know what you may come to: they said it was the very first time they had been guilty of any such thing, and begged to be let go.</p>

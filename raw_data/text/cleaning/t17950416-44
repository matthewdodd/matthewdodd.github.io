               <p>Q. How near were you to the window at the time? - Behind the counter, being near the window.</p>
               <p>Q. She could see you through? - She did see me. She then went away; I then went to the door and looked at her; she got about three door off as I got to the door; she looked at me very earnestly indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing to her? - No. In about ten minutes afterwards I heard the break of the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned to the shop again? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of February last, about five o'clock in the evening, I was standing in my own shop, and I heard the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your shop to Mr. Exton's-Mine is No. 11 and his is No. 7. I went to the door, and I saw the prisoner at the bar running about the space of ten yards past my house; I ran and I overtook her, and I found this piece of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was she running? - From Mr. Exton's shop towards Spitalfields church. I suppose she might run about seventy or eighty yards before I took her. I asked her where she got these handkerchiefs from?</p>
               <p>Q. Were had she them when you stopped her? - Right open in her hand as I have got them now. I took them from her. She gave me no answer. I brought her back to the house; Mr. Exton was not within. I took her down to the office and she seemed to think very slight of it. She told me she knew who did it but she would never tell; but she told the magistrate afterwards that a woman persuaded her to break the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose her examination was taken in writing, in course before the magistrate? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the handkerchiefs? - Kept them in my possession.(The handkerchiefs produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine, I know them by the shop mark on them, marked to sell for five shillings and sixpence a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. To Perry. Though you heard the window break you did not see any hand put in? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to Windfield-street, to an acquaintance of mine, and as I was coming home crossing Brick-lane I see these handkerchiefs, lay and I picked them up, and I carried them along open in my hand, to see if any body would own them.</p>

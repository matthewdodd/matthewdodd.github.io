               <p>Q. Was there any croud of people at that time?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, there was not; I immediately seized him, and charged him with it, and called out for the watch; upon which a man that I had not observed, aimed at my head with a stick, which happened only to knock my hat off. I carried the prisoner to the watchman, he did not come to me; and he and I carried him to the watch-house. He was taken before an alderman, where he denied taking the watch, and said he was an apprentice to a vintner at Bristol. The watch was conveyed to that other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it delivered?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, it was dark. I could not see that, but I heard the chain to chink, when his hand was delivering something to that man that strove to knock me down. The prisoner was searched, but I told Mr. Stevenson, he need not search him, for he had not got it. I never got it again.</p>

            . On the 10th of August, about a quarter after ten at night, I being constable of the night, the prosecutor and watchman brought the prisoner to me; he charged him the same as now; he was searched, but Mr Wright said, he knew he had delivered it to another man that was gone off with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I think it is very requisite the watchman should be here. The prosecutor said I was very obstropulous. I desired alderman Cartwright to ask the watchman if it was so, and the watchman said I went very regular and quiet.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner seemed to resent it as an indignity to him, that I should charge him with such a wicked thing.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jos. Watson. The prisoner lived with me 13 or 14 months, I am a lighter-man; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176109160066"></xptr> trusted him to receive for 10, 14, 15 chaldrons of coals at a time; he behaved very honest. Just before this, he was going captain's steward with admiral Saunders: I thought he had been on board the ship, when this thing happened; I would trust him with all I have in the world.</p>

               <p>Jos. Peade. I have known him 13 or 14 months. He has as good a character as any gentleman need to have for a young man. I have left him in my house when I have had 60 or 70 l. worth of silk, he never wronged me; I would trust him with-all now: I never heard a bad word from him in my life.</p>

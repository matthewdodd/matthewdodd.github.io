The prisoner at the bar, and the coachman, tried last sessions, pushed me down, and took my bundle out of the coach; they pushed me all along the street, as I was getting into the coach; who pushed me down I do not know, whether the coachman or the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did the bundle contain? - It contained a great many articles, a gown, two shifts, two or three caps, a petticoat, three pair of stockings, five aprons: I got into the coach, and told the coachman I had lost my parcel; the prisoner and the coachman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080076"></xptr>both damned me several times, and said, they had not got any thing, nor had I lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing to you when they first pushed you down? - Nothing at all; they pushed me down, and took the bundle; I went then to my lodgings, and I had the coach searched then, but the bundle was not in it when I got there: Sir Sampson Wright's men found the bundle some time after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask whether I was nigh her? - The prisoner was near me, and damned me several times: there was only him and the coachman present.</p>

               <p>I brought Mrs. White from Brentford to London; she asked me to call an hackney coach; the coach did not come near enough to step out of one coach into another; I went to assist her, and put in her bundles; and as she was getting in, she was shoved down, and the bundle was stole; I was shoved down along with her; I can say there was no one near but the coachman and the prisoner at the bar; the prisoner at the bar was at the hackney coach door at that time; and he was there some time after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask whether I was not with him from the time that the lady said she lost her bundle, for an hour after? - He was with me some time; I cannot say for the time; he came and attended the coach as usual: he was the watering man, and generally attends the coaches there.</p>

             had taken the bundle; I saw him about there a few minutes afterward; and about five minutes after I saw him on an hackney coach box in Piccadilly, with the man who was convicted last sessions; I pursued him up Rupert-street; Peart got off the box; and at the end of a little court, called Edmond's-court, facing St. Ann's church, the coachman stopped, and got off the box; (this might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the robbery was done); he got down and opened the coach door, and took the bundle out, and had walked down the court some yards; and Peart came up from the bottom of the court to meet him; and he was close to him when I apprehended the coachman; his name is Johnson.</p>
               <p>What became of the prisoner? - He left London after the sessions, and went to Portsmouth; and an information coming up that he was at work at a stable-yard there, I went down and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says I rode on the coach, and he followed me about to the dead wall of St. Ann's church; then he says he saw me in the court, at one end, and the coachman at the other; now, if he saw me in Rupert-street, how could he see me at the other end of the court? - He was coming to the coachman, almost the distance as I am to you, my lord; I saw him first at the corner of Air-street; and he passed just the end of the street; I says to the man with me, there is Peart on the coach-box; says I, we will follow him wherever he goes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is it possible for a coach to go to Piccadilly, and set the lady down at Mary-le-bone, in this time as he has mentioned he saw me? - I cannot be positive for a few minutes.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. White. Did you go in Johnson's coach to Mary-le-bone? - Yes, I did.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was called into a pawnbroker's, and found the prisoner there; Howse gave me one pair of shoes, which she had attempted to pawn - I took her, and in going to the watch-house she said they had been given her by three boys, whom she named, and they were waiting her return in Bainbridge-street - I went there, but they were gone; she also told me she had pawned a similar pair in Tottenham-court-road - I took the prosecutor there, and he owned them; the prisoner said the boys had stolen the shoes - I made her no promise.</p>

I stopped the prisoner, and gave information - I was not there when she first came, but from what I heard from my shopman I came down into the shop, and asked the prisoner whose shoes they were; she said her brother's, and she would fetch him - I detained her, and gave her into custody.</p>

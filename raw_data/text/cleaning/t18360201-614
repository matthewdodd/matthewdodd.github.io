                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham. I came up to London to see my brother—I happened to meet the prisoner about two o'clock in the morning on the 10th of January—I believe it was in the Dover-road—I believe I spoke first, and she took me up a back lane—she took my watch and my tobacco-box away—I had only been with her a few minutes—I had not given her any thing, or made any bargain with her—she took my watch and tobacco-box in a minute, and ran away—I went after her with the policeman—she had got about thirty yards, or more—I had not given her these things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You asked me to have something to drink, and took me down that place, because there was a light at the corner, and asked if you could be with me all night, and I said no, because I had a husband—you said, "Never mind, come and stop with me"—You said you had no money, and gave me the watch to keep till Monday morning—the case fell off, and I picked it up, and put the watch in my bosom, and then you—I got from you by telling you there was a policeman coming. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.; No, I did not.</p>

At a quarter-post two o'clock in the morning on the 10th, I heard the prosecutor say he had been robbed of his watch and his tobacco-box, by a woman who was with a man in a smock-frock—I saw the prisoner run across the road, and join a man—I stopped her, and asked the prosecutor if she was the woman—he said she was—I put my hand to her bosom, and felt the watch and the tobacco-box—the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what ho was about—he said if the box was his the rivet was out, and he had put a large pin in, and turned it up, which is the case.</p>

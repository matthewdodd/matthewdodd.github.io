               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I had been drinking; but I was not so drunk but I knew what passed.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner came into my apartments, between nine and ten o'clock, last Tuesday was a week, in the morning; she produced a watch, and asked me to get a little money upon it; I asked her whose it was, and she told me it belonged to a friend that wanted a little money. I went to Mr. Wright's, where I always go with any thing of my own, I got a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pawn it in your own name? - A. I did not know it was any thing amiss, and I gave her the money.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know this watch to be mine, by the number and maker's name; I had broke the the chain inside, the watch-chain, by winding it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it impossible that the watch could fall out of your pocket? - A. Yes; I had a deep fobpocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The prosecutor was as drunk as a beast could be; and he gave me the watch to pawn, and said he would be back in an hour, and sleep with me all night, as he and I have known one another some time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who had known her from her infancy, and gave her a very good character.</p>

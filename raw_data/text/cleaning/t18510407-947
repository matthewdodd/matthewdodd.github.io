On Friday night, 14th March, between ten and eleven o'clock, my mistress sent me up-stairs to a bed-room on the first floor—it is a front room, next to her bed-room—on going in I saw the legs of two persons under the bed—I closed the door and remained out<lb></lb>side—I made an alarm—I had seen the window closed before I closed the door—I heard some persons coming, opened the door again, and saw two persons getting out of the window—I had a light—the prisoner is like one of them, but I could not swear to him—I believe he had the same coat on that he has now—I did not see his features—I speak from his back—the other man had a short jacket on, but I don't know him at all—the window was fifteen or sixteen feet from the ground—there was a light in the road, but not opposite the window, further on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Oliver-street, Bow. On the evening of the 14th March, I was passing the Blue Anchor, I saw the middle window of the three up-stairs, in the room over the bar opened, and two men came out of it and ran along the ledge, which is about six inches wide—they jumped on the tiles of a stable, and from that to, a gate—they jumped off the gate and ran away—I heard the people hallooing and screaming, and a man ran out in a state of great alarm, and pointed up to the front window—there were no lamps, but it was, a beautiful moonlight night—the prisoner is one of the men I am certain—they got away.</p>

On the night of 14th March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in the bar, and heard a noise as if something was falling over head—I sent my potman up, and he raised an alarm—I heard the bed-room window open—I went up-stairs when the policeman came, which was about a quarter of an hour after the alarm; I examined my bed-room—there had been a box under the bed, which had been removed, and the beading round it broken off, but nothing was taken out—a drawer, where these silver articles had been in the morning, was forced open—I missed eight or ten sovereigns from a bureau in my room—I do not know that I had seen the prisoner in the house that night—there were two strange men in the house on the Thursday night—this is my husband's property, and was in my bed-room in the front of the house—I had been in the room that evening, and fastened the window about five.</p>

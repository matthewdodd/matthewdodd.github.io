I had occasion to go out, and on my return I met him going out with my coat under his arm. I followed him about twenty-yards, and asked where he got it from - he said a person had sent him in for Mr. Jones' coat. - I told him it was mine, and he must come back with me; there is no Mr. Jones in the house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was sent in by a gentleman, and there was a carpenter at work there. I asked for Mr. Johnson's coat, who was outside - the carpenter opened the door, went into the billiard-room and gave it to me. I went out to go the gentleman, and this young man came running after me, and said I must go back with him. I said I had been led into the snare, and told him I was going to give it to Mr. Johnson, at the corner of York-street. I have been a respectable tradesman.</p>
               <p>COURT to H. PRATT. Q. Did the prisoner say the same thing before the Magistrate? A. Yes; and the Magistrate put it off till the evening for the carpenter to come - he said he never saw him; the prisoner said the man's name was Jones in the morning, and Johnson in the evening.</p>

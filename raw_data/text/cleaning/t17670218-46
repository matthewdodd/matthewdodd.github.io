I went with him to Red-bull-yard, St. John's-street, there were two girls that they kept; one of them is called Martin's wife; I saw the cardinal, and proved it to be Mr. James's property: while we were talking about it, we heard somebody coming up stairs; Mr. Clark said they are coming, put the door too; they came up, the prisoner was first apprehended; Martin ran down stairs, but was soon apprehended and brought up: they were taken before Justice Girdler, he admitted the girl an evidence.</p>

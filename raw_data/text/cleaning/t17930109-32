(Produced.) I told him I should go out of town to Birmingham on Friday, he said I might as well go back to his house, and stop till I went out of town, it would be expensive to stop in town; I went back to his house; this was Thursday evening; on Friday morning, he says to me Tom, give me those notes; and I will go over to Mr. Stenson's, and get them cashed for you, you will rip them or lose them, or some mischief or another with them. Mr. Stenson lived over the way facing the prisoner's house, he is a mercer, I gave him the notes; six five guineas and two 10 l. notes, all of country Banks; they were those I received in the country, of what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090049"></xptr>particular Banks, each were I cannot tell I delivered them to him, to get them cashed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect he would give you cash, I did; I parted with them to receive the cash; he brought me back the cash for a 10 l. about a quarter of an hour after, he said Mr. Stenson had got no more cash, this was about nine or ten on Friday morning, he said he would cash the remainder in town; I went with him to town, because I was going to dine with my uncle about one o'clock in the afternoon; I saw him again about nine o'clock at night, at his house at Kensington; I asked him for my notes, he says what notes? I never had any notes of you, nor nothing do I owe you, and nothing will I pay you; we quarrelled that night; on Saturday morning we got up and breakfasted, I did not speak to him then, but I went and spoke to him before he went out; he went out, and I went into the yard, I heard him say he was going to a neighbour's house for whom he had a tea urn to japan, I stopped in the house about half an hour, waiting for him to come in, he did not come in, I went to this neighbour's house and asked for such a person as he was not there; I came to London to my uncle; I heard of him the Tuesday night afterwards Christmas night; he was advertised in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any letter after he left Kensington? - One Mr. Charters did make an appointment, at a particular place for the purpose of receiving the money.</p>

I went at eight o'clock that morning according to the appointment of the letter, and a broker's cart was at the door, he had sold all his goods; I did not see him till the Saturday following I believe; at the time I gave him these notes, I gave them him for no other purpose than for him to get them changed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowyles. It is three quarters of a year ago since you first became acquainted with this man? - Rather better.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot be mistaken as to the time, not materially? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course, if you have said it was not three months since you was first acquainted with this man, that cannot be right? - It was rather better than three quarters of a year I believe; it is more than three months, but I cannot be sure to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you first became acquainted with him, that you first worked for him in London? - Some where about three weeks, I am not positive to the time, it may be a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never represented it any otherwise? - Never have.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your father here? - He is not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of the nature of the complaint Mr. Strickland had against you? - I heard a complaint, he sent a letter down to Birmingham, he sent word that I had stole the patterns, but it was patterns that my father had sent me up, and I took them down with me again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he leave your service or did you turn him away? - He left our service without our knowledge, him and another young fellow stole several patterns which was a material consequence to our manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any means to find out this young Otely? - I applied to know if any one had seen Otely cut them patterns, I had a warrant against him, advertised him in the Birmingham papers, I did not succeed in finding him out till about a month ago, I overtook him in St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very possible you can help us to the date when you applied to get this warrant? - No I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I can help you to it very soon; on your oath, was it not on the very day the prisoner was under examination? - It was not; there was two warrants, one to apprehend him in Birmingham, that was some time about May or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Before whom did you make that information? - Before justice Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another warrant as a runaway apprentice, the day the prisoner was examined? - There was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090052"></xptr>Q. You had forgot the charge of felony then - The young fellow that was in the office is ill in Birmingham infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. Who invited you to make that charge that day? - No body invited me but what is just.</p>
               <p>Q. Then just or unjust who invited you to Bow-street? - No body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner send for you to come there and make the charge? - The prisoner sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't repeat the question, answer it. - Give me time to recollect myself; the prisoner acquainted me that he was in custody, on the charge of Otely, and that if I wanted an opportunity of making him my prisoner, then was my time.</p>
               <p>Q. No body invites me but what is just; the prisoner did tell me that he was in custody, on a charge of Otely, and that if I wanted an opportunity of making him my prisoner, then was my time. Mr. Strickland, when was it you had that invitation to come and do what is just, perhaps you have got the letter in your pocket that he sent to you? - No, I have not, he sent a verbal message.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was it sent? - I don't know to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not seen him to day? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the message? - That Mr. Harbidge was a prisoner, and that I wanted an opportunity of finding Otely, I might meet him there on his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce the warrant at Bow-street, you had taken out before? - No, it is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you even hint at it? - I did to the clerk, I wanted a warrant for both felony and as a run-away apprentice, but I could not bring the young man that see him put the patterns in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. And so he refused the warrant; do you know the clerk's name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - I believe he has been at different times at our manufactory for three, four or five months, I don't know what way of life he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever sell you any goods? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason on which you say you would not believe this young man on his oath? - Upon account of his misconduct in our manufactory, his conduct was so base, damning and blasting his eyes and limbs, and instead of attending to his business six days, he used to attend to it three; and many other things, his behaviour in every part whatever was bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps one might help you, perhaps he might represent to you, that you ought to allow him 4 s. in the pound more. What was the money that was stipulated? - He was paid on common prices.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the articles there? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them; was that twenty per cent. the usual article in your manufactory? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that five made you an allowance of twenty per cent. in December 1791? - I think I could say ten did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you believe five out of sixty made you that allowance? - I will swear nothing but what is fact; there is not above twenty in this line.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you believe that out of the twenty there were five that allowed you twenty per cent? - I think I could swear there were ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the young man make that representation as I have before stated? - He cheated besides, he borrowed money and never paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom? - Of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What more than the twenty per cent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The reason that you made no complaint of felony against him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090053"></xptr>was because a material witness was ill in Birmingham? - He was, or I would have sent for him up.</p>

            , Otely was under articles to him for three years, he was there five or six months, he behaved himself very well for three weeks or a month, but after that he behaved in a most ridiculous manner, and corrupting the boys in bad language.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray did he ever say any thing to you about the riots at Birmingham? - He told me he was concerned in pushing out the pulpit in the old Meeting house at Birmingham, he used to go on in that strange manner; I assisted in pushing out the pulpit at the old Meeting house, he used to swear Church and King.</p>

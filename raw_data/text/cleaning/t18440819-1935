                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father, a boot and shoe-maker, in East-road, City-road. On the 19th of July last, I saw the prisoner—I had seen him before on business—he asked me if my father was at home—I said, "No"—he said, "I want him to cash this check, I will give you the least one"—he had two in his hand—he showed me this one for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., drawn by Mr. Whistler, and wanted me to cash it—I said, I dare say I could—he said he wanted another pair of boots, and he would leave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; off the check to pay for the boots—I went up stairs, and met my father coming down—I spoke to him, and paid the prisoner a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would call again on Wednesday week for the boots—I gave the check to my father—on the 1st of Aug. I heard the shop bell ring—I ran up directly, and saw my father and the prisoner—the prisoner asked me if the boots were done—I said, "No"—I walked towards him, and said, "Did you know that check you presented to me was a forged one?"—he said, "Good God, you don't mean that," and he turned round and said to my father in my presence, "I must go and get you the money, will you meet me in the morning?"—my father said no, he would not let him go, and told him he must give him into custody—at that time the policeman had come in, and he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers of the London Joint Stock Bank Company, Princes-street. Mr. William Miller Christie is one of the partners—there are others—Mr. John Whistler, of Laurence-lane, has an account at our blank—on the 21st of July, this check marked B was presented by the elder Mr. Samuel—I required an explanation of him—I stopped the payment of it as forged—the check for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid previous to that—I was not the person that paid that.</p>

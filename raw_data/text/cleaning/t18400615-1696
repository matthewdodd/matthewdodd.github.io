On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, about half-past eight o'clock, I received some information from my daughter, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Templeman's house—I found the door closed and fastened—I went to the parlour window after</p>

"—he said, Middling-like—he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>very particularly—I asked what he wanted to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>for—he said he wanted to borrow a <hi rend="italic">screw</hi>—as far as reading goes, I consider that means a picklock-key—I have read that term in a published work—I asked him what he wanted a <hi rend="italic">screw</hi>for—he stated to me that he was going to <hi rend="italic">serve</hi>an old gentleman in a lonely cottage—the term <hi rend="italic">"serve"</hi>specifies to commit a robbery—I told him he had better not do any thing of the kind, if he did he was sure to get transported—he said he might as well be transported for that, for if he was taken as a deserter, he should be sure to be transported—a fight then took place at the bottom of the street, and I and the prisoner went down to look at it—I knew the prisoner by being up at our place—I gave him shelter eight or nine nights, and lodg<lb></lb>ing and victuals, as well as I could for a poor man—I have seen him in what they call an undress—he was in the 11th Light Dragoons, I believe—after the fight was over we returned back to my own door—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>had not come then—I had not seen any thing of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>at all—I said to the prisoner, "Good night"—he said, "You had better not go yet, for I want to see <hi rend="italic">Jam</hi>very particularly"—I said, "What do you want to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>for? "—he said, "I want to borrow a <hi rend="italic">darkey</hi>, it might be handy"—a <hi rend="italic">darkey</hi>means a dark-lantern—I told him if he went over to the public-house (the Blue<lb></lb>coat-boy in Dorset-street) and waited a quarter of an hour, no doubt he would find <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>there—he said it was no use going to a public-house, for he had no money—I then bid him good night, but be said he was going to <hi rend="italic">serve</hi>the old gentleman on Saturday night, and should go and see his aunt on Sunday, and if he did <hi rend="italic">serve</hi>the old gentleman, he would call and let me know on the Sunday—it was about half-past seven o'clock when I first</p>

               <p>entered into conversation with him, and I got into John-street, Spital<lb></lb>fields just as the clock struck eight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Now, Mr. Jobson, what work is this to which you allude, as having seen these words in? <hi rend="italic">A. Tom and Jerry</hi>—I have seen it in two works—I have seen it in——</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you never stated that it was in "Bell's Life in London" that you saw them? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. That was a misunderstanding altogether—you were in my company twenty or twenty-five minutes altogether—I said before that it might be about a quarter of an hour—I am speaking from the time of seeing you in the passage till I got to the public-house, butit✗ was half-an<lb></lb>hour from the time I left my room—as I am lame, it would take me five or six minutes to walk to thep ublic-house—I went to the Weavers' Arms public-house, Brown's-lane.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. You say there was a fight at the top of the street? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. At the bottom—seven or eight rounds were fought—none of this conver<lb></lb>sation took place while the fight was going on—the fight lasted six or seven minutes—they were no sooner up than they were down—I colour ca<lb></lb>ricatures, or any thing I can to get my living—I have done some hundreds or thousands of religious prints, and through seeing you I have not got one to colour—my work has been stopped—I am not in the habit of dealing—I have been to fairs and races for pleasure—I never buy things there and bring them to London—I have been twice in custody, once for being drunk and disorderly, and once for being in company with a drunken man who give me into custody for robbing him of a shilling—you were in my company then, and offered the man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to abandon the charge; and after being there the man came and wanted the policeman to let me go, but he said the charge was booked—I should say your character was equally as good as mine at Spi<lb></lb>talfields at that time, only you were a deserter at the time.</p>

                  </hi>I am an umbrella-maker, and live at No. 7, Dorset<lb></lb>street, Spitalfields—I have known the prisoner five or six years—I knew him when he first enlisted. On Friday night, the 13th of March, when I was coming home, the prisoner was between the door and the window, in Dorset-street, between eight and nine o'clock—the first word he said was, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, you are just the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>I want to see"—I said, "What do you want to see me for? "—he said, "I want you to lend me two <hi rend="italic">screws</hi>and a <hi rend="italic">darkey</hi>"—I thought he meant two skeleton keys, but he did not say ske<lb></lb>leton keys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Is that the slang term for skeleton keys? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not know much about the slang terms myself—I told him he might as well ask me for a 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as for such things as those—he said nothing more—I said, "I am sorry to see you as you are, but I have got no money, or else I would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi>some beer"—he said he had no money—I asked my brother-in-law, who had been with me coming from Thames-street, to pay for a pot of beer—he said he had no money, but he went home to fetch some, and I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150173"></xptr>
               <p>went with Gould to the public-house—we called for a pot of beer, and while we were drinking it my brother-in-law returned and paid for it—I parted with Gould about nine o'clock, or not so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Before you came to give any evidence against me, had not you had some conversation with Jobson? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. None in the least—I now and then read the newspaper, but very seldom—if I heard any thing of the newspaper, it used to be more told me than reading it myself—it was tn consequence of what I saw in the newspaper that I came to give evi<lb></lb>dence—it was stated in the newspaper that I was not yet in custody, and I thought, not having any crime against me, that the best way would be to make my appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. That was the cause of your making out this tale? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I believe it it truth what I have stated—I had heard the phrase <hi rend="italic">screws</hi>before, as meaning skeleton keys, and <hi rend="italic">darkey</hi>as meaning a dark-lantern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do umbrella-makers generally keep such things? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No; but I formerly kept an old-iron shop, and I suppose you thought I might have such things—you did not want to purchase them, but to borrow them—I could not say whether you were serious or joking—I passed it myself y a joke, but I cannot say what your intention was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. If you had not seen your name mentioned in the newspaper, should you have thought of coming to give evidence? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You are the last per<lb></lb>son in the world I should have come against, or thought of coming against, or seeing in the situation in which you are placed—I said I was sorry to see you as you were, because you seemed to be so poor, and when you were in the public-house you always had a shilling in your pocket—you told me you had no money—I believe you said so after I said I was sorry to see you as you were, but I will not be positive.</p>

                  </hi>I am a shoemaker, and live in Elder-walk, Islington—I was at the Rainbow on Monday evening, the 16th of March, in the skittle-ground along with King—I went there about six o'clock—King was there before me—the prisoner came in between seven and eight o'clock—he said he should like to have a game at skittles, but he had but 1 ½<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>, and if any one would lend him a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would make one of four for a pot of beer—a pot of beer comes to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if two persons lost a game, they would have to pay 2 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—Gould said the potman there would be answerable for a pint for him—Gould and I were partners, and we won—he had no occasion to pay any thing—when we came out of the tap-room after playing at skittles, it was about a quarter to twelve o'clock, as near as possible—I had lost one pint, but I was not the prisoner's partner then—I gave him 2 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to play off, but that was not spent—he won the pot of the other man—on the whole, he was a winner, because he did not lose any thing—about eleven o'clock, before I left the house, I had occasion to go out for half-an-ounce of tobacco—the prisoner asked me to fetch him a rushlight, and gave me two halfpence to pay for it—I got one at the same shop I got the tobacco at—I returned with the rushlight and gave it to him—he put it into his pocket—he had a fustian coat on, similar to a shooting jacket, with an outside pocket—about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I left the house—I parted from him at the door of the house—I saw no more of him that night.</p>

               <p>was sober—he would not have to pass through my room to get to his—he would have to open my front door, and exactly at the same time as he opened the front door, he would open his own door—it was quite light, so that I saw him pass from one door to the other—the front door opens im<lb></lb>mediately opposite to where I was sleeping—he merely bad to pass the corner of our room—he had to come into it—he got up next morning about the same time as the morning before, between seven and nine o'clock—when he came out of his bed-room, be came right across our room, and went out at the door leading to the wash-house—I and my wife were sit<lb></lb>ting at breakfast in the same room as we sleep in—there is a privy which you can go through the wash-house to go to, or there is a way round without going into the wash-house—you can get to it without coming through the house, by coming up the garden, and going round the house—the privy is in the same wall as the wash-house is—a person outside the house could get to it without having to get over any fence or wall—I have half an acre of garden, and the house stands in the centre—it is not en<lb></lb>closed in any particular way—part is fenced, and part not—you can get to the privy from the garden without coming into the house, or getting over any fence or wall—no stranger has a right to come into my garden—I am confident the prisoner went into the privy when he went into the wash-house, because I beard him lift up the latch of the door—I heard the latch of the privy door close, so I am confident be either opened or shut it, I cannot tell which—I do not recollect whether my wife went into the wash-house while he was there—I saw him come out of the place again—he had been there between twenty minutes and half-an-hour—he had on a pair of heavy nailed shoes, which I had made, and when he came out of the wash-house they were blacked, and shined—he frequently cleaned his shoes of a morning—he left the house immediately he came out of the wash-house—he passed through the house, bid us good morning, and went out—I saw him again between seven and eight o'clock that same evening at my house—I had been out to fetch a pint of porter for supper, and when I came home I found him sitting in my place—my wife was there with him—I had at that time heard of the murder of Mr. Templeman—my cottage is between 300 and 500 yards from Mr. Templeman's—when I came in, my wife was holding conversation with the prisoner respecting the murder—I sat down, and did not interfere with the conversation, till Richard turned round, and said, did not I suppose that Mr. Templeman bad done it himself? —I said, "Richard, it is not very likely that after his hands were tied, and his head bound up, that he had committed suicide; it did not look feasible"—I do not remember that he made any reply to that—my wife still continued conversing with him—whilst I was sitting, having some supper, Richard said he should like something to eat, and he asked me if I would go and fetch him a slice of bacon, and a pot of beer, and some to<lb></lb>bacco—I said, "Richard, why not fetch it yourself"—he said, "You know the reason why I do not wish to go out"—I knew no reason why he did not wish to go out, otherwise than there was an assault warrant out against him—I went and bought the bacon, beer, and tobacco for him—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for them—he did not take any more money out of his pocket—I no<lb></lb>ticed that he had a pair of new shoes on, and while I was looking at them, he said he had been over to his aunt's at Clapham, or somewhere in that neigh<lb></lb>bourhood, I cannot exactly be certain where, he had been very fortunate—he had called on his cousin who had a pair of shoes which fitted him,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Have you never said it was two years ago since you saw the lantern? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Have you not been often troubled by persons crossing your garden, both after you have been in bed, and in the day time? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Sometimes there have been people gone across my garden, and I have noticed it, but I was not troubled with any body, because I did not see them—I have had occasion to go out to stop them from crossing the garden, but I do not term that trouble—I only did it as a friendly action—I have not been frequently robbed of little things by my neighbours' children—I have lost things twice since I have been there, but I always found them again—I have used the lantern so often I can almost swear it is my father's lantern—I never carried one when I was in the police—I used only to lock up prisoners that were in the watch-house when I helped my father.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of Charles Allen. The prisoner slept at our house seven or eight nights before this occurred—I have known him for twelve months—on Saturday, the 14th, he slept there—on Sunday, the 15th, he complained of being ill, and he went to bed in the afternoon—when he got up he asked for a little tea, and he gave my little boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fetch him some tea and sugar—he had some bread and butter with me, and with the tea and sugar, that came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was all expended—he said he had taken 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. since he had been out—he slept at our house on Sunday night, and did not get up on Monday morning till half-past eight o'clock, when Mrs. Jarvis called him up—she is the wife of a man living in a cottage in the neighbourhood—she had called at my house for him three or four times—I do not know where he generally breakfasted—he went out about a quarter of an hour after she called him—I did not see him after at all that day—I was in bed very early that night, by eight o'clock—I slept till the prisoner came home, and awoke me—I had an infant weaning—I expected him home early, and had left my door ajar, as I thought I should awake my baby, by getting out of bed—he pushed the door, which awoke me—it was two o'clock, as near as I can guess—I did not hear the clock strike about that time, but he awoke me and my baby, and I did not go to sleep any more—I had to get up with my child—it was day-light very soon after he came in—I did not hear any clock strike soon after he came in—I judged the time by the light—when he came in I said, "It is morning, Richard, " and he said, "It is early"—he then went into his own room—I got up next morning about six o'clock—I had my fire lighted before six o'clock—he did not get up till half-past seven o'clock—when he got up he went through our room into the wash-house—we live in the same room as we sleep in—a door opens out of the wash-house into the privy—I heard him open that door into the privy—I am quite sure I heard the noise—I went into the wash<lb></lb>house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, and found him standing by a table, doing something to his trowsere—I did not pay attention whether the door into the privy was open or shut—I came out directly—he remained there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after I went in—he then came out, and asked me for a towel—I gave him one—he had washed himself, and wanted the towel—he merely said, "What time is it? "—I did not answer him, for he said, "The clock is striking eight"—I heard the clock striking just as he asked the question—he left the house directly—I saw him again, about a quarter after seven o'clock the same evening—I bad heard of the murder and robbery of Mr. Templeman about twelve o'clock in the day—when he returned in the evening, I said, "Richard, I am glad you are come home, as I should not have left my door open for you any more, " in consequence, I told him, of the murder and robbery which had oc<lb></lb>curred so near us—he made answer, and said, "I expected as much"—I did not mention the person who was murdered, at that moment, I did di<lb></lb>rectly after—he said, "I have just heard something about it, but I do not know any particulars, " as he had called in at the Rainbow public-house as he came along—my husband had gone out, and he came in about that time—when the prisoner said he had just heard of it, I asked him where be had been that he had not heard of it before—I believe he then walked through the house, and went into the wash-house to the privy—as soon as he came back, he said he had been to his aunt's, and asked my husband</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150179"></xptr>
               <p>to fetch him some beer, and a rasher of bacon, and some tobacco—he did not say where his aunt lived—he had represented that he had an aunt, but I had never seen her—he gave my husband 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the beer and bacon, and when he gave it to him, I fancied I heard more money in his pocket—he told me he had been to see his aunt, and she had given him tome money—I noticed that he had a pair of new shoes on—he told me he had called on his cousin, who had a pair of shoes too large for him, and had given them to him—we proceeded to have supper—while at sapper some conversation took place respecting the murder of Mr. Templeman—I asked him where he had been the night before—he told me he had been playing at skittles at the Rainbow—I made answer that he could not have been playing at skittles till that time of morning, and he said he had been gossipping after he came from the Rainbow—he did not say with whom—he went to bed very soon after—the moment he went in, my hus<lb></lb>band went and bolted the door of his room on the outside—he made an observation to me when he bolted the door—about an hour and a half after he was bolted in the police came and took him into custody—I was in his room on the Monday, and noticed a pair of stockings lying on the box, dirty—they were rolled up the same as a clean pair of stockings—I merely took them up to see what stockings they were, and laid them down again—I did not undo them at all—I looked at them, because it was an unusual thing to have any of his clothing in the house—he never left any thing in the house, and I looked to see what it was—I am quite tore there was more than than one stocking there—they were rolled up so that I could only see one stocking, folded op as clean white stockings usually are—I had washed for him some months before—latterly, I be<lb></lb>lieve, Mrs. Jarvis washed for him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a stocking</hi>)—this is a cotton stocking, and this is the stocking which was folded outside—it laid in this direction—I took hold of it, to see what it was, and laid it down again—this is exactly the same sort of stocking, the same make of stocking, and I judged, when I saw it, that it was Richard's stocking—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another stocking</hi>)—this is not the fellow-stocking to the other—they are two odd ones—they are both cotton—when I washed for him, through getting wet in his feet one day, he put on one fresh stocking, and so they got mismatched—they continued to be washed as a pair afterwards, though they were odd ones, the whole time he was with me—the first stock<lb></lb>ing I have looked at, was shown to me on the Wednesday by a policeman—at that time it contained money—I was afterwards shown where it was taken from—I had never put any money or property of that sort in that place, nor did I ever know of its being there—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the lantern</hi>)—I remember that my husband had such a lantern as this in the house—it may be twelve or eighteen months, or longer, since I saw it—my hus<lb></lb>band used it about two years ago, to go to the sow when she pigged, and I have some recollection of putting it into a cupboard or box, I do not know which—I know I put it away—the cupboard and box were both in the wash-house—the box was not removed to ray knowledge for a length of time—it was never in the room the prisoner slept in—it was never moved out of the wash-house, that I remember—my box was in the pri<lb></lb>soner's room—that is a rubbish box—it was not in that box I put it—it was in the wash-house—I have some recollection of putting it away my<lb></lb>self—I cannot positively say—I never burnt a rushlight in it, when it</p>

               <p>was used—during the time the prisoner slept at our house, I never knew him have a light—if I offered him a candle he would not have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. What sort of a night was this? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Very moonlight, very light—I have stated it was about two o'clock when you came home—I judge so because my baby awoke me, and I was awake the remainder of the night, and did not go to sleep any more—I was out of bed three or four times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. If you had been awake, could not you have heard the clock strike? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I might not be attending—there is no fastening to your bed-room win<lb></lb>dow—I could not have got out of it myself without difficulty—I do not know whether you could have got out of it—I do not know how high the window is from the ground—you can stand in the room and look out of it—you cannot reach to the top of the window, you can to the centre—I remember taking the lantern off the table and putting it away after my husband used it—we have never had any one lodging in our house since we had the lantern, but you and Wright—I cannot say whether you were in the habit of going to my boxes or cupboards, you were often in the house, you could go to them if you liked—I have not washed for you since you went to the Barnsbury Castle public-house, that was about six weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You say that is like the stocking you saw on the box, is there any nark on it which causes you to think so? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. It is exactly the same kind of stocking, and here is the mark round the top, and the appearance of the stocking altogether—I looked at it, and when I saw it next morning, I saw it was exactly the same stocking—I have not found any stockings in my room myself—I have never seen any found in a bedstead since, nor have I heard of it—you were poorly when you came home on Sunday—you told me you had been drinking some beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Was it not the custom for me, all the time I lodged with you, to go regularly every Sunday morning to collect what money I had due to me by weekly instalments? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not since you left the Barnsbury Castle—you owed me about ₤1 or ₤2, at this time, but I have never cast it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now tell the truth, if you had known that I had money in my pos<lb></lb>session, would you not have thought me unprincipled not to pay you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You have had money and offered to pay me, and I have said, "If you are short, you had better let it alone"—I have said so in many instances, and I never expected you would pay me, being out of employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. How could I be without money when I offered it you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. You have had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or so, and said, "I will pay for my tea, " and I have said, "Never mind"—you have said, "I have a trifle, " and I have said, "Never mind"—I knew you were in distress, and did not wish to trouble you—we have one door into the garden, and one into the wash-house—we cannot fasten the outer door, nor do I want—it is off the hinges—I have footed stockings for you when I washed for you—I have no recollection whatever of mending this one—you had two pairs when I washed for you a month before Christmas—I had mended them for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you suppose two pairs of white cotton stockings in constant use would last me that time, and be as good as these? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I can't say whe<lb></lb>ther you wore them all the time or not—I know nothing about your re<lb></lb>placing those stockings.</p>

I was on duty on the 17th of March, at Islington—I came on duty at nine o'clock in the morning—I received information at half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and went to Mr. Templeman's cottage, the door was closed—I got in by the sitting-room window—it was about a third open—I found the sitting-room in a confused state—there was a chest of drawers in it, and I observed the top drawer was open—two drawers were open—they had been opened by a chisel—there was a mark on the drawer—I afterwards went into the bed-room and found Mr. Templeman lying on the floor, dead—I returned to the sitting-room, and found inside the top drawer a small box which Collins took possession of—there was nothing in it—it was open, there is a lock to it—I cannot say what it had been opened with—there was the mark of a chisel close to the lock of the tap drawer—I observed the win<lb></lb>dow by which I had got into the room, there was a pane of glass in it with a small bit out—it had been an old break, and a nail was put in to keep it in its place—it was knocked down, so that a finger could be put into open the window—I do not remember seeing any paper there—I went in by myself—I did not fit any chisel to the marks myself.</p>

                  </hi>I am an Inspector of the N division of police. On Tuesday, the 17th of March, I was stationed at Islington. Pocock's-fields are in the Islington-station—I know Mr. Templeman's house—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—I first went to Mr. Templeman's house between twelve and one o'clock on the 17th of March—I examined the window of the sitting room, and found it open, and the top pane of glass broken—a small piece was broken out of the corner—I found a piece of glass on the sill of the window inside—it was in such a situation as it would have fallen from the vacant space if pushed in—I saw a chest of drawers in the sitting room—the top drawer had been forced open and there were two marks on it—I produce a chisel and the drawer—I have compared the marks on the drawer with that chisel, and they correspond—the chisel has got a notch in it, and there is a mark on the brass of the lock, corresponding with the notch—it is a vacancy in the mark, a part where the chisel has not touched—there is a second mark in the wood-work, which also corresponds, but that is cut into the wood-work rather deeply, and there is no defect in the chisel mark there—the drawer appears to have been opened by those means—I took the prisoner into custody at a quarter after eleven o'clock the same night (Tuesday) at Allen's cottage in the same fields—he was in bed—the bed-room door was bolted outside—he was in bed with two children of Allen's—he appeared to be asleep—I disturbed him—he did not get up then—I procured a light, and he then got up, after my arousing him a second time—I searched his clothes, and found in his trowsers pocket 9<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, all in shillings—while I was counting the money I asked if he knew what money he had—he said, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found seven lucifer matches</p>

                  </hi>I am a police-sergeant.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. How long had you known I was at the Compter previous to your coming to Gravesend? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Not more than three or four hours—I first visited you there at eleven o'clock at night—I represented myself to be an officer—I was dressed in plain clothes—I had no Macintosh on my arm—I left you in about half an hour—I said I had come by desire to show you a copy of the letter of the Secretary of State—you asked me to show you the letter—you were in the cuddy when I first came on board—you read the letter twice, I believe—you had it time enough to do so—after reading it you put it on one side, and said you had made up your mind you would have nothing to do with it—you did not tell you knew nothing about it—the paper offered 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for the dis<lb></lb>covery of the parties who committed the murder of the late Mr. Temple<lb></lb>man—you asked me to show you the letter again—I did so, and then you said, "I will hare nothing to do with it, but I will tell you what I will do; if they will give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will tell who the parties were"—I then asked you who the actual parties were that committed the murder—you said, "I shall be required to remain in England"—I told you you would so—you then said, "I will tell who the parties are that actually committed the murder, if you will give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay my passage-money"—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I had been with you—it might be twenty minutes, I am not certain what time I stopped, whether it was half or a quarter of an hour.</p>

On your oath, did you not persuade me, as I had seen so much trouble through this affair, to make something by it now I had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

                  </hi>I live in a cottage a short distance from Mr. Temple<lb></lb>man's. I know the prisoner—I know he used to supply Mr. Templeman with beer, till within a fortnight after Christmas last—he was then pot<lb></lb>man at the Barnsbury Castle, a public-house in the neighbourhood—I had seen him there often at that time—I never saw him serve beer above once at Mr. Templeman's—I have seen him about there, and crossing the ground there about that time, or just after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My Lord, as this is a very intricate case, I am to<lb></lb>tally unable to explain the nature of the evidence myself. I most earnestly crave your Lordship's protection, as I am undefended. There are some portions of the evidence which, I think, perhaps it is necessary that I should make some remarks upon, although I am not aware that I am compelled to explain every little thing that might transpire. It appears, gentlemen, al<lb></lb>though there is a great mass of evidence produced against me, that there is very little of it which appears at all to affect me; but I shall explain, in the best manner I can, to you, that part that I think does. And first, the witnesses state that I was in the skittle-ground, playing at skittles, and had no money but three halfpence. Now, gentlemen, the very name of a skittle<lb></lb>ground will convince you of the motive of my denying my pocket there. It is not likely, if I had a few shillings of my hard earnings and savings in my pocket that I should go and throw it away among a parcel of men in a skittle-ground, especially when I could get as much beer as I liked by saying I had no money. One of the witnesses states that I sent him for a rushlight. I did so, I acknowledge, but I made no secret of it. If I had wanted a rushlight for any particular occasion, I should have gone and got it myself, the shop is but a few yards from the public-house. I sent for it in the open tap-room, and he brought it to me in the tap-room. Then, as to the time at which I am stated to have gone home that night, I would ask you whether it is likely, on a moon-light night, like that was, that they can tell what time I went in? In their own evidence they state that it was as light as day, and still they take upon themselves to swear that it was two o'clock. With regard to my telling the Aliens that I had no money, my reason for that must be very obvious to you: I owed them between 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and there was still something standing for boots: if I had told them that I had money in my pocket, or that I had been and bought new boots, Allen, being a shoemaker, would naturally have thought it very unprincipled of me to go and lay out my ready money at another shop, at the same time that I owed him money. There are a parcel of wit<lb></lb>nesses who come and give some and very various accounts of convers<lb></lb>ations that they say took place between us previous to the murder; but you see with what caution they have managed it, so that there should never be a third person to hear those conversations. First notice Mr. Wright—he can recollect every thing I said to him, but he does not recol<lb></lb>lect any thing that was said in the presence of Squires; he does not recol<lb></lb>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150188"></xptr>
               <p>lect what he told Squires; and it also appears that Mr. Wright knew all these places as well as I did; he knew Allen's cottage, and he knew the wash-house, and the water-closet, and the garden, but he states he never saw a lantern; for what reason Squires is kept out of the way I am not aware; but he is not forthcoming to day to certify as to the truth of what Wright has stated. Next come Mr. Jobson and Mr. Rogers. I will ask you, whether their characters are worthy of the least attention. You must have been convinced, by the way they answered those questions which I put to them, that they are not to be credited for a moment. But there is one thing which I should particularly wish to draw your attention to, and that is, the very unfair, if not illegal, means by which I have been drawn into the predicament in which I now stand. This Sergeant Otway (although he comes here and denies it; why does he do so? for the sake of what he shall get, if I am convicted) knew that I was at the Compter; but he would not come there to me. No, he watches his opportunity, when he well knew I should be among strangers, and should wish not to be known; and mark the time he comes, at eleven o'clock at night, when I am in bed and asleep, taking me by surprise, and thinking that day being the first I had been at liberty for some time, that I should have been drinking a little, that that would be the best time. When he came to me he represented himself as a gentleman, sent to me by the Secretary of State, with an especial message to offer me 100<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, if I could give him any information that would lead to the conviction of the parties concerned in the murder of Mr. Templeman. What did I tell him? I at once told him that I did not know any thing about it, that I would have nothing to do with it; he has confessed here to-day, that I told him so more than once. I said I would have nothing to do with it for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He then sat down, and began reasoning with me, telling me as I was a young man, and about leaving the country, how serviceable money would be to me, how much better it would be to go out with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket than nothing at all, and as I had seen a great deal of trouble, I should be very foolish if I did not now make something of it, if I could. Well, with these persuasions, and as he positively assured me that I could not be tried again, I am free to acknowledge, that I did feel inclined, if I could make any thing of it, to do so, and I made up my mind to tell a lie for the sake of the reward. Now, I will ask you, Gentlemen, if that was a fair way of transacting business? He then got me to agree to his proposal. After I had said several times that I would not have any thing to do with it for 200<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, I said, "In the event of there not being a conviction, how should I be situated? for if I was to stop behind I should lose my pas<lb></lb>sage, and lose every thing." He then said, "Putting that on one side, will you, or would you, if I was to bring you 100<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and lay it on this table, tell me who the actual parties were? " I said I would. He then asked me if I was required to lose my passage, what would I do so for. I said, "For the passage money." He then left me. I will ask you, Gentlemen, whether you think that the conversation he states was all that transpired, would occupy half-an-hour? and he was obliged to acknowledge that he was there at least half-an-hour. I saw nothing of him till the next morning, or the morning after, when he came down, and instead of bringing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he talked about he brought a warrant. Of course I found I was very much taken in somehow; but I did not take any notice of it then. In the course of our journey to London, I asked him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150189"></xptr>
               <p>how it was that I could be apprehended on the warrant. He told me how things stood; that I could be tried for the robbery, and at I had acknow<lb></lb>ledged to him that I knew who the parties were, I could be punished if I did not make a disclosure. I then saw, for the first time, that I had been taken in, and how awkwardly I was situated. He then took me to the station-house, and from thence to Bow-street, where I was charged with the robbery. After I had been so charged, he came to me in the lock-up place, and told me the only way for me to get ont of the scrape was to make a full statement of the whole affair, and then I should be not only entitled to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but 200<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and likewise that I should be committed as evidence, and taken great care of. Of course I could not make any statement at all; but I told him I would consider of it, and if be came to me next day at the prison, I would give him a decisive answer. He then left me there locked up by myself, and finding they had driven me into a comer, and not knowing in what way at all to get out of it, I was driven almost to desperation, and I then made up my mind to make it appear, as though I really had been concerned, and also to accuse innocent parties, with the intent of getting out of it myself. You will say that that was a very rash proceeding; and so I will allow, and so I felt it to be, when I came a little to myself; but I never thought of there being a conviction at that time; it was merely because he promised me that I should be able to turn evidence; it was on that that I made the statement. After I had made up my mind to do so, I sent for him. He came to me in prison, and in the presence of the under-governor, and the principal turnkey, I told him that I was making this statement on condition that I was to be myself perfectly clear. He said he would tell me then, as he had told me before, that I should be admitted as evidence, and likewise that I should have the reward. For what reason the principal turnkey is kept away, I am not aware; he was a witness that would have been very necessary to have been here, to prove that part of my statement; but he is not. I had commenced making this statement to the principal turnkey when the officer came; but I had told him what were my motives for making it, and likewise told him that I would send for the officer. They thought; I was to be admitted as evidence, and on that account I was not treated as prisoners generally are. I was allowed sheets and tobacco, and to buy what I liked. Sergeant Otway also gave me some money there, and told me whatever I wanted I could have. Now, gentlemen, I will appeal to you whether, if it is not an unlawful proceeding, it is not, at least, a very unfair one? With regard to the lantern, it must be very evident to every, one of you, that I did not know it was there. The reason of my men<lb></lb>tioning the lantern was, because there had been, a lantern mentioned on a previous occasion. Is it likely that if I bad known there was a lantern in Allen's house, I should have been running any where else inquiring after one? as some of the witnesses try so to make it appear I was, a day or two previous. If I had in reality been engaged in this horrid affair, should I not have given some convincing proof of it? Do you think that a transaction of that kind could be carried on, a crime of that kind committed, without something having been traced to the parties themselves? What proof is there about that lantern? None. Where has it been for two years? whose hands has it been in? If they were to speak the truth, they do not know whether they left it in the garden, or brought it in doors; and if they did place it in the cupboard, as they state, a child might take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184006150190"></xptr>
               <p>it out. Their own children are in the habit of carrying things out, and losing them. It would be useless for me to comment any further upon the evidence, as I am sure his Lordship will explain it to you in a much clearer manner than I can.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Oxford-street. On the evening of the 15th of Nov. I was in my parlour, adjoin<lb></lb>ing my shop, and saw the prisoner, about half-past seven o'clock, riling from behind my counter—I went towards him—he caught hold of something on the counter, and asked me the price—I told him he did not want to buy anything and asked what he was stooping behind the counter for—he denied it—I closed the door, and told the boy to look at the till—he immediately said that it ap<lb></lb>peared as if money had been taken out of it—I then asked the prisoner if he would allow me to search him, which he did, and I took from his pocket a knife and some silver—I sent for a policeman, and before the prisoner left the shop with the policeman I went to my till—I can swear that there had been some money taken out of it—I had been to it a quarter of an hour before, and no one had been in the mean time—I had been in my back parlour writing it appeared by the till-book that there were 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wanting in the till, but there could not be 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as there were three half-crowns found—I believe it was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say whether I had any half-crown in my till.</p>

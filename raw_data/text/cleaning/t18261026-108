            . I was coming down Union-street, about half-past six o'clock on Sunday morning, the 8th of October, about one hundred yards from the mews; I saw the two prisoners, and watched them - they went up the mews, and appeared to go towards the prosecutor's stable; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260071"></xptr>waited about ten minutes, when they came out, and Day had this bag with the harness and saddle in it; Smith had the bridle - I went and told Mr. Bell; I saw Day throw away the bag; I went and took it up; they were in company together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Smith throw anything away? A. No; he had the bridle in his bosom - I might be twenty or thirty yards from them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you near enough to see him? A. Yes; I passed them when they were crossing the mews - they went in with nothing, and came out with these articles.</p>

            . I had just finished taking down my shutters, at the corner of Mortimer-street, when Waugh gave me information; I ran out, and saw the prisoners going down Mortimer-street, one on each side; Day was carrying this bag; I ran after them, and he threw it down - I pursued him down Titchfield-street, and into another street, where I collared him, without losing sight of him - I called Stop thief! and another person took Smith; I am quite sure that Smith run at the same time the other did - I saw him again at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were their backs towards you? A. Yes; my observation was chiefly directed to the man with the bag.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the man dressed who ran away? A. He had a blue round-frock on, like a butcher's-frock; Day had a fustian jacket and trousers. When I got to the watch-house I found Smith there, in the same dress as the man who ran away, but I had not seen his face.</p>

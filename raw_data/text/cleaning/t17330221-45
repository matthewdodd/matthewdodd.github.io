            . On Tuesday Night, the 10th of the last Month but one, the Prisoner and I, and Will. Morris, found the Prosecutor's Door open, and so we went along the Entry to the Kitchen Door.</p>
               <p>Court. The Kitchen Door?</p>
               <p>Powers. I suppose it was the Kitchen, because it was upon the Ground Floor, and we went a good Way down an Entry; I am sure it was a Back-Room, but I don't know what Name they may call it by. So when we came to the Door, says the Prisoner, this Lock will fly, and with that he burst it open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did we meet that Night?</p>
               <p>Powers. At Mr. Dacres's House.</p>
               <p>Dacres. I don't remember that I saw Norman there.</p>
               <p>Powers. Mr. Dacres's Maid knows of our being there.</p>
               <p>Maid. I don't remember that I saw them together. About a Fortnight after Christmas, I saw the Prisoner at our Door talking with my Sister, but Powers was not there then.</p>

               <p>Court. Has not the Prisoner been an Evidence himself?</p>
               <p>A Turnkey. Yes, my Lord, he was an Evidence last Summer against* 5 young Fellows, who were all capitally convicted, but were afterwards transported.</p>

            , I am the responsible person, and Mr. Houghton lives with me; our sleeping place was in these chambers On Friday the 18th of January we left them about six o'clock, I saw the doors fastened, I did not absolutely lock it myself, but I felt, and it was fastened, I left them perfectly secure; I believe, as near as I can guess, about five minutes past six, we had light candles, we light candles about half after four when we dined, it was dark then out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that the robbery had been committed? - About half after seven, we received intelligence of the laundress; in consequence of which information, we immediately both of us went to the chambers with the laundress, we found them in a very great state of confusion and disorder, there were two trunks drawn out of the bed room into the sitting room, with the locks absolutely forced up from the bottom, we had left them, one in the passage just by the outer door and the other was in the bed room; the locks were forced underneath and wrenched off, and the lock itself was torn from the wood, and left on one side of the trunk; my trunk was nearly emptied of every thing, but some letters, and some papers, that trunk was left in the passage, I lost all the things mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200095"></xptr>in the indictment; I attended at Bow-street afterwards, I saw Stone in custody on Friday the 4th of February, all he said before the magistrate was taken in writing. The lock of the outer door was found in a perfect state, there was the mark of some instrument at the dressing room window, as if it had been forced up; the window looks into the garden in Clement's Inn, it is the ground floor, the mark was on the outside of the window, but whether it was done at that time or before I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You went out about six, who was with you? - A gentleman, a stranger was with me and Mr. Houghton, we all went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed that the door was fastened, how do you mean? - I said to the gentleman, Gardiner, will you lock the door, he did, and I put my finger into the key hole to see if it was fast, and it was.</p>
               <p>Q.As to this mark in the window was the sash fastened down with any thing? - It is commonly fastened with a bolt, but whether it was bolted then or not I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other gentleman a key? - No, we both had one, and the laundress had one.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say what the value of the articles were? - According to the value I have laid them in the indictment, they are six pounds, and they are laid very much under their real value.</p>

               <p>I am laundress to the last gentlemen, that stood up here, I went to the chambers about a quarter after seven in the evening; I opened the door, and I found two mould candles burning, and there were two trunks broke open, and the locks were wrenched with great violence; I went into the dining room or sitting room, and said gentlemen are you in? after that I went into the bed room, and I found the candle burning there, and there was a pair of leather breeches very near, and if I had not gone as soon as I did the breeches would have been on fire by the light of the candle; I went out of the bed room to the gentlemen, to the office in Carey-street, No. 3, I called the gentlemen out and they came with me; it is Mr. Miller's office, the gentlemen were there both of them, we came to the chambers and found they were robbed, they took Mr. Gardiner with them to the chambers, and I went with them; I found then that the things were gone, and the dressing room window about that high up.</p>
               <p>Mr Peat. The dressing room window you found it up? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did there appear to be any marks of violence about that window? - I did not look then, nor since; there was a tea cup at the side of the window, and a pair of trowsers and a brush, and the tea cup was thrown down to the floor and it was not broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was the marks of any feet, or any thing of that kind, what sort of ground is that that is underneath it? - It is a flag pavement, not soft ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Had you been in the chambers before that day? - I left the chambers about half after five o'clock the window was down then when I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you left it at half after five, and when you returned afterwards did you find the trunks in the same place or were they all changed? - They were all taken out of their place.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you ever seen him before? - I know him by his face, he is the man that pledged the pistols; he called again the 11th of February, he was then in custody, before that I saw an advertisment from Bow-street, the 2d of February I saw an advertisement describing these pistols; I took them to Bow-street, and took them to this gentleman's lodgings, and shewed them him; on Monday the 4th of February, he came with the ticket to redeem them, he laid the ticket down on the counter, and I immediately sent for the constable, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You took in the pistols you say? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have little partitions and apartments in your shop, where people stand behind the shutters? - He did not happen to be in one of these; he was in the open part of the shop at day light.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated that those pistols have been in your custody; I presume they were laid by in the shop? - No more than being in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Every body had access to them as well as you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It sometimes happens that tickets are mislaid and affixed to other goods than those they belong to? - That is impossible, the ticket is on them, and he came for them; I can swear they are the pistols that was pawned; I never saw a pair like them in my life; I have seen a thousand pairs.</p>

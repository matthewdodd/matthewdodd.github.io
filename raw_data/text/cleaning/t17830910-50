               <p>Did you cry out at the time they had you down? - I cried, but I could not cry much, because he held my throat so.</p>
               <p>Did they immediately pursue him? - It was up by Penetent-street that they took him.</p>
               <p>How many yards was it? - Forty yards, I dare say, I got up as well as I could, and the way the gentleman run I run.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler, about ten or eleven minutes before I had shut up my house and was going to bed, a friend came in and we were talking, and I heard the watchman's rattle, my house is the corner but one of John's-hill, the prisoner was running from Torrington-street up John's-hill, I said you are in a hurry, he said, what do you want with me, I said, I do not know, there is a cry of stop thief, he said, he had hurt nobody, I said, then why did you run, he said, to meet them as he had heard the cry of stop thief, I told him he run the wrong way, I took him and gave him to the watchman, when I came down the road I found the old gentleman almost senseless, he kept crying out for God's sake do not hurt me, do not hurt me, he did not know what he was about, he begged he might go home to his wife and family; then the old man went to the watch-house, and he said that was the man, he recollected the man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes, that is the man, but I would not have him hanged neither, because I have children of my own, and I do not know what they may come to; there is nothing to hard for God to do, he may make a good man of him yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said at first I was not the man, he was very much entangled in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, no, I said you was not the man that robbed me, but the man that held me down.</p>
               <p>Williams. The prosecutor did say so.</p>

               <p>For five weeks before this I had been laying sick, and recovering again I said to my landlord, I would go and look after a little work, I was returning and I fell in with some of the people that worked for him, and I staid drinking till between ten and eleven, and one of them came out with me, and bad me good night, and said I had better go by the New Cut, and there was a mob of people, the corner of Ratcliff highway, and this gentleman seized me by the breast; when the prosecutor came up he said I was not the man, it was a sailor-man and a shorter man, they asked him my dress, he said I had a blue jacket on, I had a nankeen jacket and a green shag waistcoat, I have had three people here all day, and they are gone home; this is laid falsely to me, if they swear my life away they swear it falsely, therefore I leave it to the mercy of the Jury and the Judge.</p>

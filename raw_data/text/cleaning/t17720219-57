I was busy. She pretended she came from a lady; she wanted bumbazines, crapes, and other things, to be sent to Whitegate alley. I thing she said her mistress's name was Reeves. My man shewed her a petticoat; she agreed to give 19 s. for it. She wanted an ordinary crape. I looked it for her. She said she was going a little further and could not conveniently stay, but would call in half an hour: her countenance changing, I suspected she had taken something. When she went out, I sent my man to watch her: he went out, and instead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190036"></xptr> of going after her, there was another woman he went after her, and so lost the prisoner. In about five minutes after, the weaver, whom I bought the silk of, came to me: I asked him if he would not take something off the silk, for it was very dear. I was going to show it him, and missed it. I suspected the woman had taken it, and sent the cryer to crye it; which had no effect. The next day I advertised it, and Mr. Coney, the pawnbroker in Holborn, brought me eight yards of it. He left the silk with me, and gave me instructions to go to Sir

On the 11th of this month, the prisoner pledged eight yards of black silk at my house, I lent her a guinea on it; after that I saw an advertisement of sixty-three yards of black silk with a blue thread run through the selvidge; on looking at it by candle-light, I saw the thread.

He went to the door; he asked me where I lived, I said, in Whitegate-alley. I went out of the shop. I had no cloak on. I went to go to a grandfather's in Half-moon-alley, to see how he did; I met a woman that asked me if I knew where there was a pawnbroker's; that she was in great distress, and desired I would shew her one. I went with her, when she pawned the silk; I took the money, and gave it to her. I went to different pawnbrokers. I had no cloak on.

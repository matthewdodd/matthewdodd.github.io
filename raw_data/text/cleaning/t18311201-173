            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Baker's-row, about one o'clock in the morning, I heard a female voice crying Stop him! Stop him! two persons then ran by me; the prisoner was the last, and I caught him - he said, "It is not me, it is the other - let me go, and take the other;" at that time the prosecutrix came up, and said, "Hold him fast - that is the one that knocked me down, robbed me of my shawl, and tore my gown;" she said she had seen his face by the gas-lamp, and she knew him by his face and clothes; I took him about four hundred yards from where she was robbed - I put my hand on the prisoner's heart; he appeared very much flurried and agitated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from a friend's in the Dog-row; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran down Greyhound-lane; I was then stopped - the prosecutor said at the office, that there were three or four young men.</p>

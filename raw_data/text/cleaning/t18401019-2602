                  </hi>. I live in Carnaby-street. On the 23rd of October I met the prisoner in Holborn, and went with her to a room on the ground-floor of a house in Vine-street, Bedford-square—I had a silver watch in my waistcoat pocket, and a guard-chain round my neck when I went into the room—about ten minutes after I missed them, I called the police—he came directly, and took the prisoner to the station-house—my watch and chain were brought to me by the female searcher—I also lost a half-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my coat pocket, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my trowsers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You gave me the watch to keep till the morning. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not—I threatened to beat her brains out on the floor if she did not give me the watch—I called the police, when she would not give it up.</p>

I heard a call in Vine-street—I went into the room en the ground-floor—I found the prosecutor and the prisoner—the prosecutor charged her with taking the watch—she said she knew nothing of it—I took her to the station-house—the female searcher was employed, and I saw the watch produced.</p>

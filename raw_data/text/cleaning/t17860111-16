               <p>How long had you been at your tea, before you heard this bustle between Riley and the prisoner? - Not ten minutes, when I went past, I saw no light in his room, nor I heard nothing on the stairs, till I heard Riley calling.</p>

               <p>If any body had been wrenching the door or pulling off the padlock, do not you think you should have heard it? - There was another poor woman with me, there were five more families in the house.</p>

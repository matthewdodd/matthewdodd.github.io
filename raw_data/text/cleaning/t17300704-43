             depos'd, That as he was going over Stepney Fields about Three o'Clock in the Morning, he saw the Prisoners carrying Sauce Pans, and perceiving Hawkswell's Pockets bulk out, he suspecting them to have committed some Robbery, therefore ask'd Hawkswell (the old Man) where he had the Goods, and whither he was carrying them? That he reply'd, He was in fear that his Landlord would seize them for Rent, and so he had come from his Lodgings; that he searching his Pockets, found wet Linen, which further confirming his Suspicion, he would not let them go from him, till he came to White-Chapel, and got a Constable, and secur'd them, except one Boy, which ran away; and having got it out of the other Boy, that they had brought the Things from New Gravel-Lane , the Boy pretending, that as they were going to get Bird's Nests, the Prisoner met them, and desired them to carry the Things for him; he went thither, and upon inquiry found the Prosecutors; and in coming over an Hay-Field, found the Boy which had run from him, lying in a Hay-cock, who carried him to the Farthing-Pye-Fields , and shew'd him where they had hid a Porridge Pot in a Ditch.</p>

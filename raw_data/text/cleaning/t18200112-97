On the 18th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was cleaning my room, and had my back towards the door, the prisoner came, and took my bonnet and apron off the box. I was turning round, saw something go out of the door, and missed them. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with them in his hand. He said,</p>
               <p>"Is this your bonnet?" I said Yes. He said he had lost such a bonnet as that, and was in search of it. I asked him if he had got a a search-warrant? he laughed at me - I took it from him. The lodgers came down and detained him. I ran down, and fastened the street-door. I then asked him if he knew any person in the house? he said No. The people of the house said,</p>
               <p>"Don't let him go, for we have been robbed before, and dare say he is the person." He gave no reason for coming there. The street-door was latched, not locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the room - A. He was on the landing-place. He could not get away, for he was surrounded by women.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My sister-in-law, who lives at Knightsbridge, was robbed of a bonnet. I was hunting for it; a woman, whom I do not know, sent me up there, and said it was there. I knocked at the door twice. I took the bonnet in my hand to look at it. It is my wife's bonnet.</p>

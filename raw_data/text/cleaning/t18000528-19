            ? - A. Yes; she had been five months in my service; I missed a great number of things, and at the latter end of April, in consequence of some suspicions that I entertained, the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things produced by Mr. Gordon? - A. Here are two silk gowns, they are my property which I have lost; these two table-cloths are mine; they are the same pattern with many that I have lost, but they have no mark upon them; the gowns were made for me, I wore them some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Upon the tablecloth you have no mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As she had a controul over your property, she might have taken one gown at one time, and the other at another? - A. She might.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stratford. I have known the prisoner some years; I have trusted her with large sums of money, and always had a very good opinion of her.</p>

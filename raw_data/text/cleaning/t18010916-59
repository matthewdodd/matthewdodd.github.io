             produced the other two bundles, which he took from Phillips, the contents of which were identified by Mrs. Clarke.)</p>
               <p>Crocker. As we were going to the office, Phillips told me he saw Nell come out with the things, and he asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he was going to a stage-coach to his sister, and asked him to help carry the bundles, for he said it looked aukward for a soldier to be carrying bundles at that time in the morning, and he told me he helped him to carry them on purpose to find out where he was going with them.</p>

               <p>Nell's defence. I was drinking a pint of beer at Old's house with this young man, and we stopped till it was too late to get into our lodgings; we went up St. Martin's-lane, and there were two soldiers sitting upon a step with these bundles, and when we came up, they ran away, and left them; we took them up with an intention of going to Bow-street to find an owner for them.</p>
               <p>Phillips's defence. What Crocker says is very false; I never said any such thing.</p>

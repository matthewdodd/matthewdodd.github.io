This box was in the window on the 18th of December; about half-past five o'clock in the evening the prisoners both came into my shop together, and asked for a watch-key; my boy showed them a quantity; I was in the back parlour, and could see their persons - they went out; the box was then safe, about two yards within the shop in the window; about half-past eight o'clock the prisoners returned to the shop - I served them then; they said they had bought a watch-key, about half-past five o'clock that evening, and the boy promised them to change it if it did not fit; I took the keys out of the window, and endeavoured to serve Flanner; he wanted a smaller key than the one he brought, and that was one of the very smallest - I took the whole quantity of keys out; he excited my suspicion by his anxiety to engage my attention - I heard a noise behind me at the window; I looked round, and saw Dullage close to the sash - I asked if he had taken any thing from the window - he said he had not, and then Flanner said he was sure he had not, that he was merely looking at the toys in the window - I did not miss any thing at first, but on looking under a work-box I missed this musical snuff-box; I immediately called my boy, and sent him for a constable - the shop door was closed at the time; in the mean time Dullage got behind Flanner - I looked round at Flanner, and saw Dullage in the act of drawing the box from under his coat; he then said he merely took it to look at - I took it from him.</p>

            . I am a ward-officer. I took the prisoners in charge - Mr. Back gave me the box; Flanner said Dullage had been looking at it, and it was very hard that he (Flanner) should be taken up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Dullage's Defence. Flanner had nothing to do with the box, and I only had it in my hand to look at - I never thought of stealing it.</p>
               <p>Flanner's Defence. I did not know he had got it; I believe he had no more idea of stealing it than my Lord, who sits there.</p>
               <p>MR. BACK. Flanner wanted a smaller key; he turned every one aside that I chose for him, took up several larger ones, and asked if they were not smaller, to engage my attention - he had brought no watch to fit.</p>

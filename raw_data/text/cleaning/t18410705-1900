On the 14th of June I came home to dinner, about one o'clock in the day—when I left the room the door was locked—when I came back I got the key from the landlord—I opened the door, and saw the prisoner and another girl there—they were locked in the room—I stood about half a minute, and then went and knocked at the other room door, to tell the people, and while I was gone the two girls ran down stairs—the people told me to ran after them—I ran and took the prisoner, and she hit me—I walked by her side till she was taken—I never lost sight of her—I went back, and this ink-stand was on the bed—this trunk was on the table, and the room was in a disordered state—I had left the room at half-past fix o'clock—my father locked the room door in my presence—the prisoner had a bunch of keys in her hand, and one of them opened the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Frederick Henry Ridley, of Broom<lb></lb>field-row, Maida-hill, Paddington. I saw Young about a quarter past twelve o'clock on the morning of the 18th of Jan., in my master's scullery—I did not know him before—he was not dressed as a butcher, but he had a page's jacket on, and a piece of beef in a butcher's tray, which had not been ordered—he left the beef in the scullery—I said, "This is not for here"—he said, "It is"—I asked where he brought it from, and he mentioned a name which I cannot recollect—I left him in the scullery, and went to the dining-room to ask my mistress about it—I came back in about two minutes, and found him where I had left him—I again said, "I don't think it is right"—he said it was, and went out—I followed him, and locked the door—I returned to the kitchen in about three minutes, and missed my mistress's gold watch off the shelf—it had a key attached to it by a ribbon—I know it was safe about ten minutes before—it was gold, and was worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite sure it was there—I made inquiries, and my mistress had not ordered the beef—I am quite sure Young is the lad—the watch has not been found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Young.</hi> I did not go out till a quarter to twelve o'clock, and was back by a quarter past; it was not me; you said it was ten minutes after, I was gone you missed it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I said in three minutes after I looked to see what time it was, and the watch was gone—there was no one there but you and I.</p>

I saw the prisoner's hand in my till; I was at the door, serving some potatoes - the prisoner had come to see me; she had lived with me three years before: I went into the shop, and she had fled - I pursued, and found her with another girl; she handed something to the other girl: I caught hold of them both, and demanded what she had got; she gave me 3s. 6d.; I found but 6s. 6d. in my till: I had seen 14s. there half an hour before, but I took a good deal while the prisoner was there; the prisoner ran to a hay-lost, and the officer took her there; I had been looking for her an hour or two in the street: she threw me down and struck me; she was a good girl when she lived with me, but she has turned out a horrid bad girl.</p>

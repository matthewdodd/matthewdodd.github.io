               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there not many persons passing? A. Yes; I saw them in custody on the Saturday following; I am a clerk to Mark and Co., of Mincing-lane; they were not above five minutes in my sight - I did not see Timson till they had gone into the shop.</p>

            . On the 8th of June I had been to Bow-common with my father, and on returning I sat down on Venables' step to rest, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; the two prisoners came up and told me to get up - another man was with them - I got up, and walked away; I then watched, and saw the two at the bar go into the shop; they came out in two minutes with the linen - the other man stopped outside while they went in - he went away with them; I am certain of both the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The two who came out carried the linen away? A. Yes. I was once taken up for a row, and held to bail; I was never charged with felony.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. When they desired you to go away, how far did you go? A. Five or six doors off; I went and told my parents of it, and my father sent Mr. Venables a letter - nobody was with me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you not say another boy was sitting at the door with you? A. There was another boy walking about outside, but not with me - that boy was brought before the Magistrate, and he was said to be a reputed thief; he told the Magistrate he knew the prisoners by sight - he did not say he had been taking a walk with me; they would not take his eveidence; I do not know his name - I have seen him about; I never was in his company.</p>

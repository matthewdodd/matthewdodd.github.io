            ; he said, he saw a man take the fowls out of the hedge, and I saw Sharp run along the river bank with two baskets on his shoulder, and throw them into the river off his left shoulder; and I followed him till he was taken. Afterwards, I saw the baskets taken out of the river; I am sure they were the same baskets that he had upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing of Davis or Hindes? - A. I overtook Davis in the Ashstead road, and I afterwards saw Hindes and Davis in Bedfont, on Sunday morning, about nine o'clock.</p>

When I came back, I saw Sharp upon the river bank, with he basket upon his shoulder, then he took some fowls out of the basket, and threw them into the river, I cannot say, how many; I did not see them taken out afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Foote with you at the time the fowls were thrown into the water? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hastings there? - A. No; I do not know who was there; I pursued the man, and took him.</p>

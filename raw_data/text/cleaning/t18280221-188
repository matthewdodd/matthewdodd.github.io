            . I am a publican, and live in Sutton-street. On the 15th of February I was lodging at the <placeName id="t18280221-188-crimeloc1002">Horse and Groom public-house, St. John's-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then the other seemed to employ the prisoner? A. They came together up to the cart - the other man took the keg from the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the other man dressed? A. I think he had a blue coat, a black silk handkerchief, and a white hat.</p>

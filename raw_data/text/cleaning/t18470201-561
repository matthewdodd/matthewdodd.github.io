                  </hi>. I am in the employment of John Colthard, a pawnbroker of the London-road. On Saturday, the 16th of Jan., about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my master's shop—I am certain it was him—he offered to pledge this watch and appendages—I suspected it did not belong to him—he said his name was Charles Jones, of No. 8, Webber-street, and he was sent by his father to pawn it—I offered to go there with him—he did not object—we wemt out—when we got to the Victoria theatre, he made a remark about the theatre, and I immediately missed him; and on looking round, saw him running up Oakley-street—I followed him down two or three streets into the Waterloo-road again, and saw him stopped—when I got up this box was given to me, in his presence, by a man who had bold of him—the man said, "He gave me this snuff-box to let him go"—the prisoner said, "I did not give it you to let me go, I merely had it in my hand—I took him back to the shop—he then said he had been sent by a man, who was waiting opposite the theater, to pawn the watch, and after he had pawned that he was pawn the box, and say he brought it from his father, and he was to have 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his trouble—he said he saw the man run away as saw left the shop together.</p>

On Friday, the 15th of Jan., about half-past six in the evening, I was in my cow-yard, and observed the casement window open—I had seen it shut close down before—I went into the room, and missed five watches, a silver punch-ladle, and a small wooden snuff-box, which has been produced—I am certain they were in the room two evening before—I kept them in a box—I had seen the window shut about half-past five o'clock, and found it open at ten minutes after six—the door was locked, and so it was when I entered the room—the window opens into the Horse ferry-road, and is about four and a half feet from the ground—it was not fastened—this watch is my property.</p>

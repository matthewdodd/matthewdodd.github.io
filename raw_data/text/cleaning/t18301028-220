               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Were you out with your gig the day before? A. Yes; I swear it was in the gig when I arrived at my brother's; when I was about to return it could not be found - I had cautioned my brother's young man not to take it out of the gig; I put the gig in the gig-house; I saw it in possession of the prisoner the next day, at six o'clock in the morning - he passed close by me; he saw me but did not know me - he got on about two hundred yards and I walked after him; I had been speaking to a neighbour when he went along.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the marks you speak of in the umbrella as he went along? A. No; I knew it by its general appearance.</p>

I met the prisoner in Pall Mall about seven o'clock one evening; he said he was in distress, and asked me to assist him. I gave him 18 d. - he then took me to Jackson's in St. Martin's-lane, I there gave him a 1 l. note. I waited there three-quarters of an hour with him; he then took me to a public-house in <placeName id="t18200112-113-crimeloc647">Covent Garden</placeName>

I was so drunk I do not know what happened after - he did not sleep with me. In the morning, when I awoke, four 1 l. notes and my hat were gone. He had left his old hat behind.</p>

He said he had the man's money, but he meant to come back and give it to him again. He had the hat on his head. Lebeau said he had given him 18 d. to get a lodging, and 1 l. to buy a jacket. Only 10 s. was found on him.</p>

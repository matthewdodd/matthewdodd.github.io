               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not the prisoner have washed these potatoes? A. Yes, he sold them in the mould - I never knew potatoes to be covered with pea-haum before - I did not take any from his shop which were not mine; they are not uncommon in our neighbourhood, but they are in the London market, though they are occasionally brought here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To the best of your belief, are these your potatoes? A. Yes, I can clear my conscience in saying that they are, from the pea-haum which is about them - the horse I saw at the prisoner's was a chestnut one, with a white streak down his face.</p>

            . On that morning, the 1st of February, I was coming to town about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning, from Bexley - I met a horse and cart about one mile from the prosecutor's - the cart was then empty, and was going toward the prosecutor's - there was no one in the cart but a person (who, to my firm belief, was the prisoner) was with the horse, and leading him - it was rather dark - I went round at the back of my horse and cart, and let the cart go by me - there was a chesnut horse in the cart - I came on to the half-way house and baited, and the same cart again passed me loaded, very soon after six o'clock; the man was leading the horse by the head - I have been to the prisoner's house, and saw the horse and cart there, which I have sworn to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you particularly notice the cart on the road? - I noticed it by seeing it twice; I noticed the size and the colour of it; I swore to the magistrate that it was the same to the best of my belief; I swore to the horse, but I did not swear to the man; I said, to the best of my belief it was the prisoner, and the magistrate ordered him to put his round frock on, but I had known him for years; I did not tell the magistrate that; the magistrate asked me if he was the man, and I said, by his height and size, to the best of my belief, he was; I could not see the man's face in the dark, but I was sure in my own mind he was the man; it was not dark at six o'clock, but he was then five or six rods from me; his back was towards me then, but I knew the horse and cart, as I had seen it so often; but I did not tell the magistrate so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt that the horse you saw going and coming, was the same you saw in the prisoner's stable? A. No; it was the same, and so was the cart; and from the size and appearance of the man, I have no doubt it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Dowling - I left the bury about six o'clock the night before, I covered it with pea-haum and dirt - the next morning it had been opened, and about three-fourths of a ton of potatoes were gone - I went to Rosemary-lane and saw the potatoes, which I have no doubt were my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not potatoes of the same description grown in the neighbourhood? A. Yes; and a good many fields have stiff soil in them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the cart? A. Yes; it was a smallish cart and smallish horse - I took a small quantity of potatoes away at first by the prosecutor's order; and I took the prisoner - his wife saw what was done - I took him to the magistrate - I afterwards went back to the shop, and took some more potatoes; but I thought they were not the same, and I took them back - his wife said she was ordered not to take them in.</p>

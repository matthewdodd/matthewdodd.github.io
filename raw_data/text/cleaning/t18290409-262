            . I live next door to the house where the lead was cut. This spoon, which was found on the prisoner, is my property - it was in my back premises; they got over the wall to cut the pipe off; the key was left at No. 20, and the pipe was cut from there and No. 19.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I was returning home, and passing by Wellington-street, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went down to see what was the matter, and when I had got about half way down the street, I kicked something before me; I took it up, and found it was a spoon - I put it into my pocket, and followed after them; when I had got to the top of the street, on turning round the corner, I slipped down - the witness turned round, and laid hold of me.</p>

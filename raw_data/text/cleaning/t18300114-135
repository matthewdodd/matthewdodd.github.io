On the 14th of December I went to my tea at a quarter before six o'clock, and the cheeses were safe under my portico, on a pile up to the top of the doorway; I came from tea in about twenty minutes, and said to my shopman, "Richard, there is a cheese gone;" he had not missed it - this is the cheese; it has my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know whether this cheese was on the pile? A. Yes - they were all marked No. 2, being of one particular dairy; I had sold some that day, but this is marked 24, which no other was - the shopman could not sell a whole cheese without my knowledge; there were eight of them, part of which I had put up.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOGG. I saw the prisoner in Rosemary-lane, with the cheese, on the evening of the 14th of December; it was in a small green bag, on his head, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I asked where he got it; he hesitated some time, and then said two men gave it him at the corner of Four Awl-court, and I might go and see them - I put him into a shop, and handcuffed him; as we were going along he saw two men, and said, "They have just cut down the lane now;" he afterwards saw his brother, and told him to go with me and show me the persons, and said one of them was named Phillips; I went with his brother to the City of Carlisle public-house - he went in, and two young men ran out; one of them we took, but the other, whom he called Phillips, got away - when I had that young man before the Magistrate the prisoner said it was not him, but Phillips gave it him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young man gave it me to carry, and I was to have 6d. for it.</p>

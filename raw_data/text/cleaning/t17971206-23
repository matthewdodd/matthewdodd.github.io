               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the handkerchiefs? - A. I missed the Bank-notes on Wednesday, so I looked if I had lost any thing else, and the same day, I missed the neckerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. The 22d was the first day that you missed them, but you had not seen any of the articles for four or five days before? - A. I had not taken notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you had not seen them within a week or ten days? - A. I have seen my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060041"></xptr>property, without counting them over, to see whether they were all there; I missed the Banknotes, and then I looked if I had lost any thing else.</p>

            , Painter;" I saw a woman, who represented herself as the wife of the prisoner; the front room is a chandler's shop, the back room they sleep in; the other parts of the house are let to lodgers; in a box, under the counter in the shop, the prosecutor being by the side of me, observed this handkerchief, and said, that is mine; I said, before he opened it, what should he know it by; there will be holes in the middle, says he, finely darned, the letter F in blue, and the appearance of a second letter scratched out; these were the words he made use of at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said finely darned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this box locked, or open? - A. I think it was open; the woman was standing by at the time; in another box, in the back room, which stood under the table, I found this cravat, marked with the letter F in blue; Mr. Franque said, all his things were marked with the letter F in blue; in a basket, in the same room, I found this neck handkerchief; the prosecutor claimed it, and said, he knew it by it's quality; there is no mark about it, but the appearance of it's being fresh hemmed; he had others which corresponded with it, in his pocket; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner was not at home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not apprehend him? - A. Not myself.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to the office voluntarily next morning? - A. I saw him there, he had been first, I believe, to the prosecutor, his wife being in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. One handkerchief was in the open shop, in a basket under the counter? - A. In a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mrs. Baines was a washer-woman? - A. I understand she took in mangling. (They were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Franque). Q. How long had you been in possession of these handkerchiefs? - A. I cannot say exactly, perhaps these four or five years, and this about a year.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter F would do for any other person's name as well as your's? - A. Yes; but there were two initial letters to my linen; I did not like two letters, and I scratched one out, and there is a mark of it being scratched out.</p>

Did I not come over and say I had been robbed of 19s., and that it was your money, which I had taken, because you were rather intoxicated, and had lost one before, and were you not so much in liqour when I first took you out, that I gave you some vinegar? A. That was before we went to the play; I was quite sober when I went to the woman's house.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the port of London, employed under the commissioners of the customs. On the 6th of November, about three at noon, I had the charge of an India hoy loaded with tea; there was near it a lighter, which was very close to this hoy, that hoy was loaded with sugar. I had received information that sugar was taken out of it. I went on board, and I saw the prisoner filling a handkerchief out of one of the hogsheads: before I went on board I called on one Chinner who was upon the key, and likewise upon a watchman; this prisoner was secured, and the handkerchief was found there, containing this quantity of sugar, amounting to seventy pound.</p>

Mr. Scott and I took up the tarpaulin and hatch-way, and we saw the prisoner; he was then at work, filling the handkerchief out of the cask; upon this we went down different ways, in order to prevent his escape that way; the other went the other way, at last he did come up: we secured him, and carried him on shore. Within about twenty yards after we got him on shore, he made his escape; he was rescued after that, it was three weeks before he was taken, he had been in our custody about ten minutes before he was rescued; and I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw under the hatches in that lighter, and no other person was in the lighter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, James Russell, in Brownbear-alley, Aldgate—I do not know the name of the parish—he occupies the house—he rents it himself—I was with my father and mother at the club-house, on Monday, the 22nd of June, in Glass-house-street—we went there at nine o'clock, and staid till nearly twelve—I saw the prisoner at the club-house about eleven o'clock—he was sitting there, like other persons—he was a member of the club, and lived two or three streets from us—he is a ballast-heaver—I stopped at the club till we received information that somebody had robbed the house, and then I went home, and saw the policeman in the yard, with the bonnet in his hand, and the prisoner with him—It was my bonnet—I had seen it safe about nine o'clock that night—I took my other bonnet out of the same box as it was in—It laid in the band-box, in my bed-room—the bed-room door has no fstening—the outer door was secured with a spring-lock—my father keeps lodgers—the lodgers come in at all hours—there is a cord through the door, and they pull that and open it—any body could open it, by pulling the cord—we had three lodgers at that time—I left nobody in the house when I went out, except a little girl, nine years old, who was in bed—her father and mother lodge in the house—I found none of the lodgers at home when I returned, except the man who caught the prisoner with the bonnet.</p>

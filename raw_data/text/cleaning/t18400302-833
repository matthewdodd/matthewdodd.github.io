                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Wiggs, who keeps a clothes-shop in High-street, Poplar. On Saturday, the 8th of February, the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my house about twenty minutes past ten o'clock, and asked for a halfpenny-worth of hooks and eyes—I showed him some out of the window—he said they would do—I cut them off—he took them and went out—after he was gone I missed a carpet and a flannel jacket—the carpet had been sold, and done up in a small compass to go home, and the jacket was on the counter—I saw the prisoner run up the street—I in<lb></lb>formed the police—while he was running I noticed a flannel jacket under his arm—Hale-street is near our house—I have since seen some hooks and eyes, which the policeman has got—they are exactly the same as I sold the prisoner—my carpet was a light one, with a little green, a little red, and a drab corner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and lire in Mary-street, Bromley. On the 8th of February I was in Hale-street, and the prisoner passed me—he was running towards the East India-road, with a carpet and flannel jacket under his arm—he took the direction towards Bow-common—he came from the direction of High-street, Poptar, and I gave information to Mrs. Wiggs.</p>

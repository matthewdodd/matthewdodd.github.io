                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Hudson, of Limehouse, and keep a coffee-shop. The prisoner Johnson, and one Steel, came to lodge there in the early part of August—they both came the tame night—on Saturday, the 20th of August, about six o'clock, Angus came, and inquired for Johnson and Steel, and while they were sent for, she asked me to go with her to buy a cap—I went with her to Mrs. Millens, Three Colt-street, where she bought a cap and bonnet, which came to a few shil<lb></lb>lings, and paid for them with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and directed them to be sent to my house—I afterwards went with her to Nathan's, and bought six shifts, which she paid for with another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I went to my house with her to tea, and in about a quarter of an hour Johnson and Steel came—scarcely a word passed between them—I did not notice what did pass—five minutes after they came they went away with her—Steel returned that night, but not Johnson—Steel quitted the lodgings the next Satur<lb></lb>day—Johnson staid till he was apprehended.</p>

On the 3rd of October I ap<lb></lb>prehended Steel, at Scotland—on the 11th of October I apprehended Angus, at Derby, and told her that I took her for stealing eight 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at the time she was servant at Arundel-street, Strand—she denied it—while she was at the police-court she said, "I did not take eight, I only took seven, and if you will go with me, I will show you where I changed every one of them"—I told her I had traced the notes—among other places, she went to Jones, the servant at Morrison's, and Harding, Mills, White, and Mat<lb></lb>thews—she said she had looked at the notes, and took them out of the box two or three times—at last she took them and went away with them—I pro<lb></lb>duced a watch to her which I received from Pocock—she said she bought that in Fleet-street, and would show me the shop—she said, "Johnson had it, aod gave me his old one for it"—I received the old one from her—I do not know what became of it—I received this letter from Mrs. Hudson.</p>

I took Johnson in Fore-street, Limehouse, on the 17th of September—I told him he was charged with being concerned with a female who committed a robbery at Arundel-street, Strand, she being the same person who called at the coffee-shop to see him and Steel, and who was at his lodging on the 20th of August—he said no female had ever called at that lodging to see him while he lodged there, and that he had never slept out of the coffee-shop any night since he had been there—I asked him where Steel was—he said he was gone to Scot<lb></lb>land—I asked if he had given any message to the person who kepi the coffee-shop about a bonnet—he denied all knowledge of the bonnet—I found two silver watches on him, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and several letters—he said the old watch his father gave him in Scotland, and the new one he bought in the street in London for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I must take care of the old one—he did not know the man—I asked if he bought the watch without taking the man's name—he said, yes, and he did not know the name of the street. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

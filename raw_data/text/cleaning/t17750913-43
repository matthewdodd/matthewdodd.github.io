            . On Saturday last, a woman offered to sell me four pieces of lace. I stopped them. My apprentice observed marks upon them, which he thought were Heath's marking, who was servant to Mr. Vaux. She told me she lived at Kennington Common. I sent to Mr. Vaux, and we all went to the house, of the woman. We found the prisoner there; and, upon the producing of the things, the prisoner confessed he took them from Mrs. Vaux's shop (produces the lace he stopped on the woman).

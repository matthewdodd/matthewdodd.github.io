               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her? - A. Yes; she dropped the things directly at my feet; five children's frocks, five cotton frocks, two children's great coats, five linen pin-cloths, a pair of silk stockings, and one diaper table cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things taken from? - A. Out of the room over the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that room open or shut do you know? - A. Shut and locked; I was the last person that came out of it on the Friday, and was never in it on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose room was it? - A. It was a spare room belonging to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of that room? - A. The key was on a ledge by the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the house-door broke? - A. No; it appeared to have been opened by a key.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first look at the door? - A. About five minutes after she was gone; between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the key of the door where you left it? - A. No; the door was wide open, and the key in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the outer door of the house open so that any body could come up? - Yes; it was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen the street-door before? - A. About an hour before; it was then shut upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her open the latch to come in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else in the house been out or gone in after you had seen the door safe? - A. It is an open warehouse; so that I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped her upon the stairs, what did she say? - A. She said, she was no thief.</p>

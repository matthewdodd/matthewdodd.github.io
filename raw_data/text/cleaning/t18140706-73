               <p>BENJAMIN JOHNSON. I am a city officer. On the 11th of June, I saw the prisoner at Spring Gardens; it was on the night of the illumination. I observed him an hour to and fro with the mob. I watched him from Spring Gardens to Carlton-house. He appeared to be by, himself. On my following him I saw him attempt many people's pockets, and when he came down to <placeName id="t18140706-73-crimeloc407">Spring Gardens</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18140706-73-crimeloc407" type="placeName" value="Spring Gardens"></interp>

I could not get up to the gentleman by reason of the mob. I could hardly stand, the mob was so great. I have never seen the gentleman again. I and two officers followed the prisoner out of the mob; directly he got out he took a silk handkerchief from his pocket and tied round his neck. He turned round; and saw Cooper, an officer of Queen-square. He ran in about two yards; we stopped him. I told him what I had seen. He said it was through distress. I searched him; he had seven handkerchiefs upon him; one round his necks, one or two in his hat, and the rest in his pockets. I did not know his person. I had only observed his actions that night. This is the handkerchief I saw him take out of the gentleman's pocket. It is a white handkerchief; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was out on duty this night. I watched the prisoner from Cockspur-street to Spring Gardens. I saw him attempt a pocket or two, and just as he got through the crowd I saw him draw this handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket. When he came out of the crowd we took him into custody.</p>

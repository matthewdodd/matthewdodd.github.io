               <p>On the 20th of November I laid three guineas worth of silver into a bason, in my closet. I live at <placeName id="t17901208-49-crimeloc265">the Cheshire Cheese, in Angel-street</placeName>

There was put by a crown piece, eight half crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences: they laid there about two o'clock; I had the crown out, and shewed it to several people in the kitchen: when six o'clock came I went to get change, and missed the crown piece, and with that I looked into the bason, and saw the silver looked very little, and took it up, and found it to be no more that two pounds-worth; I found there was gone a crown piece, four half crowns, and eight shillings; I did not know whom to charge it to; I had no one in my kitchen but my servant maid and this drummer, who was ballotted on me; I directly takes the servant maid up stairs, and had every thing searched, and found nothing. I takes my candle up and searched the drummer's room, and I clapped my hand into his grenadier's cap, and there I found my property; I left it there, and sent for Mr. Townsend, and we examined him in my club room; I asked him what property he had got of his own in his room? he said, no property there, excepting some silver, which he said was a four and sixpenny piece, and some half crowns, and some shillings; with that we went up stairs together with Mr. Townsend, and as soon as ever he was in the room, he fell-down on his knees, and said, the money was my property.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said to him, to induce him thus to confess? - He owned it before Townsend had searched one thing: I had not time to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Was this closet locked, or how was it fastened? - It was shut, but not fastened.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSEND sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of November Mr. Careless sent for me, and told me the story, and I went to the lad, and desired him to be called into the club room: when I asked him what silver of his own was up stairs, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080085"></xptr>said he had a four and six-penny piece, &amp;c. in his cap; I then took him up stairs, and when I had taken the money from his cap, and told him I should take him into custody, and to Bow-street, he said it was was the first time, and he hoped Mr. Careless would pardon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They asked me to tell them about it.</p>

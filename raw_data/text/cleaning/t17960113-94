               <p>I work for Messrs. Penton; the prisoner was employed by them. On the 12th of January, about five, or a few minutes before five o'clock, Mr. Penton desired me and Tilworth to go and mark some brass that was in the necessary, hid in some cinders from the furnace; Tilworth took out a pig broke in half, he marked one piece, with a small punch, in two places; and I marked the other piece in one place also, with a punch; we put them in the same place again, among the cinders; we returned to the shop where Tilworth works; and I got a gimblet and bored a hole in the wainscoat, and Tilworth bored another in my yard, which joins this place; he went into the shop to work, and I staid to watch in my own yard, till about twenty minutes, or a quarter before six o'clock; I heard a rustling among the cinders, it is a very thin partition, but I could not see any body, it was then dark; I looked through one of the holes, but there was no light on the other side; upon hearing the rustling among the cinders, I found that the person had got one out, because the rustling stopped; and in the space of half a minute, I heard it again; then I heard a person come out of the necessary into the passage that leads into the street; I then went along the passage of the house that I live in, they are parallel to one another, and at the end of the passage my street-door was open, and I saw the prisoner go by, and heard the gates shut, he went along the foot-pavement past me; I followed him about two doors, and spoke to him; I said to him, Thomas, where are you going; he said he was going to tea; I put my hand before his apron, and said, you have got that here that does not belong to you; he answered, no; I said, I was certain he had a pig of brass; he begged for me to let him go; he gave me a piece from under his apron; I told him I was sure he had more; his answer was, no; I rung the bell, and desired one of my shop-mates to send Tilworth down, and I sent him over to Mr. Penton's; in that time he gave me the other pig of brass, and said, he had never had more than half a dozen; then Mr. Penton came, and he was delivered to the constable, with the pieces of brass; he has had them ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. In what part of Mr. Penton's premisses did this brass use to lie? - A. In the cellar of the house where the manufactory is carried on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had access to that cellar? - A. We always had to go to the counting-house for the key of the cellar, to get at the brass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the business of one workman? - A. It was Cavernor's business to fetch it to the customers; he was the labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the cinders to see if the brass was gone?</p>
               <p>Tilworth. I did, my Lord; they were then flat again.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for on the 12th of January, about seven o'clock; when I came up, the prisoner and the two witnesses were all together; he had been stopped before I came. This brass(producing it) was delivered to me; I have had it ever since.(The punches were produced in Court, and fitted to the marks in the brass).</p>
               <p>Mr. Penton. It came from Bristol; they are broke before they come to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing about that brass by which you should know it, independent of the place in which it was found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had brass of that kind? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to it? - A. He used to come for the key to the counting-house whenever he wanted it; he used to have it once or twice a day; I think he had had it that day, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not miss it, I suppose, out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130153"></xptr>cellar? - A. It is impossible; I might be robbed of a ton and not know it; I have frequently from half a ton to four tons in my house at once.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these two pieces? - A. I have valued them at 2s. 6d. but they are worth 6s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Penton sent for me about five o'clock, and gave me two-pence for a basket of sand; at the same time, he knew I never paid more than three-halfpence for it; I fetched it, and pitched it in the yard; I went to look for him to give him the odd halfpenny; and, as I was coming back, I went into the necessary, and kicked my foot against this brass, and I picked it up out of the dust; I never saw the brass before in my life; I put it under my apron, and the last evidence stopped me with it; he took one pig from me, and I gave him the other.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

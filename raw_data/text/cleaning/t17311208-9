            . The Prisoner was committed to New-Prison on Suspicion of murdering and robbing Mr. Wayman. I saw him there, and he said he was innocent of the Murder, but own'd he took the Money, which was 5 l. 2 s. 6 d. and threw the Purse away for fear it should betray him. Was he Dead, says I; no, says he, for he rattled in the Throat, and I thought I might as well take the Money as leave it for another.</p>

             . Going from London on Sunday Morning, I met the Prisoner at Hounslow-Whelm , beyond Paddington-Hill, between Five and Six; and two or three Miles farther I found the Deceased lying in the Road. When the Prisoner was before the Justice, he at first deny'd that he met me, but afterwards confess'd it, and that he found the Deceased on the Road. I ask'd if he was Dead, he said, no, he guggled in the Throat ; and how, says I, could you leave your Fellow-Dumb-Creature in that Condition ? He made no answer to that, but said he found the Purse 2 or 3 Yards from the Deceased; and taking out the Money, threw the Purse on the Dunghill; I went with him to the Dunghill , and found it.</p>

As I was coming from Stanmore towards London, I found the Deceased lying in the Road, I thought he was only Drunk, but raising him up, I found he was Dead, and going a few Yards further, I kick'd a Purse before me; I took it up, and emptied it, and then threw it on the Dunghill; the Jury found him <rs id="t17311208-9-verdict48" type="verdictDescription">

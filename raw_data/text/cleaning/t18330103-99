            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of November I met the prisoner coming down Jackass-lane, in a direction from the prosecutor's house, about one o'clock in the morning; his head was bleeding - he appeared to have recently had a severe blow on the head; he said he had been to Uxbridge, drinking with some friends, that he had fallen out of a cart, and lost his hat; his clothes were not dirty - he had no hat on; I took him into custody; he had his smock-frock wrapped about his head - he was about a mile and a half from Mr. Dowden's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Uxbridge to look for a job, at Fowler's barge: another man got the job - I fell in with two or three coalheavers, and got a little too much to drink: they put me into a cart, to take me home; I pitched off the cart on some gravel stones, which cut my head; I got up, and about ten minutes after I found three young chaps by me; they snatched my hat off: I put my smock-frock over my head, and walked towards home - I was tipsy - the Policemen stopped me; next morning the serjeant looked at my head, and said, "Well, it looks like a fall, there is a little gravel in it; I shall let you go."</p>

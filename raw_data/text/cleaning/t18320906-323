On Tuesday, the 21st of August, between one and two o'clock; I saw the prisoner just pass my father's shop, I saw this time-piece in his hand - I knew it be my father's, and gave an alarm; he was pursued and taken almost directly - the time-piece was thrown down and brought back by a person who picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was he walking? A. Yes; my father had the time-piece for sale; I often saw it - I was in the street; the prisoner ran before me - I saw it in his hand; it was kept in our shop, about two yards from the door.</p>

            , West Moulsey-lodge, Surrey; on the 13th of March, I came to town to see my friends; I went into the city, and returned towards home about three o'clock in the afternoon: I parted with a friend of mine in Fleet-street, that was between three and four o'clock; I then took a hackneycoach to the Golden-Cross, Charing-cross, because I thought I was rather behind my time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your only reason for taking a hackney-coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What state were you in? - A. I was not in a state of sensibility.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean that you had drank too much? - A. I do; I was set down at the Golden Cross, Charing-cross; and there I requested of the prisoner at the bar to direct me the way to the White-Horse-Cellar, where the coach went from; he was standing near the gate-way of the Golden-Cross; he was dressed in a white jacket, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the stage go from the Golden-Cross? - A. No; I told him I wanted to take the stage to go to Hampton; he agreed to go with me, and I gave him fifteen-pence; I had a bundle, which I desired him to carry: He took me out of the road, but not being acquainted with that part of the town, I could not tell where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now know where he took you to? - A. Yes, to <placeName id="t18020428-59-crimeloc323">St. James's, near Jermyn-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. That is the direct road; what passed then? - A. He told me the Hampton coach was gone.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you when he told you that? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280069"></xptr>A.Near St. James's Church; I refused to go any further, and he desired to be satisfied.</p>

               <p>Q. You had given him fifteen-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He insisted upon having what property I had about me: I put my hand to my pocket, with a view of securing my watch; I had it in my hand, and he snatched it from me; at that moment a young man collared him, his name is Terry; he asked him what he was going to do with me; the prisoner told him I was his sister, and he was going to take care of me to the inn.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect all this, you are sure? - A. Yes; the young man took him into a public-house and sent for a constable; the property was taken from him, and he was taken to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose watch was this? - A. It was a watch belonging to the Honourable

             sworn. - I am a serjeant of the First Regiment of Foot Guards: On the 13th of March, about five o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and the last witness together; the was hanging on his arm, in Duke street, St. James's; seeing the witness in liquor, and the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, I supposed he might have been robbing her of that bundle, and I turned and watched him; I saw a red silk handkerchief in his hand, beside the bundle; a young man, who has since gone to the Indies, came up and intimated some suspicion; I followed him down Duke-street, and along Jermyn-street, to the wall at St. James's Church; the prisoner stopped; I went as low as the corner. of the wall; I then turned round to watch them again; I observed the prisoner attempting to force his hand into her pocket; I observed her pull a watch out of her pocket; I was too far off to hear what was said; the prisoner snatched it from her; I went up to the prisoner, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, what are you doing with this good woman; he said it was his sister; I said, if it is your sister, why not take her into some house, and not let her stand here to expose herself; as soon as I had said so, the prisoner made a start; I seized him by the collar, took the handkerchief from his right hand jacket-pocket, made him open his left hand, and took the watch, which I had seen him take from this young woman, from his hand; I conveyed him to a public-house, and sent for a constable; I delivered the watch and the handkerchief into the constable's possession.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was sent for to the Blackmoor's Head, in Jermyn-street; I found the prisoner and prosecutor, the serjeant, and Hatton, there; I found the watch and handkerchief lying on the table; the prisoner acknowledged he had them from her, but said he had them to take care of.(The property was produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This woman came to me at Charing-cross, about three o'clock, to go by the Hampton-Court stage, which goes from Charing-cross; I told her it was gone, but it would stop at the White Horse Cellar, to take up more luggage; she desired me to go with her, to shew her the way, and she would satisfy me; I went with her, and when I got to St. James's-street, I saw the stage was gone; she was very much in liquor, and asked me what she was to do; I advised her to go back to the inn, sleep there that night, and go with the coach early in the morning; she came back as far as St. James's Church, in Jermyn-street, and there, she said, she could not walk any further; she put her hand in her right hand pocket, and pulled out a watch and handkerchief; I told her to put them in again; she tried to put them in and could not; then she gave me the watch and handkerchief, to put them into her pocket for her: the serjeant then came up, took me to a public-house, and sent for a constable; I did not say she was my sister; I said I was assisting her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Terry). Did he say he was assisting her, or that she was his sister? - A. He said she was his sister; for I put the question to her - young woman, is this your brother; and she said, no, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not mistake the one expression for the other? - A.No, I am positive he said she was his sister. <rs id="t18020428-59-verdict324" type="verdictDescription">

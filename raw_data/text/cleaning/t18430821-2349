                  </hi>. I live in Clement's-street, Lymington. I was living in Frederick-street, Hampstead-road—about eleven o'clock at night on the 12th of July I was in St. John-street—there was a crowd and a fire—the prisoner was before me—he took the breast-pin from my shirt—I collared him—I saw the glimpse of the pin in his hand—he had caught my chin as he drew it from my bosom—he passed it with his left hand to some one behind—I never unloosed him.</p>

               <p>(Ann Fordham, wife of William Fordham, of Little Pulteney-street, Gol<lb></lb>den-square, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

On the 3d of August my servant missed a turkey - I went into the yard, and it was gone - I had seen it safe in the afternoon of the day before - it is what we call a milk-white one, and was moulting at the time - I know nothing of the prisoners - I also missed some apples from some small trees; I took some apples to the office, and what I saw there corresponded exactly.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Paddington. On the 3d of August I was going my rounds, and at White's-bridge I saw the two prisoners coming across the country; one had a bundle under his arm, and the other this basket across his shoulder - I took a different direction, and met them in a lane, and asked what they had got - Francis said, "I have got nothing, not much;" I said,"What have you got?" he then said, "A turkey, I bought it of a man in a cart at Harrow, for 5s., for a gentleman in the Borough" - I asked what part of the Borough he lived in - he said, he did not know; I then asked where he was to take it to - he said, to the gentleman's brother in Westminster - I asked where there - he said he did not know; I asked if there was any direction on the turkey, and whether it was alive or dead; he said it was alive, and there was no direction; I then asked Smith what he had got; he said, "Some apples, to make a dumpling;" I asked where he was going to to make it; Francis replied, he was going to his house; I asked where that was - he said, in Westminster; I asked what street, and what number - he said he did not know; I then took them into custody, and have brought the turkey here.</p>

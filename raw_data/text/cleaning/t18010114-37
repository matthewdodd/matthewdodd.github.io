               <p>Q. Was it the Saturday before that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Kirby). What is the date of the committal? - A. The 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lawrence.) Do you serve in the shop? A. No; Mrs. Gillham and her daughter serve in the shop; it was after candle-light, I had been out, and when I went in at the shop door, I saw these two <rs id="t18010114-37-viclabel209" type="occupation">soldier</rs>s; one of them, Malone, was in the shop, and Mrs. Gillham with him, he was standing by the counter, I did not observe whether he was looking at any goods or not; then I went away, and when I came into the shop again, he was looking at some stockings; I then saw a piece of brown Holland between Malone's feet, it stood on the ground, and leaned against the counter; then I went out of an errand, and went up the town, and when I came away, Malone pulled the door as I was going to shut it, and would not let me shut it; then I stooped, and saw Bolton go up to the door, put his hands in, and take a piece of brown Holland from within the door, Malone was within-side of the shop; Bolton then went up the town with the cloth; then I saw Bolton go over the road, and lay it down behind a tree.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see them do that? - A. Yes, it was a moon-light night; then I went on about my business, I was going up the town of an errand for another person, I did not see any thing more of Malone that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see Malone have the cloth, you only saw it lying upon the floor? - A. Yes; I saw Bolton again the same night, and Malone on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of seeing their countenances, you only passed through the shop, you made no stop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they dressed in soldiers' clothes? - A. Yes; I knew them both again as soon as I saw them</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, at Tottenham: I was on duty between five and six o'clock, as near as I can tell, I cannot rightly say; I saw the prisoner, Bolton, cross the road, I saw the last witness near the spot where Bolton crossed oyer, I did not see him come out of the shop, he came in a direction from the shop; I saw him lay something down, and he came back and passed me, and wished me a good night; he had then two others with him, Malone was one, it was a moonlight night; I crossed over the road and went to see what he had laid down, and waited to see who would fetch it; I found it to be a piece of cloth in a bag; I then sent a person that was going by to fetch another watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of these other two men at the tree? - A. No; they were all three soldiers; one of them had on a foraging cap, and the other a cocked-up hat, and feather in it; in about six or seven minutes one of them returned to where the bag was, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pick it up? - A. No; he came up to the place, but seeing me he would not meddle with it; he was neither of the three that I had seen before, he was out of regimentals; I took him into custody, but he was discharged; I took the bundle and the man before the Magistrate; I then went to the public-house, where I found the two prisoners; Malone was set at liberty, and sent to the cage on the Monday following; I apprehended Malone again in the ranks. (Produces the property).</p>

               <p>Q. (To Lawrence.) Do you know whose property that is? - A. I had seen such a piece of Holland as that upon the counter in the course of the day.</p>

               <p>Malone's defence. I never saw the cloth, or ever touched any thing of the kind.</p>

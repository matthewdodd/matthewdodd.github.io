On the 13th of October the prisoner, who had been once before in our shop, came and made signs for a pair of stockings; I reached him a pair; I made signs to him by my fingers that they were five shillings; he gave me a guinea to change; I pulled out the till and put it on the compter to give him change; he put his hand in and took out four shillings and sixpence, and laid on the compter, which I imagined he thought enough for the stockings; I took but four shillings and sixpence of him, and gave him change out of the guinea; I put the till in its place, and he went away immediately; I took the till out about ten minutes after he was gone, to set it right, because I do not give change out of that till, but as the compter was full I could not leave it to go to the other counter; I told it over and missed five guineas; I perceived by my eye there were some missing before I told them; I had told them about nine o'clock, this was about one; I had not opened the till all the morning before; after I told the money there were thirteen guineas in the morning, and eight when I looked at them again; nobody else could have access to it; in about three weeks after he came again, and made signs for a pair of stockings.

I live with Mr. Goldwell: I remember the prisoner coming in for the stockings the beginning of November; he made signs for a pair of stockings on the compter; we were both in the shop; the last witness said it is the dumb man; I said, is it the dumb man? upon that he ran out of the shop, and I ran after him; I thought by that he understood what we said; I called out; a hackney coachman pursued him, and he was taken and brought back in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

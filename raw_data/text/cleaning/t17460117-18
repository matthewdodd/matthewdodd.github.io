            . My Brother, Sir, lodges with Mrs. Nichols. On the 22d of December I went up Stairs to speak to him. When I came out of the House, I went over the Way in order to go to Church. I stopp'd at the Church Door to hear a Gentleman's Servant read the Gazette. I observed this Lad (the Prisoner) come out of the Shop with something under his Great Coat; I called to Mrs. Nichols, and asked whether she had lost any Thing. She said a Jack. I run after him almost as far as Christ's Church, and brought him back with the Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Jack?</p>
               <p>Wealy. when he came back he left it in the Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you, my Lord, I was coming along Aldersgate-street, and I met with one Wilks, who said, he would give me 3 d. if I would fetch this Jack. And the 'Prentice gave it me. <rs id="t17460117-18-verdict68" type="verdictDescription">

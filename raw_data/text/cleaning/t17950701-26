About half after nine o'clock I went out, on Monday, the 15th of June, and came home about a quarter after eleven, and shut up the house; on Tuesday morning I found a cupboard broke open, in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was this? - Between nine and ten o'clock, and I missed a quantity of halfpence out of the cupboard, I believe there was between four and five pounds worth; I went to my wife, and asked her if she knew what became of the halfpence, and to know who had been to her in the bar in the night, while I was out; she said that Martin had been there. On Wednesday I went and searched after this man. No person had got into the house, I suspect he was concealed in the house at the time we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person that got up in the morning? - That I cannot say, we have different people that lodges in the house. I went up after this man on Wednesday morning, and I was told that he had gone that night to the London Infirmary; I went down to the London Infirmary, and told him I had lost a quantity of halfpence, and I suspected he had got them; I took an officer along with me, and he said he knew nothing at all of them; I desired the officer to search him, and he found some loose halfpence in his pocket; then he opened a cupboard which he had by the side of him, and there the officer found a paper of halfpence; I asked him what he had done with the other halfpence that he took away from me? he said he never took any halfpence; and then I went to his wife; I went afterwards to the sign of the London Hospital, and there I found seven papers of halfpence, and then I went to the man where his lodgings was, and he had paid one paper of halfpence there.</p>
               <p>Q. What are those things you have got there? - These are what the cupboard was broke open with.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these papers are your's? - I have a brother here that papered them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the papers from the sign of the London Hospital? - The officer,

I did not take him into custody at that time, because the surgeon was not there.</p>

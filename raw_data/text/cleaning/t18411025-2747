                  </hi>. I am Governor of the House of Correction at Ilford—I had the custody of the prisoners. On Wednesday, the 6th of October, a letter was brought to me by one of my officers, who is not here—in consequence of what he said, I took the letter in my hand and went to the prisoners—they were all present—on my entering the yard, Wilson ad<lb></lb>dressed me, and said, "I am very sorry about that letter, sir; I am afraid it will do me serious injury; I was not aware that such a letter had been written, and it will do me more harm than all the money I am now paying will do me good."</p>

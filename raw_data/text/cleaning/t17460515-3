               <p>Q. Did they come to your House both?</p>
               <p>Corrock. Yes. I went up Stairs but could not find any such Things in the Name. When I came down the Door was open; one was within the House, the other was just keeping the Door open; but it was not 'till the next Morning that I miss'd the Things, and I had nobody come in but a Woman of good Character; so I made Enquiry after these People, but could not find them 'till Saturday Morning. When I took them they confess'd they had pledg'd the Gown and checqu'd Shirt; when I found them on Saturday Morning about Eight o'Clock, the Woman, she roll'd and twisted the Apron about so, that she had about her Middle, that I did not see it at the first. I said this is the Apron I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, did you find any Thing else upon them?</p>
               <p>Corrock. No, my Lord. Then I charg'd a Constable with them, and I told them, if they had a Mind to make any Confession where the Goods were, if the Justice of the Peace would acquit them, I would, could I have my Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, did they make any Confession?</p>
               <p>Corrock. Yes, my Lord. I was along with the Constable when they made the Confession. The Husband confess'd that how they both had them in their Possession; that the Woman had pledg'd the Gown for 4 s. and confess'd where they sold one chequ'd Shirt and a chequ'd Apron. It was the Man made the Confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what Place he sold the Things?</p>
               <p>Corrock. Near Wellclose-Square. in Rosemary-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Rosemary-Lane when they had told you; or did you go to the Place where they had pledg'd the Gown?</p>
               <p>Corrock. They had pledg'd the Gown in New-Street, and I went after it and had it of one Dupee, I think.</p>

               <p>Rickelworth. My Lord, I am an Officer belonging to St. Katherine's. Mr. Corrock came to my House with the two Prisoners at the Bar, the 10th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what then?</p>
               <p>Rickelworth. Then I took them into Custody, and carry'd them to an Alehouse opposite to where I liv'd.</p>
               <p>Court. T he Prosecutor said he had lost two Aprons, a Shirt, and a Gown.</p>
               <p>Rickelworth. We sat down to drink a Pot of Beer, he (the Prosecutor) said that was one of the Aprons about the Woman's Side. She took it off and gave it me.</p>

               <p>Rickelworth. I can't say she did. The Prosecutor said he could swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Stephens. In Whitechappel-Road. I let these for 2 s. a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you let the Lodgings to?</p>
               <p>Stephens. To the Man. He gave me 6 d. Earnest.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the Woman was not with him when you let it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you let with it? What Furniture was there in it?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Please you my Lord, there was Bed and Bedding, and Table, and Chairs, and Grate, &amp;c. I let these Things with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell us what Things there were in the Room.</p>
               <p>Stephens. Please you my Lord there was a Bed in the Room, a Chest, a Fire-shovel, Poker, Pillows, Blankets, &amp;c. I lost a Blanket, please you my Lord, and a Pair of Sheets, and a Woollen Rug, a Frying-Pan, and a Saucepan, a Candlestick, a Napkin and Pillowbeers. I lost these Things out of the Lodgings whilst the Prisoner Donnington lodg'd there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this ago?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Five Weeks ago last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss the Goods?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I did not miss them 'till last Saturday Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say the Prisoner had them?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I was going out of the Door last Saturday Morning about Six o'Clock. My Business is a Fish-Meeter at Billingsgate. So they took an Opportunity to carry these Things out when my Wife was a-Bed and a Sleep. I saw them carrying a Bundle. So I overtook them? I said, what are you going away? No, said he, I am coming back to pay you at Night. I steps home again and takes a Ladder and goes in at the Window, and there I miss'd the Goods. I went after them down to St. Katherine's, and there I found they were in the Custody of Rickelworth. The Prisoner carried the Rug out that Morning</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the Rug here?</p>
               <p>Stephens. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not bring it?</p>

               <p>Stephens. I did not know I should?</p>
               <p>Q. What other Things did he own that he took?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I got a Search Warrant and search'd the House of Mr. Smith and Mr. Corrock; also a Napkin and Saucepan I found at Mr. Corrock's.</p>
               <p>Q. And where did you find the Curtains?</p>
               <p>Stephens. At Mr. Smith's in St. Katherine's-Lane. He had sold the Blanket and Sheet at Mr. Jones's. in Black-Horse-Yard. I went with a Search Warrant to this Broker's, and they had sold them. My Lord I want to know how I may get these Things again, for there are four or five of these Brokers join together to make a publick Sale every Month.</p>

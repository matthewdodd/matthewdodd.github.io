The prisoner was in my service, and left on the 19th of October - we had given each other warning. The night before she went away, the person she went to lodge with came to know if she was coming that night; that person left her umbrella, and took mine: I did not know where to go for it, till I met the prisoner in a day or two in Charlotte-street, and said to her, "You are the person I want to see" - she fell back, and said, "What for?" I said, "About the umbrella;" she said, "Oh, is that all?" I said, Yes, and desired it might be sent to me; she said,"Very well." I had missed the lace the day after she left - all the property had been locked up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found this lace and a piece of baize in the prisoner's box, when I took her, about a fortnight ago - she was lodging with two or three women; I found her in bed, and told her what I came for; she denied all knowledge of the things - the mistress of the house brought down the keys, I opened the box which the prisoner said was hers, and found the property.</p>

               <p>MRS. CORBETT. She always kept her trunk locked. I went out one day, and when I returned I found a drawer unlocked, and suppose I forgot to lock it - I had no other servant, or anybody who could hyave put them into her box - a skeleton-key was found on her.</p>

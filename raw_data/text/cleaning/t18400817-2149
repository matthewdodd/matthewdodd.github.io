                  </hi>. I am a victualler, and live in Balls'-gardens, Leather-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Friday, the 24th of July, I went to bed at one o'clock, leaving all safe—there is a grating in street at the back of the house, which leads to the cellar—it was quite safe that night—the cellar leads to the other parts of the house—I was called up about ten minutes before six o'clock by a private watchman—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170165"></xptr>
               <p>—I came down and saw that the grating was removed so as to admit a person—I then looked in the parlour, and found the press broken open, and two watches and a quantity of farthings taken from it—I missed a time-piece off the mantel-piece, some silver from the shop, and about 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver besides, amongst which were some old sixpences and coins—I lost great number of Irish harp-farthings, which I had been saving up for year s—there was one farthing of the reign of George the Second, and three or four others, which I could positively swear to—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I swear these are my property—the time-piece, watches, and other property, are quite lost—about three o'clock that afternoon, in consequence of information, I went to the Crown public-house, West-street—the prisoner had been there, but was gone—she had a stall at my door three weeks or a month previous to the robbery, and I had seen her at my house.</p>

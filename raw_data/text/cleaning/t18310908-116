            . I am the wife of John Grogan. On the 16th of July I was out with my husband; he got a little too much to drink - when we got back to <placeName id="t18310908-116-crimeloc634">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I came into the court, was not you laying down in a scaudalous state of intoxication, at the foot of the stairs, quarreling with your neighbours, and I helped you up; you said you should like to go to bed; I helped your husband to take your gown off? A. I was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>JOHN GROGAN. I have heard my wife's evidence - the prisoner was in the room; I put him out, and then fell asleep; when I awoke my wife informed me of the loss - I looked and missed all the property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FOWLIS. I lodge in Bull's-Head-yard. I was standing at my door, which is next to the prosecutor's; I saw the prisoner come down the prosecutor's stairs with an apron full of something; he took them across to an opposite room, in which room I saw the officer take him next morning; I saw him afterwards on that day going out of that room, with a man and woman who lodge there, with a bag, which appeared bulky.</p>

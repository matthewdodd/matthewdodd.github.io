             were present; and Hamilton and Williams were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have a house?</p>
               <p>Welch. I had one then. My house consisted of six rooms, besides the cellar, mostly in my own occupation. I have only men lodgers. My maid goes down before me every morning to clean the shop. I laid these things among the cheeses, and she asked me what to do with them; I bid her throw them into the hole. I was a little in liquor I believe.</p>

               <p>My husband lent the money upon these goods. He ordered me to carry these things up stairs. I put them in my pocket. They remained in my pocket next day. I thought no more about them. I have no locks of any signification. I thought I might as well keep them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Welch. She is my wife.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler upon Saffron-hill. I was at Mr. Welch's in November.</p>
               <p>Q. What day?</p>
               <p>Smith. I cannot tell. I served him with candles. I carried him some candles between seven and eight in the afternoon. Mr. Welch was standing by the door. Mrs. Welch and another woman came in presently. I spoke to Mr. Welch; Mr. Welch, and these two men were looking at a great part of the plate. Mr. Welch asked me if they were worth thirty-five pounds. I said I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what money was lent?</p>
               <p>Smith. Nineteen guineas, twenty shillings in silver, and some half-pence. (the agreement is shown him.) That is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it signed by somebody else?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; a woman; she set her mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote this paper?</p>
               <p>Smith. Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the two men sign it?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before, these two men signed it.</p>
               <p>Smith. I saw them writing. They asked me to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the woman?</p>
               <p>Smith. I have seen her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her name?</p>
               <p>Smith. They called her Mrs. Bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the goods if you saw them again?</p>
               <p>Smith. I might. I only just took a cursory view of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no inventory taken?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So these people borrowed twenty-one pounds; they shoved them into a bag altogether, and trusted them with Welch, without an inventory?</p>
               <p>Smith. He said his friend wanted to raise some money to save his being arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand Williams, to be?</p>
               <p>Smith. As shopkeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Smith. On Great Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived there?</p>
               <p>Smith. Going on two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Smith. I have known him eight years.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you see?</p>
               <p>Bacon. I went to Mrs. Welch's for some butter and cheese! two men came in: Mrs. Welch desired me to call her husband; he was at the Green Man: I went over for him. I told him one wanted him; he came home; these men were standing at the fire side; one said, he wanted a favour of him. Mr. Welch asked what; he said, a friend of his was put to a nonplus for some money, and wanted to make up a bill. I do not know the man, said Welch; but as to you, Hamilton, I have obliged you, and you never failed me; I am very scarce of money; what value have you; if I can oblige you and your friend I will; they made the agreement; they desired me to stand up. I stood up and signed it; he was to pay the money in five or six days, or the things were to be sold, Mr. Drybutter was with me at Mr. Welch's several times; for I kept the shop open to sell the butter, that it might not be spoiled.</p>

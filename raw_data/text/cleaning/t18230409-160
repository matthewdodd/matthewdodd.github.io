            . I was by Bishop's shop, and saw the two prisoners, and another man, stopping opposite his window, for about five minutes. They went about forty yards past the house, and then turned back. Welch left the other two standing opposite the window, and stood at the corner of Golden-lane. I saw King put his hand in his pocket, and give something to the other - he went over into the shop, and came out with a white deal box on his arm; King lifted it on the man's shoulder, who ran off down Golden-lane; I followed; they turned back, and asked where I was going - I said, home - Murphy was with me. King took Murphy's hand, and pretended to be drunk. Murphy said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go home." He said</p>
               <p>"No, do not be in such a hurry; come and have something to drink." During this time the man was going off with the box. King fell down, and Welch hit me on my neck, and I fell. I said,</p>
               <p>"I know you, and will have you." He ran down the lane, and in a short time Bishop came up; and at half past ten o'clock, I saw them all in Whitecross-street; and then I think they were in liquor. I sent for the officer, and got Welch secured that night. I knew him before. I did not want to take them, but my father said, they ought to be made an example of.</p>

               <p>"Let me go, and I will walk with you." I did so, and he rushed out. I followed and took him.</p>

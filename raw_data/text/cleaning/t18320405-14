The prisoner lodged at my house for a month, and on the 21st of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I left this property safe in my box in my bed-room - I returned at eight o'clock at night, found my box in the middle of the room, and all these things gone; the prisoner was also gone, and never returned - he left his working clothes behind him; he had given no notice to leave - he boarded with me, and worked for my mistress; I did not see him again till he was apprehended - the property is worth more than 5l.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On Tuesday night, the 13th of March, I met the prisoner in Hereford-street, Lisson-grove, and said I wanted him; he said, "What for?" - I told him for stealing a quantity of wearing-apparel from Paddington; he said "Come along,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050018"></xptr>let us go and settle it" - I knocked at my own door in Hereford-street, and asked for the inventory, and read over to him all the articles stated in the indictment; he said he had only got 14s. for the lot, and 3s. 6d. for the watch - I asked where he had pawned it; he said, at Harrison's, in Tottenham-court-road - I went there, and Meagle said there was no watch pawned for 3s. 6d.; it was produced on the 16th and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me it would be better for me to confess? A. No such thing; I knew his friends so well, I took pity on him - I have known him some years; he was going to tell me more, but I would not hear him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left my old clothes with his wife for a week's lodging.(Watch produced and sworn to)</p>

On Friday, the 9th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner standing by a man who was emptying a ditch; as we were approaching him he took to the field, and ran away - I saw him throw three fowls into a hedge; I pursued the prisoner about fifty yards, then came back, and took the fowls out of the hedge - this was about seven miles from Chingford.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Stoke Newington. The prisoner lodged with me about two months - on the Thursday night in question, I saw him at eleven o'clock, when I came in with a pint of beer; I asked him if they were all in - he said Yes; I locked and bolted the door - I had a pair of shoes to make that night; I began them at half-past eleven o'clock, and finished them about four - about three in the morning I went down, and asked him if he had a bit of candle; he jumped up in his bed, and told me to take it off the table - about five o'clock I went down again, to fill the tea-kettle, and saw him getting up, and putting on his smock-frock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you ever at Chingford? A. No - I did work at Mr. Plumber's, a shoemaker, at Laytonstone; I left the key of the door in the lock that night - my house is half a mile from Stamford-hill; I had nothing to do with the fowls - he left my house about half-past five o'clock on Friday morning; I did not give evidence before the Magistrate, but I was present. I am deaf, and did not hear when I was called.</p>

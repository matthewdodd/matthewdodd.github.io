                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Richard Cooper Goodman. He is a proprietor of a timber yard and premises in Comp<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerkenwell. On the morning of the 7th of February, at a quarter before three o'clock, I was awoke by a knocking at the door of the private house attached to the timber yard—I went down and found a policeman there—our shed has leaden gutters, but I had not been on the roof, and had not seen them—I went on afterwards, and found the gutters had been ripped and cut—I did not go to bed again till I had seen the prisoners in the station-house, which was about five o'clock in the morning—twenty-one feet of lead had been cut, about two feet six inches wide—I instructed the officer to throw it into a shed from the wall where it laid—it was not there when I went to bed.</p>

On the 7th of Febru<lb></lb>ary I was near the timber yard, at a quarter past two in the morning, and saw two men or the top of the wall—I did not disturb them—one had a blue coat on, the other a flannel jacket—one was sitting on the wall, and was heaving the lead up—the other was cutting it—I did not show myself to them—I went into a house, looked out of the window, and saw them plainly—I then came down and made my brother officer acquainted with it—I then got another officer, and he got two more—we surrounded the place before we disturbed them—they were at work for half an hour—we then got up over a blacksmith's forge—they heard us—they got down at another part, and there the two officers were—they saw them, and then turned back and got down another way, and were taken between three and four o'clock—I saw them—Keefe had a blue coat on, and the other a flannel jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman.

            . I am a shoemaker, I was at work in the shop; I heard this gentleman say, you have picked my pocket. I turned the corner, and saw him and a man close together; he had hold of the man facing the Dolphin door, it was dark; I am very confident a handkerchief came from one of them, and as there was a contest at the Dolphin door, I took a candle out of the shop, and went and found this ( silk handkerchief,) and brought it to the prosecutor.</p>

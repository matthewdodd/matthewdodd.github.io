               <p>Q. Was the stable close to the house? - A. Yes; after I had put up my horses I went in to eat my supper, and did not go back any more that night; my fellow-servant, the groom, slept in the stable; the next morning I missed my trunk, containing my leather breeches and great coats; I found the leather breeches the next day at Marlborough-street.</p>

            . I am the wife of Jonathan Jones - I keep a clothes-shop. I went into the yard, and when I returned I saw the prisoner standing behind the counter, with the pelisses in her lap; I asked what she had got - she could not answer me; I opened her lap, and found them - she fell on her knees, and begged for mercy; they had been in the window.</p>

I went in to cheapen a gown; I knocked a long time, and no one came - at last the prosecutrix came; I asked the price of a gown - she struck me, and said she thought I came with no good intention; she called the Policeman, and said she took these two pelisses from my lap, which she did not; she took them off the counter.</p>
               <p>RERECCA JONES. I had not been five minutes out of the shop - she had them quite closed up in her apron.</p>

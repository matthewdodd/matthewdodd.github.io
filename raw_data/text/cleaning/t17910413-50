The piece of gauze that I lost I saw before the magistrates at Guildhall on the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Did you know the gauze you saw there? - I did. There was a pane of glass broke of the factory; I did not see it the night before, nor the pane taken out, till after I returned from the City magistrates at Guild-hall: the room is a stoving room, where the goods are dried, and that room has glass windows, small panes; and one small pane was taken out, by which they could take away the piece of gauze.</p>
               <p>Then you knew nothing of this burglary till after some days, when you was before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>What time do they go to work in this factory? - Sometimes at three, but never after five, in the morning; our regular hour of coming away is eight o'clock in the evening; they that belong to this room go away sometimes at seven, eight, or nine, especially this time of the year, when overwork is done: they are hung up here, on tenter-hooks, on one side of the window.</p>
               <p>Is it not possible for a man, with a little ingenuity, in the day-time, to break a glass, while your people are at work, and yet they not see him? - They may.</p>

I told him I had not so much money in my pocket, I had but 5 s. I gave it him, and went to Grub-street; my wife was not there; I wanted to get a lodging, but could not; I saw an opening where I thought I might lie down there, where I went to sleep, and these people took me.</p>

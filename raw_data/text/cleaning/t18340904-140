               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen them last? A. On the evening before - there is no private mark on them - I was sitting at breakfast in the parlour, a little before eight o'clock that morning, and looking towards the shop - I was about twelve yards from the shop door - I had a pretty clear view of the shop - while I was taking my coffee I saw Tyson at the window, but I had no suspicion - it would scarcely take a moment to go to the glass-case - it was locked, but the key was in it - I considered I kept a sharp look-out, but a person might watch when my eyes were off the door.</p>

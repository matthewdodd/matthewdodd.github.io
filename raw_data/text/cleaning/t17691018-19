            . I had been at the Crooked Billet, in Little Shire-lane. Somebody said, Pray gentlemen come out, a boy has been robbed. I went out and saw the boy standing. The prisoner was brought back. He took and laid the bundle on the boy's head, and said, Come along, come along, I know Mr. Webb very well. I took him by the collar and said, I know Mr. Webb, I'll carry you to him. I took him to his house, and he was not at home. The boy said before the justice he received a violent blow on the side, and he threw the bundle down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180020"></xptr> and had not power to take it up; and that he believed the prisoner was the person that hit him.</p>

               <p>I was going through the court; this bundle was lying in the high way: I took it up, and had been some time away. A gentleman came out of a public-house, and said a lad had lost a bundle. I sad, I did not know whether it was his or no. I went and gave it him. He said he had been struck. He said it might be by me; he did not know who it was.</p>

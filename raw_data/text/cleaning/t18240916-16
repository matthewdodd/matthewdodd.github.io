I kept my hand on my reticule - he snatched it up, and ran out with it; I pursued him immediately, and did not lose sight of him till he was secured, and am quite sure of him. I saw him throw the reticule into an area - the servant of the house gave it me up. He ran down to the bottom of Bagnio-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is that court, two hundred yards - A. It may be; it was not dark - I was not much alarmed. The ball of cotton which he had bought was found upon him; a little boy came into the shop for some tape, but I think it was not while the prisoner was there. I saw him in the shop some time, for he changed the cotton. A gentleman stopped him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The person came into the shop close to you, and ran out with the bag - A. Yes. I became alarmed, but not till after he was brought back.</p>

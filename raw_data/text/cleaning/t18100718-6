I did not miss the shirt untill it was taken out of the prisoner's pocket. Before I had left home that morning, I had seen all these articles safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence about the door - A. I saw none. I had a piece of each of the gowns, I went to Mr. Cotton the pawnbroker, shewed the pieces, and desired if any body came to pledge the gowns, they would stop them and send for me. Between five and six o'clock the same day in the afternoon, I was sent for; I went there and saw the three gowns laying on the table, the woman prisoner was there; I saw her searched, a habit-shirt was found upon her; I knew it to be my daughter's.</p>

On the following day Smith was brought to the office in custody, I shewed him the gowns and told him he was charged with stealing them; he said, he bought them of a woman in Spitalfields for eight shillings, and sold them to Mrs. Jacobs for eight shillings; Mrs. Jacobs was present, she said, I bought the gowns of you, and you gave me an old shirt in the bargain.

            . I live with Mr. Cotton, 42, Shoreditch. On the 5th of July about half past five, these two gowns were presented to John Hall, the apprentice, by the woman prisoner, he brought them to me in the kitchen, I knew them to be the pattern of the pieces that were left with me; I came into the shop, and asked her if she had any thing else she wished to leave; she said, why, is not there enough; I said, you have got another gown in your lap, let me look at that; I detained her when I found they all three answered to the pieces that I had left with me. I delivered the gowns up to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the gowns worth - A. About sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I bought the property in the open street and sold them in the open street to this woman. When I have got money I buy any thing I can.</p>
               <p>Jacobs Defence. I bought the gowns in the open street; I offered the man half a guinea, he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180006"></xptr>take less than twelve shillings; I had no more than eight shillings in my pocket; I asked him to go home with me; I pawned my ear-rings for four shillings; I have the duplicate in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>- ABRAHAMS. Q. Were you in Wentworth-street any time, when you saw any thing pass between the two prisoners - A. I was, last Thursday week between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the woman prisoner buy three gowns of the man prisoner, she gave him twelve shillings, this was in Wentworth-street, he sold her the gowns and the habit-shirt, he said, he might as well give it her, as it was of no use to him. Them are the very gowns, I stood by; if the woman had not bought them I should have tried if I could have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sent for you when she was in prison - A. Yes, to know if I recollected the man that she bought the gowns of; I told her yes, the next day I went into the fair and saw the same person, I gave him in charge directly.</p>
               <p>Jacobs called eight witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

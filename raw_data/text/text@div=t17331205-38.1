               <p>John Chin. The Prisoner work'd with me in my Work-shop in the Garret ; I lost Wool several times d, and knew not who to suspect; at last one of my Men told me he had found the Thief, and that it was Old Will. I lock'd the Door, and waited his coming down from the Garret; I stopp'd him, and said, Will. this Man says he saw you put Niles in your Breeches ; (for such Wool we call Niles) and putting my Hand to his Breeches, I felt something soft, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050020"></xptr> bid him pull it out. He said he would not, for he had got nothing there; upon which I sent for the Beadle, who took down the Prisoner's Breeches, and took the Niles out. Next Morning we got a Search-warrant and went to his House; as soon as his Wife saw us, she said, I thought he was taken, because be did not come home at eight a-Clock last Night. In his Room we found about ninety Pounds of Wool, a Pot of Soap under his Bed (the Soap is a particular Sort that I use) and a Bottle of Oil, such as I likewise use in my Business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had no Design to steal the Wool, upon my Word, for I am old and cold, and put it into my Breeches only because it was warm and comfortable. <rs id="t17331205-38-verdict171" type="verdictDescription">

On Saturday the 7th of April, in the morning, about six o'clock, my maid came and told me my house was broke open. I went down, and found the outside shutter of a window was wrenched off, and the things laid in the indictment (mentioning them) were taken away out of a closet. I went to Sir

               <p>Q. Was your house fast over night?</p>
               <p>Hynam. My parlour, which I always sit in, was fast, which I left about half an hour after ten at night. I am always the last up in the house. I had an apprentice which lay in the shop. When he heard the shutter fall into the room, he got up, thinking the cat had thrown something down. He saw a man with a dark lanthorn, and he was so struck, that he ran and hid himself in his bed again. This he told me was about four o'clock. The shutter was thrown into the middle of the room from off the hinges.</p>

            . On a Saturday, ten minutes before six in the morning, the prisoner and another man came to my house. The man said he had got some plate. I said, It is my sabbath, therefore I cannot touch money to-day. If you leave it with me, I will go and weigh it, and pay you in the morning. After they were gone, I went to Mr. Lazrous and Mr. Keys, and let them know that such things were at my house, and asked what I should do. They said, Leave the plate at home, and when they come, we will come and take them. At night the prisoner came, and I gave notice to them. I put the spoons and salts in my pockets, and went over to an alehouse and shewed them to them. I told the prisoner I would not pay him, without the other, his companion, was there. The other man never spoke a word to me.</p>

            . Mr. Lyon came to me about two months ago, and said he was linked in with a parcel of thieves, who came to his house with stolen goods; and as he was an old man, he was afraid of being transported fourteen years. He advised with us what to do. We advised him to stop thegoods, and come to us, and we would assist him. He came one Saturday, about ten or eleven o'clock, and said, there were a couple of young fellows that had brought some plate, and had left it in his custody. I took him to Mr. Keys. They were to come to fetch the money. He agreed to give us notice. He came at night to us and agreed to give us a call. We went to his house. The door was upon the jar. The silver was all there, the prisoner and Lyon were agreeing, they talked of four shillings and four shillings and six-pence. Keys secured the prisoner, and the plate. He desired me to stay there, and he would go and see for the other thief. The prisoner said, Do not take the plate, for where that goes I must go. Keys came back again, but the other person got off. (The plate produced and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

Mr. Lyon desired him to come again. At night he went down to Mr. Lyon's with some plate in his pocket, and some in a silk handkerchief. The two officers came up and took hold of me.

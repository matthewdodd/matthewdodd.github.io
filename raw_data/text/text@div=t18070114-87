            . I am an officer. On the 12th of December, at six in the morning, as I was going to put my horse out, I saw the prisoner with a firkin on his head, just by Petticoat lane, it was very dark; I asked him what he had got there, what is that to you he said; I said I wished to know, he said he should not tell me. I seized him by the collar, made him put the firkin of butter down, and took him to the watchhouse. When he was before the magistrate he said he was a porter, he was hired to carry it. I wished to find out the owner of it, I advertised it; by that means the owner came to my house.</p>

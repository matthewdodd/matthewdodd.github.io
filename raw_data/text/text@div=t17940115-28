            Have you ever been able to find them again? - Yes, I see them at the justice's office, in Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see them? - On the 9th, between twelve and one; the three square files were taken out of a cupboard in the house, and the half round files out of a cupboard in the shop.</p>
               <p>LEMON CASEBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable belonging to Hatton-garden office. On Monday the 6th of January there was a search warrant granted at our office, and I went and searched the prisoner's lodgings, he told me himself they were rooms where he slept, I found these files in a tub, under his bed's head, I took the files and brought the prisoner to the office, I have had the care of the files ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to tell you they were in his rooms? - He said he bought the files in Rag Fair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you they were in his rooms? - He did not tell me they were in his rooms, we were talking as we were going to the office about something or other, that was the way it came out; here are six files which I found in a box of his, which are finished files.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are those six files found in the box in the indictment? - Yes, they are all in the indictment, they are half round files, on the half round files I put a single H. on the tang of them, the letter is struck on the steel.</p>
               <p>

            Does that appear on all these half round files? - No, not on all, about half a dozen of them, the others I know from the work.</p>
               <p>Q. The three square files what do you say to them, are any of them marked? - None of them are marked, none of these were finished, I know them by the particular make, they are cut particular to any other, I am the original maker of them in this form.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be your's from the work? - I do, I have no doubt at all.</p>

I was going one day to buy a coat and waistcoat, and I saw these files laying on the ground, and I asked the gentleman the price of them, and he asked me ten shillings; I went to buy me a coat and waistcoat in Rag Fair, I bought them of him, I had them in my possession a considerable time; some time after that I hired a shop in Play House-yard, to harden these files, they were unhardened when I brought them; I observed the prosecutor say that the files were taken away in January, there is sufficient proof in the house where I lodge that I have had them a considerable time before that time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not say that I lost them in January; I missed them in January, but I have lost files several times before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any that were finished files? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed six? - I had missed a great many.</p>

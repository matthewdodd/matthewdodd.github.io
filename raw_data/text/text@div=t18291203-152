               <p>JAMES LICKFOLD. I am a watchman. On Sunday evening I saw the two women and Tanson on my beat; I told them to go about their business, and let the man alone- I am certain they are the women; they went into the King's Arms public-house - I went in to get half a pint of porter, that I might know them again; I asked the prosecutor what time it was - he pulled out his watch, and said it was half-past nine; I said, "You are sadly out of the way, it wants but ten minutes to eleven" - I told him to put up his watch, and went out; and at five minutes before eleven o'clock they came out.</p>
               <p>CHARLES TICKLE. On the morning of Lord Mayor's day I met the prosecutor in the street; he was in trouble, and I asked what was the matter - he described what he had lost, and described Coleman; I said I would get her in about two hours - I went into Old Gravel-lane, and took her with this handkerchief round her neck; I took her to the public-house, and the pot-boy said she was one of them.</p>

               <p>JAMES WAYLING. I am an officer of the Thames Police. I was with the other officers, and asked 
               <persName id="t18291203-152-person976">Coleman</persName>
             the name of the woman who was with her; she said she would tell me, and she would not get herself into trouble - that it was Ellen Conner, who lived in Seven Star-alley; that Conner had taken the watch to Bermondsey, and pawned it for 15s., and had pawned the seal at the back of the Borough-market for 5s., and all that she had given her was a little tea and sugar.</p>

               <p>Coleman's Defence. I had been at a funeral; I met this young woman with a man very much in liquor - they asked if I would take part of a pint of porter; I went into a public-house with her and a man whom I do not know - they had a pint of ale and a quartern of gin; the watchman came in, and I gave the glass of gin to the watchman; the woman then asked the man if he was going to have any thing more to drink - he said he had no more money; I went on to Fox's-lane, bade them good night, and went home; the next morning I met her, and she said she was going to get an affidavit of a gold watch, and asked me to go with her - I said I could not, but I was going for some little things, and I would wait till she came back; I waited, and she said, "I will make you a present of this handkerchief;" I put it on my neck - she said she had pawned a watch for 15s., and a seal for 4s., and while we were there the watchman came and took me, but she got away; I kept the handkerchief on my neck, and never gave it a thought - my friends came to see me, and I could have given it to them; the officer came and asked me the name of this woman, and I told him - the officers know me and my mother, and know that I work hard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Conner. What she says is all false; I know nothing about it, or her either.</p>

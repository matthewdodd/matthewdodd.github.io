On the 27th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, I was standing at my door; the prisoner came by - he was a perfect stranger; he addressed me first, and asked if he might be allowed to walk in - I said he might if he liked, but I had an old lady, her daughter, and son there; he said he did not mind, we would have something to drink altogether, and he would send for something - he came in, and sent my servant with 1s. 6d. for some brandy and gin, which was brought; he and the old lady drank the brandy, and we drank the gin - while my servant was gone he said he would give me four half-crowns to be with me that night, which I accepted; he gave me the four half-crowns, and I put them into my purse - he then sent another 1s. 6d. for more brandy and gin, and he gave 1s. for some cheese; my purse had 2s. 6 1/2d. in it before I put the four half-crowns in - the halfpenny had five holes in it; I had some loose silver and copper in my pocket, but could not say how much - we went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock; I took off my pocket, which had the purse in it, wrapped it in my stays, and put them on the drawers - I was awoke about three or four o'clock by my servant, who said she did not think all was right; I then saw the prisoner dressed, and standing near the drawers - he had been undressed when he went to bed; he heard my servant say she did not think all was right, as she had heard him about the room for half an hour - she said I had better get up and see that all was right; I got up, looked into my pocket, and said I had not got a farthing - I accused him of having my money; he said, "No, I have not;" my servant went for an officer by my desire - he was searched in my presence, and my purse was taken from him - he had denied having it, and said most likely my servant had it; when the Policeman came he again denied having it, but it was found inside the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - the Policeman also found about him two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; I can swear to the purse, and the halfpenny with five holes was in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Were you perfectly sober? A. Yes, with the exception of the share of the liquor I had at your expence, which was very little - some of the gin was left in the bottle; I had my perfect recollection - there were six chairs in my sitting-room.</p>
               <p>SARAH ADAMS. I am servant to the prosecutrix - when I first lived with her she was under the care of a gentleman who has gone to sea. On the night stated I was sent out by the prisoner, who was with my mistress, for brandy and gin; I had never seen him there before - he and the elderly lady drank the brandy; her daughter, son, my mistress, and I drank the gin - the prisoner took none of that; I went out a second time for 1s. 6d. worth more liquor, which was disposed of in the same way - I then fetched - lb. of cheese, for which the prisoner gave me 1s. and I paid 7 1/2d. for it; the prisoner went to bed with my mistress - he awoke me by walking about the room, but I cannot say the time; I slept in the adjoining room - I called, and asked if he wanted to go out; he said No - I laid down again; I heard him rustling about again for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070100"></xptr>about half an hour - I again asked if he wanted to go out; he said Yes - I said, "I will get you a light;" I got on my gown and shawl, and said,"I will let you down," but I first awoke my mistress, and asked if all was right - I then went down for a light; when I came up my mistress was standing with her pocket in her hand, empty, and she said, "Adams, I have not a farthing in the world;" I said, "Perhaps you have put your money somewhere;" she said, "No, I am certain I put it into my pocket, and rolled the pocket up in my stays;" I looked about every where I thought it could be - she then accused the prisoner, and said, "You must have my purse and money;" she said, "Give me the purse, and I will forgive you all, for my friend gave it me, and I would not lose it for the world;" he denied it, and said he had not got it, she might search him, and she did put her hand inside his pockets-I said to him, "You must have it;" he said, "It is more likely you have got it a great deal;" my mistress then cried, and said, "Do give it me, there is a good man;" he still denied having it - she then said, "I will not lose my purse," and she desired me to get an officer; when the officer came the prisoner still denied it, but the officer found the purse within the lining of his trousers, near the calf of his leg - he had denied over and over again having the purse or money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you tell the number of persons who were sitting in the room? A. Yes, there were five besides myself - I did not state at Worship-street that there were seven; I did not say, "Have you fleeced him?" she is not a person of that character.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLAY. I am a Police-constable. I was called to that house between three and four o'clock on the Sunday morning; I went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the bed-room - he was dressed; the servant had come for me; the prosecutrix was partly dressed - she accused the prisoner of stealing a purse, containing 12s. 6 1/2d.; he denied any knowledge of it till I found it in the lining of his trousers, just below the knee - this is the purse; there is 12s. 6 1/2d. in it - the halfpenny has five holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I deny having any money in my pocket independent of that purse? A. No - I found on you two half-crowns, two shillings, a sixpence, and 2 1/2d.; it was taken from you at the station, but the inspector returned it to you next morning.</p>
               <p>S.E. BOTTLEY. This is my purse, and the money in it; here is the halfpenny with five holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find in the deposition that she stated she had four shillings loose in her pocket, and there were not four shillings found - her servant said to her,"Mrs. Jones, is all right, have you fleeced him?" the truth is, she was in such a disgusting state of intoxication that I got up, and said I would not stay with her - when she got to the watch-house, and found I had more money about me, she wanted to make a further charge; I am a clerk in the City.</p>
               <p>JAMES CLAY. The prosecutrix was perfectly sober.</p>

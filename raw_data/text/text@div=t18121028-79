I enquired who Richardson was, she said she was a servant; she knew nothing at all of Brice's transactions, it did not concern her, I took the canvas and St. Ledger in custody. I found Brice at the office. I told him that I had stopped a man in his house with the canvas, and that I had likewise taken a bolt of canvas out of the cupboard; and I found ten new sacks laying about the room. I told him I had seized the sacks and the canvas; he said, he could give me an account of them. He never did. I kept him custody till the next day; then he went before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>St. Ledger's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the night of the 7th of October, I was going home from my work, I was accosted by a man in the street, he asked me to carry a parcel to No. 64, in East Smithfield. I agreed to take it there for a shilling. On the night following I met the same man and carried a parcel to the same place. As I was going into the passage, I was met by an officer. I am 44 years of age. I have served my King and country, in Spain and Holland; and have done my duty as a soldier, and for my universal good conduct I was recommended to the Board of Ordnance, and they have been pleased to grant me a shilling a day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Neale. How many bolts of canvas did you miss - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Brice's Defence. I declare myself innocent of the charge. I was not at home when the goods were brought, and when I was informed of it, I immediately told Mrs. Richardson, to tell the person when he called to take them away. I never saw the man or goods in my place.</p>

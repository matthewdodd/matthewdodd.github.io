            . On Sunday, the 27th of May, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, going to Cecil-street Coffee-house, in the Strand, I felt a jirk at my pocket; I looked, and saw my handkerchief in the hand of a little boy, and he delivered it to the prisoner: I seized him, and he delivered it to a third person; having nobody to assist me, I could catch none but the prisoner and one of the others. I carried them into the coffee-house, and desired the waiter to search them, but he did not chuse to do it, and I did not care to do it myself, I did not find my handkerchief, but let them both go. The prisoner was taken up afterwards, for picking another gentleman's pocket; then I appeared before Mr. Alderman Nelson, and gave the same account as I have here; upon which, he bound me over to appear: this is the fourteenth handkerchief that I have lost this winter; I have transported three persons, and intend never to forgive any that I can catch.</p>

               <p>I and another young lad were coming along the Strand: the prosecutor turned round, and took us both by the collar, and carried us into the coffee-house; after that, they found nothing upon us, they bid us go about our business. I never saw that young man since; he is gone to Bristol.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw Mr. Patrick by the North gate of St. Paul's; I had seen the prisoner a quarter of an hour before, in company with two others, rather taller than himself, but quite young: I watched them - they parted at the end of Cannon-alley; the prisoner remained at the end of the alley; I saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, draw a handkerchief a little way out, and put it back again; he then went to Mr. Patrick, put his hand into his pocket, and drew his handkerchief out - I seized his arm with it in his hand: he said he was never in custody before.</p>

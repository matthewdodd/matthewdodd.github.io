I had the care of this property for Henry Pearse, who lodged next door to me. On the 14th of May, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner on the landing-place of my room - the property had been in a bundle in my box, but he had got it in a handkerchief which was only tied at two corners - he asked me if Mrs. Williams lodged there; I said No; he came downstairs - I went up and found my door open and the bundle gone - I ran down, clapped him on the shoulder, and said,"I want to speak to you;" he said, "Me!" I said, "Yes; walk up;" he went up-stairs before me - I opened Wallis' room door, told him to go in, and I ran down to look for a man, and he got away - he was taken in about an hour - he was quite a stranger, and had no right in the house - I had gone out at eight o'clock in the morning, and left my door locked - it was not broken open.</p>

I was not quite drunk, nor was I quite sober; I found it so late, I did not care to knock the people up at my lodgings.

I had not been there long before the prisoner came into the vault, and immediately laid hold of me and began to use some indecencies toward me: she put her hand into my pocket where my wages was: I pushed her from me: she came again and endeavoured to attack me a second time. I pushed her off again when I had got up, and then I missed my watch, which I had not felt for before, thinking that secure, because my custom always was, and I had done so at that time, to twist my chain and key through a button-hole, that my watch might not fall out, but it was gone; I found I had been robbed. When I went up, I asked who that woman was? they told me. I went away to Sir

I am a waiter at the Green Man, in Bow-Street: the prosecutor asked the way down to the necessary; afterwards I saw the prisoner go down stairs the same way; the way leads to no other place but to the vault: she staid there five minutes, or thereabouts, and then came up again and went out of doors. The prosecutor afterwards came up, and said, he had lost his watch, and he charged it upon this woman.</p>

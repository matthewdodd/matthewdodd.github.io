               <p>How was the fact? - I had dined in the City, and walked home; I had been drinking but left off drinking before eight o'clock; I sat down to my dinner at past five o'clock at the London coffee-house; then I walked home; I told her, if I was sober I never could think of going with her; if I was drunk, I was not proper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250154"></xptr> company for her; she asked me to give her some money to drink; I told her, I made it a rule never to carry money of a night; then she put her left hand on my right hand breeches pocket, and kept rubbing up my thigh, to feel if there was any money; I had a new pair of leather breeches on which were very tight, and I thought I felt my seal draw up my thigh, and I took my hand and caught hold of the skirt of her gown, and she was going to leave me; upon putting my hand on my pocket I found my watch was gone out; I praised her ingenuity and dexterity, and told her it was a very good joke, but would advise her to return it, least it should prove serious; says I, have it you certainly must; says she, what the devil should I do you with your watch? I was leading her to the watchman who was within three or four yards; I saw one in Coventry-court; I charged the watch with her; he took her to the watch-house; I was asked if I found my watch, if I should proceed; I said, I owed it to the public, and I certainly should do it, whether I got my watch or no; I carried her to Bow-street, Sir Sampson Wright committed her, and I then went to the clerk of the indictments, who directed me to the Grand Jury; then I heard that a person had found it; I saw it at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. When she embraced you, you understood that she did it in an affectionate manner? - In a very affectionate manner.</p>
               <p>Not with any degree of force or violence? - Not at all; I have often met with attacks of that kind in the Hay-market; I did not find that there was any difference.</p>

               <p>I am shopwoman to Mr. Absolom, on the 19th of January last, about seven in the evening, I was sitting to work in his back parlour, and heard his shop door open, I saw the prisoner come in and thrust his hand through a pane of glass in the shew-glass,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230109"></xptr> it was dark: the shew glass is between the counter and the door; the door was on the latch, I saw through the glass of the parlour door; the shop door sticks in wet weather, it is difficult to get it open; the glass case was hung next the door; he put his hand through the glass, and took a white sarsnet hat, a pink ditto, and a black mode muff, the property of the prosecutor; some persons ran out of the door, and called out, stop thief! I lost sight of him for five minutes, till he was brought back; he was about a minute in the shop at first.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the person that was in the shop? - I did not see his face, but I saw part of his back and his arm, I saw his clothes were dark blue, he took the things with him out of the house; when he was brought back, I saw the things taken from under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time before this happened, had any customers been in the shop? - I really cannot tell, there had been several that afternoon, it might be more than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you or the prosecutor's sister serve in the shop? - The prosecutor's sister in general serves, but I cannot tell which served then.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know the latch was fast? - I am sure I heard the latch go.</p>

               <p>Court to Gunhouse and Smith. Did you hear any noise in the night? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is no circumstance that affects the prisoner Newton with the knowledge of this being stolen; the crime of burglary consists in breaking open a house by night, that is when it is so dark that the lineaments of a man's countenance cannot be seen, either with intent to steal, or actually stealing same property thereout, where it is laid for actual stealing: but it is accessary that the house should be broke open in the night; now the maid servant went to bed in the night, and did not get up till it was clear day-light; and in all cases you know, if it be a matter indifferent as to the whole of the charge whether the prisoner is guilty or innocent, the presumption is ever in favour of innocence; if, therefore, you think the house was not broke open in the night time, the prisoner must be acquitted of the burglary, for people are not to be found guilty upon conjecture.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have a watchman here that saw a light in my house about 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. They cannot call him now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. I cannot call him rioty, it is a dangerous practice, I have no doubt in this particular case, but the practice itself is a dangerous practice, if after a Judge has made observations on the defect of evidence, then the prosecutor is to come and supply that defect.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, as to the captain part of the charge you have no clear account that the house was broke open in the night as to the other part of the charge which consists of his stealing these things, of that you have such stronger evidence, they were took the 2d, they were found in his possession the 9th, and when called to give an account of them, he gives such an account as is not consistent with truth; that is a strong circumstance that he was the person that stole them; If you think there is no evidence to convict him of the breaking by night, you will acquit him of the burglary, and find him guilty of the larceny only; or, if you think he is not guilty generally, you will acquit him of the whole of the charge.</p>

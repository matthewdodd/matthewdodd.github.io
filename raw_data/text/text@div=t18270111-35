On the day he left we missed the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them) - the coat, cloak, waistcoat, seals, watch, key, and a pair of shoes, were mine; the other articles were my mother's - we missed every thing that night, and the plate was missing at dinner.

I found a silver bladed knife in his waistcoat pocket; I went to his lodgings in Bristol - he told me he lodged there; I found under the head of his bed a cloak; and in the room a black waistcoat, a pair of shoes, a great coat, a jacket, a silver Port wine lable, and a red waistcoat.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Bristol. On the 30th of November two table-cloths and four desert-spoons were pawned with me - on the 6th of December six tea-spoons, and on the 9th of December a silver shaving-box and stand, and six more tea-spoons; they were pawned by two females, to whom I gave duplicates; one brought the property, and the other accompanied her; neither of them was Williams. (Looking at four duplicates) - these are what I gave the persons.</p>

            . I know both the prisoners - they both lived in my service once, and at the same time; Davies entered my service in December, 1824, and left in the middle of September last; Williams was only a few weeks with me, towards the latter end of his time, and remained after he quitted.</p>

            . I live in Cumberland-street. Middlesex Hospital. Williams lodged in my house in November last, and left on the 28th of November; she had lived there three weeks, during which time Davies came to see her and his wife, who also lodged there - they both lived in one room. The last rent I received was from the prisoner Davies.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILLIAMS. Q. Did he come to see me, or his wife and sister? A. Williams slept with Davies' wife all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110022"></xptr>the three weeks they were there; they went away together in a coach, on the night of the robbery - Davies went with them; I did not see them get into the coach, but Davies brought it to the door, and when it went away they were all gone.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

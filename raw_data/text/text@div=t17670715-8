I lost the things mentioned in the indictment a little after ten o'clock at night, the 6th instant, from out of my room; I had seen them within five minutes of the time I missed them; I went to a pawnbroker's the next morning, to desire if any of the things were brought to stop them; there I saw my hat lying in the window; I wanted to know what name it was brought in, and in the mean time the prisoner came in; the pawnbroker said she brought it; I desired him to stop her, which he did.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Forsell, a pawnbroker in East Smithfield; the prisoner had used our shop for about a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come often with things?</p>
               <p>Beckford. She has come several times, three or four times in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you many such customers come to your shop?</p>
               <p>Beckford. We may have six or seven hundred in a week come to bring and fetch out things; she had had a hat in a little before, and she came and threw this hat on the counter, and asked for the other hat out; after that she brought a gown and apron, and wanted to pledge them; I lent her 6 s. upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend her upon the hat?</p>
               <p>Beckford. She had had 4 d. upon the other hat, and she took that out, and left this for four-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she lived?</p>
               <p>Beckford. She said she lived in Blue-anchor-yard, in lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you book every thing?</p>
               <p>Beckford. We do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you it here, I should be glad to see it; it would be a great curiosity. (The hat, gown, and apron produced in court, and deposed to by Mrs. Gibson.)</p>

            . I was at the Three Tuns in Wood's-close; when the prosecutor opened his pack the prisoner was there, I had never seen him before; I saw him take a piece of black handkerchiefs from the pack, and dropped them on the floor under the table; I believe the prosecutor did not see him do it, I was going out of the room directly at the time, so did not take notice of it, to mention it.</p>

            . I was at that public house at that time, I saw the prisoner take a piece of something black from under the table, and put it under him where he sat, and after that convey it into his pocket, by putting his hand through his coat; he saw me see him, he beckoned me to come towards the door: I went; he asked me if I would go with him, and see what he had got; I said, no, if he had any thing belonging to the pedlar, to go and return it to him again; he said he would; he came into the house again, I fell into conversation with the company, and soon went away, whether he returned it or not I cannot say; the next day I mentioned it to a shop-mate, and we went and let the landlady know of it, by which means the prosecutor came to the knowledge of it.</p>

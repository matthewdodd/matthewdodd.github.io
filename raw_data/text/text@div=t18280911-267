            . On the 26th of August I was on duty in the Hornsey-road. I was called, and saw the watchman search the prisoner - he found 4 1/2d. in one of his pockets; I followed them to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner put his left hand behind him, take out this pocket-book, and throw into the road - I took it up, and asked the prisoner what he threw it there for - he said"He knew he threw it away; and not to ask him that foolish question;" I asked the prosecutrix if that was her's, and she said it was, and one of the strings she had sewn on it - I then asked the prisoner what he had done with the money; he said 1s. 6d. he had spent in the public-house - he did not appear tipsy.</p>

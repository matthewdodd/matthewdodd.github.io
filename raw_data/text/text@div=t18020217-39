               <p>ANN IVES sworn. - On Saturday, the 6th of this month, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner at the bar was sent to fetch some pots to scour; I live in the house in which my aunt lives, who employs the prisoner; she was sent to Mr. Everitt's, and, on her return, about half past nine o'clock, I saw her come on tip-toe, into the passage of the house where my aunt lives; she took the basket from off her head, and placed it on the bannisters of the one pair of stairs; from there she placed it in the passage against the back parlour door; she took either a pint or a quart pot out of the basket, but her hand concealing a part of it, I could not tell which, and put it into her pocket; after that she went down stairs, and, on my going down, I met her coming up stairs again to fetch some more pots from another house to be cleaned; she took down the remainder of the pots, and brought up an empty basket to fetch another load; upon her return back with that load, it was not then ten o'clock, I said to her, Mrs. Spooner, you must now deliver to me the property that you have in your pocket belonging to Mr. Everitt; upon that she refused, and very stoutly resisted; I then said, I saw her put pots in her pocket; she then pulled out a small pocket; I said, upon my soul, that will not do, I saw you put pots in your pocket; I then shook her by the side, and, to my great surprise, these two pots sell out of her pocket; I did not expect to find more than one; I, not knowing the law, was afraid to take them, and made her return them to the; she gave me a pint first, and then a quart; when she had given them, she said, there, now you have got them, you can neither prove me a thief, nor yet transport me. (The pots were produced, and identified by Everitt.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to Mr. Everitt's, the basket would not hold all the pots, and I put these into my pocket; I did not take them out of the house; but when Mrs. Ives charged me with it, I gave her them directly; I had worked a year and a half for her aunt; she said she would transport me, and if she could not Mr. Everitt should.</p>

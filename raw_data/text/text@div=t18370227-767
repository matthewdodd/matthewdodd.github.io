                  </hi>. I live in Upper Ogle-street, Marylebona. I have known Cochrane nearly three years, by his lodging at the Gloster tap—on Wednesday morning, the 8th of February, I was told that he was passing my window—I sent for him, and asked him to have something—he said he did not care—I sent for a quartern of gin—he went away—the next evening I went out at half-past six o'clock, and locked up the front parlour, where I live—I returned about half-past eleven o'clock—I unlocked the street door, the parlour door was shut, but not locked—I went in and</p>

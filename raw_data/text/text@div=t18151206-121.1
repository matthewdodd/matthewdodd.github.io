            . I live in Cross-street, Hatton Garden. On the evening of the 16th of September, between five and six o'clock, I was walking up <placeName id="t18151206-121-crimeloc663">Holborn</placeName>

I then felt and missed it; I had felt it about ten minutes before. I was taken to a linen draper's shop across the way.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the public office Bow-street, and was in Holborn, at the time the prisoners were secured. I knew their persons perfectly well before that time; I saw them before Mr. Jones came up, on Holborn Hill, and watched them for the space of ten minutes. Just as Mr. Jones got by Hand-court, Turner went up to his pocket, and felt it, and the other covered him; they were both in company together. Turner withdrew for a moment, but they continued following Mr. Jones until he got to Red Lion-street; then Turner went to him again, and 
               <persName id="t18151206-121-person1041">drew</persName>
             a handkerchief out of his pocket, caught it up, and gave it to Perring; at that moment Barrett came up to me; he was following them and watching them, although I did not know it. We apprehended them, and Perring made some resistance, and at that time he dropped the handkerchief.</p>

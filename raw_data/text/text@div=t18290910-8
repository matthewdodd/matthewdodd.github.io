under his coat - I saw it fall from him, and picked it up; I took him to the street-keeper, and delivered it to Martin at the Mansion-house; he said at the watch-house that he took it, and asked me to forgive him, saying it was his first offence.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present when he said that? A. No; the constable had gone out at the door - I saw it drop from his coat on the payement.</p>

I am now out of business - I lived at Limehouse; but the apartments I last occupied were at No. 3, Sutton-street - I had the first floor there - all this property was in my apartments - the prisoner Lane's husband occupied the house - I took the rooms of her - Kinsman appeared to me to be a <rs id="t18340703-213-deflabel1186" type="occupation">char-woman</rs>

Lane fell on her knees, put her arms round her clothes, and said,"It is me, Miss, it is distress has driven me to do it; they shall be made right in a few days." My daughter then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030100"></xptr>said, "Are my father's things safe?" - she said, "They are not all there." I missed a variety of articles, to the amount of 50l. - some of them are here.</p>

               <p>MR. PRESTON. These are all my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Lane is married? A. Yes. for any thing I know - I did not see her husband when I first went, but he made his appearance some time afterwards - he was living there nearly the whole time - he left this country just before this discovery took place - I think on the Sunday before - he came out of his room and took leave of me - he said he was going off with the Coldstream to the East Indies - I have no reason to doubt that they were man and wife - Kinsman used to come and work there- I do not know whether Lane sent her out to pawn things- Lane said before the magistrate, that Kinsman knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often was Kinsman there for the last four or five months? A. Almost every day - she generally waited on me, and cleaned the room - she must have known the property was mine.</p>

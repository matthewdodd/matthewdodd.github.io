I had seen some linnen in a tub that day, which my wife had put there ready for washing. And in the morning my wife first missed her pocket, then her cardinal, then she went to look for the linnen, and that was all gone.</p>

My wife said she had not a farthing left in the world, and desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176302230003"></xptr> she would go and pawn a gown for her. She went with it, and the pawnbroker would not take it in. Then my wife, and she, went to the alehouse for a dram; there the landlord informed her, there had been a woman at his house drying wet linnen by the fire that night, who had set her up some drams there, and that he should know her again if he saw her. Then Knight said, do not be afraid about your cardinal, for a young woman brought it to her room: she delivered it to my wife, and went with her and me in search of Clements; and at Clements's mother's house, in the Coal-yard, there we found my wife's pocket; we took the mother in charge till we found the daughter: when she was taken, she confessed she had sold a shirt and a shift to a woman in St. Giles's for 18 d. which we found accordingly: we found one of my wife's aprons, not quite dry, at Mr. Desalear's, a pawnbroker, pawned in the name of

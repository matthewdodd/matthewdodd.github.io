The prisoner had been three weeks in my service before the 1st of August, and he had been with me before he went to sea - he had a box of goods to sell for me, and on the 1st of August, when he came home with his box, he put it down close by a quantity of worsted fringe; he told me he wanted a gross of Waterloo cord braid; I stepped for it - he went out with it, and when he was gone I missed the articles stated - he was to have returned with the money for the braid which he had of me, but he did not; I thought he might have put it into his box, but I looked, and found the box was emptied of what he had taken out in it in the morning; I went out, and a friend directed me to a public-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060098"></xptr>house, where the prisoner was smoking a cigar; I called him out, and asked what he had done with my property; he said he did it with a view to get transported - he afterwards offered me 3s. in part of payment; he had a commission on what he sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever receive money from me? A. Yes, when you returned home, and gave an account of what you sold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body on the premises who could have taken it but him? A. No; he put his box on the ground on the counter, close to the fringe - I missed 4l. worth of goods out of his box.</p>

On the morning of the 8th of October I was told the prisoner had gone out with a parcel; I followed him, brought him back to the shop, and asked him what he had in the bag which he had with him? He answered, Nothing. On examining it I found it contained 14 lbs. of string. I showed it to my master.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's servant. I have often seen Scott go out with bundles under his arm, when my master went to breakfast. I informed the apprentice of it. One day he was coming out of the cellar with a parcel, and saw my master coming from the counting-house, he threw it down stairs, but as soon as my master went to breakfast he brought it up, and went out with it. I informed the foreman of it on Friday morning when he went out, and he fetched him back.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 8th of October I was sent for to Messrs. Barkers', and took the prisoner in charge for stealing a parcel of twine. I took him before the Lord Mayor, and he was remanded. He said he lived at No. 1, Osborne-street, Bermondsey - I could not find him there. As I returned I found he lived at No. 1, Salisbury-lane. I went to the house, and told his wife I wanted some brushes, she said she had no brushes there whatever. I searched, and found a quantity of twine, and the rest of the property stated in the indictment.</p>

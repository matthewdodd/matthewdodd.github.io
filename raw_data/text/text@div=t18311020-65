               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you believe I intended to steal your hat? A. I do; it was almost new - the prisoner's was only part of a hat.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty, and saw the prosecutor sitting on the step - I saw the prisoner, as he passed, take his hat off, and put it on Horn, who jumped up, seized him, and took his hat from him; the prisoner ran away - I ran and apprehended him - I found twenty-nine duplicates on him for hats and other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the prosecutor drunk? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a man sitting on the step of a door, with his head cast down in a manner I thought injurious to him; I knocked him on the hat, and told him to awake - he said I meant to steal his hat; he struck me, and I ran away, thinking he would strike me again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arlington-street, Piccadilly. On Thursday night, the 16th of August, I was at the Opera—we went at a quarter before eight o'clock—there was a party of eight of us—we were coming away between twelve and one o'clock, and just beyond the glass doors which lead to the Arcade, in coming down the stairs, I felt I had got my purse and keys, and again, when close to the glass doors-about a yard from the door between that and the last opening, I heard a jingle of keys—it struck me it might be mine—I felt, and they were gone—the only person I thought could have taken them, was the prisoner, who was slow to me—I gave the ladies in charge to a gentleman, and watched the pri<lb></lb>soner—he turned and went back into the Opera-house-as he passed the glass doors, I saw the policeman—I told him I was certain he had got them—we watched him about a minute—he walked to a bar opposite the check-takers—he then put his arm across the bar and dropped my purse and keys—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the purse contained two sovereigns, two half—sovereigns, and four shillings.</p>

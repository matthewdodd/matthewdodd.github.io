On Thursday evening, the 29th of March, he brought me a ball of twine, as a sample of some, and offered it for sale; he said he had more, and that he took it in barter for some things, at 1s. 6d. a pound; he then offered me some at 14d. - I asked why he sold it at 4d. a pound less than it cost him; he said he had bartered it for other goods that he must have lost considerably by, and that he lived at Perrin's, in Charlotte-street - he went home, and brought ten more bundles, they weighed 5 1/2lbs.; I bought them of him - he had 8d. in money, and the rest in goods - on Monday, the 2nd of April, about half-past ten o'clock, Perrin came to me; I told him of this, in consequence of what he stated, and took the twine to Mr. Thompson, who said he could swear to it.</p>

            . I am a drawer in the Assay-office. On the 8th of October, I received three watch cases from Richards. I have two of the same cases here; they are for hunting watches - the other was a double case. The top part of the hunting cases we call the cover, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220036"></xptr>lower part, the bottom; in double cases, the outside is called a bottom, and the inner one the middle bottom. The stamp on a hunting case is a variable letter, denoting the year, and the figures 18, denoting that the gold is 18 carats pure, which is the standard - the mark impressed on the bottom is a crown, above the figure 18 on the center - a leopard's head on the left, and a variable letter on the right. The stamp on the bottom of a hunter would never be impressed on the middle bottom of a double case - that would be only a crown and 18. We call the flat surface only the bottom, and all the rest wires - we only stamp the bottom. A small bottom being introduced into large wires, would denote that all the case was of the same quality; it would appear as if all had been assayed. When I received these cases, I put the mark on them, and a private mark of my own on the bottoms and wires; then gave them to Richards to deliver.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of the same month did you receive any more cases from Richards - A. Yes, two hunting cases, and found they were the same as had been assayed on the 8th, except that new bottoms had been substituted - my private mark was upon all the wires, and in consequence of this the prisoner was apprehended. I searched his shop with two officers, and found a quantity of gold cases partly made, and not marked, and one loose bottom, with the mark on it, it had been cut out of a case, which had been assayed. We never stamp cases without the wires being attached to them. I found the prisoner's day book on his premises - here is an entry of two gold cases having been sent home on the 10th, to Mr. Tyrer; there is no other entry of gold work, having been sent out after the 9th, when these cases left the hall. The weight and prices of the cases are not entered - we went to Tyrer, who lives in Northampton-street, and found Bellows there; he gave me two double bottomed gold cases - upon examination, I found my private mark on the bottoms; they were bottoms of the cases assayed on the 8th - the wires were different, and had never been assayed; the bottoms had been transposed into new wires - the middle bottoms had the letter, and 18, instead of the crown, and my private mark was on them; they had been transposed from the covers of hunters; the new wires contained more metal than the original ones. I produce the hunting cases sent on the 14th, and the cases found at Tyrer's. The prisoner's shop is in his yard - there is a little boarding to separate where the gold is manufactured, from the silver work. Bellows gave me a bill of parcels, which corresponds with the entry in the book. There is a bruise on one of the cases found at Tyrer's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I believe you have been a watch case maker yourself - A. Yes. The bottoms and wires are manufactured separately, and afterwards joined. I believe the wires of large cases are stamped, as well as the bottoms, if they will admit of it, but with a different stamp; the business of a silver case maker, is distinct from gold case makers.</p>
               <p>Q. When a bottom or cover is stamped, it can only be extended by a hammer - A. Hammering, or going through a flatting-mill, that would flatten the mark, but not obliterate it; it would spoil the beauty of it The marks are perfect on these cases - I should think they had not been flatted. Cases are often spoiled in finishing after they are marked; they should be sent back to be remarked, we should then keep them a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not very common to put on another rim to save that day - A. Never, the case is always sent back.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the trouble and expence in making a new cover if the wire is spoiled, might not the workman put a new one without the master's knowledge - A. In a small shop, like the prisoner's, I think not. Whoever superintends must know it, as it requires gold to do it. There is no duty upon watch cases; the mark is to denote the quality.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. If a case is spoiled do the Company charge anything for re-stamping - A. No; the damaged part comes back with it. I only found two boys in the prisoner's shop; no journeyman. If the damaged part was not delivered to the master, he would find a deficiency. The cases produced do not appear to have been flattened - it is not necessary to extend it to put on a larger wire.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the value of a carat of pure gold - A. I believe about 3 s. 6 d. This stamp denotes that there are 24 carats, 18 pure, and 6 alloy; every additional carat of alloy would be 3 s. 6 d. in the manufacturer's pocket. One of the cases sold to Tyrer weighs 1 oz. 12 dwts., and more than half of that is the weight of the wires; they would be about 12 dwts. A carat is the 24th of an oz.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY, declined entering into the question whether the new wires were adulterated or not, the statute not requiring that proof.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's employ, and took the cases to the hall to be stamped - he kept no journeyman, while I lived with him, which was four or five months; he had two apprentices, who generally worked upon silver - he and his brother worked on gold; his brother had left him about a week before; I took the cases to the hall the last time - I took three on the 8th, with a memorandum, which I gave Richards, and next day I got them back, and delivered them to my master; and two or three days before the house was searched he sent me with two gold cases to Tyrer's - I had seen them on my master's workbench before. He told me in the kitchen that there were two gold cases on the board, and to go and get them, and take them to Mr. Tyrer's; I took them off his board, and as I was going along one of them jolted out of my pocket, and when I got there I found a brass edge and pillow plate had fallen out. I took a bill with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner superintended the silver business - A. Yes, and his brother the gold. I worked in the shop myself drawing wires; there is a partition between the gold and silver departments. My master always worked on the silver bench; till lately he worked on the gold. I believe his brother was canvassing for a situation; he did not leave the house entirely till my master was taken. I have not seen him since - I cannot say he has fled. My master attended to the gold work for a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended - he had vary little to do with it till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his brother the person who melted alloy and manufactured gold - A. Yes. His brother came back after looking for the situation, but did no work then. Before that my master principally attended to the silver; he had a great deal of silver work. I have heard high words<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220037"></xptr>between them, about his brother making a mistake in the gold work. I have not been to the house since my master was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have not been to the house since - A. I went next morning; they opened the door a little way. I was not let in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the brother at work on the day you took the cases to Tyrer - A. No. I saw the prisoner at work on gold cases that morning, washing them out - they were like the cases I took; I saw no others in the shop. I do not know how the brother was paid, or whether he was a partner.</p>

             attended to the silver, and Mr. Frederick to the gold exclusively; there is a division in the shop, between the gold and silver benches - you cannot see in the silver department what is going on in the gold. I have heard him and his brother dispute about mistakes in the gold business. I have not seen Mr. Frederick since my master was taken. I have been to the house. Mr. Frederick made the cases that went to Tyrer.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What was made by the brother - A. The two cases that went to Mr. Tyrer; his brother was not a partner - every thing was done for the prisoner's benefit. I remember receiving from a witness for the prosecutor two cases; they were returned to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they returned to you as having transposed stamps on them - A. Not to my knowledge; I was not told so. His brother left the house the day he was taken. He had ceased to work for about a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of the two cases given you by the witness - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say the brother left about a week before, where was he - A. Canvassing for a situation - he came home every night, and left the day the prisoner was taken; he managed the gold department till a week before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you seen the cases sold to Tyrer since Frederick made them -

            No. They were not altered, to my knowledge. I had not seen them since he made them. I have seen the prisoner go into the shop when his brother was working on gold cases; he was paid by the piece. I have not looked for the brother. I lived in the house before my master was taken, but have been with my friends since; trade has been suspended. I was never sent to enquire after the brother.</p>

            . I live in Kingsland-road. On the Thursday or Friday before the prisoner was taken. I called on his brother about a situation he was after, and saw him in the shop at work. I cannot say what work he was about - it was about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

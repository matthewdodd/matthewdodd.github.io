On the 24th of May the prisoner came to the shop, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; he said he wished to look at some boat-shirts - I showed him some, which he did not approve of; I then showed him some others - he saw a pattern, which he liked, in a window which was locked, and I went to the other window to get some of the same sort; while I was doing that I looked round, and saw him put his left hand into his coat pocket; he then walked towards me, and asked how soon I could get half a dozen made; I told him - he said he would call again in two hours; I looked him very hard in the face, and said "I am afraid you have something in your pocket, which does not belong to you;" I felt him on his left side, and found a bulk - he hesitated: I said, "No nonsense, sir, I must see what you have" - he then drew these nine handkerchiefs from his pocket - he had not asked for them; he had gone three or four yards to possess himself of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You know it is false to say I took them from my pocket; you found them on your counter. Witness. I did not, they were taken from your pocket - he took off his coat and gave it me, but not till he had taken them out of his left hand pocket.</p>

I deny the charge in toto - he asked what I had got; I said nothing - I took off my coat, and gave him; he was not satisfied with taking the handkerchiefs off the counter, but said I had taken them - I said it was not right; he said, "I shall detain you till my fellow-shopman comes in;" I sat down, and waited till he did come - he then sent for an officer; if I had gone to plunder, I should have made some attempt to escape.</p>

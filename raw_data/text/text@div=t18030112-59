He came up, in great agitation, and told me the house had been robbed; he desired I would come down as soon as possible, which I told him I should do; the prisoner and I then went into the kitchen, I examined his pantry, where he keeps the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you learned, from the prisoner before, what sort of a robbery it had been, whether it was of plate, or any thing else? - A. He said the plate was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that induce you to go to the pantry? - A. It did, with the prisoner; I found that the edge of the door, outside of the pantry, had been scratched a little, to make it appear as if it had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of the pantry-door? - A. He kept the key himself; I examined the door, it is a very thick door, the lock is inside, I saw no appearance of force upon the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner upon this circumstance? - A. I was afraid to awake suspicion, and I told him to go up stair's and lay the cloth for my breakfast, and make himself easy; and, privately, desired one of the maids to go for a constable; I tried the key in the lock first of all, and I found it opened and shut in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the key from? - A. Out of his pocket, I desired him to give it me; I fol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120030"></xptr>lowed the prisoner up stairs, and kept my eye upon him, not to lose sight of him, till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you found any thing before the constable came? - A. I had observed the drawer in the pantry where the plate was usually kept, I found it open, and the plate was gone; the constable came, and took charge of the prisoner, and took him away to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the plate was found? - A. I was not; I saw it afterwards at Worship-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. We know you are an officer belonging to Worship-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Jobson's house on the morning this affair was discovered? - A. Yes: On Friday, the 7th of January, the prisoner was brought to the office; I went to Mr. Jobson's house, I was shewn the pantry, the door, is painted chocolate, and the side of the door white; on the side of the door, by the lock, there was a little chipping on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. By the chipping, did it appear to you as if the lock had been broke? - A. It appeared to be done to shew that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could it be of any use to force the door? - A.Certainly not; I then tried the lock, and found it perfect; I then shut the door, and there was no appearance at all of force against the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Where did you go afterwards? - A. I then went to the kitchen-door, which commands the entrance from up stairs, which has nineteen steps to the kitchen-door, and there I found this box, which recieves the lock, lying upon the steps; and the screw of that door opens inwards from the house into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to get that off, must it have been got off inside the kitchen? - A. It must; because I looked at teh jaumbs of the door to see if there had been any force used on the inside, and there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of force as if the person had come from the area throught the kitchen? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose any person came from the area through the kitchen towards the pantry, did it appear as if any person coming from the area had opened this door? - A. No, the contrary; I was then shewn another kitchen-door, which leads to the area under the stone steps; I looked at that door, and there was no violence at all, and that door lock inwards, and opens inwards into the kitchen; after viewing that, and finding no force there, I shut the door which leads into the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, underneath the pavement, at the end of that knifeplace was a privy, upon viewing this place I saw a number of bricks, and I called for a light, I looked in the dust-hole, Vickery immediately called out to me, Armstrong, I have found the plant; I looked down the privy, and at the end of the privy, under the seat, upon the side. I observed something white; I then got the kitchen tongs, and moved a brick that lay before it, and this tablecloth was produced, tied up, and when I opened it, it contained these articles of plate, and two more table-cloths, and two towels, on the soil;(produces all the articles mentioned in the indictment); this chopper was produced to me in the kitchen, I compared it, and in the door I found the impression of this chopper, upon the sill of the door, where it had been chopped.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Soane.) Did you find this chopper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180301120031"></xptr>Q.What did you do with it? - A. I hung it up again in its place, and afterwards delivered it to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jobson.) Are these articles of plate your's? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. And these table-cloths and towels? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I locked my pantry-door every night, but the lock catches; I am frequently obliged to lock it several times before I can make it lock. I went to bed that night, and did not come down any more till the next morning; but Susan came up for the tinder-box. I know nothing of any body getting into the house; I am very innocent of what I am charged with; there was no occasion for me to have broke the lock when I had the key in my pocket; there is a door at the back part of the house that is very seldom locked; there is nothing but a latch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a building behind the house, but it is impossible any body can come in that way; it is only a way from one part of the house to another.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Green.) Had the prisoner any candle in his hand when you saw him? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there sufficient light for you to be able to see the face of a man? - A. Yes, I am quite positive he is the man.</p>

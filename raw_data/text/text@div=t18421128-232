                  </hi>. I am single, and am a laundress, living in Steven-street, Tottenbam-court-road. On the 25th of Nov. the prisoner came to the street door for a lodging—she said she was a servant out of place—I took her in, and asked for a reference—she mentioned all the trades people round about—she staid from Monday evening till Friday morning—she slept with me—on that morning she got up first, and was about the room for half-an-hour—I then saw her going out of the door with a bundle under her cloak—I asked where she was going—she said she should be back again—after she was gone I missed my black scarf which had been on the chair the evening before—I did not find her—I went back to my house, and missed the other articles, and all the money out of the child's money-box—the next morning I got a dupli<lb></lb>cate of the black scarf and the shawl—the prisoner was brought to the station on Saturday, with my flannel petticoat on, and my boots—she begged me not to appear against her, and she would give up my things.</p>

On the 24th of June the sheriff put in a distress on my goods, and Robert Fowler was put in possession—there was a sale—some of the goods were cleared away, and I took possession of my pre<lb></lb>mises again—I had authorised the auctioneer to sell up and give me the balance, but these articles were not lotted—it was not necessary to sell them—they were mine—on the 30th of June, George Arnold, who was the auctioneer's porter, came out with these two pails and these other things—he met Fowler and a woman in Old-street-road—I followed them, and saw the officer.</p>

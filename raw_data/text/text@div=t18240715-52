            . I saw the prisoner in St. John-street on the night of the 27th of June. I saw him put his hand into Mr. Soames's pocket; I collared him, and called Mr. Soames, who came back, and said it was his handkerchief. I took him to the office, and in going along he was nearly rescued from me.</p>

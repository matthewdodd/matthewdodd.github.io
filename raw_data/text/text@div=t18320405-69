            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Watling-street. I was with my sister - there was a crowd at the corner of Bouverie-street; I had great difficulty to get her through the crowd - she complained of her reticule being cut; I looked round, and a gentleman directed my attention to the two prisoners, who I saw running down Bouverie-street; I followed - they made two or three turns, but I kept them in sight; they were stopped near Temple gate; when I got near them I laid hold of Jones first - he ran to the wall; they were then examining the purse, which was in his hand; just as I laid hold of him he ran to the wall, and threw the purse over, at the back of some chambers - I went afterwards and took it up- I knew the keys in it belonged to my sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether any body had given it to him you cannot say? A. He had run a considerable distance - I had not noticed him in the crowd; there was a very great crowd by Carlile's - I raised a cry of Stop thief! when I followed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You never saw it in Wilson's hand? A. No, I saw him examining it.</p>

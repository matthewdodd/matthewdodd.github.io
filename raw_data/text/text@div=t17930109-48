               <p>I am one of the patroles under the direction of Sir Sampson Wright; nearly about six o'clock on Wednesday night I saw the prisoner at the bar carrying a strap of pots over his shoulder; I followed him from nearly the end of Great Queen-street that come into Drury-lane, up into Lewkener's-lane, and he went on about ten yards, and there I asked him where he had brought them pots from? he said, he was taking of them for his master; I asked him what his master's name was; and he could not tell me; I asked him where his master lived; he said, he keeps the Bull's head lower down in the same street, and if I was to go with him he would shew me the place; a soldier coming by I commanded him in the King's name to aid and abet; we brought him from there to a house in Drury-lane, and I saw that the Cross keys, Long-acre, was on the pots; I took him then into the first public house, Drury-lane; after we came down Lewkener's-lane we took him into a coal shed, he began to be fractious then, and then he

               <p>Prisoner. Pray when you laid hold of me first did not you take my hat away and knocked me down with a stick? - I did not knock him down with a stick; I did not take his hat away; I never struck him; at the time the soldier and me were bringing him along, one of his shoes slipped off and his hat fell off.</p>

(The pots deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any knife? - He was striking the patrole, with that he cut me on the back of my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Drury-lane and I met a man with these pots, and he said, his pot boy was gone away and if I would carry them to the Bull's head in Lewkener's-lane he would give me 6 d. and that man would not let me go with them, and he would not go along with me; as to drawing my knife I never drew it at all, it is not my knife.</p>

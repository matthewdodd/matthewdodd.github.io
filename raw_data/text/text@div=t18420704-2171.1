                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Union-street, Borough. On Tuesday night, the 21st of June, I was proceeding home from Tooley-street, between twelve and one o'clock—Brown and two other females stopped me, and in about a minute Brown put her hand into my pocket, and took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I seized hold of her hand, and in a minute or two afterwards M'Kew and another young man came up—they en<lb></lb>tered into conversation with the females, and made me let go of Brown—they began shuffling about, and got me into the road, and M'Kew said, "Take no notice of it, I will make all right"—I said, "You had better keep your distance from me; I don't want any conversation with you, or else you will no doubt share the fate of the person who has robbed me"—I could see no policeman—M'Kew went back to the women again, and told them to go with him, and they proceeded on down under the arches—I was following, and M'Kew saw me following, he struck me, and threw me down, and ran his fist in my face—he dared me to make resist<lb></lb>ance till the others got away—he then laughed at me—I said I would follow him if the rest had got away—he was making his way to go to St. Thomas-street, and I was calling out, "Stop thief"—Mr. Grinsell's pri<lb></lb>vate watchman stopped him, and gave him in charge—I went to the sta<lb></lb>tion with him, then came back, and searched about Tooley-street to see if I could find any of the others—I could not, and about three o'clock the policeman persuaded me to go home—as I was going, I saw Brown and two other women with her—I went to look at her—she saw I took notice of her, and turned round—the other women said, "Is that him?"—Brown said, "Yes," and she proceeded down some back streets to getaway, but I saw a policeman, and gave her in charge.</p>

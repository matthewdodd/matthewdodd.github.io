               <p>Q. Did you let her remain in the house after that time?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Yes, I did; she said she had a brother come from sea, that he was ill, and she was forced to take them to help him, and said she would get them again the Saturday following. I employed her as a chairwoman, and the next morning when I came to look for my spoons, one of them was gone. I found it had been pawned in her name, but she said her sister pawned it.</p>

            . I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. The Prisoner was continued in the house after she took these things, and she went quite off that night. She took a couple of shifts, a child's dimitty coat, a long lawn apron, and a calico apron of mine. She confessed before the Justice that she took them, and pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say in excuse?</p>
               <p>Platt. She said she designed to fetch them back, and she told us where they were pawned: I had two shirts from Mr. Harrison's.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 28th of May I was in Corn-hill, and saw the two prisoners between eight and nine o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing at the window of No. 25; I watched them, and saw Johnson scraping the putty off the window; he left pff when there was no carriage coming by, and went and stood under a court; but when a carriage came by he went to the window to work—they went backwards and forwards—a piece was taken out of the glass—I then saw Johnson put a piece of wire in the window, and move the things—the wire got hold of a scarf—I then went to look for a patrol, and when I came back I found them in custody—I had not seen them take the scarf out, but it was moved towards them—they were together—I went and examined the window, and saw the wire hooked into another scarf ready to be pulled out—it was not the one I had first seen.</p>

On the evening of the 28th of May I was going along Cornhill, between eight and nine o'clock—I saw both the prisoners at the corner window—it was Mrs. Evans's shop, a hosier's—I delivered a parcel lower down the street, and when I came back I saw a hole cut in the window, and the two prisoners standing a short distance off—I went</p>

On Monday even<lb></lb>ing, the 28th of May, a little before nine o'clock, I was on duty in Birchim-lane; in consequence of what Wilson said, I went back with him, concealed the collar of my coat, and got before the window, where I saw the two prisoners, and pinned them just on the window, exactly on the spot where the hole was cut in the glass—I seized Johnson, pulled him into the shop, and shut the door—Wilson produced this black scarf in the shop, and gave it to me—I have had it ever since—I searched Melvin at the station-house, and found two instruments on him for starring glass, and picking out the putty; and a piece of wire was given to me in the street by Thomas.</p>

I carry on the business of a hosier there, in partnership with Jane Griffin—she is married, but carries on business there as a single woman—we both live in the house, sleep there, and take our meals—we have the whole house—her husband sleeps and lives there—on the evening of the 28th of May, Sherwood brought the prisoners into the shop, and asked me if that scarf belonged to me, which he produced—it belongs to us, I knew it again—it had my mark upon it—I had put it into the window about six o'clock—it is worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I looked at the window which had been cut, the scarf gone, and every thing in disorder—the window was quite perfect at six o'clock—this is our scarf—here is my mark upon it.</p>

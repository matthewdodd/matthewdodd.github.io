            . I am an officer and was in Sweeting's-alley. I met the two prisoners in company in Cornhill; I suspected them and fell back into a hatter's shop in Sweeting's-alley to watch them - Clark was on the right-hand side when he first went into the crowd at the shop; there might be a dozen persons at the window - Carman was on the left hand; I saw him try the prosecutor's left pocket - he found nothing there: I saw them speaking together; Clark then placed himself on Mr. Kilgour's left hand and Carman on the right - I saw Carman's hand in Mr. Kilgour's right-hand pocket- Clark held his coat out to conceal Carman's hand; a gentleman passed at the time and I did not see the handkerchief taken out, but I saw it drop, and saw Carman run away: I instantly followed and took him - I was only about a yard and a half from him; I brought him back and found Clark in custody of another officer, who I had not seen before - I am perfectly certain of both their persons; the handkerchief was in the hands of another officer - when I took Carman he said he had done nothing; I told him I had watched him and seen his hand in the pocket - we searched, but found nothing on him; Clark said he was of good parents and begged hard to be allowed to go to his friends, and we should be satisfied he was innocent - they were strangers to me before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He meant you should be satisfied of his respectability? A. He said his father would give him a good character - I did not see the handkerchief picked up.</p>

            . I am a constable of Broad-street. I was in Sweeting's-alley about half-past three o'clock and saw the prisoner in company together, in the crowd by the caricature shop for a little while; they then went away together - I noticed their persons, and am sure of them; I saw them again a few minutes before four o'clock, in the same place - they turned round, saw me and went away again together; I followed them as far as the Mansion-house - they went up the Poultry; I saw them again about twenty minutes to five, at the same shop window - I did not notice Mr. Kilgour; Clark stood on the left of Carman - I saw the handkerchief in Clark's hand; he put his hand towards his pocket - I laid hold of him and it dropped; Carman was close to him - they were joined together; I caught hold of Clark- Mr. Kilgour turned round immediately and caught hold of him also; I said "Catch the other one" - Carman was then running; I did not see him taken - Mr. Kilgour described the mark on his handkerchief before he saw it; Carman was taken directly, and both conveyed to the Mansion-house.</p>

Yes; Carman had not then run away - it was Clark who dropped the handkerchief; Carman did not run till I told Mr. Kilgour to catch him: Clark had dropped the handkerchief before that - Mr. Kilgour put his hand on Clark's shoulder; I said "Catch the other" - he turned round and caught Carman; he did not take Clark - he only put his hand upon his shoulder.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

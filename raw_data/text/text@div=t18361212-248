                  </hi>. I am foreman to Allen Mason, and Mr. Longman, wharfingers, in Upper Thames-street. Last Monday week we had thirty-three bags of linen rags on the premises, and about a little before six o'clock that evening the private watchman missed a bag—I had seen it a few minutes before four o'clock myself—I went to a place near Queenhithe, and saw the prisoner Brooks and another person, and was induced to go to Blofield's shop, which is about three minutes' walk form our premises—I saw him there with a boy, and asked him if he had bought a bag of rags, describing what rags they were—he said, no, he had not—I told him I knew he had, and then he said he had—I asked him to let me see them—he would not—I then called the patrol in, who was outside, and we went down stairs—I picked out a bag of rags there, and told him that was my master's property—he said, "That is the bag I have bought"—I asked him what sort of a man brought them—he gave me a description which agreed with that given by our private watchman—I went and took Brooks into custody, and took him in to Blofield, who said, "That is the man who brought the bag to my shop, and the man I paid the money to"—a woman who I suppose was his wife said, "That is the man who brought the rags, but you paid the money to a taller man."—he said, "Let me alone, I know what I am about"—Brooks said "It is false, Mr. Blofield, I have not been in your shop to-day"—they were then taken into custody—Nash was taken up last Saturday—he is a Porter, and so is Brooks—I have employed Brooks occasionally for my master—I have not the least doubt of the bag or rags being my employer's.</p>

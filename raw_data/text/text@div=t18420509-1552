On Friday, the 29th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the kitchen, and heard somebody in the passage—I went up and found the middle-door, between the pas<lb></lb>sage and the street-door, open—it is opened with a latch-key—I had seen it shut ten minutes before—a person getting through that door could go to the back-parlour—I found the back-parlour door open, and a trunk there was open, which I had seen shut about ten minutes before—I gave information</p>

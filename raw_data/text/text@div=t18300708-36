               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not possible you might have dropped it? A. No, it is impossible; I had had it in my hand just before, and if it had fallen on the stones I must have heard it - my hand had not been off my pocket a minute, as I am always suspicious of these places; I had been looking at some caricatures: there is a bruise on the snuff-box, from a fall.</p>

            . I am a clerk to a solicitor. I saw the prosecutor standing at the window; the prisoner and another came up - I had suspicion that the other was a thief; they pressed against me: I watched, and saw the prisoner take something out of the prosecutor's right-hand coat pocket, but I could not see what it was - I was confused, and did not take him; I followed him with the prosecutor into Piccadilly - the prosecutor took him, and asked for the box; he said, "I have it - here it is."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you present when he gave the prosecutor the box? A. Yes; I did not see the prosecutor search two other persons, to my recollection - he did feel one person's pocket, I believe, but he was not an instant about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up, and the prosecutor came to me at the corner of St. James'-court - I said, "I have picked one up," and he said it was his.</p>

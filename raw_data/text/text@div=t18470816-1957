                  </hi> I am barman at the Golden Horse, in Aldersgate-street. On Friday night, the 14th of Aug., the prisoners came to the house about twelve o'clock, they said they came from the Blackwall Railway, and asked for a bed—they went to bed, I went to bed about one o'clock—I heard them talking in a suppressed whisper, though I could not understand what they said—the next morning I was down in the bar, Mrs. Witcher came down, and said there was somebody in Mrs. Fitzgibbon's room, for she tried to open the door, and it was pushed against her—I went up and saw nobody, I then came down to my room, which is on the second-floor, and found my clothes where gone out of the box—I came down and fastened the front door—I said to some coal-heavers who were there, "Don't let anybody out, we have been robbed"—I let the officer know, then ran up, and saw Williams putting some things under the bed where the prisoners had slept—I went to the bed, and found a bunch of keys—I called Mrs. Fitzgibbon, and she iden<lb></lb>tified them—I then found these trinkets under their bed—I had seen Williams putting them under the bed, Saunders was standing by him—my boots, coat, waistcoat, and other things, were found by Mrs. Fitzgibbon hidden in my bed—there was nobody who could have removed these things but the two pri<lb></lb>soners.</p>

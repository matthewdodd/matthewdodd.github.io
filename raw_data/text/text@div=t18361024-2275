                  </hi>. I keep the Hatchet public-house, in Little Trinity-lane, in the parish of Queenhithe. About half-past eleven o'clock on the 21st of October I put our my lights and shut up the house—I considered the house was clear of customers—I went down into the cellar, and while I was below I heard something moving in the shop—I went up imme<lb></lb>diately, and saw prisoner behind the bar with the glass, in the act of taking the sovereigns out of it—he had just put them into this pockethe must have concealed himself I went down—I held him till the officer came in—I had seen him in the house that evening from about nine o'clock till about eleven o'clock—I could not exactly tell what number of sovereigns I had in the glass—I will say from fifteen to twenty—I will swear there were above ten, and thirteen half-sovereigns, I belive—they were all gone when I caught the prisoner—sixteen sovereigns and a half in amount were found on him.</p>

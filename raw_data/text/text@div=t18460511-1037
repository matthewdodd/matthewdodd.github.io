                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Finch, jeweller, at No. 20, Wide-gate-street, Bishopsgate, it is the dwelling-house of Mr. John Hillyer—on Saturday, March 7th, we had three fowls in a shed in the yard, which adjoins the house—I locked them up safe between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—about half-past ten o'clock that evening I and my daughter heard somebody come along the passage, and heard the fowls cackle—my daughter got up and ran out—the shed door was shut, and the prisoner was in the shed—she</p>

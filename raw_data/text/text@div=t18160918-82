On the 16th of August, at night, I fell in with the prisoner; I went with her to her lodgings; I agreed to pay her three shillings for the bed and herself; I went to bed; she sat up for three or four minutes; I told her to put out the candle, and lock the door, and come to bed, and she did so. I had a twenty pound note and a five pound note in the pocket of my trowsers; I put my trowsers underneath my head, and about two o'clock in the morning; I missed her, and the note. Two men came up to the room to send me out, and told me I should not sleep there.</p>

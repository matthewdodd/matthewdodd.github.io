             sworn. - I am an officer: on Saturday, the 14th of January, at a quarter past nine at night, I was going up Tottenham-Court road, and, by the end of Windmill-street, I met the two prisoners and three men behind them; I let them pass me, and I followed them towards Oxford-street; the women parted from the men at the end of Hosier-court; I got a man to assist me, and took the two women into custody; the three men ran away; I secured the women, and took them into a shop, and in the prisoner Turvey's apron was the property I now produce; I asked her where she had got it; she said she found it; I took them to St. Pancras watch-house, close by where the prosecutrix lived; a person came into the watch-house and gave the alarm of the robbery when I came in with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the women before? - A. Yes, I have seen them; I knew the men very well; I apprehended two of the men afterwards, but the prosecutrix could not identify them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) Who took them out of the drawers? - A. Davison took them out of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Davison's defence. I never stirred from the counter, nor was nigh her drawers, and when I came out at the street, facing the shop, this woman picked up the bundle.</p>
               <p>Turvey's defence. I picked up the bundle at the second turning coming from the shop; I went up as far as Tottenham-Court road, and coming along I met with

On Thursday evening, the 20th of September, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for a silver milkpot; he asked the price, and weight, which I told him - he took it up, and went out of the shop with it - I followed him to the door, and missed him - not knowing which way he was gone, I could not follow him; he was apprehended on the 22nd of September, on a similar charge - he took it quite openly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run, or walk away? A, He was a very short distance from the door - he went out quick - I cannot say he ran; I had some distance to get round, the flap of the counter being down; I saw him again at Bow-street on the 26th or 27th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me run, or walk out of the shop? A. The distance was so short, you could hardly make a run of it; you were hardly three steps from the door - you went out quicker than you came in.</p>

             (Police-constable F 76.) On the 27th of September the prisoner was given into my custody, on another charge, on which he has been acquitted to-day, in the other Court - he said what he had to state should be before the Magistrate; I found this silver milk-pot on his person. (See page 927.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you look after me, or did I give myself into your custody? A. Neither; you were given to me by Mr. Mott's foreman, who had you by the collar; we took you into a shop, while he told me the nature of the charge; I took you into another of Mr. Mott's shops; he has two - Mott's man had you by the collar, and you had the milk-pot in your hand - it was from what you said that I found Mr. Brook's out; I do not consider that you gave yourself into my custody.</p>

            . This is Mr. Brook's milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Is it in the same state as when you gave it to me? A. Yes; I see no alteration - here is our private mark on it now; nothing has been done to disguise it - the officer brought it to our shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I most respectfully inform the Court I am not in a situation to proceed further in this trial: the officers of justice, by whom I have been confined, have pursued a course which renders it impossible for me to defend myself, and I am solely, from the course pursued by the said officers, completely and entirely at the mercy, and in the power of the prosecutor, who is comparatively a rich man, and his witness, the Policeman, who is entitled to receive more wages than his pay for my conviction; I am thus left at the mercy of persons interested in finding me guilty; under these circumstances, I claim the interposition and authority of the Court to afford me a just and reasonable opportunity of defending myself from the charge: the Policeman, as soon as I gave myself into his custody, (with an intention of going before the Magistrate to explain that I was possessed of the milk-pot, and another which I took from Mott's, and for stealing which I have been acquitted, I intended to explain my conduct there; but) instead of taking me to the Magistrate, he took me to the station, where every article was taken from me, among which were the very proofs and facts I had prepared to defend myself against the charge.</p>

            . Mr. Minshull ordered me to bring to him what I took from the prisoner, and I believe they are in his hands now; it was pamphlets relating to the criminal law, with some papers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were several manuscripts and receipts, and various articles of which I have no account; he took even the key of my trunk; and it is the practice of Policemen to go to prisoners' dwellings, and take what they think may convict them; I do not know the injury I may sustain from this man, who I gave myself into the hands of; the fact is, he has committed a robbery instead of me, for he took my property; I have been locked up a month, in consequence of which the newspapers are exposing me all through the world; I am a teacher by profession; I am known in Scotland and all parts; the papers have exposed me as having done an act - whereas my sole reason was to expose the cause of crime, with an intention of bringing the matter directly before this Court, and through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180030"></xptr>them before the Government, in order that crimes so heinous may be stopped. I wish to inform the Court I am clear myself of any intention of taking the cup with any other view than to expose a publication which I have brought out for the benefit of society; I went to Mr. Brooks', thinking the man would follow me into the street, and take me into custody, and I said I should explain to the Lord Mayor why I did it; I can bring evidence before the Court, if means are afforded me to subpoena my witnesses, that I used every other means in my power to bring the work before the public, but not having the means of publication, I took these means. I was aware I was breaking the law, but I had rather suffer punishment myself to benefit society.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and live in High Holborn. I believe the prisoner to be a worthy good man - he was a schoolmaster, but has been unsuccessful -I firmly believe the situation he has placed himself in was merely for the sake of experiment, he is so excited with regard to the laws - on the subject of any thing connected with our laws and politics he is exceedingly warm; and considers that his publication will produce general good; a more honourable man I believe does not exist.</p>
               <p>- FEDDON. I am a schoolmaster, and live in Stanhope-street. I have had the pleasure of the prisoner's acquaintance for twenty years; he would scorn the idea of a mean action - he got his living respectably as a teacher; I do not know whether he had a place on the day in question; he had a home - I do not believe him to be in want.</p>

            . I live in Colebrook-street, and have known the prisoner three years; he was enthusiastic on the question of public good, more especially on criminal law; I have read his pamphlet - a more honourable man I do not know; his pamplets were for sale, and for public circulation.</p>
               <p>After the Learned Common Sergeant had recapitulated the evidence to the Jury, the prisoner added:</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ought to have said I held the property from Thursday evening to Saturday, waiting to see if it was advertised; when I walked out of the shop, I stood at a distance to see if the man would follow me, but nobody did, and I was so astonished I thought it was really a dream; I went home, and looked at the paper two days, but it was not advertised - I said, "I will take this with me, and go and commit another act to-day, at twelve o'clock at noon - it is impossible that they will take me into custody, and by this means the man I have taken this from will have his property;" if it had been advertised, I would have gone before the Lord Mayor, and acknowledged myself the man who took it; I have ruined my character, no doubt, by the act, but it is plain I did not intend to deprive him of his property, as I did not dispose of it - I explained this to the Magistrate, and he was perfectly satisfied I did not intend to steal it.</p>

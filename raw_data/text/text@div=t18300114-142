On the 15th of December my man was gone backward to kill; I served a customer, and went to book the meat - I came out and missed a piece of beef; I called my man to mind the shop, and ran down Slater-street - I saw the two prisoners; Hawes had a bundle under his arm; I ran on the other side of the way, crossed, and met them - I laid my hand on Hawes, and said, "You have got a bit of meat of mine;" I called an officer, and gave him in charge - as soon as I had spoken to him Glassop ran off; I pursued him with Winter, and took him.</p>

               <p>Glassop's Defence. The only reason I had for running away was, because I own I am not one of the best of characters - I had been up at Worship-street, and I thought I was known there.</p>

On the 3rd of September the family were all out of town; I received information that the prisoner had absented himself for a night or two - I called him into the office, and censured him for it, and asked him if it was true that he had got drunk, and got over the wall, as I had heard; he said Yes, it was true: I said I should send word to his master - he made but little answer, and went away; in about half an hour I heard the street door shut, and saw him pass the office window with something under his arm, or under his coat - I thought he might be going on an errand, but he never returned; on the 6th of September the Policeman came to my lodging, in George-street, and took me to the station, where I found the inspector, who said the prisoner had surrendered himself, and had confessed the robbery - I said to the prisoner,"You are not bound to give me any answer to the question I put to you, but if you like, you may tell me where the key of the plate drawer is;" he said he had lost the key, and some money - I then asked if what he had confessed to was the extent of the robbery; he said Yes, it was, and he enumerated the articles as put down in the indictment - I asked him where I could find an account of the plate left in his charge; he said that he had no inventory, but he believed there was a list in his pantry: I asked when he took the plate - he said on the morning I spoke to him, and he had it with him when he passed the house; I said, "What! after I had spoken to you?" he said Yes, he had the parcel under his coat - we then went with the officer to the house, and found the list of the plate; it was all right but that which he confessed he had taken, and which is all lost - it was worth more than 10l., at the lowest.</p>

             (Police-constable E 38). On the 6th of September I was on duty, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; the prisoner stood at the end of Berner-street - he came to me, and said, "I have been looking for you all day;" I said, "For what?" he said to take him in charge, as he had robbed his master - I said,"Of what?" he said, "Of two dozens of silver forks, one dozen of spoons, two coats, and a pair of trousers;" I asked when, and he said on the Monday morning - that he went straight away to Rosemary-lane, and there met a girl, who asked what he had got in his bundle, and whether he had not some plate; he told her he had, and she said, "If you will give me one of the large spoons, I will get a man to buy it;" that he gave her one, and a man then came to him; they went into a public-house together; and after that he lost all knowledge, till he found himself the next morning with all the property gone, and his pocket picked of 10s. of his own.</p>

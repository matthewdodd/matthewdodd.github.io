                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in Brownlow-mews, Grays Inn-lane. On Wednesday night, the 31st of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Drury-lane—the prisoner and another came up</p>

               <p>and asked me to treat them with a drop of gin—we went into a public-house, and called for a quartern of gin, which I paid for—the prisoner asked me to take a walk home with her, and took me to King-street, Drury-lane—I went up stairs with her, into the second-floor room—she said it was her own room—I did not agree to give her any thing—she locked the door, locked me in, and requested me to stop the whole night, and give her half-a-crown—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and objected to give her half-a-crown—she said I should not go out of the room till I had given her half-a-crown—I demanded her to open the door, and let me out—she swore I should not go out till I had given her half-a-crown, using very bad language—the then drew a knife, and said, "You b—, you shall not go out of the room till you give me half-a-crown; and with this knife I will let your b—entrails out"—she then made three or four fences with the knife to-wards my stomach and body, but I kept her off—I pushed her away from me, and went and threw up the window and called the police (this was before twelve o'clock) in returning from the window, she jobbed the knife into my face, but how I could not see—I was not aware that she was coming to me again—it was purposely done—it was a very bad cut in my left cheek bone—I bled a good deal—she immediately turned up the table, tore off the leg of it, and beat me severely about the arm and head, and wherever she could—I saw a policeman come up to the window, I called him, and she opened the door as he was coming up stairs—I then went with the policeman to Bow-street, and then to the public-house, and got my face washed and dressed—I have had no surgeon to it—it is not well yet.</p>

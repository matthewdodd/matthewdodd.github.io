                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the London Joint Stock Bank, Princes-street-Mr. Tate is a customer of ours. On the 13th of May the prisoner presented this check to me at the banking-house for payment—in consequence of suspicion I requested him to walk into an inner room, and there Mr. Pollard, the manager, asked him where he got the check from—he said it was given to him by a friend—he was asked who he was, where he came from—he said he was in the employ of Mr. Tate—I cannot say whether that was before he said he brought it from a friend—he was asked who his friend was—he said he could not tell, he did not know his name, it was a person he had met in the street, a person somewhat like himself, rather short—he was detained while Mr. Tate was sent for—William Miller Christy it one of the trustees of the bank—there are other partners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in tiasinghall-street—the prisoner was in my employment as clerk—he had been so nine or ten months—this cheek is not my signature—J did not authorize the prisoner or anybody to sign it for me—no part of it is in my handwriting—I know the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing, and I believe it to be his—I was in the habit of sending him to the bank on all occasions—he had access to my check-book only when he brought it from the bank—I have sent him for fresh check-books—I examined my check-book when I returned from the bank, and found one check had been taken out without my knowledge—the check produced corresponds in number with mine—it is 20928—I had given the prisoner notice to quit my service about a fortnight before.</p>

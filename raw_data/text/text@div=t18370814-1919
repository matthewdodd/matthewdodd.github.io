               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">RODERICK M'LEOD. D. D</hi>. I reside in Dean-street, Soho. On the 3rd of August I was walking towards St. Martin's court—when I got there I was pressed on by several persons—I put my hand to my fob immediately, and my watch was gone—it was worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen it since—I cannot tell who the persons were.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Castle-street, Long-acre. I was passing through St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prosecutor—I saw a seal and key hanging from his pocket, and saw the prisoner and another person rush across the court to the prosecutor, and stop him—they were there about a minute or more—the prisoner then pushed on one side, and ran away—I looked at the prosecutor, and saw his seal and key were gone—I followed the pri soner, and did not lose sight of him—another person joined him—they left off running in Long-acre, and walked along—I am sure the prisoner is the person—another man was taken into custody on suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Haddon-street, Regent-street. I was in the court, and saw the prisoner rush against the prosecutor, and stop his progress—another man, in a brown coat, was in company with him—the prosecutor was pushed and backed up against me—he said, "I have lost my watch, I have lost my watch;" and I saw the prisoner run away immediately—I have no doubt about his being the man—I saw no one but him and the other man rush against the prosecutor.</p>

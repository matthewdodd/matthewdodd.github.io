I was informed a bag had been taken from the carriage - I missed a black bag with gold tassels, from the seat of the carriage; I turned, and saw the prisoner at a distance, with a bag in his hand - I could not tell at that distance that it was mine; this bag, which is mine, was brought to the carriage, and the prisoner was brought to the carriage door - it is my bag, and contains the articles stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there many persons about? A. Yes, a great many - I cannot tell whether the prisoner's back was towards me when I saw the bag in his hand, he was at some distance; a person named Ford came to the Police-office, and said he was a constable - Ford had said that he saw the prisoner snatch the bag from my hand, but he denied it then; I had not been there the day before.</p>

            . I am a servant out of place. On the 23rd of July I was at the review - I heard some persons cry "Stop that man! he has taken something from a carriage;" I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards me, with a bag in his hand - he dropped it behind a gig; I took it up, and took it to the lady; I am sure the prisoner dropped it - I afterwards saw him in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not running yourself? A. No, the prisoner was running towards me; the last place I had was in the service of a clergyman in Grosvenor-street - I have been out of place three months; I was not dismissed for dishonesty - he did not give me a character, but I dare say he would.</p>

             (Police-constable T 4.) I took the prisoner - he said he did not know what I took him for; he then said would I take a sovereign and say nothing about it - I said No; he then said he had a wife and family, and would I take two sovereigns, as it would injure him - I said No; he then went on a little further, and said if he were to give me 5l. would I let him go - I said No, not if he were to give me 50l., as I had a wife and family too; I then took him to Paddington station - a man, who false swore himself, gave him to me.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And I believe, in consequence of his swearing what the Magistrate knew could not be true, he was not heard? A. I believe so - he told me he was a special constable; the prisoner said he did not know what he was taken for, and I said I could not tell him, for I did not know then - this is the bag and property.</p>
               <p>LADY ST. GERMAIN's. This is my property - I am sure the prisoner is the man who had something in his hand, but I could not see that it was my bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see his face? A. I cannot say that I did, but I know the man from the whole of his appearance - I can be positive of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Though you do not know whether his face was towards you, had you an opportunity of seeing his face? A. I saw rather his side face, but I saw his figure altogether - I saw enough to be quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; I was talking to two gentlemen, and this Ford came and said"I want you" - he took me to the carriage, as the soldiers were going the other way; Ford said, "I will have a job now," and he afterwards told my wife if she would let him have 5l. he would be out of the way - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060032"></xptr>swore I snatched the reticule from the lady's arm, and made two attempts at it; he said so on the Monday, and on the Tuesday, and the Magistrate said his evidence would not do at all.</p>

About six in the evening, on Tuesday the 9th of this month, I was in the parlour adjoining to the shop, nailing some list round the door; I came into the shop and saw the prisoner taking some rings out of the window, and giving them to an accomplice that was stooping down beside him: the shew glass is a part of the window within the walls of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the shop is shut is it within or without the shutters?</p>
               <p>Skinner. It is within the shutters. I had no time to hesitate; I ran out and caught the prisoner by the collar; there was nobody passing; I dragged him to the other side of the way, in hopes I might meet with somebody in the public house to assist me; I got him to the door; I had him by the collar with one hand; he struck at me, and said, D - n your eyes what do you mean by laying hold of me, and got away; what he had in his hand he threw away after he had got from me; I pursued him through the court; he lost his hat, and there I lost him. I came back and my wife found the ring in the street, in the very place I described he had dropt it in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get his hand into the shew glass, was the glass broke?</p>
               <p>Skinner. Yes; by whom I am not certain; it was not broke before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door did he throw away the ring?</p>
               <p>Skinner. It might be within three yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. He said before Sir John he had my hat.</p>
               <p>Skinner. I said so; I have it now; the hat that dropped from his head.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Skinner. I am the wife of the former witness: my husband was lifting the door; he went into the shop; I heard a bustle; I went to the door and saw my husband and the prisoner at the alehouse door; he got away and my husband pursued him and took him. My husband told me the ring was dropt, and I took a candle and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the ring?</p>
               <p>Skinner. In the street, about a couple of yards from the door. (The ring produced and deposed to).</p>

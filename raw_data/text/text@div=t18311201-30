            . I am a Police-serjeant. In consequence of information I went to Mr. Bunn's, on the 18th of November, and made a communication to him; he desired Hodge to produce some ladles to me, and I went down stairs with him - he felt in his pockets, and said,"Dear me, what have I done with them?" he went towards the area, I said, "They are not in the house" - he said, "No, they are not;" I then took him up stairs, we met Roberts on the stairs - he said to her, "You have brought me to this;" she said,"You are as bad as I am:" so I took them both to the station-house - Hodge told me where he lodged; I went there, and they directed me to the garret, where I found thirty-four duplicates in a bottle - I asked Roberts where she lived, and she said, at No. 9, Norton-street, and I should find her sister there; I went and found her sister: I found six duplicates in a teacaddy, and one of them was for these six cups and saucers, and two glasses.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to a pawnbroker, in Berwick-street. I have a tea-pot pawned on the 2nd of August, and a cloak on the 5th of August, by Hodge.</p>
               <p>MR. BUNN. I believe Roberts came into my service, on the 3rd of February. I had not missed any of these articles till the prisoners were taken; I cannot say when I lost them - when I had discharged Roberts, I commissioned Hodge to examine if my things were all right, and he said they were; that was about a week, before he was taken - these cups and other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect using the teapot? A. I do not think I ever did use it; there is no crest or arms on these coffee-cups, but they correspond with the pattern of a set I purchased - here is my crest and name on this salt-spoon, and the other articles I know by having similar ones; I had the management of the Dublin theatre: Hodge was at that time in my service, and he then had 1l. a week - I knew he was married and had a family; when I came to England, I paid him 10s. a week; the 1l. a week was not continued - I am not in debt to him for wages - I told him I could not give him the same as I had at the theatre; I cannot say that I fixed any sum with him, but to the best of my belief, I told him his wages would be 10s. a week - there is something due to his wife for washing, which has been witheld merely because my things were not returned, and there may be something due to her as a dresser at the theatre; Hodge did not sleep at my house - Roberts was not accustomed to pay for mangling and other things for me; I never left her without money to pay current expences: I was never absent for any length of time, but when I went to France for five weeks - I left some money with her then, but only enough for a few days; I do not know that she then pawned some articles to pay expences, for when I found my stay in France was protracted, I wrote to my solicitor to supply her, which he did - I found some letters had come while I was away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.From the time you returned from France did either of the prisoners make any communication to you on that subject? A. No, Hodge did ask for some advance to his pay, and I got his wife a situation as dresser in a theatre; I have found my stock is deficient of six cups and saucers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harp-maker. On the evening of the 3rd of February, I was at the Hanover-square Concert-rooms, sitting on one of the benches—I had, in my coat-pocket, a pocket book containing the money and bills of exchange stated—it was quite secure at the time—after I had been in the room a short time, I missed it—I immediately gave no<lb></lb>tice to the different persons who were near me, and to a policeman, who</p>

               <p>went out with me, and stopped the prisoner in the street—he struggled, and would not come back into the rooms—I did not see my pocket-book then, but I heard it fall down an area—I saw a person pick it up—the concert was just beginning—the persons were not going away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable A</hi> 36.) I was on duty at the Hano<lb></lb>ver-square Concert-rooms, and saw the prisoner coining out of the parlour from the Concert-room—I heard him ask for a check, which would au<lb></lb>thorise him to come back again without paying—he had been one of the audience—he then walked into Hanover-street—the prosecutor imme<lb></lb>diately afterwards came, and told me he had been robbed of hit pocket-book—Itold him to follow me, and went after the prisoner—I touched him on the left arm, and said, "My good gentleman, 1 beg your pardon, but you have just come out of the Concert-rooms"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have"—he said, "What rooms?"—I said, "The Hanover-rooms"—he said, "So help me G—, I was never there, and don't know where they are"—I said, "You are the person I let out of the parlour, you must go back with me, you are charged with robbing a gen<lb></lb>tleman, and if you are an innocent man, you will go bark without any re<lb></lb>sistance"—he resisted as much as he possibly could—when I got him to the door of the rooms, he hung his right arm round the iron railing!—he bad his great coat hanging on his arm—he took the pocket-book out of his coat with his left hand, and threw it down the area—I said to the prosecu<lb></lb>tor, "There goes the book down the area," and before the words were well out of my mouth, the book dropped into the area, and a sovereign and a half dropped in the area.</p>

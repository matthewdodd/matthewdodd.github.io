The prisoner was his carter—I sent him with a ££5 note to change to pay the labourers—he never brought it to me—he went away, and I heard him say, after he was taken, that he changed it, and wrapped four sovereigns in a bit of paper, and put it into his pocket, as he thought, but he was not certain whether he put it in, or on one side; that he then went to a shoemaker's shop for a pair of shoes, and on returning home he felt, and the four sovereigns were gone, that he was then ashamed to return home, and went off with the rest.</p>

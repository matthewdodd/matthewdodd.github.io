On the 20th of December I had a silver watch, gold chain, and seals, worth 17l.; about two o'clock in the morning I was coming up <placeName id="t18260112-24-crimeloc144">Holborn</placeName>

I had not crossed Gray's-inn-lane - it was by a baker's shop, close at the corner; I pursued, calling Watch! and the watchman came and took her, going into Walton's-court, which is ten or twelve yards within the City bars. I saw my watch found in her left hand. I had not been with her at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know the City boundaries? A. I had been to Captain Sansom's - we dined at five o'clock, then drank, and smoked. I dare say I drank a bottle of wine, and had some rum and water after supper. I suppose a bottle of rum was drank - nobody was there but Mr. and Mrs. Sansom. I drank no wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you drank wine? A. I drank some, but I did not say the quantity - I saw but one bottle of wine produced; gentlemen generally take rum, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120017"></xptr>leave the wine to the ladies. Mr. Sansom lives near Stepney-causeway, which, I suppose, is six miles and a half from my house. I am a married man. I was accosted by nobody but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body to say it was your own fault entirely, and not the prisoner's? A. I did not - I said nothing of the kind. I had 23s. about me. She had not followed me - she ran out and met me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Holborn, and heard a cry of Watch! I was in the court, and went up the passage; Mr. Graveley said he had been robbed - I took hold of the prisoner, who he was holding; he charged her with robbing him - I found the watch, chain, and seals in her left-hand; she at first denied having it, holding out her right hand. I took her in the City - the baker's shop is out of the City. Mr. Graveley certainly was sober. He told me the maker's name and number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear as if he had been drinking? A. He certainly had, but was not drunk - he walked as strait as I could. I considered him very sober. The prisoner said at the watch-house that he met her and gave her the watch - he denied it - she had been drinking - I thought she smelt of rum.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house - the prosecutor did not appear drunk; he gave the maker's name and number of the watch directly; she said it was given to her for going with him; he said he had not spoken to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he was sober? A. I believe him to have been quite sober. She said he had no money, and gave her the watch; he put his hand to his pocket, and I heard money rattle. I think she was not quite sober.</p>

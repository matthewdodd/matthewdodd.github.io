I missed two pieces of printed cotton from the field the 2d of January. containing fifty-six yards; a few weeks after that, one of my servants informed me, an acquaintance of his had bought some printed cotton at Uxbridge very cheap; I sent two people with warrants to search the house of the person who I was informed had some pieces; these are my pieces; (producing several pieces of cotton) there were never any printed of that pattern; and they are not finished; they were not in a saleable condition; they were cut into several parcels; they amount to within two or three yards of what I lost.</p>

            . I am a callico printer, and servant to Mr. Witts; I know these pieces to be his property; they were lost from Mr. Witts's bleaching ground, on the 2d. of January. I know them by the pattern; I printed them myself; never any went to town of it before; none of that pattern had been sold. I went to Justice Fellows, at Uxbridge, and told him the affair; he granted me a search warrant, to search Mrs. Rickman's house; she cried and seemed almost out of her senses; she went to the justice's, and told him, she had sold them to these people; I marked the names of the people as they brought the goods into the justice's. I found the prisoner at Staines; he was waiting there to fight a cock; I told him I had a warrant against him, for selling of goods at Uxbridge; he said he would go along with me to clear himself. I spoke to the man at the inn for a chaise to go to Uxbridge; he would not let me have one. I sent for a constable; then the prisoner said, I don't know what reason you have to keep me; he said he would go make water; he ran in the yard and I followed him; he endeavoured to throw me down, I kicked him up several times; there were many people; they rescued him. Presently the man came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290040"></xptr> with the constable, and he was taken at Colebrook.</p>

               <p>Milward. About an hour and a half; I shewed him a piece of the pattern; he denied he knew any thing of it, and always did deny it to the last.</p>

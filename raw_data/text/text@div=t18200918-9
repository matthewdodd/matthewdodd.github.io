            . I am a shoemaker. On the 15th of July. I was coming from a friend's, at Ratcliff, across Tower-hill, and up the Minories, I saw eight or ten men surround Mr. Knox; I immediately went to assist him, and saw the prisoner with the watch in his possession - I saw the seals through his fingers - I did not see him receive or take it. I collared him, and tried to take it from him, but he knocked me down. I got up, seized him again, and he dropped the watch. I made a second attempt to pick it up, and was knocked down again. I held him till we got him into a shop - somebody picked the watch up, and gave it to the prosecutor. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I did not let him go for a moment.</p>

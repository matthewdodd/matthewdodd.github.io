            , we live in Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 7th of January, towards the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked for some veils, for his mother to shew to a lady; I knew his mother, but not knowing him, I refused to give them to him, and told him, that I would send Celia Brown with them; I packed up four lace veils, they were worth 4l. cost price; I delivered them to the prisoner, and he gave them back to Brown, desiring her to carry them, they both left the house; Brown went to bring back the money or the veils.</p>

            . I am in Mrs. Yates's employ. On the 7th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, she sent me with the prisoner, and some veils, I had them in my hands, when we went out of the shop; he first took me to Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and said that his sisters lived there, and I was to set there while he shewed the lady the veils, he went up and said, he would fetch a candle to light me up stairs, he returned and said they were not at home, and asked me to accompany him to the place where he was to sell them. I said I would, he took me to the corner of Long-Acre, and said he was going to take them into a house; I saw the house would not be a proper place for me to go into, and said I would wait outside, and he promised to return in a few minutes, I gave him the veils in Wild-street, I waited near an hour without seeing him, I went to the house in Wild-street, and found his sisters there, who told me where I was likely to find him, a person took me to Phoenix-alley, I waited there for him, but he did not come, and I went home. He had come out of that house and went in again, but I did not know him as he had changed his dress. I saw him at Bow-street the same evening, in the dress which he put on after he took the veils; I knew him again.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor - I stopped a short time, and when I came up, I saw the prisoner and his mate - the prosecutor said, "Come on, Tom, we are all going home together;" I looked at the prisoner and his companion, but did not know them - I walked on; the prosecutor said, "Tom, they are robbing me;" I said,"Nonsense, not they:" he then said, "D-n their eyes, they are;" I turned round, and saw the prisoner had got hold of the prosecutor's left arm, and then they ran off.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURTON. I am a watchman. I was coming out of the street from crying one o'clock - I saw the prosecutor, the prisoner and another man, in the middle of the road - the prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's left arm; I heard the prosecutor say they had robbed him - he called to Jones, and Jones called him stupid; he then said,"D-n their eyes, they are robbing me," and they ran off; I knew the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>JOHN RADLEY. I received information from Burton,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110150"></xptr>and found the prisoner - he asked what I took him for; I said he would find that hereafter - I found nothing on him.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this fowl - A. On the 27th of January, the prisoner came into the shop between five and six in the evening. She asked for some butter, and during the time I was serving her she went to a shelf where the fowls laid. There was three on one shelf, and four on the other. She took one from the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her, did you - A. I did not. I missed it, and I accused her of taking of it. She denied it. I looked under her cloak. I heard it fall behind her. I immediately went round. There I saw it lay by the side of her. We then sent for the constable. She offered to pay four shillings and sixpence for it if we would let her go.</p>

            . I am a constable at Hackney. On the 27th of January, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody. When I went in the prisoner said she had not taken the fowl. They had the fowl in their hand, and insisted upon my taking charge, saying, she had stolen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of her - A. Yes, she has been here before. She lived at Temple Mills.</p>

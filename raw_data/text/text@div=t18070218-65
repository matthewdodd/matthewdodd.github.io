               <p>Q. On the 21st of January last did you come to Billingsgate. - A. Yes; I came from Gravesend, and I landed there in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had landed you saw the prisoner Waples - did you know the prisoner Waples. - A. I had never seen him before in my life. After I had landed I got a pot of beer at a public house; I was speaking to a woman that I had got prize money due to me in the town; Waples said to me you can go along with me if you please, and I will take care of you, and pay your expences till you receive your prize-money. I went with him, he lived in Sun yard, Nightingale lane; he procured me a lodging in some other house. I told him I should go to the agents the next day and draw my money; I told him I had got a hundred pounds to take. I went on Thursday to the agent's, they told me to come on the next day for my money, and they would give me an order on the bankers; I went the next day, and they gave me a draft, and I went to the banking house the next day for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the banking house. - A. I cannot say the name nor the number, it was in the Strand; I cannot read; Waples was with me when I went. There I received a fifty pound bank note, a forty pound, a five pound, and four one pound bank notes, and five shillings in cash.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know there was a fifty, a forty, a five, and four ones. - A. I told them. I did not understand the figures of the notes; he said he knew the number of the notes better than what they did. I know a one pound note; there was four of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How do you know that one of the other notes was a fifty pound note. - A. I trusted to the gentleman that paid me. I put them all in my pocket book, in the same pocket I have now; we went and bad something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober. - A. Yes; we drank about sixpennyworth of rum and water, it began to rain; we went home in a hackney coach; going home in the coach, he said he should like to look at the number of the notes I had in my pocket; I said stop till I get home and you shall be welcome to look at them; I did not shew him the notes in the coach. When I got home there was a dinner dressed; I sat down and had my dinner, and then I asked him what I had got to pay; he told me it was four pounds for my lodging and for a pair of boots that I had of him, and for his trouble of going along with me. I took my pocket book out and gave him the four one pound notes; he said I am able to take better care of your notes than you are yourself, you may go out and spend them, and I may be brought to account for it; I told him I was able to take care of my own money, I was the person that went out and fought for it; I let him have them, I was not willing to breed a disturbance in the place; he put them in his pocket, he said he would take care of them; he took them out of the pocket book and returned me the pocket book again. He told me that if I would come to him the next day in the morning he would return them to me. I did not sleep in his house all night, I believe I went into the Star; I had only the change with me that I took from the banker's; I thought he was an honest man, I was glad that he had them to take care of them for me. I went to his house the next morning, I told him I would be glad to have some money to pay for my breakfast; he gave me some money to pay for my breakfast, he gave the money for my breakfast. I asked him for some more of the money that he had taken from me the night before; he told me that he had not got any money of mine, and that he did not know any thing about it; he supposed I had been out and I had lost it.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated that when you went to the banker's, you went home with him and went to dinner there, you asked him what you had to pay - had you any thing to drink. - A. Not much; a pot of porter, and a glass of rum; I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him for some money to pay for your breakfast, how much did that amount to. - A. About nine pence; and when he charged four pounds, he took the book out of my hand, and took the whole of the notes that were in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say that you supposed the prisoner to be an honest man, and therefore you consented he should have the notes till the next morning. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180702180051"></xptr> Q. On the next morning you looked to him to pay for your breakfast. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before at dinner time you drank a pot of porter and a glass of rum. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not all that you drank. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank more than that. - A. Not before I had paid what his demand was; after dinner I drank some rum that was in a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. You were groggy. - A. I was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. So are all drunken men - do you mean to say that you was perfectly sober. - A. Persons if they be not sober may know what they are about; I was so sober as to know that was the man that had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor did you drink after dinner. Q. I am not able to say every spoonful.</p>
               <p>Q. You was pretty fresh. - A. I was certainly on board a ship a long time; I drank freely. I thought the money was safe; I found to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to a dance afterwards. - A. I went to the Star, to a dance, along with a woman that I paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. They tell me that sailors when they go to a dance generally give some money. - A. What they give they are welcome to, but not so welcome what they take away.</p>
               <p>Q. You shewed some notes there did not you. - Q. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it when you said the man took the notes away. - A. It was Friday in last month; I forget the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he got the notes from you did you apply to have him taken up. - A. I applied on the Wednesday following. On the Sunday the prisoner took me to Gravesend to get me on board a ship, thinking that I was a poor foolish lad, I would not not think no more about it. I took him up last Friday was a week. On Saturday, the next day after I received my money, the prisoner said he would get me a good ship on the Sunday; he went with me to Gravesend on board the ship. I told him I was not going to be impressed that way, I thought he was going to pay me the money down on board a ship; I asked him for my money, he told me he had none of my money and none he should return me. I went to his house on the Tuesday night following; he told me to go out of his house, he would have no more to do with me.</p>

On the 22d and 23d of January the prosecutor and the prisoner both came to me. In November Farrow was entitled to prize money for the Lively; I paid him twenty-six pounds. In November he left one hundred pounds with me, to buy stock in the funds. On the 22nd of January he came in the afternoon for us to sell it out; we told Farrow it was too late that day to sell it; the prisoner was with Farrow; he sent him in again; he said he had better sell it out that day; we said it was impossible; we sold it out on the 23d of January, I paid him ninety nine pounds nine shillings; that is a check that I gave him on Hodsoll and Co. I have likewise brought the receipt which was witnessed by me, and I got it witnessed by the prisoner at the bar, who said he was a friend of Farrow's, and Farrow said he was a friend of his.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any warrant for Waples. - A. I had on the 6th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where Waples lived. - A. Yes; I went to his house, I could not find him; I looked for him four successive days.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the prosecutor and I came home together to my house, I asked him to leave his money with me, he answered no; he had fought for it, and he was capable of taking of it. I said if you are afraid of trusting me with it, I am afraid of trusting you. I says how much do you owe me, he says here is four pound notes; and he says if there is any coming to me out of the four pound, give it me to-morrow; and if there is any thing coming to you, I will pay you. He directly fastened up the pocket book, and went out of the house to a woman. He was brought home the next morning by a pork butcher; he says to me, pay for my breakfast; I says pay for it yourself, you left no money with me but four pound notes; he then says I left all my money in your care; I says you have not, he says you do not mean to say so; if you have not got it, I have lost it I have none, he says to me, pay the fifteen pence for my breakfast; I put my hand into my pocket and gave him one shilling and three pence. He says if you have not got it, I lost it last night with the three girls I was with. I says, Abraham, it is a bad job, you had better have left your money with me. I says, Abraham, there is some difference between you and me, I will make out the bill. I was going over to the London docks; there was a jew called him by name; I says, Abraham, do you know this man; he denied it at first, till the man came up to him; he asked him how long he had been out of the Cumberland Indiaman; he said that he was discharged from that ship, and he would go forward and declare it; this man said, I do not think that such a stout able man as you was discharged. I said I will be accountable for him; he had been misfortunate enough. He had been out last night, and had lost ninety nine pound. I then went home and called over my bill, which is eight pound nine shillings; I asked him which way I was to be paid, as I had only four pound; he said I can pay you out of my absent bond. I called Bradley to write out the bill for eight pound nine shillings; saying on the bill, received the above, and saying I am in debt to

             four pound nine. He was satisfied, and he went down to Gravesend with me, and the man brought him to the captain, he said he was impressed. He then came on shore; he said he would not go on board. I said if that is the case, you owe me money enough, you shall not run any further in debt; he came to my house one day afterwards. I saw no more of him for fourteen days; I heard a warrant was out against me. I surrendered myself up, knowing myself to be an innocent man.</p>

Waples said as you are afraid of trusting me, I am afraid of trusting you. So accordingly he asked him what was coming to him, he said about four pounds, he said if you will stop a little I will let you know, I will make out the account; he said he would not stop; he opened his pocket book and laid the pocket book along the table; he took out four pound notes, and put the pocket book in his pocket with the other notes; he catched hold of the notes, here says he is four pound notes, if there is any thing coming to me, return it to-morrow. All very fair said Waples, I will; he said he would go out and have a dance where the fidler was, and have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the pocket book and the other notes. - A. He put the other notes in his pocket book, and he put the pocket book into his trowsers pocket, and he laid the four pound notes down on the table.</p>

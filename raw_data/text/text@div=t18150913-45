I lost a chaise cart on the 16th of August, from an open yard behind my house; it was safe at eight o'clock in the evening, and on my going round my premises at about ten minutes before ten, it was gone. The season was very dry, and I could only trace which way the wheels went for a short space, and it was in a direction for the High road, in front of St. James's chapel. In consequence of information which I received, I went down to Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, and there I saw the wheels and springs, which I can swear are my property, and belonged to this chaise cart.</p>

            . I am a farrier, at Dunstable, in Bedfordshire. I know both the prisoners at the bar; I saw them both at Dunstable, at my house, on the morning of the 17th, between five and six o'clock in the morning;

             I knew before. Thomas told me he had a friend, pointing to Roberts, who wished to sell a chaise cart; he had sold it at Smithfield to a grocer, who resided at St. Albans, and he had taken it down to him, but found he had not the money, and so they brought it to me, thinking I was a likely person to purchase it. Roberts was standing by when this conversation took place. Roberts appeared to be the owner, and I bargained with him for it; after some chaffering, I agreed to give him four pounds ten shillings for it, it was out of repair rather, the wheels were bad, and one of the springs was bent, so I took off the springs, and put wooden ones in their places, and put on another pair of wheels. Thomas and Mr. Warden came down together in a gig in a few days afterwards, and I understood it was to shew Mr. Warden where they had sold the cart. Warden immediately claimed the wheels and springs when I shewed them to him.

I was in company with Brown when he took Roberts, on the 11th of September; he said, that Thomas, and a man named Riddell, drew away the cart, and he, (Roberts) considered it as Thomas's property. It was taken from the back of the prosecutor's house, he said, but he did not know but what it was Thomas's own property, and he being poor, and having a large family starving, was induced to go down to Dunstable to sell it, and present himself as the owner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw his family, and they really were in a most wretched condition; no furniture in the house at all, except an old box, upon which Roberts himself was sitting, and three straw beds up stairs, upon which the children were laying.</p>

               <p>Thomas's Defence. I was in company with Roberts at a coach-maker's in the New-road, and we were asked over the way by a man named Riddell, a baker, who asked us to buy a cart; I said I did not want one, and Roberts said, he had no money, but we agreed to sell it for him.</p>
               <p>Roberts's Defence. What Thomas says is true; that we were invited by this Riddell, (who has since run away,) to buy this cart, and as I had no money, I could not, and we agreed to sell the cart for him, and accordingly that night we went into the Regent's Park, and he led us to a yard where the cart was, and he and Thomas drew it through a dust yard, and into the High-road, and I borrowed a horse of a man who is here, to take the cart down to Dunstable, which I at first understood was only fourteen miles from Town. We saw Riddle the Friday following in Smithfield, and gave him the money.</p>

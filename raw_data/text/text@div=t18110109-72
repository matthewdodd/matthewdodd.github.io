On the night of the 5th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, I went with the boy, to see him feed the horse, and shut the place up at the slaughter house; there were then three carcases of beef hanging, and a large hog, and a cloth over the hog; I saw the boy lock up the place; he came away with me; about a quarter before nine in the morning

            , the boy, gave me information. I went to the slaughter house, the beef was cut to a mere skeleton; the hog and the cloth were gone, the cloth was marked in full length. On the 8th of December, in the morning, Mr. Sapwell came to me; I went with him to the Poultry Compter, there I saw Catherine Parker in custody; from there I went in a coach to Shoreditch Church. The prisoner Wilkes was brought to me, and a quantity of meat, it was not cut like a butcher, and by comparing it to the other part of the carcase, I found it tallied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any cloth produced to you - A. Yes. The cloth was brought into the coach, it had my name on it. The prisoner Wilkes said he bought it; I said, did you buy the cloth; he said, no, he believed that was left with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the beef and pork in the state that Mr. Jefferies represented it - A. Yes; I left the slaughter house all safe and secure at that time. I returned to the slaughter-house the next morning, between four and five o'clock, I found the staple had been drawn, and when I went in I found three carcases of beef cut, and the hog gone, likewise the cloth round it. I went back and informed my master. I have seen the cloth since, master's name is on it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of information that you received did you go in a coach with the prosecutor - A. Yes, to a house in White Bear Gardens, near Shoreditch Church; the prisoner was at work; he is a turner; Armstrong spoke to him, because I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butcher's shop - A. No, by no means; there was a turner's shop. I went up stairs, there I found a quantity of beef and pork, in different parts of the room, some on the bed; there were two or three hundred weight; I found some cloths. In a drawer in the lower room I found an iron crow, he said he used it in his business; I saw some meat hanging backwards, and I ran up stairs, the room was literally covered with meat.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer: I was with Sapwell; the wife opened the door, then I saw the prisoner Wilkes, he was at work in a back shed; I told him we wanted to speak to him; he came out of the place he was working in. Sapwell went up stairs; he came down and told us to secure the prisoner, we did. After all the meat was brought down I asked the prisoner how he came by that meat, he gave me no answer. The meat was then put into the cloths and put into the coach, and he was taken to the office.</p>

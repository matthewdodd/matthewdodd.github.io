               <p>How near was the man to them? - I imagine he might be about twenty or thirty yards; I called to him, and bid him stop, he immediately stopped, and asked me what I wanted; I told him I had been robbed, and suspected him to be the thief; he said he had lost his way, for his wife and he had been falling out; he did not appear to be particularly in liquor, he was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Was there any footpath where he was going? - There was a footpath near, but he was not in it, he was rather going from it.</p>

               <p>I am son to the last witness; these turkies were locked up in the turkies house.</p>
               <p>Was that broke open? - No, Sir, I had hid the key, and he had found it, and the door was unlocked; when we found the prisoner, the turkies were near him; he was walking round the brick-kiln.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else near? - There was a man who went down in the field with us, but nobody else; it was between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night? - No, I believe the moon shone; the man said he had been drinking, and had lost his road, and his wife and he had had some falling out, and he did not care where he went; he denied knowing any thing of the turkies.</p>

               <p>Should you know the basket? - It was a flat basket very much like this; he had not been gone out of my house above twenty five minutes before I heard Mr. Holmes had lost two turkies, and that they were gone with the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>

In about two hours I got up and missed my watch. Two more persons were in the room; I charged the prisoner with it - she denied it. I called the watchman, who took her directly. She still denied it - he felt about her, but could not find it; and as he was taking her to the watch-house I saw him take it out of her right hand; she said she would break it before he should have it; and she did break the glass. I had given her 2 s. - I was sober.</p>

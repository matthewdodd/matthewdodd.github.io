The prisoner was employed under me for eleven weeks, at the Marquis of Westminster's and at Mr. Tollemache's, Peckforton-castle, in Cheshire—he went down there with me and my wife, on 19th Sept.—we left there on 9th Dec., about half-past eight in the morning, by the Parliamentary-train, and arrived at Euston-square a few minutes past seven the same night—we went home from there, and the prisoner with us—my wife was with me in the carriage, and a man named Solari, a labourer to me, and his wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the shovels that were brought back to your house the same that you had lost? - A. Yes, they were. When we had got some distance towards the Police-office, I saw the prisoner running back again towards my house, with a drawn knife in his hand; he had made a clear way as he passed the middle of the street, and I gave him way too.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of knife was it? - A. A small clasp knife. I then turned round and followed him; after running some distance, he turned up a passage, called Smith's-place, that was no thoroughfare; he came back again down a court, and brandishing his knife about, he cleared the place again to let himself out; he then ran down Wapping, towards the Police-office; he then turned up a place, called Russell's-buildings, and I saw a Mr. Calmer standing at his door with a hair broom in his hand; when he had gone past Mr. Calmer, I snatched the broom out of his hand, and knocked the prisoner down; at that time he had his knife drawn in his hand; I had caught hold of his left hand which had the knife in it, but could not get it from him; several other neighbours then came up, and what with holding him down by the hair of his head, and otherwise ill using him, after about ten minutes trouble, we got the knife from him, and secured him; I went to the Police-office, got some officers, and they took him to the Police-office.</p>

             sworn. - I am a headborough: On the 26th of last month, I had charge of the prisoner at the bar in Mr. Miller's shop; I had taken him about two hundred yards from Mr. Miller's, towards the Police-office, and he told me he had stolen the shovels; that it was the first time, and that his partner was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise or threat at that time? - A. No, I did not. He had desired me to let him step upon the stags, I then observed him to be very busy with his hands in his pocket; and then he pulled out a knife from his waistcoat pocket, and swore he would stab me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the knife? - A. No, we lost it in the scuffle; he made his escape, and was afterwards taken again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never took the shovels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live in Ratcliff-highway. On the 25th of July I went out, and when I returned I understood an ad<lb></lb>vance note had been offered at my shop—when I was at home in the after<lb></lb>noon, the prisoner came in, and said, "I have now come, Mr. Hart, and have brought a friend with me who knows me;" he told me he had an order from Captain Bull, of the <hi rend="italic">Tobago</hi>, for a month's advance, and that he had brought a friend with him who was to be responsible that the order was correct—Mr. Dalton was the person—I did not know him be<lb></lb>fore—I consented to take the note—he took 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in clothes, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and he went away—I sent my young man with them, with the goods, to Mr. Dalton's, to see that it was correct—I gave my young man the goods and money—he is not here—I gave the note to Evans, the officer.</p>

I knew the prisoner about ten months ago—he ap<lb></lb>plied to me in July to accompany him to Mr. Hart's, to say that he was respectably connected—I had heard that he was so, but I certainly never knew any of his friends—I understood he was highly respectable—he showed me shipping order for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he had received it from the <hi rend="italic">Tobago</hi>, Captain Bull commander, and asked me to go down to Hart's—I asked him why he could not go to some other friend—he said his friend was too far, and he must sail next morning to the West Indies in the <hi rend="italic">Tobago</hi>—I went with him, and the goods and money were advanced on my responsibility—the man brought the clothes and money to my house, and delivered them to the prisoner in my house, and he took them away with him—the man gave the money and goods into his hands.</p>

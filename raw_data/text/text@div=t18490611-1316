                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Spilsby, in Lincolnshire. I had a client named William Whittaker, and another named George Searby—on 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> April, 1846,1 had some deeds at my office, belonging to Mr. Whittaker—they had been examined and deposited there on the 20th—there was a note and a memorandum with them—I served a copy of this notice on the prisoner, in Newgate, the day before yesterday—(<hi rend="italic">this was a notice to produce the papers in question</hi>)—on 2d June, 1847, I gave up to Searby two papers relative to a mortgage for 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I believe had been in the same box with Mr. Whittaker's papers—in consequence of something Mr. Whittaker said, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110072"></xptr>
               <p>looked for his papers, about 2d May, and found the deeds, note, and memo<lb></lb>randum were gone—I went up to London with him, about 17th or 18th May, went to the Tontine Insurance-office, and this note and memorandum were produced to me by Mr. Dimes—I believe he is the solicitor and managing director there—on 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> May I went down to Liverpool, and found the prj<lb></lb>soner at 1, Sun-street—I asked what he intended to do about his life insur<lb></lb>ance with the Tontine Company, Pall-mall, and his note to the same company for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and likewise Whittaker's deeds, and the note and memorandum of deposit for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Whittaker owed him—he said he did not know what to do at present; that he had no money, having been a long time out of a situation; but that he intended to pay something weekly to the company—I told him he was suspected of forging, and gave him in charge of the officer who accompanied me—he voluntarily said, "Searby gave me the deeds, in consequence of my having joined him and a Mrs. Thomas in a note for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, to get Searby out of Whitecross-street prison"—he gave no account of Whittaker's promissory-note, or of the memorandum of deposit—this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I alluded to—I did not produce it to him—I had seen it at the Tontine-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sandwich-terrace, Battersea. In June, 1847, I settled some accounts with Mr. Thimbleby, and received from him a mort<lb></lb>gage-deed of my own, within which was a deed, a promissory-note, and a memorandum belonging to Mr. Whittaker—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got to London in the latter end of June—I recognized to whom the papers belonged, a day or two before I came up—I went up expressly to meet the prisoner, in answer to an advertisement for a partner—we entered into busi<lb></lb>ness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110073"></xptr>
               <p>together as perfumers, at 22, Wellington-street, Kingsland-road—the deeds were in my portmanteau at my house, 4, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney—in Aug., 1847, I was taken to Whitecross-street prison—I got out the same month, and took all Mr. Whittaker's papers to Wellington-street, wrapped them up, directed them to Mr. Thimbleby, and put them into a closet—in Sept., I went out for the day—I returned, and found the greater part of the things removed, these papers also—I saw the prisoner a day or two after, at the place of business, and accused him of taking away the part<lb></lb>nership things, and also the deeds—I had never told him I had the deeds—I think he denied taking them, or having them—it is not true that I handed them over to him as security for his joining in a promissory-note, or any of them—I remember the prisoner lodging at 13, Brunswick-square, Hackney-road—a person named Tooke was his landlord.</p>

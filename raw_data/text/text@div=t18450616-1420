                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and at the time in question, lived at 11, Galway-street, St. Luke's. I opened my shop there on the 24th of Dec—on the 22nd the prisoner came and represented himself as a traveller for the firm of Messrs. Simmons, who keep an emery warehouse in Iron<lb></lb>monger-row, St. Luke's—I did not know there was such a firm—I gave him an order for some black lead, which I desired him to bring on the 23rd, but he did not bring it till the 24th—early that morning a woman came for a bundle of wood, for which she paid me a halfpenny—she re<lb></lb>turned in a short time, and asked if I had any emery paper—I had none</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160158"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner afterwards brought me the black lead which I had ordered I paid him for it—while he was there, the woman who had been before came in again, and asked if I had any black lead—I told her I had, but if she had been a minute sooner she would have been too soon; for that gentleman, meaning the prisoner, who stood behind her, had that moment brought the lead into the shop—I then undid the packet of lead that was on the counter—she said she did not mean that lead, she meant limp lead—I said I had not got any, but I would get her some—she said she used a great quantity of lump lead, and a great quantity of rotten-stone, and likewise emery paper, she used as much as 12lbs. each week—she said she was a stranger about there, but if I would oblige her by getting it for her, she would be a good customer to me, not only in those but other things—she put her hand in her pocket, and produced a piece of rotten-stone and a piece of lump as a sample—she said she paid 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the lump lead, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for the rotten-stone—the prisoner was there all the time—she ordered 12lbs. of each—I asked the prisoner if they kept it at their warehouse, he said, "Yes"—I said, "You hear what this lady says; can you let me have it by the time"—she wanted it at three o'clock—he said he could—I said I was not acquainted with the articles, nor did I know the value of them, or wbat they were used for—after the woman left, the prisoner turned to me and said, "You have a d——d good customer there," meaning the woman—I asked him what it was used for, he said, "It is used for doing the backs of these little penny looking-glasses, that they hawk about the streets"—I told him I was not acquainted with the things, but if Mr. Simmons would supply me as rea<lb></lb>sonably, and with as good an article as he supplied to other persons, as he lived near, I might as well deal with him as any other person—I then gave him an order for 14lbs. of rotten-stone, 14lbs. of lump lead, and four quires of emery paper—he returned in twenty minutes or half an hour, with a boy carrying the articles in a sack—he brought them into the shop, and dismissed the boy—the packages were in large brown paper bags—he then produced this bill, and one of Mr. Simmons's cards with it, and said either Mr. Simmons was not at borne, or he was in a great hurry, and he had made the bill out in his own name, but it did not signify—I laid, "No, I don't suppose it signifies, so long as you get the money;"—at the bottom of the bill I perceived the words, "Received same time"—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one sovereign, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, aud he then put "W. Webb" at the bottom of the bill, and went away—I never saw him again till he was in custody—finding the woman did not come for the goods, I went to Mr. Simmons, and made some inquiry—I then opened the parcels, and found only 2lbs. of rotten-stone and lump lead, instead of ten—I gave the prisoner the money, believing he was, as he represented himself to be, a traveller to Mr. Simmons, a respectable manufacturer—being pushed for time, by the woman giving the order for three o'clock, and not knowing where to go for the things, of course I gave him the order.</p>

             thus deposed: On the 26th of June, between Ten and Eleven at Night, I made all fast, and went to Bed; and rising about Five next Morning, I found both the outer and inner Doors of my Cellar broke open; and that several Shirts, Smocks, a Handkerchief, and other things, were lost out of a Tub of Water; some of which I got again by the Instructions of Bewle.</p>

             thus deposed: I have known Jack Little about three Months: My first Acquaintance with him was by means of his Wife Betty, for I have known her longer. Jack, (says she to me one Wednesday) I know a young Fellow that wants a Companion to go a House-breaking with: Do ye, says I? Why then I am his Man. Let me see him. She soon brought us together. We presently struck a Bargain, and broke open 2 or 3 Houses that very Night. On the Friday Night following, betwixt 11 and 12, we entred the House of Mr. Rans, over against the <placeName id="t17250827-56-crimeloc242">Sugar-Loaf in Virginia-Street</placeName>

I hoisted Jack Little upon my Shoulder; he took out several Panes of Glass, and so opened the shutters, went in, and took out the Goods. There was two Gowns, a Velvet Scarf, several Dozens of Wig Cauls, and other things.

We cut away with a Hatcher, the Runner so far, that one of the Shutters fell upon my Head, and had like to have killed me. We only took a Quilt, a Hat, and a Petticoat from thence; for the Watch coming their Rounds, prevented us. The next Week we broke open Hedgers's House about Midnight, and took, Linnen out of a Tub of Water. The Linnen, the Cauls; and most of the other things we sold to Mother Belcher, who very well knew how we came by them.</p>
               <p>Belcher, in her Defence, deny d that she ever bought any thing of either Little or Bewle; but said, that Bewle had own'd that he sold those Goods to one Roger. In Answer to which. Bewle did not deny but that he had sold some things to Roper; but insisted upon it, that he sold the greatest Part to the Prisoner Belcher.</p>

Bewle's Wife (with a Child in her Arms) went with us to set him. And as soon as we had taken him, he said, he was sorry that he did not kill Bewle's Wife and Child, for his Life was gone, now Bewle was made an Evidence.</p>
               <p>John Everet thus deposed: When we took Little, he would fain have got away, but we brought him to New-Prison; and as soon as he saw Bewle there, he (the Prisoner) said to him, I little thought, Jack Bewle, that you would have served me so. We took this Handkerchief upon

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Messrs. Nicholls. I came from Ips<lb></lb>wich by the Eastern Counties Railway to the station in Shoreditch on the 30th Sept.—I saw a brown portmanteau of mine put into the luggage-van at Ipswich—it contained about a dozen coats of a new register <hi rend="italic">Llama</hi> paletôts and about eighteen French waistcoat-shapes, which I used as patterns—I had also a new edition of "Walker's Dictionary"—Mr. M'Pherson and I were together at the same hotel at Ipswich, and he having no luggage agreed to assist me—when I came to London, I went to the luggage-van to get my portmanteau, and it was gone—there had been a leather label on it, with my name on it—I have not seen the portmantean since, but some of the waist<lb></lb>coatings have been produced by the officers, which were part of the property stolen—some of the coats had patent pocket-protectors, and some had the <hi rend="italic">Llama</hi> hood—the "Protector" is an elastic covering on the mouth of the pocket, which prevents anything falling out or being easily extracted from it; it closes when the pocket is shut—I believe that the waistcoat-pieces pro<lb></lb>duced are part of what I lost.</p>

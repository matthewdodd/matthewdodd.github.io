            . On the 3d of December, I was on duty near Maida-hill, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and met Morrington at the bottom of the hill - Edwards was two or three paces behind him; they each had a bag on their shoulders. I asked Morrington what he had there; he said he did not know - I said it was pidgeon (meaning lead), and told him to put it down, he threw it down - I asked Edwards to put his lead down, he did so. Morrington was going away; I said</p>
               <p>"I must detain you as well as the property" - Harrison who was with me, handcuffed them. We found a hammer and a knife upon Edwards; the rivet was broken, and there was marks of the hammer on the back of the knife. I found a knife on Morrington, which has been used in the same way - we took them to the office. We delivered the lead to Hooker, after marking it. Edwards said he found it in a ditch, and Morrington said he found it in the road; it was a very wet night. The prisoners and the bags were very wet indeed. I took them about half a mile from the barracks. They said they slept in a barn at Red-hill that night, and that was the way they became acquainted.</p>

            . I am an officer, and was with Hunt, whose account is correct. I had seen the prisoners on the Monday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, in the fields, by the barracks. Morrington was looking towards the barracks, and Edwards was lurking about in the fields - I noticed them for full half an hour. I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150032"></xptr>a hammer in Edwards's pocket, which appeared to be made for the purpose of receiving it. In our way to the watch-house, Morrington said he did not care a d - n, for they had disfigured the lead, so that it could not be matched.</p>

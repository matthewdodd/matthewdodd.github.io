            . On the 16th of March, about seven o'clock, I was talking to a Clapton stage coachman, in <placeName id="t18070408-24-crimeloc142">Bishopgate-street</placeName>

opening the coach, I found myself run against the arm; I looked round, I saw the prisoner whom I thought was a little intoxicated, he went on in a hurry; I stepped a little back and let him pass. I saw him after he passed me, he mended his pace; I overtook him at the London assurance company. I stepped forward, I said you have robbed me, laying my hand upon him, I saw at that time a handkerchief in his right hand. He knocked or pushed me down, I came to the ground, and my hat fell off; the moment he knocked me down I saw my handkerchief go away; and the man run off. I said immediately stop thief, I got up and ran after him; he was taken in Threadneedle-street. When I came up to him, I said you are the man that robbed me; he cried he knew nothing about it, that he was not capable of robbing. We took him back to the place where I had talked to the coachman. We sent for an officer and took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief. - A. It is in the hands of the officer. I am certain that he is the man that passed me at the coach, because he ran against me.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment you charged him with it you saw the handkerchief in his hand. - A. Yes, I saw him throw it away, and I saw the handkerchief on the ground; I lost some time in getting up, and picking my hat up; I thought I had better go after the man.</p>

            . I am fire-lighter to the East India House, Leadenhall-street. On Monday the 16th of March, about seven in the evening, I saw two men scuffling, I saw one fall, the other ran down Threadneedle street, and threw a handkerchief from him, I saw it plain enough; I picked the handkerchief up, and carried it into the Flower-pot, Bishopgate street; I looked at the handkerchief, it was marked W. B. No. 18, I gave it to the young man that belongs to the parcels there and left my address. I could not swear to either of the parties, it was so dark, and the contest was short.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Rohrs, a sugar-baker, and live in Pell-street, Ratcliffe-highway. On the 13th of March I was in an omnibus with a child in my lap, going towards Notting-hill—the prisoner got in at Cornhill—I am sure he is the man—he sat on the right side of me—I was on the left side—he was nearer the door than I was—I had a bag on my right side, the same side as the prisoner sat—I had a purse in my bag containing a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and a shilling—I saw the prisoner's hand move—a lady sat opposite me—she looked at me, and I thought of my bag—I put my hand down to take my bag up, the purse was hanging out, and it dropped—I took it up, examined it, and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and the shilling were gone—I laid hold of the prisoner's, arm as he was going to get up di<lb></lb>rectly I felt my purse—I caught hold of his coat, he put his hand up to the side of the omnibus door, and I saw a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in his hand—I gave an alarm, and the conductor ran after him—I am sure he is the man.</p>

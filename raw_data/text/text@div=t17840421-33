               <p>On the 4th of March, about three in the morning, I saw three boys in a wherry with coals, I rowed up to them, I went into the boat to see who they were, suspecting the coals were stolen, the boat was off Pelican-stairs, where there is nothing but empty craft lay; it was a common wherry.</p>
               <p>How long had you observed them before you went on board their boat? - About ten minutes, I knew Tuckey and the other, but I could not call him by his name, they were all three in the boat together.</p>
               <p>Did you ask them any thing respecting these coals? - I asked Tuckey whether the boat belonged to him, and he said yes; they ran away out of the boat as soon as I came in.</p>
               <p>Court. How did they get off? - They went over the light craft.</p>
               <p>How far was the place off where you saw the loaded wherry to the stairs? - The ship lay in the tier opposite.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Was it light or dark? - It was moonlight.</p>

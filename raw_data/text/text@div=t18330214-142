               <p>WILLIAM MARTIN. I live at the East India Arms, in Fenchurch-street. On the 12th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was passing <placeName id="t18330214-142-crimeloc803">Aldgate</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I was passing this gentleman - he said he had lost his handkerchief; I said I could not help that - he said I had got it, and searched my pockets; when he found I had not got it, he said he would swear he saw me give it to somebody else who ran across the road, but if he had seen that he might have taken the other person, as there were two friends with him.</p>

            . I am a lighterman. On the 4th of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Lambeth, and found White and Clark in company with a barge-builder, at the Duke's Head public-house; I asked the barge-builder if he had any barges to sell suitable for the Regent's Canal; White said, "I have a Bristol boat to sell;" Clark heard this. I asked at what time he would have her in town - he said in the course of a week; I asked where she was; he said, at Bristol, and he was going to fetch her to London directly. Clark then said, "We have got a little boat to sell now," and that it was at the boat-builder's. White heard this - Clark went and fetched her to Mr. Curtain's, the boat-builders, at Lambeth, for me to see - they both went into the boat with me to shew it to me, and agree about the price. They asked 6 l. for it - one interfered as much as the other. I said I would give them four guineas, and did not care about having it. Clark agreed to take it, but White objected, and said she ought to be 6 l. - he at last agreed to take four guineas. I gave them 2 s. 6 d. earnest - they both rowed me down to Whitefriars - I hauled the boat upon some timber at the Grand Junction-wharf. I went ashore with them, and paid them 4 l. 1 s. 6 d. - they said they could not write, and a person at the public-house, a friend of mine, wrote the receipt - Clark put his mark to it - White said there was plenty of witnesses without putting his name to it; I paid the money into White's hands; I went to Woolwich, and afterwards found the prosecutor, who claimed it. (Receipt read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I go to fetch the boat for you? A. Clark fetched it to Curtain's - White received the money, and I saw him give Clark two sovereigns.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURNHAM. The boat Maxwell shewed me is the one which was stolen from me.</p>

            . I am the son of Joseph Burnham. I saw the boat when it was found, and am sure it is my father's. I saw Clark and White jump into it on the 4th of August, between three and four o'clock - I think it was then fastened to a pile; I saw them untie her; they rowed away up the river; I knew Clark before; I went and told my father of it directly. Clark has absconded - he used to ply about the river.</p>

Clark used to work about the river, but I have not seen him since, I told White I took him for stealing a wherry from Queenhithe - he said Clark persuaded him to do it.</p>

            . I am street-keeper, of Queenhithe. Maxwell brought me the receipt, saying, he had brought the boat, and desired me not to let it be sent to Bristol. I had it in my possession two months - Burnham and his son claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 3d of October I was drinking with the prosecutor in Trinity-lane; he was in liquor, and said he wished to sell the boat, and should be glad if I could get him a customer - I went home and next morning Clark hired it of him, and came to me between one and two o'clock, and said he had hired it; I said I wanted to sell a boat which was coming from Bristol; he got me into this boat, and said Burnham had authorised him to sell it; we rowed to Lambeth, and he sold it to this man.</p>

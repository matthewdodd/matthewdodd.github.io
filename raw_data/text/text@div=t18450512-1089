                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins—he is a drum-major in to Royal Artillery. About five or six o'clock in the evening of the 17th of April I was on Blackfriars-bridge, looking at some tumbling—I had six half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket, which was in front of me—I saw a boy near me, in a fustian dress, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I missed my money—he then went to the prisoner, who was about two yards off, and gave something into his hand, which he put into his right-hand pocket—the boy ran away, and I called out that he had picked my pocket—I charged the prisoner with being one of them, and I took hold of his coat—he got off, and was taken by the officer—I saw him throw some, money away.</p>

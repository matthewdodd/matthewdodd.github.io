            . I live at No. 9, Great Portland-street. I was coming across <placeName id="t18151025-70-crimeloc411">St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

I instantly turned round, and made a blow at him with a stick; instantly I heard him drop it. I immediately said, Mr. Ricketts, he has dropped it; pick it up. The prisoner then ran round and round, and the other people ran across me, and knocked the stick out of my hand. I pursued the prisoner, and took him, and delivered him to a watchman.</p>

            . I happened to be walking with the last witness, just at the end of St. Martin's-court. I saw this business. Mr. Briggs said, he has dropped it. The prisoner ran away. I said, never mind, follow up your man, and take him; which he did. It was impossible for the prisoner to have got out of our sight. We never got the chain or seals since.</p>

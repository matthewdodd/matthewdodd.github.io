On the 17th of December my mother had taken the prisoner in out of charity, fed him, and lodged him; I lost my property, and found him at a public-house with my jacket - he said it was his own, and his father bought it for him six months ago, but his father died at Greenwich twelve months ago, with breaking a blood-vessel; I know it is mine by the buttons and a piece at the corner.</p>
               <p>JANE WOOD. I am the prosecutor's mother, and took in the prisoner. This jacket is my son's - I have mended it many times. I am a widow. The other articles were taken from another room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.You know you are only doing this out of spite, because my father owed you a little money? A. Yes, he owed me 4l. 10s., but I did not do this out of spite - I have had a very heavy loss by him.</p>

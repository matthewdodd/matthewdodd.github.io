               <p>CHARLES THOMSON. On the 22nd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18100411-32-crimeloc183">Old Bond-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18100411-32-crimeloc183" type="placeName" value="Old Bond-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he purposed to do it, or that he was actually intoxicated. - A. He did it on purpose; four men then came up, two of them stood before me, and the other two were behind me, and picked my pocket of a pocket-book, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them things to be in your pocket recently before. - A. I had my hand in my pocket upon them not two minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. And you felt their hand in your pocket, and you suppose they took them articles away. - A. Yes, I was so alarmed at the time that they picked my pocket, I let the men that picked my pocket run away; I let them leave me as if I took no notice. I then saw the other three. I went up to a watchman and related the case to him, and insisted upon him taking charge of the three; he said, yes, and acquainted them with the charge that I had made; they said, they were innocent of the crime and they would go without force; they then turned round as if to go to the watchhouse, and went down Stafford-street. I was behind them, and expected the watchman was following of me, instead of which, he had gone a hundred yards, to take the trouble to shut his watch-box door. The prisoner turned round, and finding me only behind, they run off, and separated different ways; I kept the prisoner in sight from first to last; he run; I pursued him and never lost sight of him; I came up to him and collared him; three gentlemen were by; I took him up to Mount-street watchhouse, there I gave charge of him to the constable of the night, Mr. Watson. I am positive the prisoner is the person that reeled up against me, and he is one of the three men that I gave charge to the watchman, who went back to his box, and he is the man that I seized when the three gentleman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that his shoving of you in apparent drunkenness, was real or affected. - A. He was perfectly sober when I collared him the second time, and so he was at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you collar him the first time. - A. Yes, I collared him the first time, when he reeled against me; and the second time when the gentlemen came up. It was a moonlight night; I saw him when I collared him the first time, I never lost sight of him before I collared him the second time.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. I was constable of the night in the watchhouse; I received charge of the prisoner, as being one of the five that had robbed the prosecutor of his pocket book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

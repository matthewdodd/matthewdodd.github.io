               <persName id="t18210411-102-person1155">Ellis</persName>
             the watchman. I had reason to suspect one of the boys. I went with Ellis to an old iron shop, kept by the prisoner on Saffron-hill - his name was over the door. Ellis went behind the counter, and handed me up a roll of brass, it weighed about 50 lbs. - and in the parlour another roll was found, about the same weight. It was new brass, and I am certain it is mine - it is worth 1 s. 3 d. per pound. I told him it was mine - he said it was not; that he had bought it of a gentleman who was distressed for money, to make up a bill. He said it was a pity to deprive him of his liberty, and I might take the property back. In consequence of something Ellis asked him if he knew my boy - he said he did not. My boy Warner was there at the time, in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not the boy say he carried it to the prisoner - A. He said he gave it him in his master's shop.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. I was employed by Mr. Keats on the 7th of March, in the morning. I followed Warner from Mr. Keats's to the prisoner house, on Saffron-hill. He had made several halts and turns, and looked round as if he thought he was watched. He turned suddenly back on Saffron-hill, and I went into a house, that he might not suspect me. I lost him for about ten minutes - then saw him come out of the prisoner's house. He went a few doors down the street, into a shoemaker's, and the prisoner followed him - and in a few minutes came out. I saw nothing with him. Next day I followed the boy again, from his master's, about half way down Saffron-hill - I there apprehended him. He had nothing with him. I took him to Mr. Keats. I then went to the prisoner's house, and found two rolls of brass, one in the shop, and the other in the parlour. He said he had bought it of a man like a porter, with a white apron on. I understood him to say he gave 12 1/2 d. per pound for it. When he got to the Office he was shewn to the boy, and asked if he knew him, and if he was the person he bought it of? He said No - it was a man much older, and that he never saw the boy before, and that he did not know the prosecutor or his shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Keats present when he said he did not know him - A. He was. I do not believe that he was pointed out to him. He was in the shop, and claimed the brass when I found it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Keats. I lived about two years with him. I first got acquainted with the prisoner about nine months ago - I took him a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110066"></xptr>brass of my own, and sold it to him - he asked how I came by it - I said it was my own - he said I need not mind, for if it was any thing belonging to my master he would buy it of me; he took me into his back parlour and gave me something to drink. I afterwards met him in St. John-street, he took me to a public-house and gave me something to drink again, and said if I would bring any thing belonging to my master he would buy it, and nobody would know any thing of it. I took him three square files, and he bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the 6th of March - A. Yes, he asked what time my master would be up in the morning, and what time I went into the shop, and if I served in the shop. He came to the shop on the 6th and 7th of March, both mornings, and I delivered him a roll of brass each morning in the shop - he brought a basket; and came to buy a file, and I put the brass into his basket, he told me they weighed 34 lbs. I was to have 4 d. a lb. for it. I saw them afterwards at Bow-street they were the rolls I delivered him; he paid me 2 s. at a time for it. We tossed for gin, and victuals and things together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been robbing your master - A. Six or eight months. I sold goods to nobody but him - I thought all along it was a shocking thing. I told about it the moment I was taken. Wilson was in the shop on the morning when he came, but did not see it taken. I went to the prisoner's house the same day. I am eighteen years old.</p>

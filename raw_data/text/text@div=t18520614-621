About two o'clock in the morning of the 13th May I was standing at the corner of Tichbourne-street—sergeant Harford was near me—I saw the prisoner and another man turn the corner from out of Cambridge-square—I did not see from what place they came—they passed to the opposite side of the street—Harford came up, and he and I went over to them and stopped them—Harford asked them what they had been doing at that doorway in the square—they said, "We have been at no doorway—Harford said", "You have"—I saw the prisoner put his hand in the breast of his coat—Harford asked him what he had there—the prisoner took a step back—I saw something white in his hand in the air—he appeared to strike Harford, and he was knocked down—he also struck at me, but missed me—he then ran away—the other man ran away directly Harford was struck—when Harford got up we sprang our rattles, snd a short distance off I found the prisoner in the custody of Dunlap, almost momentarily—I ran after the other man, but he got away—I then returned, and saw the prisoner and Dunlap struggling violently on the ground—I saw him assault Dunlap by kicking him three or four times on the legs—he was secured—Harford came back after me—he was bleeding on the left side—he had a wound on the head—I afterwards saw Harford go out into the road and pick up this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is elastic—one end of it is loaded with lead—it is covered with white leather—it is very heavy.</p>

About 2 o'clock in the morning in question I was in Oxford-terrace, which is close by Cambridge-square—I heard a rattle spring—I saw the prisoner and another man running along Oxford-terrace—I saw him come from Porchester-street—Titchbourne-street runs into Upper Porchester-street, and from there, to go in the direction of Edgeware-road, you have to turn to the right along Ox ford-terrace, where I saw the prisoner and the other man; I drew my staff—I met the other man, he struck me, and I fell, and he got away—the prisoner had this instrument in his hand in a raised position at the time he was running—I had my staff out previously to seeing that—as he passed me he struck at me, and I caught the blow on my staff, and parried with my staff at the same time—I struck him on the head—this instrument flew out of his hand into the road, and he fell—I took hold of him, and we had a violent struggle together—I was at last enabled to spring my rattle—Masters came up to my assistance, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

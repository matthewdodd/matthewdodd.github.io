               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose the articles mentioned in the indictment? - A. Yes, on the 1st of June; the man that took them away carried my box, and I followed him; they were in my possession till I employed him to carry them home for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round - is that the man at the bar that you employed to carry your things? - A. He has got his appearance, he is not now drest in the same way he was then; it is not possible for me to say, but he is the size of that man, it may be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is the man, or is not? - - A. I cannot say; I was in search of a lodging in the dusk of the evening, and being a stranger in the neighbourhood, I asked the man if he could inform me of one; he said he would take me to his house, and he carried my trunk for me; my clothes were in a large trunk, and a great many more things in it than is expressed in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to the man, or the man to you, seeing you with a trunk? - A. I applied to the man; he was going to take me to his house, and he carried the trunk before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it you saw the man to whom you entrusted these things - was it near the workhouse? - A. No, not very near there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you missed him? - A. I cannot say; I missed him at the turn of a corner, I never saw him again till I saw him at the Public-office; he did not tell me where he was going to take my trunk to; it was a week, or several days, before I saw him again at the Public-office, then he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of your things again that your trunk contained? - A. Yes, some of them; I knew them when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the value of those things? - A. I cannot say the value of those things; the best of my things were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they worth twelve shillings? - A. Some pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect the person of the prisoner when you saw him at the Public-office - was his hair cut off them? - A. No, I could not say with certainty then; it might be the man; he has altered his dress every time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>- PARSONS sworn. - I am a butcher, I live in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that woman? - A. Yes, I saw that woman on the Tuesday after the robbery; on Saturday night, the 1st of June, about half after ten o'clock, the watchman came to my house, and brought a large trunk with him; I told him to take it to the watch-house, and while he went there, I was passing by the door of Mr. Levi, he keeps a clothes-shop; I looked into the shop, and I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100078"></xptr>some clothes lying on the counter, and the prisoner standing at the counter by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend to what was passing between the prisoner and Levi? - A. No; I went back to my wife, and told her what I had seen; she told me to go to Mrs. Levi's, and tell them not to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went into the shop, and cautioned Mrs. Levi not to buy them? - A. Yes, and Mrs. Levi said to the prisoner she thought he had not come honestly by the clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the clothes then lying on the counter? - A. Yes, and they were women's clothes; the prisoner answered, they were his Peg's, he sold them as he wanted to bury her decently; he was going to take them off the counter, and I prevented him, I told him if the clothes were his, and he could bring people to prove that the clothes belonged to him, he might have them, not else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go away then? - A. Yes, he went out, and never came back again; the things were left at Mrs. Levi's till the prosecutrix was found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present afterwards when these things were produced before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, the prosecutrix claimed them; she said they were some of the things that were in her trunk; the Magistrate censured my conduct, as being head-borough of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You behaved honestly, though you did not behave knowingly - have these things that was produced to Levi been kept separate from others? - A. (Coombes.) I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never mentioned those words the witness has said.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you agree about the price? - A. Yes; I went out to get change and the prisoner went with me; Parsons was passing up and down the door, he came in before we came back; when we came in (I had the change to pay the prisoner), Parsons called me back, and my mistress told me, that Mr. Parson's said, that the things were stolen; the prisoner said, he was sure they were not, they were his Peg's, his wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, by passing up and down our place; he said, she was dead, he sold the things as he wanted to bury her decent; the prisoner said he would go and fetch a witness to prove the truth of what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever come back? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things that the prisoner produced on the counter and said were his wife's, were these things taken before the Justice and shewn the prosecutrix? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street; the Magistrate desired me to take the things into my possession, I have had them in my custody ever since; the prosecutrix has been in Whitechapel workhouse ever since she was robbed, she has been ruined by it; I produce them. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday evening, the 1st of July, it might be about eight o'clock, I went to Mr. Davis's, the White Swan; I commonly go there every night when I have done my work; about half after nine o'clock a man came into the house with a bundle of clothes under his arm, apparently to me he was a soldier; he asked me whether I knew of a place where he could sell these clothes; he said, they were his wife's, she was deceased, and he had come out of the country; I told him I had lived in the neighbourhood a great many years, I was not accustomed to selling clothes, I never did sell any clothes in my life; he asked me to take them and sell them for him; I took them to Mr. Levi's, and during the time I was there, Mr. Parsons came in, and he said there was a trunk found, and that these things were stolen; I told Mr. Parsons I had them of a man who was waiting for me at Mr. Davis's; I had leave to go and fetch the man; I went back to Mr. Davis's, and brought the man out with me, and lost sight of him just by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Parsons.) Did this man, in your hearing, say that he had received them from a man to sell? - A. I never heard him say any such thing till Saturday week, when he was before the Justice; I am sure he did not say so in Levi's house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Norris.) Did he say at Levi's that he had got them from a man to sell? - A. He said that he came to sell them as his own deceased wife's.</p>

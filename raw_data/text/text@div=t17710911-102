I told the prisoner it was my property; he said he bought them of a man at Turnstile, in Holborn. Before Sir

            . The prisoner brought this saddle to Mr. Lowe's and offered to sell it; he said he was going out of town next day, and had no more use for it; he said he bought it in Long Acre. I desired him to come again when my master was at home; he came again, and then he was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met a friend of mine, who is a gentleman's servant; he said he had a saddle to dispose of; he asked me twenty-seven shillings for it; I said seventeen was nearer the matter. I walked with him to Turnstile, there we stopped. I said I will give you as much as any body; he said it was his own property. I told him I would give him a guinea, and that was the full value; he said he had another that was old, but it had a good bridle. I gave him a direction where I lived, and told him I should be at home in an hour. I went home about twelve o'clock; he had left that saddle and was gone home for the other; there were two women saw me buy them, one of them is ill, or she would have been here; there was a gentleman's servant too that knew of my buying them, but he is gone out of town. I paid for them about one o'clock, at my own house; I would not carry them home because I was going about some business, and being dressed pretty clean, I did not like to carry the saddles. It was in the month of June that I bought them. I intended to buy a horse the Friday following, in Smithfield.</p>

            . I lodge at the Anchor and Crown, in St. Martin's lane. I have been out of place three weeks. I know the prisoner at the bar very well, he lives in - I have forgot the name of the place, but I know it very well. I was there on a Monday afternoon; I went to drink a dish of tea; a young man came there with a saddle; he left that and went for another; they came to a guinea and a half; he had brown clothes on, like a gentleman's servant; I saw him write, but I could not read it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Williamson. No; I had not been long out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this ago?</p>
               <p>Williamson. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what month this is?</p>

               <p>Williamson. Indeed, sir, I am no schollard.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has he got?</p>
               <p>Williamson. He had two children, but they are dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was you drinking tea with?</p>
               <p>Williamson. His wife; I was helping her to wash, and I washed my own things.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in place since that?</p>
               <p>Williamson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he desire you to tell this story?</p>
               <p>Williamson. Never.</p>

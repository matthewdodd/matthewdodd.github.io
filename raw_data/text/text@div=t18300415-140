               <p>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS. I am porter at the Horse Bazaar. On the 12th of March I saw the two prisoners there - I had seen Perrara before; I had some conversation with another porter, and we went after the prisoners, who were then gone; we met Griffiths, who had this basket, and these glasses in it - they are the property of

            . I am a porter at the Bazaar. I saw the two prisoners there together; Griffiths had a basket, and when they left we missed the glasses - I went out, and came up with them about two hundred yards from the place; I saw Perrara put his hand into his coat pocket, take out one glass, and put it into the basket; I brought them back, and found these two glasses in the basket - I had seen them safe five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Griffiths' Defence. He said to this young man, "You must go back to the Bazaar;" I said, "What for?" he said, "You have something in your basket;" I said, Yes, and this young man said, "They are for patterns," but I never touched them.</p>

               <p>Perrara's Defence. I asked Griffiths where she was going - she said to Carburton-street; I left to go with her, but she got three streets off before I came to her.</p>
               <p>Perrara received an excellent character.</p>

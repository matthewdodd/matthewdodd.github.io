On the 4th of December I had this shirt, these shifts, trousers, and several other articles wrapped up in an ironing blanket, ready to iron - I was gone out for some work, and left them in my room on the first floor; it is at a shop, and there is a middle door, which is open in the day - a person might have walked in, and taken them; I went out about half-past eleven o'clock, and returned at one - I saw a crowd round the house, and was told a woman was at Bow-street office; I went there, and saw these articles -

            . I am landlord of the house. I believe these articles to belong to the prosecutrix and her husband - I had known the prisoner's person, but she had no right in the house - I came home at twenty minutes before one o'clock on the 4th of December, and heard some high words in the passage; I ran in, and saw the prisoner with this bundle of things by her side, and some in her apron; my wife was accusing her of having my property - she said, "I have nothing more belonging to you;" I said,"Before you go from here, I will go up stairs and see;" I went up - all the things in my room were packed up ready for removal, and I missed some articles; the prisoner must have been very busy, if she did it all herself - when I came down my wife said, "We will all go up together;" but the prisoner got to the door, and ran out - she was brought back.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Newgate-market, and met a woman in St. Andrews street, who said,"If you will go to a place up here, I will satisfy you for your trouble; go up to the one pair landing place, and there is a bundle near the door - I have had some words with my husband, and if I go in I shall be known; bring that bundle down, and if the door is open you will see another one;" I went, got these things, and as I was coming down the gentleman said, "Where are you going?" I said I was sent for these things - I put them down, and said I would go and get the person; they pursued me, and said I was going to make my escape - they would not give me time to fetch the person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You swear to the hay and oats? A. Yes, as far as one sample is like another - they are very fine oats, but others may have such - I can speak positively as to the sack - it had a particular mark, and it is here - all my sacks are marked, but this had been mended by one of my men - I took particular notice of it - the prisoner is a stable keeper, and had occasion for hay, and oats, and sacks - I lent him one sack, but that had no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that all your sacks were marked? A. No; not all - I never lent him but one sack - I never gave him one, nor sold him one - he never had a sack from my wife, to my knowledge - it was about the 29th of September that my attention was called to this - I do not remember the prisoner leaving town on the 28th, to go to his father, at St. Alban's - I do not remember him coming back till he was taken into custody - the first thing I said to him when he was taken was, that I had a strong suspicion he had some property of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to him, "Good morning, Sir; I was at your house yesterday?" A. No; I did not - it was on the Sunday that I saw his wife, and she said he was out- I did not know it till that night - I told him there was some oats and hay in his stable, and I wished him to tell me where he got them, as I had matched them with mine - he said he could very soon tell me where he purchased them - I said, if he could, that would be sufficient - he then said,"If I must tell you the truth, I had them from my father"- he then took me into the stable, and said if I would forgive him, he would tell me the truth - I said, "If you will tell me the truth, and no other person is connected with you, I will forgive you" - he then said he was afraid I would not forgive him - I do not think the policeman heard this - I did not ask the prisoner about my men being concerned- I had had no quarrel with him about a harness - I never had any words with him in my life - his father appeared before the magistrate, but he did not produce any sample of oats - he was ordered out of the office by the magistrate - he came to bolster up his son.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of oats were yours? A. Scotch potato oats - the hay was Aylesbury hay, cut in a particular shape, to fit boats - I missed the hay when it was found.</p>

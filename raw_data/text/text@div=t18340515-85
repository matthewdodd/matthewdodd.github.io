My wife and family live in the house, and my landlord's two sons - Powell lives at Isleworth, but his sons occupy a room in the house - I only rent two rooms, but have the range of all the house - his sons were living there at the time - one is eight years old, and the other two years old - they do not pay rent to me - they are placed there by their father - on the 2nd of May, at four o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise down stairs - I jumped up in bed - I heard the shutters opened, and the front door broken open - I went down stairs, and found the front door about three inches open, and the prisoner's shoes about four feet from the door, and a small parcel by them - I saw the glimpse of a person running from the kitchen - I caught him behind the door, and said, "Halloo, what are you doing here?" - he said he had only come in for two or three hours' sleep - I had bolted and locked the door the night before - I lost a sheet off the line in the kitchen, where it hung to dry; three caps out of another room; two small handkerchiefs, and fourpence farthing in copper - I have not seen the money since - I detained him, and gave him in charge - he was without shoes, and afterwards put on the shoes which I found - he had got in at the front parlour window, which I found half-way-down, and which had been shut overnight, but not fastened.</p>

             (police-constable T 104). I got the articles which I have produced when I took the prisoner to the station-house - I found the waistcoat, three caps, a small handkerchief, and two pieces of lace in his hat - he owned himself guilty to me - I said nothing to induce him to confess - I found 103/4d. on him - he did not seem at all in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not consider myself guilty of the crime laid to my charge - two persons, particularly one, has sworn false, for I never had the articles in my possession - I can safely say as a man, in the face of the Almighty, I never committed an offence before in my life - I have been in His Majesty's service some years, and in the young Queen of Portugal's - I wrote a publication in my name, "Thomas Knight, lately a corporal in the British battalion."</p>

             - we were seized by three young men; the prisoner was the one on my left hand - one of them ran against me, and seized my seals; the chain broke, and he got that and the seals - I said, "My chain and seals are gone!" the prisoner at this time was holding my left side; I turned round, and saw the man who seized my chain run down West-street. I said to the prisoner, "I'll have you; you are one of them" - he was with the other two; he tried to get away, but I held him; he dragged me to the top of West-street and knocked my hat off - I then knocked his hat off, and let him go to recover mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he stopped when his hat fell off, and asked you for it? A. No, he did not - I was sure of him before the Alderman - when I called Watch! I was surrounded by a number of people.</p>
               <p>MARY WHITE. I was with Murray on Sunday evening; three persons came round us - I do not know who took the chain - they were all in company - Murray took the prisoner; I saw the chain and seals go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you his sister? A. No; I do not know that he took them.</p>

On the 3rd of August, I was in the Almonry, Westminster, about nine o'clock at night; I met with the prisoner; I went to her lodgings; I was with her from nine o'clock until two in the morning; I missed her about two in the morning, and I missed my property at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you lose - A. I had eighty pounds in my pocket; there were three or four ten-pound notes; they were in my pocket-book.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Feltham, in the parish of Feltham, in Middlesex, and occupy a house there—I am a labourer, but am not able to do any work now. On Saturday evening, the 9th of December, I locked my house up, and came away—I went down to my son's to get shaved—I returned at a little after nine o'clock, and found the house broken open—I have two doors, both of which I had locked up, and I found both broken open—both the staples were drawn, and one broken—there was plenty of victuals in the house, but I missed nothing but a cask of elder wine out of the room I live in—I have a room to myself—my son lodges with me—I am the housekeeper—there were nine gallons of wine—I saw my cask afterwards at the prisoner's house, about one o'clock on Sunday morning—I have known him from his infancy—he lives thirty or forty yards from my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Feltham. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house last Saturday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he had a cask of elder wine in his house which did not belong to him—he said, "No"—I searched the house, and seeing the earth fresh under the stairs, as if it had been removed, I had the coals removed, and saw a sack—I had the sack re moved, and then saw the cask, which I produce—I have had the care of it</p>

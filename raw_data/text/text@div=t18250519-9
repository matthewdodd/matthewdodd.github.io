               <p>MR. HENRY HODGSON. I live at Wanstead, in Essex. On the 10th of May, about seven o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18250519-9-crimeloc58">Fleet-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250519-9-crimeloc58" type="placeName" value="Fleet-street"></interp>

While Curtis was searching Hall in a shop, a person came in, and said something - Curtis then went out and brought Phillips in, who was searched, and the handkerchief found in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He had it openly in his hand? A. Yes. He said he had taken it from a boy in the street who had taken it. I had not seen him till he came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he came and said that was not the person, did he then shew you the handkerchief? A. No, my Lord; it happened about six yards on this side of Temple-bar: we were on the City side when Phillips came up.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Mr. Hodgson on the other side of Temple-bar, with Hall in custody - I took him into a shop to search him, and in consequence of what I heard I went out to Bell-yard, and saw Phillips surrounded by people, with the handkerchief in his hand - I immediately took him; he said, "I have picked this up, and anybody may have it," and that it was dropped by some boy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was in the open street? A. In the yard. I did not hear him state to Mr. Hodgson that he took it from a boy - he might have said so. I was busy searching them.</p>
               <p>PHILLIPS'S Defence. The gentleman said he saw the officer take it out of my hand - he was in the shop, and I was through Temple-bar.</p>

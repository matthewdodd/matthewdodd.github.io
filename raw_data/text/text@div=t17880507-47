             sworn.</p>
               <p>About seven, on the Sunday morning; I saw the other prisoner, the boy, with this sack; containing a copper kettle, and a sauce-pan, a brass pestle, and a mortar, and a quart copper pot; he was knocking at the door of an old iron shop, in East-Smithfield; I took him into custody; I asked him where he got the things; he said, he had them of a black man; I had myself, before then, met a black man; but I cannot say it was this black man that is now at the bar; I took him into custody; and on the next day, I advertized the things; Mr. Andrews came, and claimed them; and I took the black man into custody, on the information of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Court to Miller. How far is Church-lane from Greenfield-street? - I believe it is about three hundred yards; I am positive this black prisoner is the man I saw with the sack on his back.</p>
               <p>What kind of a sack was it? - It was a brown sack, such as we have pollard in.</p>
               <p>What size sack was it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But as near as you can guess? - I believe it was a three bushell sack.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any mark upon it? - I did see some letters, but I did not take so much notice what they were on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Andrews. What sort of a sack was it? - A sack that contains pollard and bran, which we give to our horses; they will contain eight bushels of pollards, and they will contain four bushels of corn.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas, the black man. I have got something to say, that I know nothing at all about it; on Sunday morning I came over the water to get something to eat; I got a shilling, and I went into a public-house, and got something to eat; and on the Monday or Tuesday, I do not know which, I just got a pint of beer, and they took me into custody; I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER KING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>About six I was coming up Wapping, and a man asked me to carry this sack for him a little way.</p>
               <p>What man? - I cannot be sure of the man; I took it upon my back, and carried it to the place where I thought he directed me; I could not find any man.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he that gave you the bag to carry? - It was not near light.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was a black man or no? - He was not a black man.</p>

On the 25th of February, about a quarter past eleven, the prisoner came by me with a bag on his back; I asked him what he had? he said, some fowls, that came from Lynn, in a brig, and the brig lay at Deptford; I took him to the watch-house; there were seven hens and a cock; the cock had his head off; he said the captain had no place to put them in, and when he came to Deptford he killed them; Mr. Morpeth came the next day, and owned the fowls.</p>

How was it possible for me to observe that they were talking - he was on the other side, and I did it merely out of a lark, as we often do with these countrymen; I called after him, when he had got about twenty yards.

            . On the 14th of August I was driving along Piccadilly, about half-past five o'clock in the morning - Gardner told me that the prisoner had snatched someoff the shafts; I turned round, and he began to call out-I went back, and said, "You thief, what did you take that for?" he said he did not - I said, "You did;" I made a blow at him - he jumped back; I went to take the things and he struck me on the nose - I gave him in charge.</p>

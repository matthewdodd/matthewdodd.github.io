                  </hi>. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. On the af<lb></lb>ternoon of the 1st of December I was in Long-acre, and went to the Piazza, Covent-garden—I was looking at some cloth there, when a witness told me my handkerchief was taken, and the prisoner was pointed out—I immediately pursued him—he went under the arch to the centre of the market, and round to the right again—I did not get my handkerchief again—I did not observe other people about—I had used my hadker<lb></lb>chief within half an hour—it was a red one with, I think, a yellow border, with "J. B." on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Raven-row, Mile-end and am a labourer. I was in Long-acre, and saw the prisoner—he pulled the handkerchief partly out of the prosecutor's pocket, and looked at it, and put it in again—the prosecutor went on and looked at some cloth, and then the prisoner took it quite out—I told the gentleman—we both pursued him to the middle arch of the market, he turned to the right, and then to the right again, before he was taken—he might have thrown the handkerchief away—I did not see it—he did not run, I believe, till the gentleman called, "Stop thief"—I pursued him closely—he ran two or three minutes, and had a full opportunity of throwing it away—it was a red colour, and ap<lb></lb>perd like a silk one—I told the prosecutor it was a red one when he found it was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Browning and three others, we are oil-merchants, and carry on business at 113, St. Jobn-street. Rooke was our carman, and had been so about twenty-one months—Leggett had been in our service, but left I think about April last—on the morning of 29th Aug. my attention was called by our warehouseman, John Huggins, to a can of ten gallons of olive oil which was in our new warehouse—it had no right to be there—it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gallon—those fine oils are always drawn by ray particular order—my warehouseman marked the can in my presence, and I left it where I found it—I looked for it between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, and it was gone—about eleven the same evening I looked for it with Huggins and the policeman, and after some time we found it under some straw in the wagon which Rooke drove—there was another ten-gallon can with it of the same sort of oil—the value of the two was between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had no directions on them—I saw the cans again on the morning of 30th Aug.—there was a direction on them then—they are the property of our firm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Browning. I have heard Mr. Browning's evidence; it is correct—Rooke drove the wagon—on 30th Aug., between five and six o'clock in the morning, I saw the cans—Rooke came to work about six, and about nine he took the wagon out of the yard, to the front of the premises, to have it loaded—he bad a load of five pipes of seal-oil—he helped to load the wagon, and was in it—I gave him a delivery-note for these five pipes of oil—he had not to take two cans of fine olive-oil—when goods are sent out, it is a rule that delivery-notes are to be given with them—four of those pipes were to go to Hale's Wharf, and one to Topping's Wharf—I do not know how the cans of oil got into the wagon—I gave no order for their being taken.</p>

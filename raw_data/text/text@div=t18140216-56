            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's house in Petticoat-lane, on Wednesday the 9th of February, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. Yes, and there were three other persons that have been tried; they were charged with stealing sealing wax and pencils. I desired my fellow officer to secure the prisoners while I ran up stairs. I went up stairs; I found this compass up two pair of stairs. I took the prisoner up with me; I asked him how he came by it; he said he bought it the night before of a man for one pound. This is the compass.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it is my compass; it was brought to my warehouse on Monday night; I saw it in my warehouse about twelve at noon on Tuesday. I removed the compass myself, and set it on a medicine chest in the middle of the warehouse. Mine is a wholesale warehouse; I sell nothing retail. This compass was for a ship of my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Tuesday week a sailor came in; he asked me for a lodging; he had a box under his arm; he slept at my house that night; he paid me sixpence for his lodging. On Wednesday morning he asked me to let him leave this box, and on Wednesday the officer came and took me in custody.</p>

            . I am the son of the prisoner; I live at No. 5, Meeting-house-yard, Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. My father keeps a clothes-shop, and lives in Petticoat-lane. He lets out lodgings for seafaring men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at his house when this article was brought in - A. I was; it was brought in by a sailor last Tuesday night week, between seven and eight o'clock. The sailor asked for a lodging; he was accommodated with a lodging; he paid sixpence for a bed. He lodged in the front two pair of stairs room, in a four-bedded room. I slept in the same room the sailor did. I laid hold of one handle of the compass box, and the sailor the other, I helped him up stairs with it. In the room he uncovered it, and shewed me the compass.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the compass taken away by him - A. No, I saw it there the next morning; he asked my father to let him leave it there, and he would fetch it away on Thursday.</p>
               <p>COURT. What day was your father taken up - A. Wednesday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no talk of buying the compass - A. No, not a word.</p>

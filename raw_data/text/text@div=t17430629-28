my Friend said, may be may be come out; and in about ten Minutes Time, I saw the Prisoner come out of the House; and, I observed, that she had a great Lane of Goods in her Apron, and I did not perceive that she had any when she went in; I followed her, and called after her, and said Mistress, or Madam, but she would not stop; I then ran after her, and ever took her, and caught her in this Manner, with both my Hands, by her Petticoats, and hold her fast; I asked her what she had been about in my House, or the Apartment that I had in the House she said, she had been doing no Harm, for she had been no farther than my empty Entry, therefore she could do me no Harm - I never saw he before that Time in my Life; she said, she had been bundling up Things in the Entry; I asked her what they were? she said, it was no Matter to me. for they were her Goods: I told her I would see what they were; then, she said, if I would see what they were, I must go with her where she was going, and I should see there; I told her, I would go no farther, but would see them: I held her fast, and put one Hand into her Apron; and the first Thing I saw was one of my own Gowns (there was a large Parcel of Goods produced, as in the Indictment. which were sworn to by Mrs Wheeler) the next Thing I saw was my Husband's Shag Breeches, with the Knee-Buckle in them, the Fellow of which I had then in my Shoe, and have now; when I saw them, I made no farther doubt but they were all mine; I still held her, and cried I was robbed and desired the Neighbours to send for a Constable: she desired that I would not put her into the Hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290015"></xptr> of a Constable, or a Publican, and she would return me my Goods; I own, says she, I have done an ill Thing to you; but if you will let me go about my Business, and not put me into the Hands of any Body - if you will not put me into the Hands of any Body, and not expose me, I will give you your Goods and your Money; the first Time she only said she would give me my Goods; I did not know that she had got any Money; because I did not recollect, that there was any Silver among the Cloaths; and I was frightened for fear she should have got to my other Money; and then, I was willing to withdraw from the Folk, which I had called to my Assistance, to get her into the Apartment again, from which she had taken the Things, thinking she would return me the Money; and believing that she had got a large Sum; I took her into the Entry she came out of, and shut to the Door to keep the Mob out; she then threw down the Cloaths, and put her Hand in her Pocket and pulled out the Money, and gave it me; when I found it was only the Silver that was in the Cloaths; I threw it down; for I was very glad she had not got to the other Money) and then I went to open the Door, to let in the People I had called to my Assistance; she then went to hold me, to prevent me from opening the Door of the Entry; I pushed her from me, to let the People in, that the Thief might go to Newgate; but, I was not willing she should go, till I saw whether she had got my other Money; for she might have spent my Money in Newgate; and, if I had sent her there, she would not have delivered me the Money; and I could not swear to the current Coin. - The Reason of my opening the Door, was to have the Prisoner secured; for I could not have kept her long, if I had not had Assistance: when I opened the Door, some of the Neighbours came in, and desired the Door might be shut again, to keep the Mob from running away with the Things; they bid me take my Cloaths off the Ground, and tie them up, and see what Money there was, which I did, and there was four Shillings; said I, to the Prisoner, there was more Money than this; she said, she had two Shillings when she came in, and if she had more than that, it was my own; she put her Hand in her Pocket, pulled out four Shillings, and put two of them into my Hand, which made six Shillings, and said she had no more, then she begged and prayed for Mercy, and that she might: have Leave to run away, but I thought it was not safe for me to let her; so she was secured, and carried before Justice Deveil; one Thing I forgot, that when the Neighbours first came in, they heard her throw down a Key, and I made her take up the Key, and give it me; and they desired me to go up, and see whether that Key opened my Door; and that Key locked and unlocked my Door, which was then open, and my Drawers swept of all that was in them; I desired she might be searched, and there were 8 Keys more found upon her; there was a Street-Door Key, Keys for Chamber-Doors, and other Keys.</p>

            . I keep a Publick-House in Oxford Market; as I was at my Door, I heard somebody call Mr Norman; I turned about, and saw Mrs Wheeler have the Prisoner hold by the Petticoat, and was bringing her along; and desired me to come to her Assistance; and, in the mean Time, took the Prisoner over to her own House; and then I went into my own House again, and sent my Wife; and when I came, the Door was bolted, or latched; I stood a Minute or two, and the Door was opened; there was a Parcel of Linnen lying upon the Floor; I can swear to some of them. Mrs Wheeler was making a great Noise, and said, she was robbed of all she had: There were four Shillings and some Half-pence lying on the Floor; the Prisoner pulled four Shillings out of her Pocket, and gave Mrs Wheeler two; and said, the other two were her's; she began to cry, and begg'd for God's Sake, that she would let her go about her Business; for she was a poor unfortunate Woman, and did it to support a young Child, which she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About six Weeks ago, Mrs Smith came to my Shop to speak to me (she owed me 16 s. 6 d.)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290016"></xptr> and desired I would go along with her to see some Lodgings; I told her I could not go; then she came another Time; I told her I was going to leave my House, and take a first Floor; she said she had taken a pretty Place, and desired I would go and see it; this was on Saturday Se'nnight, but I could not go, and on Monday I went to Ratcliff Cross : On Tuesday I saw Mrs Smith again, I told her. I I could not go then, for I must go to the Boarding-School in Cavendish Square; but I would go on Wednesday, and accordingly I did go with her, and as I came down. Oxford Square, says she. Come up Stairs, did not I tell you I had a pretty Apartment; I must move before Quarter Day, and I desire you would see whether there are any Bugs in the Walls, for I had a Receipt from abroad to kill Bags, and had no Occasion to take her Things. She went up one Pair of Stairs higher, and asked if one Mr Johnson was within, a Child answered, and said no; she had a Bundle of Cloath pined up, and she gave them to me to carry for her, and she gave me the Money; I had not got three Yards from the Door before Mrs Wheeler said, G - d d - n you for a B - h, you have robbed me; I said, Madam, I have not; (for no Body could see what I had) I was afraid of her, for I found her to be a very violent spirited Woman, she said little to me, but she called me all the B - es she could think of; one of the Gentlemen of the Jury told me she was a vile Woman, and would swear any thing, and if your Lordship will inquire into her Character, you will find her to be so *.</p>
               <p>* This comes with a very ill Grace from the Prisoner, whose Life is probably owing to the Compassion of the Prosecutrix: For had this Felony been laid to have been committed (as the Fact was) in a Dwelling-House, it had been a capital Offence.</p>

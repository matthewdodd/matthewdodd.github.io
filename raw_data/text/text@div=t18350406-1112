In the afternoon of the 18th of March, at five o'clock, I saw the prisoner Dunn with a pocket of hops on his head on a knott—Messrs. Barlow, Gills, and White's premises are in the Maze, in Tooley-street, and Rutter's premises are about 200 yards from them—Dunn came out of the Maze, and went down Mill-lane, where Rutter's premises are—when he got to Rutter's gate, he put the pocket of hops down—I went up to him, and asked him where he brought them from?—he said, from Messrs. Barlow, Gill, and White's, and if I wished, he would go back with me to the warehouse—I said, he might if he liked—and he took up the hops, and went with me—when we got to Messrs. Barlow's ware-house, he called Lloyd to the door, and Grubb came out with him—Dunn said, "The policeman has stopped me with these hops, are they not all right?"—Lloyd said, "They are all right," and he pulled this piece of paper out of his pocket (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"March 18, 1835. Mr. Butter: Please to receive one po. repack, from T. Saxby"—I then went back with Dunn to Rutter's premises, as I was not quite satisfied—Dunn took the hops, and I followed him—I saw Rutter come out of a public-house opposite his premises—Dunn put the hops against the gate—Ratter took out the key, opened the gate and went in—Dunn put the hops inside the gate—I asked Mr. Rutter if he received these hops—he said, "Yes, I do; for I paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I said, "For how many?"—he appeared confused, and gave me no direct answer, but said, he had had a deal of trouble with our men before—I then spoke to Bride, a police-constable, told him to take charge of the hops; not to let them go away—I then went to the prosecutor's counting-house, in High-street, Borough, near the Town-hall—I saw Mr. White and Saxby there—from what I learned, I went back to the warehouse—I went from there to the Red Man public-house, and found Rutter and Lloyd in conversation in the parlour—I asked Lloyd what quantity of hops there were in the bag that he had just sent out—he refused to give me any answer—I told him I had seen Mr. White; it was my duty to prosecute this in<lb></lb>quiry, and I was determined to know—he hesitated some time, and then said, "Seven pounds"—I again asked him for how many hops—he said he did not know, for Grubb had weighed them, and Grubb was only at the warehouse—I asked him to go over there with me, and show me the entry, and let me know the weight of them—we went, and Lloyd called Grubb—I asked Grubb what was the weight of the hops he had sent out—after some hesitation, he said, "1 cwt. 1 qr. 191bs."—I asked him if he had made the entry, and said, "I should like to see it"—he turned to look at the slate, and then he looked at several pieces of paper that were lying on the desk, then, all on a sudden, he ran up the ladder—at that time Lloyd left me—Grubb remained up stairs about a minute, and he came down with this piece of paper in his hand, with 1 cwt." 1 qr. 19lbs. upon it—I said, "You have just done this, it is wet," and I smeared the writing—I then went over to the Red Lion, where I saw Lloyd and Rutter again—I called the officer, Morgan, and I gave them into his custody—I then went back to the warehouse to look for Grubb, and gave him to an officer—I then went back to the Red Lion, and took Dunn in the tap-room—I weighed the pocket of hops—it weighs 1 cwt. 1 qr. 26lbs. bare weight—</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of John Barlow, Gill, and White—we are hop-merchants—our counting-house is near the Town-hall, and our warehouse in the Maze—Lloyd was our foreman, and Dunn one of the porters—I did not know Rutter, but by name—when hops arrived from the country, the side of the pocket is cut open and a quantity of hops are taken out, which are trimmed into a form called a sample, and the hops which are cut away from the sample, constitute a quality which are again put in pockets, and called repacks—this is a custom perfectly well known in the trade—Mr. Thomas Saxby was a customer of ours, and was in the habit of purchasing repacks of us—on the first of February, he purchased eight pockets of repacks, which were numbered according to the custom of our trade, one to eight inclusive; and I gave instructions that Saxby was to have the repacks, and I ordered the man to deliver them to Saxby's order—the pocket of hops in question does not fall within the numbers from one to eight—I am not aware that there is any written order from Saxby for the delivery of these hops—I know that three of the pockets of repacks had been delivered, and that there are five more remaining—Saxby certainly had no authority to sell any of our hops—the pocket in ques<lb></lb>tion had never been sold to Saxby—I had never given orders to deliver any hops to Rutter—it is not unusual to send hops out on a man's head—a slate is kept in the warehouse to make rough entries on, and then they are entered in the book—the weight of the hops is not put down on the slate—we have regular books for that.</p>

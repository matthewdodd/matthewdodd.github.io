                  </hi> I am a milkman—I have known Horn some time—I met him on this Friday afternoon, about twenty minutes past four, in Devon's-lane, that is much nearer Bow than the Railway Tavern—I should say it is a mile form the Docks—Horn called out <hi rend="italic">hoy</hi>, and went into a beer<lb></lb>shop—I went in and helped to drink some half-and-half, and walked with them into Bow—the prisoner said to me, "There are the little houses when he lives, I will take him home safe to his father and mother, because he has got money about him; they will be glad to see him at home"—I left them going on that way.</p>

                  </hi> I live at the Bird-in-Hand, Bow-road—the prisoner and Horn came there—Horn was very much in liquor—the prisoner called for a quartern of rum—after that, they went into the tap-room, sat down, and a pot of half-and-half was brought—the prisoner told me Horn had got about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about him, that he was going to see him <hi rend="italic">righted</hi>, that his mother lived just below, at the almshouses, and he would see him safe home—he brought the half-and-half back, and had half a quartern of noyeau—he put some water to it from a jug which stood on the counter, and gave it to Horn to drink—he did not take any of it himself—Horn drank it all—they left the house directly—it was near five o'clock—they did not go towards the almshouses, but towards the Fair-field, quite an opposite road—that was the last I saw of them—next morning Horn came to me to make inquiry.</p>

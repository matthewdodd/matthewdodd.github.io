On the 1st of June, at half-past eight o'clock, I left the stable safe, and at half-past six o'clock in the morning I found the harness taken and thrown about the hen-house; a hen, the curry comb, and brushes were gone. I found the curry comb and brushes in a pig-stye, close by. A man in Westbrook's house could drop them over there. The stable window was broken open.</p>

            . I am a fisherman, and live next door to Westbrook, and Stroud lives next door to him. On the night of the 1st of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was awoke by a noise - I opened the window, looked out, and saw Westbrook in his yard, within about a yard of his own door; it was moon-light - I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! Thomas, what are you up to now?" he made no answer, but put himself against his back door, as if to hide himself, and in five or ten minutes returned, and I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, it won't do, Tom, for Barrenger has opened his window, and seen me." Stroud was at that time up in Mr. Broxholm's loft. I heard a trampling on the sticks. He picked up something, and threw it into the loft window - I then saw Stroud come out of the loft window. I am positive of him, and believe Westbrook to be the other man, but will not swear to him. The man was in his yard, but his brother lodges with him, and they are nearly alike. Next morning Mr. Broxholm called on me; I would not tell him anything about it, as I was afraid of my life. I have a doubt whether it was Westbrook; he spoke very low, I could not distinguish his voice. I am certain of Stroud.</p>

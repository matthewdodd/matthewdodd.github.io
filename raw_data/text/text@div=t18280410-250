               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You did not see the prisoner near you at the time your property taken? A. Yes, they were both together, and the other took the seals; it did not occupy a minute; I did not pursue the person who took them; the prisoner did not say it was accidental; he denied that he pushed me at all; he did not say his eyes were bad, and he could not see.</p>

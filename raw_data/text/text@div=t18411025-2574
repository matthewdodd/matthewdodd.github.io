                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at No. 8, Great Earl-street, Seven-dials—I have known the prisoner three years, and have been in the habit of going to see her now and then at her lodging. On the night of the 28th of September, I met her in Drury-lane, between ten and eleven o'clock, and went with her to a public-house at the corner of Drury-lane—she appeared to have been drinking—I afterwards went with her to her lodging in Smith's-court, Charles-street, Drury-lane—I fell asleep there—on awaking I missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think it was about half-past two when I awoke—the prisoner was in the room—she awoke me by coming in, and I accused her of taking the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—she denied it at first—I insisted on having it, and she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down half-a-crown—I insisted on having my money back—she ran to the door, bolted it, ran to the dresser, got a knife out of the tray, and stabbed me with it once in the cheek, and once underneath the jaw—she struck me four times—I closed on her, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her down, and ran out of doors, and she ran all up the court after me, beating me on the head—a policeman came to my assistance—I was bleeding very much, and lost a great deal of blood, and was very weak—I was taken to the hospital—the prisoner bolted the door before she made the attack on me, and I unbolted it when I pushed her down, to get out of the way—my head was affected from the loss of blood, and I was very faint, so that I could not make any very effectual resistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Smith's-court, Charles-street, Drury-lane. On the 29th of September, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was in the court, and saw the prosecutor rush out of the prisoner's room, saying "You have killed me, you have killed me," and the prisoner after him, beating him as hard as she could with both her hands—I stopped till she returned to her own room—I went to the prose<lb></lb>cutor, and found him bleeding, I thought for death—a policeman came, and I left—I saw a piece of skin about two inches, or two-and-a-half inches long, hanging down from his right cheek—he was much exhausted from loss of blood.</p>

               <p>and heard a cry of "Police"—I ran to the spot, and saw Reynolds lean<lb></lb>ing against the wall, bleeding profusely from a wound in his face, and the flesh of his face was hanging down—he was nearly fainting—I sent him to the hospital—I afterwards went to the prisoner's room, No. 6, Smith's-court—found a great quantity of blood on the floor, and on the dresser a knife, with wet blood all over the blade—I traced the blood through the passage into the court to where I had found Reynolds—I afterwards saw the prisoner brought from No. 3, in the court, by Russell—I asked how she came to stab the man—she said she knew nothing about it, and if he was stabbed, be had stabbed himself—her face and clothes were completely covered with blood, all through to her white petticoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was with Lawrence, and not finding the prisoner in her room, I went to the attic of No. 3, and found her covered with blood, sitting on a bed—she appeared to have been drink<lb></lb>ing—I told her the charge—she said nothing then, but on the way down stairs she said it was not her, and in Drury-lane, she asked if the man was dead, or if he was likely to come against her—at the station-house she was asked several times to give up a knife which she had, and she said she would keed it to cut her own throat—she afterwards gave it up—it was a penknife.</p>

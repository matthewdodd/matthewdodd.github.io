On the 9th of December, my wife went out between one and two o'clock in the morning, to nurse a woman; I went out at eight, leaving nobody in the house, and left my watch on the front parlour mantel-piece, and am sure I fastened the door with a spring lock - I put the key on a nail between the door and window; we always put it there for the lodgers: I have known the prisoner three or four years - he has been a groom, and was in the habit of coming to see my son, who is about his own age; he knew where I put the key - I returned at one o'clock, and left again at two; I am sure the latch of the door caught - the watch was on the mantel-piece; I returned at eight, and it was gone - I found the door fast, as I had left it, and the key in its place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your son here? A. No; he lives with me - he went out, and returned with me - he was working at the same factory as me, but was not in my sight all the time; the lodger knew where to find the key.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ANDERTON. I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road. On the 19th of December, in the evening, the prisoner pawned this watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see him before? A. I do not know - it was about six or seven o'clock; I am sure he is the boy.</p>

               <p>CHARLES AMBROSE. I received this cloth from Mr. Neal, about a quarter before six o'clock, to take to Mr. Williams, York-street, Commercial-road - as I passed Bishopsgate church-yard, I saw the prisoner, who asked me to let him carry it - I refused; he asked me again, and I gave it him; we went on to Cutler-street, and then he gave it me, saying, "I shall overtake you soon;" he came again soon after, and took it, and when he got to a turning, he said, "I have dropped it;" he knocked me on one side to look for it; he then said a man had taken it from his shoulder - he was going away, but I called Stop thief! and he was taken.</p>

            . On this evening I was in Bishopgate church-yard, and met a young man, (not the prisoner,) carrying a piece of cloth in his arms - and when I got throught the post, I met Ambrose in great distress, saying he had lost a piece of cloth - the prisoner was there, and some person attempted to rescue him - he was very resolute, and resisted very much; I and two or three others had great difficulty to secure him - two or three others, and a woman, appeared to assist him; he said he lived in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050102"></xptr>Hosier-lane, I asked how he came there - he gave no answer - we took him into a public-house, and it was stated there, that when the prisoner gave the lad the cloth, at the corner of Cutler-street, he beckoned to another person.</p>

I first saw him with the cloth, which appeared to be heavy - he was placing it on the shoulder of another person; I said he appeared tired - he said he was, and asked which way I was going - I said to Whitechapel, and he asked me to carry it part of the way; in going up a court from Houndsditch to Whitechapel, somebody forced it from my shoulders; I rushed after him, but was prevented by the boy taking hold of my coat.</p>

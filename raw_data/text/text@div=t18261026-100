               <p>ELLEN GORDON. I am a widow - I live at Newington, and am a <rs id="t18261026-100-viclabel549" type="occupation">dress-maker</rs>

I was taken very ill that night in the square, and the prisoner came and said, "Gordon, is that you?" and offered to take me to her lodgings in <placeName id="t18261026-100-crimeloc550">Pump-court, Westminster</placeName>

The next morning, having no money about me, I gave her my handkerchief to pawn, and she took up my lace-cap and said, "Let me take this too;" I said, "Do," and when she came back, she gave me a glass of gin - I was still in bed, and I turned round and went to sleep again - I awoke in about an hour and a half, and all the articles stated in the indictment were gone, and the prisoner also. I did not know what to do, as I had nothing to put on - I did not see the prisoner again till the Tuesday, when I met her with my bonnet on; I caught her, and took her to St. James's watch-house - I never permitted her to pawn any thing but the cap and handkerchief, which I believe she pawned for 3s. I knew her by the name of Simmonds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This lady has no claim to the name of Gordon; but she has gone by the name of the Duchess of Gordon - she is a common prostitute - the last witness keeps a house of the same description. When I met her, near one o'clock in the morning, quite intoxicated, I asked her if she would have a coach home, and she said she had not the money to pay for it. I am married to a person of the name of Benjamin - all the articles were given me to pawn except the bonnet, which was lent to me.</p>

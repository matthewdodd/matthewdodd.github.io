I was in my parlour on the 20th of April, and saw the prisoner come in with this glass, which he placed down by a cupboard in the passage - he was very much in liquor, and insisted upon having some drink - I would not serve him - he became very turbulent, and I told the servant to put him out - he has been at our house occasionally - he lodged at a respectable house just by.</p>

             (police-serjeant L 63.) On the 20th of April I was on duty in St. Martin's-lane - I saw the prisoner in the act of getting into a cab; and this glass was handed to him in the cab by another person - it was then about half-past three o'clock - I ran and told the driver to go to Bow-street, as he was a reputed thief - the cabman made use of very abusive language, and said he would not - he whipped his horse and drove off - I ran and took the number of the cab, and reported the circumstance, and in half an hour I heard the glass had been stolen - I traced the prisoner to the Hampstead-road, and there found the glass - I went to his lodging and found him on a sofa - he made great resistance, and struck, and kicked, and bit us - it took four or five of us to take him - I found in his room this stock, two bits, a jemmy, some pick-lock keys, and a dark lanthorn on a new construction - I found a metal box soldered together - I opened it, and found in it this model of a key taken in soap - this glass was at the public-house; but this piece of the frame was at his room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far were you from me when I called the cab? A. I did not see you till you were in the cab - I was about four hundred yards from you - I said to you,"Your name is Nelson: you are a brass-founder" - I followed the cab as far as Pall-mall.</p>

               <p>- WICKINS (examined by the Prisoner.) I am a cab-driver. On the day you called my cab, and got in, another man gave you the glass - the policeman came and asked you if you were not a brass-founder - you told him you was - I do not know that you told him where you was going - the policeman said he knew you, and told me to drive to Bow-street - I said the gentleman had hired me to go to Somers-town, and you told me to go on - I touched the horse, and went on - there were several round the cab - you said to the man who gave you the glass,"You are satisfied?" - he said, "I am," and he went away.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the prisoner intoxicated? A. He was a little in liquor - he told me to drive to Somers-town; but when we got to Camden-town, he said, "Draw up here" - he got out - a lady and gentleman came out on a balcony, and they said he would break the glass - I told him he had better leave it; but he said "No, it is my property; I will take it."</p>

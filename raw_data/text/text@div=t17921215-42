               <p>My husband's name is William, I lost the sheets, the 19th of November. The prisoner came in for a pint of beer, on Monday, about half past one; I went and drawed the beer myself, and when I came up, she refused the beer; said she was in a hurry, but told my husband, she would have a glass at the bar, which, she said, was the same to me, and suited her; she had something in her hand, but I did not know she had robbed me, till about three o'clock, when I went up stairs, and found my bed sadly tumbled, and missed my sheets, but did not know who had robbed me, till about five, or half after four; this same woman came into my house again at just dusk, and she came from the tap-room to me, and asked me for a pint of gin hot; I went to get it, and before I could get it hardly on the fire, I heard there was somebody in my bed-room; I went to see who it was; my husband went up the first, and met her coming out of the bed-room in the club-room. Mr. Armstrong was sent for, and there was a duplicate of the sheets<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150076"></xptr>found on her; she took the sheets at noon; I believe, Mr. Armstrong has the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. These very identical sheets? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn them? - Once at Catherine-wheel alley. I am a widow, and have eleven children.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. What time of the day were these pawned. - The 19th of November; I think, about three o'clock, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barker. When was the first time you pawned these sheets? - I pawned them about eight or ten weeks ago, with Mr. Davidson, the corner of Catherine-wheel alley; they gave me a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other time? - Before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to insist on it, they are the same sheets? - They are the same sheets.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Davis. Were these sheets ever out of your house before? - Never, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Tyler knows I have pawned them in his shop before now.</p>
               <p>Court to Tyler. Did she ever pawn these sheets before? - Never, to my knowledge. I don't know whether it is proper to mention it to you, but this woman, (Barker,) brought me a letter from the prisoner; the purport of it was to induce me to say the sheets were pawned separate.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barker. Did you carry this letter. - I did.</p>

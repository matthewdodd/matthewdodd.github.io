                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I live at Strand on the Green, and work for Mr. Grange, of Uxbridge—on Saturday night, the 7th of March, I went into the Red Lion public-house, at Uxbridge, kept by Mr. Johnson—I went between ten and eleven o'clock at night—I had then one sovereign, two half-crowns, two sixpences, and nine shillings about me—I had counted it just before I went in—I had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Grange, and had given him two penny-pieces—when I went into the public-house, the two prisoners were sitting in the tap-room together—I called for a pint of beer, and sat down, but not near them—I fell partly asleep—my money was in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I was awoke by Woodcock having his hand in my pocket—I caught hold of his arm, when his hand was in my pocket, and he let the money fall from his hand on the floor—I accused him of robbing me—he said he had not, and began sparring at me—Howard was standing with his back to the table, and he picked up the money—I asked him for it, and he said he had not got it—I told the landlord to keep the prisoners, and I went to get an officer—I could not get one, but I got the watchman; and when I got back Mr. Johnson had let the prisoners into the street—I saw Woodcock—I caught hold of him, and would not let him go—he was taken to the cage—as we were going along one White, who was committed from Uxbridge, came and ill-used me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Uxbridge. The prosecutor came to my house that Saturday night, but I was ill in bed.

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Mr. Brown gave you the leather to make up, and he never had the shoes in his possession at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that the shoes were the property of Wilkinson, and not of Brown, inasmuch as there never was a possession in Brown, either absolute, or legal; but the Court held that Brown had a legal possession of the property.</p>

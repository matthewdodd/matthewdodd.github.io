            . On the 4th of April I saw the prisoners in custody of a person in George-yard, which belongs to me and my partner - I gave charge of them; I saw some coach-springs laying about the ground, and some cushions, and varnish in various places on the premises in different parts to where they had been in our warehouse - the hasp of the warehouse lock was broken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long before had you been in your warehouse in George-yard? A. We do not often go there - I cannot say that I had been there for several weeks, but if it had been in that state, I should have heard of it.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ; I live at No. 20, Oxford-street, Whitechapel. On the 4th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I went to the warehouse; I put the key into the lock, and it turned round - I felt some obstruction against it - I pushed it away, and got in; while I was getting some timber, which I wanted, I heard some footsteps - I looked up, and saw a man going towards the gate; I called out; "Who are you? and what do you want?" he went out - I went into the yard, and on returning to the premises again, I saw the two prisoners; I called for assistance, and they were taken; there is only one gate to the premises, which is the one I went in at; some of these articles were taken from below, and some were up stairs; the lock of the gate was not broken, but the staple was broken off; I saw eleven springs on the ground, which had been taken from carriages; I had seen them on the Monday before, and this was on the Thursday; we found thirty-two or thirty-three cushions in different parts, and the linings of four of the carriages appeared to have been cut; I saw a quantity of japan in an iron pot, which had been put there from a stone bottle and a carboy - this screw-wrench was found in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How must they have got in? A. I did not see them get in, but they must have got over a wall, or the gate, twelve or fourteen feet high; the prisoners were taken on the spot - two men came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Stubbs. Q. Where did you find the holdfast of the door? A. It was hanging down on one screw; I did not tell you the door had been forced, and show you the holdfast on the post.</p>
               <p>MR. STUBBS. I saw the cushions and springs; they were mine and my partner's.</p>

            . I live in this house with the prisoner, in Dock-street. On the 10th of September she brought the prosecutor home - he appeared sober; at half-past three o'clock the next day the prisoner told me she had been shopping, and had bought a pair of shoes for 5s., a pair of shoes for a child, and a black bonnet - she then said she meant to go down to her grandmother, and leave her her money to take care of till Saturday, when she meant to go to Chatham; I did not see what money she had; but she said the shoes cost 5s., and the child's boots 5s. - I do not know what the bonnet cost; the prosecutor afterwards came into my room, and the prisoner turned her back to him; he then went away, and she said, "He don't know me again," and burst out laughing - I said, "I don't suppose he does know you?" we were having tea together at the time - as soon as he was gone, the prisoner and another girl got up and ran away; they sent me word in an hour that they were going to a raffle, and could not come back to tea.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not tell you I did not know the man; I said I got the bonnet from Queen-street, but I did not know the woman's name - I never told Williams I had any money; I bought these things, but I pawned a handkerchief and a gown to do it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had counted all his money, and seen it safe before she left him. <rs id="t18290910-261-verdict1435" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am just thirteen years old, and live with my aunt, in Bartholomew-square. Between eight and nine o'clock on Monday evening, the 15th of January, I was in Old-street, St. Luke's, and saw the three prisoners together—they followed a truck from Whitecross-street to the iron bedsteads—it was loaded with two boxes at the bottom and a large band-box at the top—I kept my eye on the prisoners—I had an opportu<lb></lb>nity of seeing them—a man was drawing the truck—the parcels were tied—the prisoners were dodging about in the road—at last Perrens cut the hand-box from the truck—the other two were dodging round the iron bed<lb></lb>steads, to watch close to the truck—when he had cut the box off they all four ran away together—there were four men—Perrens and Goddard carried the box—they both had hold of it at the same time—I told the man who</p>

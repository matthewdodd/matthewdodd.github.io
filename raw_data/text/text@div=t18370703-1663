                  </hi>. I am a Thomas police-officer. I fell in with the pri<lb></lb>soners in Ratcliffe-highway, on the 12th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning—they were walking in company—they both had fustian coatls on, and from their bulky company—they separated all was not right—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them to Connon-street—they separated—I followed Bachellier and asked what he was loaded with—he said, "Lead"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "Form my master"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, Bethnall-green"—I knew he had come in another direc<lb></lb>tion, and I took him—I followed to where I saw Bennett go, and took him—Bachellier then smashed something which was in his pocket, which appreated to be glass—I took a cob and took them, and in going along over the bridge I saw Bachellier raising his hand, I seized it and found in it these skeleton keys—I went to the office, and found in Bachelliers' pocket 19lbs. weight of lead, and this glass smashed in his other pocket, two keys, this knife, and these phosphorus matches; and on Bannett 24lbs. weight of pipe lead—I askeed what they had to say—they gave no answer—I then found a house had been entered and plundered in Ratcliffe-street—I went there, and found the front shsh had been taken into the back parlour the glass taken and frame broken up, and some square taken out in the back parlour and some up staris—among the glass which I found in Bachellier's pocket. I found some pieces that</p>

               <p>corresponded with the frame—I could only only march one piece of pipe, as the whole of the eds were so broken up that they could not be matched—there had been some of the pipe whitewashed, and some in the cellar had not been washed—here is a piece of glass that I found on Bachellier, and this is a frame I found in the house—ther is another piece that fits it exactly—I have no doubt they are part of the same—about thirty-five feet of pipe had been taken—I found fifteen feet on the prisoners.</p>

In went to the house in Ratcliffe-street, as Mr. Ellis was trying was trying the skeleton keys—I saw aleleton his open the door with one of them, and I saw him open this bundale of glass, and take out a piece—he took uo a piece of the frarse from the floor and the glass and putty on it corresponded with what laid on the floor—I have niot the least doubt that it was part of them—I took one piece of lead and tried it in different paprts—one piece corresponded in the angel of the wall of the kitchen, both iwth the whitewash and the part the was not whitewashed—it left no doubt on my mind tha tit came form that place.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 16th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was employed to watch Messrs. Taylor's premises, in Cross-street, Finsbury; I saw the prisoner come from the house - I followed him above three hundred yards, into Sun-street, which is in the City - Herdsfield stopped him; I felt outside his pocket, and asked what he had got there - he said, potatoes; I said I must see what it was - he then said it was a little opium, which a friend had given him. I took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were directed to watch? A. Yes.</p>

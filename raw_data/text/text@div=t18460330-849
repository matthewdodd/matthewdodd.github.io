                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Wilbraham, and live in Ann-street, Globe-fields—he is in the service of the East India Company—on Tuesday morning, the 31st of March, I was on my return from the Pavilion Theatre, walking arm in arm with Mrs. Williams, and on getting into White-chapel-road the prisoner Sykes came in front of me, parted me from Mrs. Williams, and pushed me against the house—I said to her, "Woman, what do you mean by this?"—she struck me, and I believe I struck her again, but I am not certain—I held my arm up—Turner came up and commenced beat<lb></lb>ing me about my head—I instantly caught Sykes' arm and held it tight—she bit me on the back of my hand—I believe her object was to bite my ring off my finger—a man then came up and held my arm very tight, which made me relax my hold of Sykes—I called "Murder!" and "Police!" I saw Turner take my veil from my bonnet—it was a black lace veil—the officer came up on my calling "Murder!" and "Police!"—and I gave Sykes into custody—Turner walked by the side of Sykes a little while and then left—I did not give her into custody, my hand was smarting so—Turner broke the comb in my head with striking me—they both beat me about, Sykes with two hands and Turner with one hand—the witness Impey was of our party, and she tried to save my veil and received a blow in the face from Turner—we had been in a public-house just before this occurred—I saw both of the prisoners there, and two men—one of them was the man that held me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Sykes. Q.</hi> Did you seize my hand and bite it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not scratch it, or put it in my month—nor did I tear your bonnet off your head and lay it down on the stones—there was no opportunity of putting it on the stones, there were too many people there—I might have torn your bonnet in defend<lb></lb>ing myself—I struck you I believe, in self defence—my male friend did not strike you—Mr. Impey, Mrs. Williams's brother, was with me, and a little boy twelve years old, who stood at the edge of the pavement crying all the time—there were five of us—the man was persuading me to let you go or you would kill me—I said, "Never till the officer comes, and I will give her in charge"—the man made his escape—he stuck his elbow in my side, and grasped my arm, which made me relax my hold—a sailor came to the sta<lb></lb>tion, but that was not the man who held my arm—he looked a very honest hard-working sailor—I had never seen him till he came to the station—the man was quite a different looking man—I should know him again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Turner. Q.</hi> Did not you strike Sykes' bonnet off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say I did not—Mr. Impey said you had beaten me as much as Sykes, and when you came to the station-house to look for your friend I gave you in charge.</p>

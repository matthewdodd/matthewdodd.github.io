                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Eliza Lewis, and lived in Vigo-street. We were milliners—Barnes lived servant to us for about five months, and left on the 9th of March—she had gone out that morning with a young lady to school, and returned about three o'clock in the afternoon—she had previously given warning to leave us—in conse<lb></lb>quence of her staying longer than we thought proper, Miss Lewis suggested, in my presence, that she should quit at once—before she was to leave, we proposed that she should allow us to look into her boxes—I and Miss Lewis went up-stairs with her, to her bed-room—we looked into her box, and found a ring of Miss Lewis's, a bag of work, and a small box of beads, belonging to me, which was in my work-box, on the 7th of Februry, when the robbery took place—my work-box was locked—the box itself has been taken, and not found—I lost a silk hat on the 7th of February, and a £5 note, belonging to both of us, which was in Miss Lewis's work-box—six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and ten shillings in silver—they were all in her work-box—there was a card-case in Miss Lewis's box, with the money—her box and all were taken—there was nothing more in her box—I have since seen that card-case at the pawnbroker's—the bag and box of beads were in my box, and the clothes—the hat was our joint property—we found two pieces of satin in the prisoner's box, which had formed part of the hat—I knew it from the shape, and the blonde and ribbon, which were with it in her box—I asked the prisoner what she had done with the clothes—she said the card-case was pledged at Fleming's, in Brewer-street, and I found it there afterwards—we got an officer and took her into custody—when she came to us, she appeared to have very little money—she appeared poor—she was very badly off for clothes, and ap<lb></lb>peared better dressed afterwards, in consequence of having got new clothes—I have seen the male prisoner about the house, speaking to Barnes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Elizabeth Schofield at the time—I went up with her to examine the prisoner's box—I found a ring, a small bag of work, several pieces of ribbon and silk, and some blonde—these pieces of satin I know, for I had several things made of the same satin; it formed part of a hat which was lost—we had a piece of blonde of the same pattern as this; it had been on the hat—we lost no blond but what was on the hat—it matched with some we have still in our pos<lb></lb>session—I know the ribbon; there is about a yard and a half of it—it is all the ribbon which had been on the hat—this card-case is mine; it was in the work-box in which the money was—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, six sove<lb></lb>reigns, two half-sovereigns, and eight or ten shillings in the work-box, which was locked, and kept in the front room on the ground floor—I occupy the whole house—it is in the parish of St. James—we jointly paid the rent and taxes—when I found the things in the prisoner's box, I asked her how she came to have those things there—she said she could not tell at first—I said she was a dreadful girl to remain in the house with us so long, robbing us in that way—she cried very much, and said she was led away to do it; she did not do it on her own account—I said I could not let such a thing pass by, I must put her into custody—I sent for an officer—I have never seen the money or work-box since.</p>

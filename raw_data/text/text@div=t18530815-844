                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 71). On Saturday night, 2nd July, I received information, and went to Mr. Capp's warehouse in Moor-lane, about 20 minutes past 11 o'clock—I heard something inside like persons moving—I sent for assistance, and two officers came—I placed one of them in front, and the other at the back of the premises—I went to the lower door which is down the steps in a sort of area—the door was nailed and fastened inside, shored up with a piece of wood—I partly forced the door open, and heard the sound of persons going up the first flight of stairs—I examined the lower room, and then went up stairs to the first floor; I saw the two prisoners go up the next flight of stairs, from the first to the second floor—I looked about the first floor, and then went up to the second floor—when I got there I saw the prisoners, one of them threw up the window, and they both went out—I afterwards examined the door in the area—I found it had been forced open—it had been nailed, and the nails were broken down—there was in the warehouse a quantity of lead pipe fitted to the gas, and to the water cock—it appeared to me as if a piece had been broken off the water pipe—I produce this piece of lead pipe which I had given to me by Mr. Ewar on the Monday—I did not find it—I examined the place again on the Tuesday, and found this piece corresponded with the part that had been broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fancy box maker, I live in Ebenezer-place. I received orders to look to Mr. Capp's warehouse—on Saturday evening, 2nd July, I heard something—I went to the premises, and saw two men in the lower shop which is below the ground—the first steps lead from there to the ground floor, and then there are steps-leading to the first floor—I saw the persons in the lower floor—I do not re-cognise them—I went for the key—when I came back the policeman was there—I tried to unlock the door, but was not able to do so—I got in by forcing the bottom of the door—the police<lb></lb>man went in with me—I had one dog who followed me in—I cannot say whether I saw any other dog there—I went upstairs with the policeman—I saw one person getting out of the window; I do not know who it was—one had got out—after the prisoners were taken and locked up, the inspector and I looked over the premises—we saw the pipe had been broken off, but could not find the piece—on the Monday morning I went there with Mr. Richards, and we stopped up the water pipe, because the water was running away—he pointed out this pipe, and I picked it up—it was a little way from under the stain—I had fastened up the premises on the Saturday, at dinner time; and after the prisoners were gone I just put the door up as well as I could—I had not seen this piece of lead on the Saturday night—we might have overlooked it in the dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Mr. Thomas Capps, of No. 21, Leadenhall-street. On Saturday, 2nd July, I went into his premises in Moor-lane, between 10 and 2 o'clock; I stayed there about three quarters of an hour—I asked Mr. Ewar to nail the doors, and he said he placed a piece of wood inside, and nailed them up—I was outside, and he was inside—I heard some one nailing the doors—that fastened them—he went out at a private door in connection with his own house—on the Monday following, I went there as usual to collect the rents, between 10 and 12 o'clock—I heard some water running in the lower part of the premises—I told Mr. Ewar—I then went into the premises, and found that the pipe had been broken—I found this piece of pipe just by the staircase, from two to three yards from the place where it had been broken off—it corresponded with the place where it had been cut—it was in a position where it might have been dropped by a person going up stairs—there were gas fittings and pipe there which had not been disturbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> And there were bricks and rubbish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice any; there was some dirt—the premises had been broken open, but the doors and windows were closed—no one was on the premises—there was no breaking on these doors, but on a door going to Mr. Ewar's premises there was the appearance as if a person had forced a way from the warehouse to Mr. Ewar's—that was not the door which had been broken—the socket that held the bolt had been forced away—the running water first took my attention.</p>

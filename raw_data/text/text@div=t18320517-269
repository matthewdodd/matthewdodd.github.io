            . I live in Field-lane, at the bottom of Holborn-bridge. The prisoner bought a hat of me last Monday week; I could point it out from a hundred - this is the hat; it is a very singular one - it is a silk hat, and narrow in the crown; the shape of a man's head has brought it to its present from - we generally have a mark in them, but when we sell them we take it out; I know this hat, by the white trimming; I am positive it is the one I sold the prisoner - it is a fashionable hat; it was quite flat when I sold it, such as a coachman or a cab-driver would swear, from the heat of the body, but a beaver hat would not - I bought it of a lad who was apprentice to a man who was a bankrupt, at the corner of Plumtree-court- he made it for himself five or six weeks ago; I sold it to the prisoner for a crown - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>JAMES HILDRED. I live in Field-lane, next door to Mr. Barnett. I saw him sell the prisoner a hat between eleven and twelve o'clock last Monday week - I did not know the prisoner, but I happened to be present; it was sold in the lane - I believe this is the hat.</p>

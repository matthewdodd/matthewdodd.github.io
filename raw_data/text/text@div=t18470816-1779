                  </hi> I am a native of Scotland, and reside about a mile and a half from Glasgow—in June last I was in London—on Monday morning, the 21st of June, I had been to the Dundee wharf—I was returning about half-past ten o'clock—I had a gold watch, with a gold chain and seal, and key attached to it, and a purse containing five sovereigns, and a half sovereign—I came along the Minories on my way back from the wharf, I met with a per<lb></lb>son, and went with him into a public-house—we got a tankard of malt liquor—in about two minutes the prisoner came in alone, and a fourth man came in in six or seven minutes—I have no doubt that the prisoner is the man who first came in—he said that his father was killed by a kick of a horse, and that an old female servant had said that his brother was a natural child, and he had had a lawsuit with his brother, and got his father's money—he pulled out a great bundle of what looked like notes, and said he would give the other man 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other man said, "I will give you a purse to put it in," and gave it him, and the prisoner gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the other man said, "Put it into my purse carefully," which the prisoner did—the other man said, "Will you give this other gentleman 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, by all means," and said, "Give me your purse and watch"—I do not know what came to me, but I gave the first man my purse and watch—the prisoner gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to put into the purse—he put the watch and note into the purse, as I believed, and he put it about me—they then went away, and I found in my pocket instead of the purse and watch a tin box in this bag—I told a friend of the robbery; he gave information, and I gave a description of the prisoner—I saw him the next night, about eleven o'clock—his cheeks were redder, and he had not the same dress on, but in spite of that I knew him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a porter in the Minories. On the morning of the 21st of June, I saw Smith come up the Minories, just on this side the archway, to the Alton ale-room, No. 64—I observed a short man stop him—I was sitting inside the door—Smith pointed with his finger to the archway, and asked what it was—the man said he did not know, he was a stranger—they came in, and went into the back parlour, I followed them in, and asked what they wanted—Mr. Gilbert was out, and I was officiating for him—I saw a third man go in directly after them.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Gilbert, who keeps the Alton ale-rooms, at No. 64, Minories. On Monday, the 21st of June, Suttle was helping me—I saw him take a pint of porter in to some persons in the tap-room—I had seen Smith come in with a short man—they were shown into the back parlour, and had some refreshment—I went into the room while they staid—I saw a man there who I have no doubt was the prisoner—he had come in about two minutes after Smith and the short man had come, and he went into the same room—they staid about a quarter of an hour—my little girl went into the room while they were there, with a pint of half-and-half—there were four persons at least in the room—I have no doubt the prisoner was one, and Smith was another.</p>

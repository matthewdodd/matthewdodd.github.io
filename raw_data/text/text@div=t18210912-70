The time-piece was on the mantle-piece in the parlour - I saw it safe at nine o'clock on the morning of the 24th of July, and when I returned at half-past three o'clock, it was gone. I found it in pawn on the 4th of August. I saw the prisoner in Charles-street, near the Middlesex Hospital, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th of July, with a time-piece in his hand, but did not at that time know it to be mine; he held it with the dial downwards, and I could not examine it. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wise, a pawnbroker, the prisoner offered the time-piece in pawn about the 24th of July. I am sure he is the man. We sent for Lack, who took him; he was examined before the Magistrate, and discharged; he came three times after it - he was apprehended in our shop; he said he had had it three years. We advertised it, and it was claimed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not wait in the shop while you sent for the officer - A. Yes; but he did not know we had sent for one.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for and took charge of him; he said it was his own, he was discharged, and ordered to attend on the Saturday following, which he did, and applied for an order to have it restored, and had a summons for the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have had it some time, my wife and I had some disturbance, I went to Wise's to pawn it, he detained it. I said I would not go till I got it. I was taken to Bow-street, and brought three people to prove it was mine, and the Magistrate discharged me.

               <p>Q. Did you take notice of her so as to know her again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner in which you first observed her? - A. The next shop to Mr. Powdich's is a print shop; she went and looked into Mr. Powdich's shop-window, to see whether the young men were engaged, and seeing they were engaged, she took one of the pieces of print that were on the horse at the door, and put it under her cloak, and went round the corner of Middle-row with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About twelve o'clock; I went immediately down stairs into the shop, and told my brother; he immediately went after her; she was brought back almost immediately; my brother brought her back in about three minutes to Mr. Powdich's shop; I went over, and saw my brother open her cloak, and then she gave him the print.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what was said? - A. She said, provided they did not punish her, she was willing to make any recompense.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same woman you saw taking the print? - A. Yes, there was no other person near Mr. Powdich's door; there were people looking at the print-shop next door, but not near Mr. Powdich's door that she looked in.</p>

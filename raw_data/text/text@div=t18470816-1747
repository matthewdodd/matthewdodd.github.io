                  </hi> I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and live in Albion-villas, Hornsey. On the 15th of July, about twenty minutes past nine at night, I was going over London Bridge, arm-in-arm with a friend—a women touched our arms, and asked if we had been robbed—I put my hand into my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner and another lad crossing the road—I crossed and took the other lad, I did not find my handkerchief on him—I then took the prisoner, and asked him if he had got anything belonging to me—he said, "No"—I said, "I think you have; at all events, I will see"—I took him by the collar, opened his coat, and found my handkerchief tucked under his arm—this produced is it.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Blue Anchor, in Upper East-smithfield, facing these buildings: This girl came in at two o'clock precisely, and called for a bottle of wine, half a pint of gin, and a pot of porter, and change for a 10l. note, for which I gave her regular change; she went away, and in less than half an hour returned with 9l. 2s. and put it into my care till the morning. About five or ten minutes past four, she returned again rather in liquor, and asked me what she had deposited in my hands for care; I told her, 9l. 2s. In going away again, crossing the street towards home, the prosecutor met her, and brought her back to my house, and there accused her of the robbery, which she denied.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house is it? - A. A Mr. Hearne's, who lets it out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew her before? - A. Since I took the house, which was only on the 10th of August. They drank together for, I dare say, upwards of an hour, to the amount of two shillings and two-pence halfpenny; the altercation between them was not much, any further than he accused her; they went out of my house together, and about six they returned in custody of the officer. (Produces the note.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Croney.) Is that the note that you had? - A. Yes, it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you heard her say that? - A. Yes; and then they went out, I followed them out, the prosecutor said, you know there is a 10l. note and two guineas and a half you have got of mine, and I will have it; I did not hear her make any answer; and they went across the way towards her home directly.</p>

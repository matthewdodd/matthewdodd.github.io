             I have suspicion of a man that came in here a little after five o'clock; the prisoner was in the house asleep; upon this information I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200045"></xptr>and fetched two watchmen, and then I awaked him, he was in the box and the things were aside him, he was sitting in the box with his head down fast asleep; when I awaked him I asked him where he had come from with that bundle; he said, from the Bell Savage inn, in the city, and he asked me what business I had with it, it was his own property; I asked him if he had any direction on it; he said, O yes; so I took it up and looked, and there was none; so I asked him where he was going to carry it to, and he said, home; I asked him where his home was; he said, that was no business of mine; so then I gave charge to the two watchmen to take him to the watch-house, nnd I carried the bundle; when we got to the watch-house I said, my friend if you will tell me what there is in the bundle you shall be set at liberty, before it is opened; he said, he would; not with that I detained him and the bundle; when we went before the justice we looked at these boots, and there was this sergeant's name on them in writing, Sporforth; and seargeant Sporforth on the breeches; with that the justice said, I must enquire among the soldiers to see if any body would own them; I did enquire; I went to the life guards and they told me there was no such man in the regiment; my son the next morning went away to Kensington, and there was no such man there. About eleven o'clock I went to the watch-house and the watch-house keeper asked me if I had an owner for the breeches; I had not; says he, bring them to me, and he said, he knew the man, he had billeted him; I went down to Westminster, and I saw one of the regiment and he told me, if I went to the Haymarket some of them were quartered there; but Sporforth was gone to Basingstoke; I went into the Hay-market were this regiment were quartered, and I found he was gone to Basingstoke; I went to the George, I believe the sign is, and I desired the man to send a letter to Basingstoke to him, so he did, and she came up again on Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was out waiting at the London coffee-house at dinner, and I was locked out of my lodging; coming home I was enquiring for a night house and I met with a man coming up the Haymarket, says the man, if you will go along with me I will take you to my lodgings; I met him at the White Bear, Piccadilly, and he had got this bundle in his hand; says he, if you will go along with me I will treat you with part of a pot of beer; we went into this house and he went away out with a pretence to call a coach, and he left me there, and I was there in the house in the box with the bundle; I did not know what the contents was, nor did I know any thing of the man; with that I set there till this watchman came in, and he asked who that bundle belonged to; I said, I don't know, it was not my property, it was the man's that came in with me; I know nothing of the man nor never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sporforth. That is the man that desired me to go into the house; he was some time persuading me to go in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was never near the door at all, nor near the house.</p>

               <p>Was your sister a virtuous girl as you believe, when she came to town? - I believe she was.</p>
               <p>How came she to be seduced? - I do not know, she sent for me, I went the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260100"></xptr> morning, and going down to Hatton Garden I met my sister crying, says I, what is the matter with you, says she, I durst not tell you, says I, for what reason, says she, I have lost all my clothes, I am robbed and durst not tell you how, a young man got my clothes and promised to marry me, and this morning he sent me with a false note; when I was at Hicks's-Hall, the young man confessed he sold the clothes for 4 s.</p>
               <p>Were any promises made to him? - No.</p>

               <p>I am quite a stranger to that woman, I came home about six weeks ago, and I got acquainted with this young woman, she asked me to take her away from her lodgings, we were together two or three days, she had been connected with twenty different people before ever I knew her, when our money was gone she gave me these things to sell, I belonged to the Punch schooner, I met her in the street, and after I sold the things I gave her two and threepence of the money, I came to an acquaintance in Pelican-court, they said to me you have robbed the girl, I went immediately to the house, and the man knocked me down and used me very ill, I said I would go before the Justice, the Justice said if I would let him know where the things were sold he would let me go, I told him where they were; it was in the street that I met her, and I parted with her there; she lived on my money while it lasted, I never saw the sister.</p>

            . Your sister lived at an eating-house? - Yes; I never heard any thing to the prejudice of her character before now; my husband is a shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him when he confessed? - I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix's master told me she was a common woman.</p>
               <p>Jury to Griffiths. Did he give you any of that money he sold the things for? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the woman of the house where you lived know that he had taken your things? - No, Sir, she did not tell me so.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be very glad to know from the girl's master what her character was; though she has been very frail and weak, yet I should think it a very bad seduction; I wish the master of the girl may be asked, for her character will alter my idea of the affair with respect to the punishment.</p>
               <p>(The master called.)</p>
               <p>Court. How long has the prosecutrix lived with you? - Near three months, and she lived with me before four or five or six months; then she went to her friends; she was remarkably honest, she is a thoughtless, simple girl, but I never saw the least want of propriety in her behaviour. I told the prisoner he would make her a common woman, I never told him she was so: if I was not provided I would take her again.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish you would recommend her to a place.</p>

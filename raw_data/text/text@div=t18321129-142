I knew who was meant by it - I went and took Hearn; he denied having the money - in going to the station Reeves said, "We may as well tell the truth; after he went to sleep we took his coat and boots off" - Goodrich said, "One is as bad as the other; after we took them off Honest Bill came up the court, and we searched the prosecutor again in the dark - Bill accompained us a short distance, when he took the coat, pocket-book and papers from us, and asked for some money to drink" - that Goodrich opened her hand to give him some, and he snatched the money away.</p>

I said Yes - he said he knew all about it; we went to a public-house, and drank two or three pints of porter - he then said if he was prepared with means he could produce the papers at nine o'clock in the morning; I said, "What means?" he said about 12s. - I went out, and told the Policemen to meet me in disguise; I then went and told Hutton to meet me at the Black Jack at seven o'clock - I went there, and he then said he would go to a person who had the papers; I advanced him 10s., and he was to bring them at nine o'clock in the morning - I went, but he was not there; a young woman said, "Are you the person who is waiting for William?" I said Yes; she said, "Come with me, and I will put you into the place where he is:" she took me to a room, where I found him in bed - he said he could not succeed, for a person had offered a sovereign for them; I told him not to let any person have them, and to meet me at the Black Jack at four o'clock; I went there with the officers - Hutton came and sat down by me, and said he had not succeeded; I began to think he knew nothing about it, but he said, to convince me that he did, there was the duplicate of the coat - he put it into my hand, and the officer seized him.</p>
               <p>Hutton. Q. Were you not in the habit of coming to the room I live in? A. I do not know where you live - I never saw you at the room but once; there was an old lady, who told me she would do all in her power to get the papers; I might have given her liquor - I did not say I had a 5l. note that was got queer; I said I had a 5l. note but no silver - I had a man with me, to see how you acted- I did not borrow money of that man; I had the 10s. from the prosecutor; I said I had been to the house two or three times myself, and was afraid to go again, but if you could get the papers - I would reward you for your trouble - I certainly believed there were persons in the house who knew of the robbery; when I returned the duplicate you were taken immediately - I did not see any persons pulling you about.</p>
               <p>Hutton's Defence. I found the duplicate in the house - I know nothing of the robbery, but this man pretended to be a friend, and like a wolf in sheep's clothing, he jumped out at me.</p>

            . Q. Had you a note of that description? A. Yes, I drew it in Cornwall, on Mr. Samuel Lyle.</p>
               <p>Reeves' Defence. The old lady's son had the pocketbook where Retallick went and gave the liquor; he had the coat and a brooch, which has not yet been mentioned; he sent the coat to pawn, and he said it was pawned for 1s. 6d., and I must do the best I could for the money - I went for the boots, and they said Douglass had them.</p>
               <p>Goodrich's Defence. The prosecutor met me, and asked if he could go home with me; I said Yes, and we went home - Reeves was in bed; I asked her to get up - he asked for no other place; he sent for some liquor, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290074"></xptr>I fetched - he went to sleep, and I went to meet Reeves; on my return - I heard there was an alarm - I said I was guilty of taking the things, but I would not make my escape; I went out, and met Honest Bill - he took me to a place, and searched the coat; then he went back, and searched the man; I then met Condy, and told him all that was passed - he said it was very wrong; I gave him the coat to mind till the next morning, and then he said what money could be made of it I should have; we then went to Douglass', and left the boots - we then met Honest Bill again; I was going to give him something to drink, and he snatched the whole of the money from my hand, and ran away.</p>

               <p>Hearn's Defence. The young man who had the coat and boots used to live with this girl - I know nothing of it, but having the piece of paper, I cannot read, and I tore it up.</p>

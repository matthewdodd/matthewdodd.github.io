            . I am a headborough. I was passing the prosecutor's shop on the 28th of August, and saw Baker and Langdale come out of the shop; I went in to ascertain if they had lost any thing; I then went to the station-house, and got assistance - we went out, and saw Baker and Langdale together, and Mendos a considerable distance from them; we followed them on to Clapton-pond - Mendos there left them, and ran down a turning; I followed Laugdale, and took him - I found nothing on him; he had a smock-frock on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not Mendos a considerable distance behind the other two? A. yes, in the church-yard, but he joined them again near Clapton-pond; they then walked all three abreast - I saw Mendos turn down a turning, and an officer followed him; I took Langdale - I do not know how long Mendos was in my sight.</p>

On the 28th of August I saw Langdale and Baker in his shop, about a quarter before eleven o'clock; Baker paid for a silk handkerchief, but both bargained for it - they were close to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160047"></xptr>gether, and were there about five minutes; they looked at some other handkerchiefs - I did not miss any, but at half-past one o'clock the officer came in, and brought these handkerchiefs, which I had seen in our shop; they have our mark on them, and I missed articles of this description.</p>

            . I saw Mendos turn down a turning, and throw these handkerchiefs over into a yard; I knocked at the door, and asked the person to give it to me; I thought it was but one, but it was this parcel of handkerchiefs - I saw the person pick it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is that person here? A. No; I saw Baker and Langdale - they did not turn the corner with Mendos; I had seen Baker pass that turning, whether Langdale had or not I do not know - I should think Sexton lives a mile and a half or two miles from where I took Mendos.</p>
               <p>Langdale' Defence. I went with Baker, but did not know he had any thing; I missed Baker, but saw him again at the other end of the church-yard - I then went and asked Mendos the way to Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Baker's Defence. I went and bought a handkerchief; how Mendos came in possession of these I cannot say - I never saw him before.</p>

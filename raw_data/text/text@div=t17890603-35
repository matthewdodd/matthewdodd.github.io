               <p>JOHN SEGOE sworn.</p>
               <p>Between two and three in the afternoon, on Tuesday the 19th of May, I was in my own shop, in High-street, St. Giles's, and I saw the prosecutor pass my shop; I saw the prisoner and two others following him, and I suspected they had a design to rob him, and I went after them; the prisoner was close to the gentlemen; I ran in between him and the other man; he had picked his pocket, I cannot absolutely say I saw him take it; but he was the next person to the prosecutor; I pushed in and he threw down the handkerchief; I told the gentleman, and he said he had lost his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was marked at the time when I lost it, and it was marked at the office with a pen and ink.</p>
               <p>Was it the same handkerchief that was produced to you by the witness Segoe, which was marked at the office? - Here is the office mark upon it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was this Mr. Fenton's warehouse? A. Yes; there were men at work there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went there to inquire for work - I picked the coat up, and threw it on a large package. Witness. He did not; nobody was about the place - I was down in the cellar - I saw him take it off the crate, and he was putting it on his back when I detected him; he was putting one arm into the sleeve - he asked me to let him go.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARGERY. I live at No. 27, Bond-street, Borough-road. This is my coat - I did not send the prisoner for it- I was in Mr. Fenton's employ, as a <rs id="t18340410-57-viclabel332" type="occupation">painter</rs>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to M. DEVINE. You were down in the cellar, and the coat was a long way behind, and as I came out, as I could not see the foreman to ask him for a job, I saw the coat, took it up, and put it on the crate? Witness. I saw him go to the crate - I am not mistaken about his being about to put it on - he had one of his arms at the sleeve of the coat - I asked what he was going to do with it - he said the man belonging to the coat had sent him for it - I asked where he was - he said, "At the public-house drinking a pint of beer" - I went next door, where there were two plumbers at work - they fetched the prosecutor, who identified it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask me if I worked there? A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PHILLIPS. Devine said, he asked the man if he worked there; and he said, not - that was when he came for me, but not when he was stopped with the coat.</p>
               <p>M. DEVINE. I did not ask if he worked there, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PHILLIPS re-examined. He came to my house, and said I must come to the station-house, to take a man into custody - he asked the prisoner if he worked on the premises, and Devine said, "No" - Devine asked the man if he worked on the premises - I was not present - I am sober - he told me he had asked if he worked there.</p>

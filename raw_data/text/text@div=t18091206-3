I believe it was Sunday night, three weeks back, I was on board Mr. Nockell's ship, the Monmouth, Cornelius came down for a light, I was a bed, I knew him, he belonged to the Hibernia, I told him if he would feel upon the top of the chest, he would find a tinder box, he struck a light himself, he went upon deck and fetched Gray down. Gray asked my fellow apprentice for the key, he told him he had not got it, then they asked me for the key of the hold, I told them I had not got it, my fellow apprentice had got them. He made Sealey go and get them, he told him to unlock the door, he did; they went down in the hold and sent me upon deck to watch for fear our mate should come. I saw them come up with a bucket of rum, they went on board their own ship, they came down and got another bucket, and told me to come with them on board their ship, they gave me four bottles, two for Sealey and two for me. I took them on board, they told me I had no occasion to be afraid, they allowed three inches leakage in a cask, and we had a nice place below to keep it. On Monday morning, when the mate came on board, I told him that Gray and Cornelius were taking the rum on shore. The officers stopped it.</p>

I went to the ship Monmouth on the next morning, and from the information of Sealey, I gauged the cask of rum, the full contents of the cask would be 119 gallons, the ullage 115, there were four gallons deficient, the quantity taken was two gallons, there were two more deficient then was found on the prisoner: I

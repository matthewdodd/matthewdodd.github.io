                  </hi>. I live in Upper Baker-street, in the parish of Marylebone. The prisoner bad been in my service upwards of two years—she left in February, 1833, but was not out of my employ till No<lb></lb>vember, 1834—she married—my servant left, and she came to me again to assist on the 29th of January; and on Saturday, the 31st, I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which I had seen safe about three o'clock that afternoon—I have since lost my wife—I missed the prisoner on Saturday evening soon after five o'clock—I had left my house about three o'clock, and did not return till after seven o'clock—the property was then missing, and the prisoner was gone also.</p>

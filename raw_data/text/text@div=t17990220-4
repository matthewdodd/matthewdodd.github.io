               <p>Q. Did you see any person with a chest of tea that way? - A. No, I returned, and Samuel Mercer pointed out to me the chest of tea being put into a coach the other side of the way; I went over along with him, and the coach door was then shut; the prisoner at the bar was then standing by the coach door, I did not see any other man with him; he was going off, and I ran after him and caught him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you at that time observe the chest of tea? - A. No, I did not then, I caught him in about ten yards, and brought him back to the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you then open the coach door? - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay by the coach the whole time after you had caught him, till you saw the chest of tea? - A. No, I did not; I afterwards saw the chest in the coach, (the chest of tea produced); it is directed, S. Godfrey, Gedney; it was to go by the Lincoln waggon; it is the same chest that I had left in my cart; the prisoner said, what do you lay hold of me for; I told him he was the man that had got my chest of tea; he said, no, he only assisted in helping it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What were you doing between the time that you had caught the prisoner, and the time you saw the chest of tea? - A. I was holding him till the constable came, and then I put him into the coach with the constable and the tea, and they went away in the coach together; I went after my horse and cart.</p>

             ran to the corner of Sun-street, and there he got a coach, that was about one hundred yards off, or it might be not quite so much; the other man stood under Half-moon-alley with the chest of tea till Davis brought the coach; he stood before it because people should not see it; when the coach came, the prisoner put it into the coach, and the other assisted him; then they shut the door, and the coach was just going to drive off; I saw the witness Churchyard running, and I directed him to the coach; I spoke rather too loud, and the other man made off, but I directly said, take hold of him, for I am sure he was one of them, and I immediately, laid my hand upon the prisoner; the carman held him while I fetched a constable; I am sure the prisoner is the same man.</p>

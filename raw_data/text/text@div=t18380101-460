                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and carry on busi<lb></lb>ness in Blackman-street, Newington-causeway. Two or three days pre<lb></lb>vious to the 1st of December, a person of the name of Parnell or Morton, presented himself to me as shopman, and I directed a letter to a person of the name of Hadwen, at Seven Oaks—I have not seen it since—I received an answer, and took Morton into my employ as shopman—I missed a vast quantity of property about the 16th—I have since seen a portion of these goods-we missed on the 16th one shawl and a piece of linen—they were all gone by the 16th—I had some conversation with Morton about the loss,—he accompanied me to No. 9, York-street, Westminster, very late at night—I found the prisoner there—I had not seen him before—when we arrived there Morton asked the prisoner where Mr. White's goods were—he denied all knowledge of it—Morton said he had told all, and the prisoner went up stairs and brought down four duplicates—they refer to property, part of which has been restored to me, and Nixon said he would send me other portions of the property—I afterwards received a packet containing other portions of the property, which is here, to the value of about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount missed was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again to Nixon to try to get more property back—he promised, but did not perform—I had held out no promises of pardon whatever to Nixon.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my parents at Seven Oaks; they keep the post-office. I remember seeing the prisoner once or twice last month—he came and inquired for a letter for Mr. Hadwen, of Seven Oaks—I found one corresponding to the direction, and gave it him—I never heard of such a person as Mr. Hadwen, a linen-draper there.</p>

I applied to Mr. White to be taken into his em<lb></lb>ploy—I think it was on the last day of November—I saw Nixon after that, and it was arranged that Mr. White was to write to Seven Oaks for my character, to be addressed to Mr. Hadwen—the letter was to be fetched by Mr. Nixon, and he was to write the answer to it; and when it was written I was to endeavour to get the situation by the character—I got into Mr. White's employ before the answer came, I believe—on the 15th of December, when the rest of the men were gone to dinner, the pri<lb></lb>soner Nixon came to Mr. White's shop and brought an empty bag, and when he took it away it was full of Mr. White's property;—the whole of the property produced went on that day.</p>

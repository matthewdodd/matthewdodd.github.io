On the 10th of February I lost the poultry - the geese were in the geese-house, and the ducks in an out-house - I saw them safe about six o'clock in the evening, and missed them at six the next morning; the prisoner lived about a mile off. The same day, at a quarter past ten o'clock, I found all the poultry at Leadenhall-market, in the possession of Parnell; they were all killed - the geese were cold, the head of the gander was quite warm. They were worth 10 l.; they were kept for breeding.</p>

            . I keep a stall in Leadenhall-market On the 10th of February, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, this poultry was brought to me by a man, who desired me to sell it for him, I did not ask him how he got them as I was busy - they were killed in an awkward manner, which I did not observe at the time. He stopped about half an hour with me. I did not particularly notice him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was the prisoner taken up - A.About four or five days after. I believe he is the man, but cannot positively say. I thought the man was lustier, and of a fresh colour. I often have fowls killed in that way - it is the custom all over the market.</p>

            . I am a salesman in Leadenhall-market. On Thursday morning, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came into the market with the ducks and geese; he took them out of a bag, and laid them on Parnell's stall, which joins mine. I was present when Morris came and claimed them - I then looked at them, they appeared as if they had been stolen, for they were improperly killed - I should have suspected them if they had been brought to me. About a fortnight after I saw the prisoner in custody, and am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>* The Court commended Mr. Hammond for acting so generous and careful a part, and recommended it as an example to others; and several gentlemen expressed an intention to employ, and promote him in his business upon that account. Mr. Hammond is a glazier, and lives in Park-Street, by Grosvenor-Square.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is the child?</p>
               <p>Hammond. He was in breeches; but I do not know his age. I said, I believe that is not your child; she said, the mother of the child had lent him to her to go a begging with, as she was a poor woman out of business, and I said she should go back with me to town, and shew me the friends of the child, and if she did, I would have no more to do with her. With that I went with her, and took her into a publick-house, and would have charged a constable with her, but he would not take charge of her. I asked the child what his name was, he said his name was

The child had a coat on, but the waistcoat was under the Prisoner's petticoat, and the child's mother said it was her child's waistcoat. I saw the waistcoat in the Prisoner's lap, and it fell down to her feet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss the child?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes; and I heard my child was picked up in the Park, and was at a house in Park-Street; I went, and there was my child, and the Prisoner was there; the waistcoat was held up, and I said, that is my child's waistcoat.</p>

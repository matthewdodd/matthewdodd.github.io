               <p>Court. Did you see any body with the truss. - A. I only saw a truss, I took the truss to the watchhouse, I saw Mr. Speering have hold of the prisoner at the bar, opposite his house No. 4, Red Lion-street.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 4, Red Lion-street, Holborn, I am a cooper; on the 24th of May as I was in my shop, I noticed a cart going past, about eleven in the morning, as the cart was going along I saw a person behind it removing a package, he was on foot, reaching over into the cart, I saw him take the parcel out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a parcel was it. - A. It appeared like a roll of cloth, I went out and laid hold of the prisoner, the cloth was then in his possession, I believe it was resting on the ground with his hand upon it; when I laid hold of him he did not resist, he said he was very much in distress, his wife had lain in lately, he never did any thing of that sort before; I took him to the watchhouse, I beleive the boy took the package to the watchhouse, I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. The same man that you saw take the cloth out of the cart you gave into the hands of the constable. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified by Baker.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witness to character.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DAVIS. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor, living in Plough-yard, Carey-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 15th of March the prisoner hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and grey gelding worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me for the night—it was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> night horse—we let them out at so much per night—he paid me for it before he took it out—he brought it home the next morning—he then paid me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards the next night—he took the hone out next night, and never returned with it or the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I found the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the green-yard on the 18th, and the horse at Mr. Gedding's, the horse-slaughterer's—the horse was kept out all day, and turned into the pound for two days without any corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I hired the horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> of Mr. Davis for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a night—I paid him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and with the other 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I bought a nose-bag of him—he cannot swear I took the horse out on the 17th. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He paid me the money for the horse in the morning, and when I came home in the evening the "d and horse were gone—he never called to ask for his money or license, without which he could not get employment in the line elsewhere.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>RICHARD TAYLOR; examined by Mr. Knapp. In what situation are you. - A. I am a bricklayer, I was employed in <placeName id="t18070114-7-crimeloc44">his majesty's building of the Mint</placeName>

               <p>Q. How was you employed on this day. - A. I was pointing the lead flushing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this lead completely finished in laying it completely down. - A. It was affixed completely to the building, the holdfasts were drove in.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day the prisoner was apprehended what was the business the prisoner had to do there. - A. He was employed as a scaffold man to attend upon the masons. Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon I saw him first on the place where the lead was missing, he had no business there that I know of; then I had to go to another part of the building to do my work, and by that time I had got to that place he had got round to a place where he was cutting the lead up and beating it to pieces; I observed him half an hour before I informed Mr. Pope.</p>
               <p>Q. What lead did it appear to you to be. - 
               <persName id="t18070114-7-person187">A. </persName>
            Gutter lead flushing; it was like the lead that belonged to the same place; I went there and informed Mr. Pope of it, he gave me strict charge to watch him, and to do nothing else all the day. At the time that I got back to the place again, he was still at work<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140019"></xptr> beating of it up, he did not see me, I was above him; he continued cutting it up till he had finished it, then he broke a hole through the centers and let it down into another apartment; I watched him into the same place where it was dropped; I could not see him any more then till he came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any intermediate time given any information to 
               <persName id="t18070114-7-person188">Wood</persName>
             the porter. - A. Yes; then I watched him till he put on his coat; the bell rang, and I followed him to the gate, I saw Wood stop him, I saw the lead taken from him; it was about thirty pound weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken from him or had any dropped from him. - A. There was some dropped from him, and Wood took one or two bits from him that was hid under his waistcoat; the prisoner begged Mr. Pope's pardon when he was taken. He said it was the first offence that he had ever done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that the lead was affixed, or only placed to be affixed. - A. It was quite fast, it only wanted pointing to stop it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a place is it. - A. It is called the New Mint, it is a strong building.</p>
               <p>- WOOD; examined by Mr. Knapp. You are the porter to the gate. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop the prisoner. - A. When he came to the gate he was not willing to go, he seemed as if he wanted to turn back again; I took him into the lodge; I took one piece of lead from his person, the five pieces he dropped, they were cut into small pieces. He went down on his knees and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you in consequence of information that you received, observe afterwards where the lead was taken from. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear that there had been a quantity of lead affixed cut. - A. It had been drawn out of the wall; it was one of the gutters of the principal building, and some lead had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards did you see some lead produced. - A. Yes, it is here in small pieces of five or six pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. How did they appear to be taken off. - A. It was drawn out of the plant of the wall; it was new lead, and the pieces are new lead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I do not now ask you whether you can swear to the identity of the lead, but all the lead that was on that building was under your charge. - They are, the whole is under my charge.</p>

Mr. Wood stopped me with this lead; and immediately he charged me with it, I gave it him.</p>

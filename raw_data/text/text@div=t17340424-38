               <p>Mr. Kendrick. On the 28th of February, I lost a Pair of silver Candlesticks out of my House in <placeName id="t17340424-38-crimeloc164">George-Yard Lombard-street</placeName>

I enquired who had been there that Day, and was told, that the Prisoner had been to visit one of my Servants. I sent for her next Morning, and took her and my Servant with some others before Sir

But Sir Edward said he suspected her, and advised us to search her Lodgings, and my Servant went, and found the Candlesticks there; but the Crest was taken out as nicely as if it had been done by a Silversmith. I went to see her in the New Jail in Southwark, and she confest the Fact, and said that she took the Crest out her self with the Scissars.</p>

The Prisoner was committed to the New-Jail, where she confest to me and my Fellow-Servant, that she put the Candlesticks in her Gown, one in each side, and pin'd them up; and that she took out the Crest the same Night with her Scissars.</p>

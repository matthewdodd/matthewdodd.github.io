               <p>I am one of Sir Sampson's patrols, on the 3d of February; about half past nine at night. I stopped the prisoner near Bagnigge Wells, with this can of oil, he said, it was oil, and he brought it from a person at Islington, from the White Swan, from a lamplighter that was lame, and had fell off the ladder; he said, he was going to carry it into Drury lane; he said, he had been at work that day, but who he said he worked for, I cannot say, but I know he did not say he worked for Mr. Lewis; he said, the landlord of the Swan would have nothing to do with it, but that there was a boy in waiting at the door that he took it from: I found out the prosecutor, (The can and oil produced) the can has been in my possession ever since, except when I came backwards and forwards here.</p>

               <p>I am an evidence; on the 3d of February last, I delivered this can of oil out of the warehouse, in the evening about eight, I put it upon the green by the warehouse, for this prisoner to take it; there was the same quantity of oil in it which is now, it was whale oil; the keys of the warehouse were in the shop, and this oil was locked in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take the keys out of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this your master's oil? - Yes, I did not see the prisoner take it away, but he told me to leave it in one particular place on the green, in the dusthole, the corner of the green, between seven and nine; he saw me that evening before I did it, and asked me about it.</p>

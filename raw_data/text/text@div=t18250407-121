After I had passed the crowd I felt it gone; I directly turned round, and heard an officer say,</p>
               <p>"Who has lost a handkerchief?" he had it in his hand, and had hold of the prisoner - I had not noticed him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I in custody when the officer gave you the handkerchief? A. Yes, he had you by the collar.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Giles's. I was in Holborn, keeping the pavement clear opposite a fire which had happened the night before. I observed a rush, and the moment Mr. Hayles passed me I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchief on the ground; I took it up, collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Who has lost a handkerchief?" Mr. Hayles claimed it - my brother officer said,</p>
               <p>"Don't put it into your pocket" - he then gave it to me, and I have had it ever since. The prisoner said he did not take it, and I was a false man altogether. I am certain he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070052"></xptr>dropped it out of his left hand; he was just behind Mr. Hayles at the time.</p>

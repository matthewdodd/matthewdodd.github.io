On the 18th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner was apprehended, I missed two ends of cloth, one measuring twenty-four yards and a half, and the other twenty-three - Henman, next morning, showed me one end, which I had seen safe in the warehouse, about one or two o'clock the day before; it is worth 16l. - here it is; I know it by the number and the private mark made by my partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q.Was your partner at the house of business that day? A. Yes; he had authority to sell goods as well as me - he left about twelve o'clock, and did not return; I was in the warehouse the whole evening after he left - my partner does not live in the house; the rent is paid by the firm, but I pay a certain portion to the firm; the warehouse door fastens with a common spring latch, and a bell rings when the door opens - I do not recollect hearing it ring; nobody but myself was in the warehouse or counting house.</p>

            . I am a constable of the City. On the 18th of November, about five o'clock, I was in Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner there with this cloth on his arm - he was going from Basinghall-street, and about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's; a man, who is of a suspicious character, was about two yards behind him - I followed him up Philip-lane to London-wall; I was disposed to let him go as far as the door beyond Deacon's yard, on account of there being a strong gas-light - I turned round towards him, and seeing me look at him, he threw the cloth down, and ran away; I had said nothing to him - I called Deacon's people to take care of the cloth- I pursued, calling Stop thief! he ran up Aldermanbury Postern; I secured him, without losing sight of him - I took him back to Deacon's, found the cloth safe, and then took him to the Compter; on our way there he asked me if this job could not be made up - that he had got a few pounds of his own, and money should be no object; I said it was of no use to trifle with me - after leaving him at the Compter I got the cloth from Deacon's, and have had it ever since; Hedges tripped him up, which enabled me to secure him; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You know that what he said could not be given in evidence against him, if you said any thing to induce him to say it? A.Certainly I do - it was dark; the cloth was wrapped up, but I could see it: he put his hand over the front, which was uncovered; I never lost sight of him - nobody was between me and him; he ran in the middle of the road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What made you pay any particular attention to him? A.

On Tuesday, at nine at night, they were lying in wait for him, at which time he came up into my workshop; the dog barked, from which my servants had intelligence; they went and took him, and brought him to me. He immediately owned the taking the long cramp and sash saw. We took him before the Alderman at Guildhall, where he said he was afraid of being arrested, and he did it to make up a little money. He owned he pawned them, and confessed the taking one other saw, and no more. We went to the pawnbroker's where he directed us, and found them; we have since found the great cramp which he would not confess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I don't deny taking what I confessed, being afraid of an arrest, which was the cause of my taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. How has he behaved before this ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never heard any thing ill of him before this. He has two children, and if he had asked me for money to support them I would have let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the two saws worth that are found again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are worth 15 s.</p>

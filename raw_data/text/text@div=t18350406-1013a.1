                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Bermondsey-street. On the 4th of April, between four and five o'clock, my daughter Jane left my house with a necklace of coral beads, round her neck—I afterwards heard her crying near the door—I ran out, and she told me something—I followed the prisoner, who was walking at a moderate pace in the middle of the road—when I came near him, I saw him throw something from his right hand, but I did not see what it was—I took him, and gave him in charge to a policeman—he went willingly with me part of the way, but, before we got to the station, he made an attempt to escape; and, had it not been for the determination of the policeman, he would have got away.</p>

On the 4th of April, I saw the prosecutor's daughter playing with her hoop—I then saw the prisoner walk from her, and she was crying—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "That man has got ray beads"—the prisoner went away—the child took hold of the skirts of his coat, and said, "Give me my beads"—I looked the pri<lb></lb>soner in the face—he coloured, but said nothing—the prosecutor then came out and followed him.</p>

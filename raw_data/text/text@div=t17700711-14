At two o'clock on Sunday morning, June 10th, the watchman going his rounds, alarmed us. I got up, and found the lower bolt on the outside parlour window shutter was wrenched off; the upper bolt, which was a very strong one, was broke in two; the window was thrown up, and the inside shutter open; the outside shutter, I am sure, was fastened over night. The closet door was broke in the middle; the bolt of the back parlour was wrenched off, and the street door, which I saw locked, bolted, and chained over night, was open. I missed the goods laid in the indictment; (mentioning them ) some of them were in the closet, and some in a cupboard in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Miss Elizabeth Howard, who lives at Tottenham. Her house was robbed on the 10th of February last—I went in pursuit of the thief—it was between five and six o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—I took the prisoner, with the property on him, against the Bull public-house, in Tottenham, three-quarters of a mile from Miss Howard's—he was going towards London there was another one with him—as I approached them, they separated the one from the other—the one that was along with him went on the opposite side of the way, and joined two more men that had flowers on their head—I secured the prisoner, and gave him in charge to George Tappin, the constable—I saw him searched and the property that was lost was found on him.</p>

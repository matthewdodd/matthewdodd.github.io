On the 1st of October there was a knock at my door, and the servant brought me this card, requesting me to deliver to the bearer a great coat belonging to Mr. Wemys, who was my lodger—in consequence of which it was delivered to the person who brought the cart—it was a boy about sixteen years old—the prisoner also lodged the card—time—he went out at a little before ten o'clock that morning or thereabouts—it might he half an hour or more before the boy came of the coat, which was between ten and eleven o'clock—I thought that Mr. Wemys had autho<lb></lb>rized the card to be sent.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of receiving any visits at your house? - A. The sister and mother, and another old woman, came into the house, and went up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. No men came there? - A. None that I can recollect; only Benjamin Johnson, her husband; I used to let him in regularly of an evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My mother offered to make it up to her for two or three pounds, and she said she would not make it up under 9 l.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix.) How is that? - A. Oh dear, no; never such a word passed; she begged of me to be merciful; I was very unwilling, as the articles were found, to prosecute, but never no money mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not give the room up, nor was I half an hour out of the place, before she came and said, I had robbed the place.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prisoner.) How long was it till she came to you, after you had robbed that place? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutrix.) You found where the prisoner was within half an hour? - A. Yes, I found her out through her own sister; I followed her sister that very day I missed the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found out where the prisoner was? - A. Yes; I went to the Office in Worship-street, and informed the officer; I got a warrant, and the gentleman went up stairs in Turk-street, Bethnal-green, and took her.</p>

I desired her mother, as Mrs. Forbes had come to me for the things, and I will be upon my oath I said, I shall be punished for the things that I had lent out of my room to her, as she had taken them away out of her room; I told her to endeavour to find her, and carry them to Mrs. Forbes's house, and then I said, may be there will be no more of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Frenchman, but have lived fifteen or sixteen years in this country—I am an interpreter and translator of several languages—I have only seen the prisoner twice—he called at my place seven or eight months ago, and requested me to attend before the Commissioners of the Westminster Court of Requests to answer to a debt to which he had rendered himself liable from a female he used to visit—he was then quite a stranger to me—I took down his instructions, and found there was no cause why he should not pay the debt if the woman did not—I explained to him that no defence could be made to it, and it was ar<lb></lb>ranged that I should obtain time to pay the debt and costs—I was to be paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for translating a paper for him, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my own attendance—I did not attend on the day the case was heard before the Commissioners, as I was retained to interpret at Union Hall, for a foreigner, and I sent my wife with full instructions to act—she brought me back the adjudication of the debt, to be paid at three monthly instalments—I sent that by my servant to the prisoner's house—I did not make any personal application, is the amount was so trifling—I sent my servant once or twice, but did</p>

I was in Ox<lb></lb>enden-street on the 17th of August, and saw the injury inflicted on the prosecutor's eye by the prisoner—I had never seen either of the parties before—the prosecutor did not offer the least violence to the prisoner—he stood with his thumb in the sleeve of his waistcoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodged in Bury-street, St. James's, at the time in question. I was in company with the prosecutor, walking arm in arm—he left me, and crossed over to speak to the prisoner—he went up to him and gently tapped him on the shoulder with his hand, and appeared to speak to him—the prisoner, by his manner, flew into a violent passion—he seemed to take a step backwards, take a deliberate aim, and with his cane made a violent thrust, and thrust out the prosecutor's eye—the pro<lb></lb>secutor had not struck or offered to strike him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Panton-street. The pro<lb></lb>secutor was brought to me on Saturday, the 17th of August—I found he had lost his eye from a wound—the sight was quite gone—I examined the injury—in my judgment it was such a one as might have been inflicted by thrusting the point of a cane into the eye—It could not have been inflicted without considerable violence—the smaller end of this cane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would inflict the injury—I saw him occasionally for about a month—he suffered a good deal of pain—there was reason to anticipate dangerous consequences although his health was good-such a blow was calculated to produce locked jaw, but I rather anticipated brain fever—It was a very dangerous wound.</p>

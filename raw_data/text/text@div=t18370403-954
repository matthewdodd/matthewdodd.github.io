                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the firm of John Benjamin Heath and two others, at No. 31, Old Jewry, in the parish of St. Olave, Jewry—neither of the partners live in the house—I reside there with my family, by the permission of the firm, in the upper apartments—on Thursday morning, the 2nd of March, about half past two o'clock, I was awoke by a nurse who was attending my wife—I got up, took a light, and went down stairs—I had heard the watchman call the hour of two a few minutes before—I went down stairs and searched two rooms, where I found nothing—I then went into a back room on the second floor—it is a small anteroom—the window of that room was up as far as it could be lifted—I had particularly observed that window the night before, at eleven o'clock, when I went to bed—it was then shut close down, and a wash-hand-stand stood in the recess of that window—I found that removed—a person might obtain access at that window, by climbing to a great height over the roofs of warehouses at the back—I supposed from that, there must be some persons in the house—I was going down stairs to ascertain that, and heard the sound of footsteps going down stairs, as from the counting-house, which is on the first floor—I followed the sound of the steps to the ground-floor, and found the Prisoner Jackson on the mat near the street door, inside the passage—I had a stick in my hand, and threatened if he moved to knock him on the head with it—he requested me to let him go—I did not lay hold of him—he then said, "There is another man up stairs"—I had, before I came</p>

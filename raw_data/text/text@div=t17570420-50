               <p>Q. Where do the other two live?</p>

            . I am son to the prosecutor, the prisoner was a weekly servant to my father; on the 9th of March he staid in the shop till all the other servants were gone out, and after that he went into the warehouse where the soap was, and took this and put it into his pocket, and made towards the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do this?</p>

            . I waited for him, and just as he came to the door I stop'd him, and asked him what he had got there, he said a bit of soap for his mother. I stop'd and charg'd a constable with him, and sent him to Bridewell. I saw the soap taken from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he did not intend to pay you for these goods?</p>

               <p>Russel. If he had intended to have paid me for them, he would have offered to pay me, but he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you watch him?</p>

               <p>Russel. I did, because we had lost soap before, and I suspected it must be people in the house that made away with it.</p>

            . I am headborough; I was sent for that evening, about seven o'clock, to the prose cutor's house, to take charge of the prisoner; there was the last evidence along with me. I search'd the prisoner, and found two pieces of soap in his pocket, and another in his apron.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor What is the value of it?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I have laid it at 2 s. value, but it is worth more.</p>

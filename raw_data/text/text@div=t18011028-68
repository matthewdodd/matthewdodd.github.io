             sworn. - I put the bonnet in the window about ten o'clock, and there were others in the window of the same shape; I have know the prisoner near twelve months, she used to come for yards of twist; the shilling was brought up to me to give change; I was informed of the robbery, and ran into the street, but saw nothing of her: On the 26th of September I was standing in the shop, and saw her go by with the bonnet on her head; I ran out, and tapped her on the shoulder; I asked her to come back, she said she would bye and bye, for she was going further; I said, a person wished to speak with her, and she must come back; at last I got her back; Mrs. Wooster asked her where she got the bonnet; she said she bought it and paid for it of a person standing in the Borough, but had had it turned, I sent for an officer, and took her to Hatton Garden; I know the bonnet, because we had half a dozen of the same sort, shape, and make, but the rest we sold.</p>
               <p>Inward. I apprehended the prisoner, and found the bonnet on her head. (The bonnet was identified).</p>

I went into the Borough, and bought it of a Jew woman I met, she had three or four bonnets to sell; I asked her the price; she asked thirteen shillings; I offered ten shillings; she took it, and it was then as it is now. I was passing the shop, and was stopped; but Mr. Maine said, if I would give him a guinea, he would let me go; I said, I had not got one, and he bid me pawn my cloak.</p>

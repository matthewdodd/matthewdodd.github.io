            . I am a carpenter. I was at the Waterloo Arms on the 16th of June; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner sitting close together in deep conversation - the prosecutor got up to pull the bell, and something like a bill fell down; the prisoner took it up and said to him, "How cautions you ought to be how you drop your things about, do you know what this is?" he said, "Yes, it is a tailor's bill and two 5l. notes" - I saw they were Bank notes, but I could not see they were fives; he asked her for them, and she would not give them to him; I said to the landlord, "She has got some of his money" - the prisoner then said if the landlord would bring in pen, ink and paper, and he would write down the numbers, she would give them up; he said he could not - she then said she would go before his betters before she would give them up; she said what was his was hers, for she was his wife, and had been married to him three years - she was then taken by the officer, but the notes have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she not tipsy? A. I saw her countenance alter as soon as she got the notes in her hand; they had only one pint of ale while I was there - I saw an empty glass on the table; I was opposite to them - it is a small room; I looked about everywhere for the notes, but they could not be found.</p>

            . I keep the Waterloo Arms. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner there; I went in to speak to Steel - he said the prisoner had taken two notes from the prosecutor; the prisoner came across the room, and gave me a tailor's bill to read - the notes had been wrapped up in that; she said if I would give her pen, ink and paper, for him to give her the numbers of the notes she would give them up, as they were not worth 2d. to him without - I said that was nonsense; she then said she would not give them up; I said she had better, it would be worse for her - she said she would not till she got before my betters; that she was his wife, and had been married three years; the prosecutor got an officer - he and my wife searched her, but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she not tipsy? A. No; I have known Steel five years.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner at the Waterloo Arms - I found this tailor's bill, but nothing more; she said, "Don't you meddle with me and my husband, I am his wife" - she said she would not give the notes up; I am sure she did not say she had not got them - she said she would not give them up till she went before her betters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she not tipsy? A. No - I took her before the Magistrate the same evening, which I dared not have done if she had been tipsy; I supposed she had the notes and made a search.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring she had not seen the notes.</p>

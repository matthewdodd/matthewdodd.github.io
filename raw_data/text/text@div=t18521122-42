                  </hi>, I am housekeeper to Mr. Styles, of Maidstone—he has a house and shop with a counting house to it—the prisoner called twice at that house to know if there was a shop to let—I answered him both times—I cannot tell when be called the first time; it was about the middle of the day, on a Saturday—he called the second time on the Tuesday fol<lb></lb>lowing for the same purpose, and he hired it then—I showed it him, but I did not let it; my master was there that day—I was not in the room when he took it—I heard my master say he had taken it—he paid a week's rent, and bad the key of the shop—I did not see the prisoner pay it, but I saw my mask put it down—the prisoner never occupied the shop, nor was in it—he called twice at the house after he took the room in the course of a week—I heard him order the name of O. Walkins and Son to be put over the door—when he called afterwards it was for letters—he asked for letters directed O. Watkins and Son—I gave the prisoner's clerk eight or nine letters—I gave the prisoner two—the prisoner's clerk came with him to look at the place—he called him in to look at the shop—he said "My man," and after that he said "My clerk."</p>

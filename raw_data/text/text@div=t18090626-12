               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a watch and a key and a pair of shoes - A. Yes. On the 12th of this month; I was not at home at the time they were taken. The shoes was in the room where he slept, and the watch was in the room where my wife slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in your house - A. Yes; he took the lodging on Saturday the 10th in the morning, and came in the evening, about half after eleven o'clock. He took it by the week.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you had seen the watch - A. I wound the watch up before his face, and lay it on the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you both use the same sitting room - A. Yes; at the time I wound up the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave the house on the Monday morning - A. I told him I should leave the house about three o'clock; when I got up I heard the chimes go a quarter after three; he was awake, he asked the time; I said a little after three. I went down stairs and called my wife up; she let me in; I told her not to lock the door, I should be back in about an hour and a half; I returned about a quarter before five; I went to feed my birds before I went to the warehouse. In consequence of what my wife said I found my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner gone too - A. He was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the shoes - A. I had seen them on the Sunday morning. He said have you a shoemaker here; I said no, they have been hanging there three months; he took them off the nail and said they would fit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he might have taken them away on the Sunday - A. No; they were in the room on Sunday morning; on Monday morning they were taken away, I had seen them on Sunday afternoon at four o'clock, I did not notice them when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On Wednesday, about seven o'clock, I then said to him, Reed, you thief, you are the man that I have been looking for ever since Monday morning. He never returned, nor had I sight of him till I took him, and then he turned as white as ashes; he did not say a word. I told him what he had stole; he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch or your shoes - A. No. I had another lodger that slept in the room where I did, he has been with me two years; I never lost a halfpennyworth by him; he lives with me now.</p>

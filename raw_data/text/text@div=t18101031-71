            . I am an officer in the Thames police; I was off the Isle of Dogs in a Thames police boat, on the 8th of October I saw the prisoner very busy at the head of a cask, I pulled round and went on board the craft, but before I could get on board it was removed from the head of the cask. When I went on board I saw this mat, there was thirty-five pound weight of tallow in it: the mat was spread under the head of the cask, I asked them how it came there, they denied any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there - A. Two lightermen pulling the punt up with two oars, the other two men were present.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he removed it - A. The mat lay by the side of the cask, and as he pulled the tallow out of it fell on the matt. He had left the cask when he saw me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a thing that often happens in a voyage that a cask tumbles down and the head falls off - Very often; but he was in the same barge.</p>

            . As we were rowing in Greenwich reach, we observed the prisoner in a punt, he was tearing a piece of hoop off a lining that confines these heads, he hove the piece overboard; we observed that he rowed round and boarded the craft, we observed, that he left the cask and sit down, this matt was spread under the head of the cask with the tallow in it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a barge belonging to Mr. Hay - A. Yes; as soon as he saw us going on board he got up and rowed. On examining the cask, on the tallow there were the marks of the fingers where he pulled the tallow out. I went forward and accused them of it, they all denied it. I told Batt that I saw him at the cask, he said no, look at his hands they are not greasy: I felt his hands, they were perfectly greasy, very much so.</p>

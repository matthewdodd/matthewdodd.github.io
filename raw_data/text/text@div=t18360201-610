                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 108, London-road. I know Mr. Cullingford, who keeps the Country Coffee-house—I work for him—on the Thursday before Sunday the 6th of December, I received an order from him for a waistcoat—it was no done in time to be there before church began or the Sunday, and I went to get there at the time church was over, but I got there about ten minutes before one—I met Thomas Miles on the way, and he walked with me—when we got here the door was shut—Mrs. cullingford was in the bar-parlour—there is a window from there, which looks into the street—I looked through, and saw her there—I held the handkerchief that contained the waistcoat up to the window—she knew me, and the door was opened by the boy who goes by the name of Henry—on going, in, Mrs. Cullingford was just coming out of the bar-parlour into the bar, apparently to go up-stairs I should Presume—the bar-maid was in the bar at the time—nobody quitted the house when I went in.</p>

               <p>in, with pipes, without your observing them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—nobody went in at the same time with Mr. Miles and myself—I found no female with a mug in her hand, as if served with beer—no female went out—I staid at the bar a minute and a half or two minutes, and after that went into the parlor—I had a view of the tap-room—there were no people there—the door makes a very great noise when it opens—it is in a dilapidated state, and tied at top and bottom—there is a stone flooring, and the bolt shoots makes a noise—I might not have heard that door open, if the parlour door had been shut, but I had the parlourd-oor in my hand, waiting for Mr. Cullingford to come down stairs, and in the situation in which I was placed I think the front door could not have opened without my seeing it—Mr. Cullingford came down stairs shortly, and we had some talk about the waistcoat—while we were talking, the pot-boy came to the room door, and told him it was near the time to open the house—I think he said it wanted about two minutes and a half to the time—Mr. Cullingford said. "Go up and look what o'clock it is, "and he went—Mr. Cullingford said, "We will not open the door, we had better be a minutes or two after than before the time"—there is a window on the staircase, which looks out on Trinity church clock—it would not he necessary to open the front door to see that—I and my friend stopped in the parlour a few seconds, and then came out of the parlour—the door was opened—it was then minutes past one o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Dues this house stand at the corner of a street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—what is called St. George's-road—there is no side-door—there are a pair of gates in the court, (which no one that I saw was admitted in or out at,) at which Mr. Cullingford was in the habit of taking his beer and lumbering things in—the parlour is in front of the tap-room—I should think it was from ten to twelve feet from the parlour-door to the street-door—I spoke to Mrs. Cullingford first—I looked into the tap-room—there was no clock in the tap-room—there is one in the bar, which I presume was going, as when I came out it was something like ten minutes past one o'clock,—I did not look at the church-cook then—the landlord did not say his clock was out of order—he sent the boy to look at the church-clock, because he wished to be accrete, through being falsely sworn against before—the people who swore against him saying, that there were six people with pipes in their mouths came out of Mr. Cullingford's—from that he was very cautious—he and I are on terms on intimacy, and he has told me he would be cautious, and make the boy look at that clock to see the time before he opened his door—I have heard him say he meant to have prosecuted the people who swore against him—the house is known either by the "County-terrace Tavern," or the "County-terrace Coffee-house"—I waited there five minutes before Mr. Cullingford came down—there is no room between the tap-room and parlour—the stain come down, and there are two doors—there is but one footway—door out of the house, and no back way only those pair of gates—till Mr. Cullingford came down I am sure no person could have come in or gone out without my hearing it; and I should think not, while I was talking to him, because the boy came in and made this remark to him—I stood close to the parlour-door—I swear people could not come in or go out with our my hearing or seeing them; and no one went out—I am sure they could not, for I recollect that Mr. Cullingford and I were talking. and I told my friend that he had been fined a few</p>

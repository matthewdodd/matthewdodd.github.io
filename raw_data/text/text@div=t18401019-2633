At a quarter to eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 26th of September, I was in the shop—I put my bag on the counter in the shop, while I went to speak to Mr. Smith in the adjoining sitting room—there was a purse in my bag, containing ten sovereigns, a small key, a shilling, also five sovereigns, a half-sovereign, and a sixpence, wrapped in paper, separate from the other—two pocket-handkerchiefs, three letters, and a memorandum book were also in the bag—I returned in three or four minutes, and the bag was missing—one handkerchief has been found—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it, because I hemmed it myself—as I was going into the shop—I saw Lane very near the shop, and Ivey two or three hundred yards from the door—this was not ten minutes from that time till I missed my bag—they might have come into the shop—Lane looked as though he was looking at my bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poor woman. My husband is a labouring-man—we live in Grosvenor-market, which is perhaps 200 yards from South Molton-street. On the 26th of September I saw Lane at a quarter or ten minutes to eleven o'clock—I am certain it was before eleven—I saw him at his mother's door—he was employed outside her shop, doing something—I do not know what—I know the time, because I took a few rags to Mrs. Lane's, and I went from there to the bacon-shop at the corner of South Molton-street, and the Court-house clock was striking eleven—I know Lane's person perfectly, and am certain it was him I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you remember this day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It being Sa<lb></lb>turday, and I saw it in the "Dispatch" paper the Sunday week following—I was not aware that it was him—I saw his sister in the week follow<lb></lb>ing, and I said, I saw a case so and so, in the paper, but being at that time in the morning, I said it could not be him—I had had no communi<lb></lb>cation with Mrs. Lane before that—I could not exactly tell what Lane was doing when I saw him—I think he was sorting rags, or something.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Lane's sister—I am married, and live in Grosve<lb></lb>nor-market. On the 26th of September I was at my mother's—Lane did not leave her house till between ten and eleven o'clock—it was a little be<lb></lb>fore eleven when he went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you come to recollect this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was very near our lunch time—we generally have lunch about eleven o'clock and the beer was brought—I was cleaning—I do not know who fetched the beer—MRS. Burrows came in—I do not know whether she partook of any of the beer—my mother set the luncheon out in the parlour—my brother</p>

               <p>was in his shirt-sleeves—I cannot tell what he was doing—he was there when Burrows arrived—he had been in the shop all the time from seven o'clock in the morning, till eleven—I do not think he lunched with us that day—he left very near eleven I am certain, and I saw no more of him till I heard he was in the station-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour on Sunday morning, near the Bedford nursery, and saw the prisoner there with a bag; I asked what he had got; he said, only some fowls, which he had got from Churchway, and was going to take them to the Seven-dials. I took him to the watch-house with them.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old, and live in Lamb-alley, Sun-street; my father is a weaver - I am an errand-boy. About twenty minutes to six o'clock on this night I saw Burrell in his cart; the three prisoners stood on the pavement; Cox went across the road, behind the cart, peeped at the bundle, and came back; he went up again, jumped up behind the cart, took the bundle out, and went up Acorn-street with the other prisoners - I believe he gave it to Fenner, as I saw him come back with Leeds without it. I went behind the cart and said, "Master, you are robbed;" he stopped, got out, and ran up Acorn-street - I stopped by the cart; then ran into Acorn-street, and saw him holding Cox; he let go of him; I said, "Master, that is the man who robbed you;" he then ran away. I went to Worship-street in the cart, and saw the prisoners taken close by the George, public-house, in Angel-alley, which is near Acorn-street. I am sure Cox took the bundle, and believe the others to be the persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you going - A. On an errand for my father. I have seen the prisoners use the George, public-house, which made me notice them. I was behind them, but as Cox came back with the bundle his face was towards me - they were all three walking together in the street before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the constable tell you you would be punished if you did not swear to them - A. He said "My man tell the truth, and do not tell more than the truth;" that is all he said. I was never told to swear to them.</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live with my parents, in St. Clement's-place, Lamb-alley. I was in Bishopsgate-street, about twenty minutes to six o'clock in the evening, going to school to write, and saw Cox get up to Burrell's cart and take a bundle out; the other prisoners stood on the pavement, on the left hand side. Cox gave the bundle to Fenner, and they all three ran up Acorn-street. I and Perkins went and told Burrell - he got out, and ran down Acorn-street, as we told him - we went there. Cox and Leeds came down the street - the bundle was then gone - Leeds was on the pavement, and Cox in the road. Burrell laid hold of him, and said he had lost his bundle. Leeds staid there till he let Cox go. I followed Burrell, and told him Cox had done it; he took us to Worship-street, and I afterwards saw them in custody, and was quite sure of them - I kept looking at Leeds and Fenner while Cox was taking it.</p>

St. Giles's: On Saturday the 26th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of a lodger coming to me, and saying she saw a man go up stairs; I went up with the key of the servant's room, and the key of our bed-room; I saw a key in the door of the two pair of stairs bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the room you slept in? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; we are always very particular in locking the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock it yourself? - A. No; but the key was down stairs, I took it up with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you taken that key from? - A. Out of the kitchen; I opened the bed-room door, and saw the prisoner, the cupboard-door was open, which he was standing by; I took him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any hat on? - A. Yes, this hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hat is that? - A. My own.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you left it? - A. In a hat-box, in the cupboard; I took him by the collar, he asked me what I did that for; and I said he was come to rob the house; he said he was come to some person, whose name I forget; I told him he should go along with me; he told me not to tear his clothes; he stooped down in the cupboard, and got shuffling about with the hat-boxes, I thought he might be feeling for something, I took him by the back part of his coat, and pulled him out of the cupboard; I told him he had no business there; upon which he took off my hat and put on his own, which was lying upon the floor, upon that I said, you have got my hat have you; I then brought him down to the bottom of the stairs, in the passage, I was giving the keys to the servant with my other hand; he gave himself a sudden twist, and ran off, upon which I immediately ran after him, and cried stop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040048"></xptr>thief; he ran up Princes-court, up Turnstile, into Holborn, into Kingsgate-street, and Eagle-street; he fell down in Dean-street, he got up, and was laid hold of by another person; I took him myself into Holborn, he twisted to get out of my hands again, he ran about as far as two yards, I caught hold of his coat, and pulled him over; a man came over and offered his assistance, and as we were going along he offered me any thing to let him go; I told him I would have no satisfaction, but he should have justice; I took him into the kitchen, where I met with the beadle, he searched him, and found upon him some keys, and some Bank-notes; upon seeing the notes, I went up stairs to see if he had been at the drawers, and when I got up stairs I found this cloak, and these handkerchiefs, upon the landing outside the room-door.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was this? - A. Two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the cloak and handkerchiefs been before? - A. On the drawers in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them there? - A. No; I only knew from what Mrs. Crook said; I took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your key? - A. No, it is not; it is a key of his, which he owned and asked for.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at home? - A. I suppose I had been at home about an hour, I had just done my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife at home? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of besides? - A. Two children, and a servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you saw any body, one of your lodgers had seen the prisoner, or somebody else, before you saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was broad day-light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before that you had seen this room? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been there after you got up? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is impossible for you to say that it was locked? - A. No.</p>

            . I work at the house. I left a little after six o'clock - all was then safe. I returned at half-past nine o'clock, and stopped there an hour, in consequence of suspicion. I heard some person coming down stairs. The prisoner came into the room where I was concealed with a bag on his back. He looked out of window to see if any one was watching him, as the watch-house is opposite, and then turned and walked down stairs. I went to the window, and told the watchman, who was coming by, to stop him - he brought a light, and I unlocked the door. He came in and found the prisoner concealed under a work-bench. The bag was behind the street-door with 60 lbs. of lead in it, which was afterwards fitted to the roof and tallied with it.</p>

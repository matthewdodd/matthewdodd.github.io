On Saturday the 25th of last month the prisoner came in and took a loaf of sugar that was standing in the shop window.

            . I live servant almost opposite to Mr. Saunders. I can swear that the prisoner is the person from whom I took the loaf of sugar. This little fellow came running by me with something under his arm; I took the sugar from him.</p>
               <p>Is that sugar now produced like that which you took from the boy? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was coming from my master's, and went up near the shop to ease myself. A man came by me in a great hurry and laid down that sugar: I looked at it and thought it was mine, and carried it away; and a gentleman came and said I had stolen it out of his shop.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses? - I have not a friend in the world.</p>

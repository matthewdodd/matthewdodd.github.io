               <p>SIR ROBERT GRAHAM, BART. I carry on business in Walbrook. On the 9th of November, about three o'clock, I was within two or three doors of the London coffee-house, on the footpath, at the time the Stationers' Company were passing: there were a great number of persons - I felt myself surrounded by several well dressed men, of whom I had no suspicion; they squeezed against me very closely for some time - I had left home about ten minutes, and had in a purse in my trousers pocket 9l. - my watch and seals were in my fob, and the chain concealed in my trousers; I had also a pocket-book of no value - my watch and appendages were gold, and worth about 36l.; as soon as I got relived from the pressure, I missed my watch and pocket-book; my purse was not taken - I thought the men who were close to me were larger than the prisoners; I saw them before the Magistrate next day, and my pocket-book was produced; the memorandums in it are my own writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. No doubt many persons were there innocently? A.Certainly; my pocketbook was in my left-hand trousers pocket - I tucked my chain and seals into my right hand trousers pocket; I did not see the prisoners - one person had very large whiskers, and another was a tall man.</p>

             - I asked how he came by that letter; he then said, "I had the pocket-book given to me;" I asked who by - he described a person dressed as Lane; his description corresponded with the appearance of Lane, who was among the party when I took Smith; I put him into the Compter, went into Cheapside, and saw Lane standing by the pavement in a crowd - I told him he must come with me; he said, "What have I done?" I said I would tell him at the Compter - I took him there, and had Smith called up; I said."Is this the person who gave you the pocket-book?" he very reluctantly said, "I don't think he is the man," and hesitated several times; Lane said, "Do you say I gave it to you?" he said, "No, I don't say so;" I detained them both.</p>

I searched his waistcoat pocket, but not minutely; he was not out of my custody - I let go of him, but kept close to him; I knew him before, and he knew me - he is in the newspaper line.</p>

I was going up Ludgate-hill, and had not been there five minutes before the officer, who I well knew, took me; he searched all my pockets, and told me to go about my business - I walked from the coffee-house to the Old Bailey, and stood looking at the prison; if I had known of a robbery, I should have escaped; I picked the book up on Ludgate-hill, as a crowd was passing.</p>

I saw the prosecutor crying; he told me he had been robbed - I went with him to a house in Albion-street; I first went up stairs, and then into a room on the ground floor - there was the prisoner, and three or four other women; the presecutor pointed the prisoner out - I demanded the clothes; the prisoner said she was not the person, and knew nothing about them - I searched the room, and found this property; when I took the prisoner she said she was a modest girl, and thought no barm of taking the clothes.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I met this prosecutor; he went with me, and he sent for half a pint of rum - I had some of it, and he and my landlady had some; he then said he had no money, but he would give me his coat to pawn -I said I would have nothing to do with that; he then said he would go and get some from his friends - he went down, and in a quarter of an hour he brought in a Policeman; I said I was with him, but I knew nothing about his clothes - I was searched at the watch-house, and 3s. were found on me, with which I was going to market; I did not ill use him, nor do anything bad to him - there was nothing of his found in my room; I am married, but my husband is not in town.</p>

               <p>Q.Where was the waggon at the time he left you? - A. At Colnbrook; I missed it about half an hour afterwards; I got upon my horse, and the landlord and I went after him; we overtook him at the Magpie, Hounslow-heath; I asked him if he had got the cheese, and he made me no answer; I put my hand to the sack, and pulled out the cheese, and I swore to it; it had the mark of a B upon it, and had been squeezed, which I observed before I put it into the waggon; I sent for a constable, and he offered me a guinea and a watch to let him go; I delivered the cheese to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is an old acquaintance of your's? - A. Yes; I used to carry money to his daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you took it in your head to be entertained with a boxing-match on the road? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you did not desire him to drive your waggon on for six or seven miles, while you went to look at a boxing-match? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.It was his own sack that he took out of the waggon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the sack opened, and found it filled with his clothes, and a quantity of shoes and boots, and apples? - A.There was a coat and waistcoat of his in the sack, and some apples.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say to you, if you had lost a cheese, the man, who was in the waggon. might have put it into the sack? - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not two men ride in the waggon to town? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you mean to say that you never left the waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you supposed you had lost the cheese, did you count them? - A. No; I did not then, only from the appearance of the waggon, I knew there was one gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a person who ran away from the public-house the moment the charge was made? - A. No; there was not.</p>

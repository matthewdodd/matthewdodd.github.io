            , who lives at Muswell-hill, Hornsey; he had a quantity of shrubs in the pleasure ground, which is fenced all round. On the 23d of November, at seven o'clock at night, I saw them all safe; next morning I found a quantity of holly, saffrons, Rhoda bendrams, and other evergreens, cut and taken away. About eight o'clock the officer came, and produced shrubs of this description they had been partly cut, and then torn away; those produced tallied exactly with what were left, and I am certain are part of those lost; they will never return again to their proper maturity. The damage done was upwards of 20 s. The prisoners lived at Highgate.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 23d of December, a little after one o'clock in the morning, I was with Davenport, and met the prisoners in Coney Hatch-lane with two bundles of holly and other evergreens - one had his bundle on his head, and the other on his shoulder, with a pole. Fisher said he brought it from Hadley, and threw his bundle down, and said he would carry it no further. I asked them whom they had it from? they said they had it from a gardener, and gave 2 s. 6 d. for it. I have been a gardener myself, and told them I was sure no gardener would ever presume to cut such shrubs as those. Hummerston told Fisher he had better take his bundle up, and go along with it, which he did, and we put them into the cage. They said they had stolen them, but they did not say where from. I found a knife on each of them - one was a gardener's knife, was all green, and appeared to have been fresh used; the other was a shoemaker's knife - there was a notch in each knife, which being compared with the shrubs, agreed with it. I have no doubt but they were cut with those knives. No gardener would cut such shrubs as those. I shewed them to Brewer, and they tallied with the trees.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the King's Arms, in Strutton-street. I was in the bar, near six o'clock in the evening, on 10th March—I saw the prisoner come through the parlour, at the back of the bar, and take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of silver off a cabinet in the bar—it was standing up in pounds—he could see me, but I do not suppose he was aware that I saw him—he ran into the tap-room—I followed him, and called Mr. Holloway, and told him of it—the prisoner came out of the tap-room again—he got out of the house, but was caught by the potman—I did not see him again till the policeman brought him—I can't say that I had seen him before—I believe he was sober.</p>

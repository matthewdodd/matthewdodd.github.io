                  </hi>. I am single. In Oct. 1843, I lived at 12, Golden-lane, Cripplegate, and carried on business in the general line, a chandler's-shop—I then knew the prisoner, and had done so a couple of years; he is a servant, and was then out of place—he came to my house very frequently—in the Sept. before I had drawn 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, out of the Camberwell Savings-bank, to go into business—in Oct. I had a 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, in a desk in the parlour on the ground-floor behind the shop—the desk was generally unlocked—adjoining the parlour there is a bedroom—I missed this money on a Sunday morning, having seen it safe on the Friday night—the prisoner came on the Saturday, and was in and out of the parlour most part of the day till he left—a person named Hart was there that day cleaning out the parlour and bedroom—the prisoner was in the parlour when I was not—he knew I kept money in the desk—I had never sent him there for money, but I sent him that morning to fetch a wafer, which he brought to me—about three o'clock I asked him to bring some coppers out of the bedroom, which he did, and then went to the parlour, fetched his hat, and went off directly, saying he should return in a quarter of an hour—I was at home the whole day, and he did not return—I next saw him at Moor-lane station, last month—on the Sunday morning I went to my desk to put some more money in, and missed the notes and the money—I sent Hart to Mr. John Trinnick, a friend of mine, and made known to him what had happened—I could get no information at the Savings-bank about the notes—I had not taken the numbers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Hart. Seven years ago I was lodging with Mrs. Lawrence, of 12, Golden-lane—on a Saturday in Oct., I went to clean her parlour and bedroom for her for, the first time—till that day I had not been further than the shop, to pay my rent—I never saw the prisoner before that day—I went about eight o'clock in the morning—he was then in the parlour—after dinner I was cleaning knives in the parlour—he asked me if it would make any difference to me if I cleaned the bedroom first</p>

               <p>instead of the parlour—I said it would not be so convenient, but if he wished it I would do so, and did so in consequence—when I left the parlour the desk was on the table, on the right side of the parlour—I do not know whether it was locked or not; it was very small, and I thought it was a workbox—I did what was necessary in the bedroom—I was there an hour, more or less—I was in and out of the parlour during the time—I fetched the prisoner a pint of half-and-half, and he sat drinking it and smoking his pipe—when I had finished in the bedroom I went to the parlour and saw the prisoner at the desk—he took something out and went into the bedroom—he stood with his back towards me, and I saw him empty some money out of a piece of brown sugar paper, and put it into his left-hand trowsers pocket—I saw gold in his hand—he then turned round to the desk, put in the empty paper and took out another piece of paper—he went into the bedroom, and I distinctly saw him folding two pieces of paper exactly the size of bank-notes, which had figures and letters on them—he put them into his right-hand trowsers pocket—Mrs. Lawrence then called him to bring a few coppers, as she was paying the baker in the shop at the time—he took her the coppers, which he got from a basket under the drawers in the bedroom, and went into the shop—he then returned to the bedroom, searched for something, which he did not seem to find, returned into the parlour, took up his hat, and went out, stating to Mrs. Lawrence, in the shop, that he would be back in a quarter of an hour, as he was going to the landlord about some alterations that were to be made—I did not see him again till he was in custody at Guildhall—I said nothing to Mrs. Lawrence about what I had seen—on the Sunday morning she sent me to Mr. Trinnick, of Elm-street, Gray's-inn-lane—he came, and I then heard her complain about the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you saw him going out, did not you say, "Why, Mr. Clayton has been at your desk and got a lot of your money?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because she had sent him to it for wafers—I was not in the parlour by myself that morning—Clayton was only in the bedroom doorway—I was cleaning knives—of course he saw me—he did not go out till three in the afternoon—I was there the whole time till nine at night—Mr. Trinnick came about three on the Sunday—I did not know of the loss at twelve o'clock—I knew there was something the matter with Mrs. Lawrence; she was crying—I mentioned to my husband on the Saturday night that there had been a man there and taken some money out of the desk—on the Saturday night I said to Mrs. Lawrence, that Clayton was a long time, she remarked, no doubt he had been drinking as he was tipsy the night before—I do not know that I was suspected at all—nothing was ever said to me about it—my husband is a bricklayer—I was married at that time, and have been ten years.</p>

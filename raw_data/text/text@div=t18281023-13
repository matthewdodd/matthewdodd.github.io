I lost sight of him; the prisoner was stopped - I did not see him throw the bundle away - he was taken in a few minutes after I called Stop thief! the bundle was produced at the watch-house; it contained all the things.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Aldersgate. I was going up Maidenhead-court, calling half-past eight o'clock - I saw three or four persons together under the dark place; the prisoner made a plunge through, and almost knocked down a young man who was eating oysters, and then nearly knocked a woman down to make way for him to run away; I saw the bundle under his left arm, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I went after him and saw him throw it away at the bottom of the court in Aldersgate-street - I am quite sure he is the man; I ran, but lost sight of him for about three minutes - he was stopped in Falcon-street; I came up and took him - I saw the prosecutrix in Maidenhead-court, trying to save her bundle, as I thought - she was nearly close to the prisoner - I heard her cry out Stop thief! I can swear he is the man who was running away with the bundle - some person brought the bundle to the watch-house; the prosecutrix owned it there.</p>

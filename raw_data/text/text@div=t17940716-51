               <p>Prosecutor, He knew nothing what was in the parcel; it contained a yard of muslin and a yard of dimity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you make up the parcel yourself? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court to Banks. How did you lose it? - I was going down Dean-street, St. Ann's, Soho, with three parcels, two under my arm and one in my pocket; it was about one o'clock in the day; as I was coming within a few doors of Compton-street I found an attempt at the parcel in my pocket, it was tried to be taken out; I found three men about me,

             was one of them, they were all about me, and one of them catched at it, but it was not out, I don't know which it was; then I felt at my pocket, and found the parcel there, then I walked on lower down, the men all kept on walking some before and some behind me; when I got within six doors of Compton-street they all surrounded me, the prisoner was one of them, but I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160084"></xptr>not hear any conversation pass between the prisoner and the other men, but I did with the other two, but they were all in company together from the first to the last; when I got within six doors of Compton street I found the attempt again, I turned about and found the parcel gone; they were all three together then, they were all walking on together, they all surrounded me together; before they made the second a tempt at the parcel, one of the other two said to the prisoner and the other, what is that market place there? and then I directly took hold of this man, and the other man went away I could not get hold of the others, I held him till twenty people came round me.</p>

               <p>I am a hair dresser I know nothing respecting the taking of it. All that I know respecting of it, is, that I was going down Dean-street, and it was between twelve and one o'clock, near one, on Friday the 14th of this month, I observed several persons standing together, I went among them and enquired what was the meaning of it, and I saw a lad had hold of the prisoner at the bar by the coat, and he told me that he had lod a parcel out of his pocket; I asked him if he was certain that this man took it? he said he was in company with two others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going down Dean-street, and as I was passing along the young man laid hold of me, and he said he had lost a parcel, and he believed I had got it; says I. I have not got it, nor do I know any thing of the parcel but if you want any thing with me you may take me where you please.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Banks. When the first snatch was made where was the prisoner? - He was with the other two</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in such a situation as to see the snatch that was made at your bundle? - He must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any outcry at that time? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You was frightened, I suppose? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came up to you did they come up to you altogether or separate? - Altogether.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness, by her former husband. I was with her about nine o'clock in the morning: I saw her buy some things, and put her purse into her pocket, and in an instant she turned, and said,</p>
               <p>"My purse is gone." I looked, and saw the prisoner running away, and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped; there was another boy with him, who said,</p>
               <p>"It was not me, it was the other." I held the other for a moment, but he bit my wrist, and I let him go, and pursued the prisoner. I called Stop thief! and he was stopped; he told the people who stopped him that he had broke a window, and they were about to let him go, I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't let him go; he has got my mother's purse;" he said he had not, and turned out his pockets: there was nothing in them - he then pulled off his hat; one of the men said,</p>
               <p>"You are surely satisfied?" I said I was not - he then put his hand into a pocket behind him, and took the purse out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 3rd of May I was fetched to Mr. Dickinson's warehouse - Bamber was offering this silk for sale; I detained him, and from what he said, I went to Pitkin's, who went with us to the dye-house and took the prisoner - I told him I suspected him of stealing some silk; he denied it - I told him he had been seen to take a parcel out of the stable; he said the boy Roe had seen him put it into the stable - Roe said the prisoner had asked him for the key, and taken a bundle out, but he had not seen him put it in; the stable is under the dye-house - there is a loft over it; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the bundle which he took out; he said it was only some shirts he had to wash - that he had taken it to a butcher whose wife washed for him; I then told him the silk had been found - he made no reply; his master said "How could you think of robbing me. when I have taken you from a state of starvation?" he was dreadfully agitated, and said "I am starving now sir."</p>

I am servant to Mr. Horton, who has a stable under Mr. Dickinson's dye-house, which is a sort of a loft over the stable; there is a hole, by which you can go front the stable into the loft, and a ladder outside, which goes up to the loft door; on the Thursday, there was silk of all kinds in the loft, and on Friday morning, while I was at breakfast, the prisoner came and asked me for the key of the stable; I asked what he wanted it for - he did not say, but said he would not keep it a minute; I went and unlocked the door - he went behind the door and took up a bundle in a blue handkerchief; he put it inside his coat, and went into the yard directly - I had been in the stable from six till eight o'clock that morning, but had not seen the bundle there then; Mr. Dickinson's men go to breakfast at eight o'clock - I went at the same time and locked the stable door; the bundle was by the side of a truss of hay, just under the hole which leads to the loft - when he came from breakfast, I asked him what was in the bundle; he said two shirts and two pairs of stockings, which he took to a man at the corner to be washed.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Dickinson.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not very east to swear to silk? A. No; but I believe it to be mine - there is not much of this made in London.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PHILLIPS. I am ostler to Mr. Dickinson. On this Friday Moss was loading a cart of rubbish with me; I saw him go for Roe, and go into the stable - he came out with a bundle; and in the evening I noticed some silk, similar to this in his hat - it is here; I asked what he was going to do with it; he said he was going round to two or three places with it for Mr. Dickinson.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer. I employed Gilbert to sell this silk; I received it from the prisoner that day - I did not know whether he was a master or what; he said he had some silk which came from a gentleman in the country, and asked if I knew anybody who could dispose of it - he gave me about 8lbs., I took it to Gilbert.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot swear this is the silk? A. No. I believe it to be the same; it was exactly these colours - I am not in the habit of selling silk for strangers; I had known him about nine days, but never sold anything for him before; he asked if I knew who would buy it - I expected to have about 6d. in the pound commission, which is usual. I have been in custody ever since: I did not ask where he lived - he came to my house, into my kitchen; my wife was not present - I did not expect him to come; I had never been at Mr. Dickinson's dye-house, and was never in custody before: he was to come in the evening for the money; I asked Gilbert to sell it for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers—the prisoner has been a carrier in the Post-office about a year and a half—in December last, Brewer-street, Somers-town, was his district—he had been removed, at the commencement of October, from the Crawford-street and Montague-square district. On the morning of the 27th of December I was at the Post-office—I saw a letter directed to" Mr. Alden, No. 27, Brewerstreet, near the Brill, Somers-town, London"—I took a copy of the address, and marked the letter with a private mark—I noticed the letter particularly—it contained some kind of coin—it had the Truro post-mark on it—I gave it to Mr. Cook, another assistant inspector, and desired him to put it among the letters for the prisoner—I told him also to take the direction down—he did so—the prisoner was not in the letter-carrier's office at that time—he came up immediately after Mr. Cook had put the letter among his other letters—he arranged his letters for delivery, and went out in about three-quarters of an hour—I saw him take the letter—this letter now produced is the same, and has my private mark on it—the prisoner left the office about ten minutes before nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant inspector of letter-carriers. On the morning of the 24th of December, Mr. Reynolds gave me a letter, which, in consequence of his directions, I placed among the prisoner's letters on his seat—I made an entry in a book, which I have here, of the address, and where it came from—I believe this to be the letter—I noticed that the r was left out in the word" Somers-town," and it appeared to me to contain coin—that coin was safe in it when I put it among his delivery letters—there was no appearance of any breaking of the seal, or displacement of the coin—I afterwards made inquiry at Brewer-street, to see if the letter had arrived there; and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to the prisoner's lodging, No. 6, Berkeley-street, Clerkenwell—I saw him there, and told him he must go with me to the Office respecting a letter that had been misdirected—he went with me—on the arrival of the officer, we were directed to go to Mr. Peacock's, the solicitor—Mr. Peacock asked the prisoner if Brewer-street, Somers-town was in his delivery—he said it was—Mr. Peacock then asked him if he had any letters that morning for Mr. Alden, of No. 27, in that street—he said he had not, that be knew the name in the street, but he had no letters for him—Mr. Peacock then said that an inquiry had been made for a letter supposed to contain coin, and directed to Mr. Alden, No. 27, Brewer-street—the prisoner said he had not seen it; if he had, it would have been delivered in the usual way—be gave no further account respecting the letter at that time.</p>

It was my full intention on returning to my duty at half-past five o'clock, to have taken it to the President, whoever was on duty, and have stated to him, that just before my delivery I discovered the seal broken, and the sovereign visible, to know what I was to do with it, whether I should detain it until my morning delivery, or what I should do with it. I was so agitated when I went before the gentleman, that I hardly knew what I said, or I should have immediately taken it out of my pocket, and asked the gentleman what I should do with it. In coming from my lodging with Mr. Cook, I asked him if he knew what Mr. Kelly wanted with me; he said he thought it was respecting a money order I had the day before, which was directed to the receiving-house, No. 1, Pleasant-row, Bloomsbury. The morning previous he had told me that I might try it at No. 1, Pleasant-row, Battle-bridge; it was opened by Mr. Steed at the receiving-house; he did not know any thing about it; I took it to Mr. Playle, the inspector, on Friday morning; he wrote on it, 'Not for Mr. Steed,' and told me to take it to the Bloomsbury man. I put my signature to it, and I gave it to the Bloomsbury man; it was thinking of that when I was before the gentleman that caused me to be so agitated, or I should have brought out the other letter, to have asked what I was to do with it. I saw Mrs. Alden, as she as has stated; as I passed her, I said it was a mild morning, and I repassed her.'—R. <hi rend="smallCaps">HORTON."</hi>

Some of them were found at the prisoner's mother's house in Lamb-alley, others at the house of Mr. Hone who had stopp'd them, so I came by the knowledge of it, for it is impossible I should have missed them where I have a large quantity together. When I with a search warrant found the four covers and sack in a box at the prisoner's mother's, she at first denied knowing any thing of the matter; but the lad own'd the taking them all, and said his mother sold them for him to a woman that is here, one Emmerton.</p>

When I saw them on the Monday morning I suspected them to have been stolen, and was determined, if possible, to find it out, so mentioning it to a woman whose husband happened to mention it to Mr. Pitman it was discover'd. Mr. Pitman came to me, and I delivered these 14 bottoms, which the woman brought to him; and as Mrs. Emmerton had given me an account who brought it to her, and we knowing her son was apprentice to the prosecutor, they were both taken up.</p>

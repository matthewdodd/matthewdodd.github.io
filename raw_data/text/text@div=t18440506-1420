                  </hi>. I am assistant to Frederick Ingoldby, he lives in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—the surgery adjoins the house, and is part of his dweling-house—I left at half-past ten o'clock on Friday night, the 26th of April—it was safe then—the window was down, and the glass was not broken—at a quarter to three I was awoke by the policeman—I went down, and saw the surgery door open, the front-door open, and the window put up—there were a pair of my master's scissors near the bell—they had been re<lb></lb>moved.</p>

At half-past two o'clock that morning I saw the glass broken at the surgery window—I turned my lamp on, and saw the prisoner come to the passage—he came out of the street door, and I took him—the sash was up half a foot, and the glass was broken over the catch, which would enable a man to put his finger in and open it—the prisoner had his boots under his arm when he came out—I asked him what brought him there—he said, "I belong to the house"—I rung up Mr. In<lb></lb>goldby,</p>

I followed him, and found him in about ten minutes, in Fenchurch-street; and asked where he was going to take the linen - he said, to the cart; I was not satisfied, and he stopped Wickers, another carrier - who said, he was Larkin's son, who is our carrier; he threw the linen into Wicker's cart, and I went home.

               <p>"Where is the bundle of linen which was brought in this afternoon - he said,</p>
               <p>"There has been none brought in here at all;" both declared that none had been brought in. I said, a person saw it brought in - he said, I was welcome to look round the room. I asked where his bed-room was - he said, that was it; I said,</p>
               <p>"There is no bed here." I went to the back-room, on the ground-floor, where I knew that he slept; I pulled the curtains back, and saw linen strewed all over the bed; I called for a light, he muttered something, and seemed unwilling to give me one, my brother got par. Bureau said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Popls, I will tell you where it is." I said, I had found it; he followed me into the room, and the linen laid there - the woman went out of the house, I asked the man how he got it, he said, it was left there for him to purchase, and that he opened the bundle to uncertain the value. I sent him to the office, and afterwards apprehended his wife. Next day, I apprehended the other prisoners, and found the duplicate of two shirts upon Smith.</p>

I borrowed 5 s. of a young man, and being obliged to make up the money, I took the bundle to Bureau, and asked him to let me leave it for half an hour, then took out two shirts and pawned them to get the money for the coachman - intending to make them good the following week. I was going to fetch it, but hearing that Bureau was apprehended, I was afraid.</p>

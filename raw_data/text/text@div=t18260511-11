On the 14th of April I gave him a box, containing the property stated in the indictment, to take to the White Horse, Cripplegate - he went about twelve o'clock, and returned in good time; I asked if it was all correct; he said it was. On the 21st of April I received information, went down to the waggon office, and made inquiry; I then returned, and charged him with having stolen the things; he gave several different accounts about it - he was then in custody for another offence. I have not found them.</p>

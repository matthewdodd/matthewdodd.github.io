                  </hi>. I live in Druid's-place, Peck ham-rye. On the 22nd of March, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the Duke's Head in the Mint—I went into the parlour in hopes to see a son of mine—I had a glass of ale—the prisoners came in—I had never seen them before—they followed me out—I went to see a person in the Excise-office—one of them followed me very closely—I looked back, and she asked me if I would give her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I did to get rid of her—Burns came up and asked me for another—I refused—she said, "I will take this," and made a dart at my brooch, and took it, the pin of it was left in my shirt—Brown addressed me—I said, "Will you resign what you have taken?"—Burns threw it down, and a third came up and carried it off—I called, "Stop thief," which caused them to be appre<lb></lb>hended—there were more than twenty people about me.</p>

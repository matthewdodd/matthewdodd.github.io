I reside at Clapham, and am the owner of Fisher-house, Islington—it is my copyhold of inheritance—a relative of mine named Hayes purchased it. I produce the deed of covenant, dated the 17th of May, 1780, between Sir William Halton, Bart., and James Hayes, of Aldersgate-street, in consideration of 2000/-✗covenanting to surrender to James Hayes six messuages✗ or tenements, lately five, &amp;c. &amp;c.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there no other instrument by which he held his title, except the deed you have produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The deed of covenant, and the admission on✗ the court-roll—I believe the court-roll is here—I have no objection to produce it—I have not been in correspondence with Fletcher—I may have written to him a note-that might be, I think, in 1833—I once met him at my tenant Hutchinson's—I understand he has claimed this property, by the tenants producing the notices—I do not know from himself that he has always claimed this estate—I only saw him once, and on that occasion he never named Fisher-house—I do not know that he has claimed it for some years-only lately—hegave notice, I believe, to Dr. Sutherland, before he left—I have seen notices in the hands of my tenants a few weeks back—I think I have seen them as far back as 1833—I have had communication with various tenants on the subject of Fletcher's claim to the property, and have treated it with contempt—I was advised to indict them for con<lb></lb>spiring to get the estate—I left it in the hands of my counsel, and they did what they thought proper—I have only had one interview with Fletcher that was in 1833 or 1834, when I met him at Hutchinson's; and now you bring it to my recollection, I remember his saying he expected he had an interest in the adjoining property, and I said, "Put yourself in respectable hands, and you will be well advised "—I have never seen Esther Joburne✗—I believe she was once the possessor of the adjoining property, but not of my property—it is separated by a high wall-perfectly divided—I do not know John Joburns—I have heard of such a person—I have heard he is dead since the prisoner was committed—I never saw Esther Joburns—I never heard of a person of the name of Nott, nor a female named Aldridge—the bottom part of the property, about which I had the conversation with the prisoner, joins Fisher-house—it is called Angler's gardens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, when you went to the property on the 29th of May, was Flet<lb></lb>cher, and the rest of these persons, secretly conveying away the pro<lb></lb>perty, or had he a cart and horse ready to take it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw neither one or the other-there were many people on the premises—it was broad daylight, and they had a flag up—I had not learnt from Fletcher before that it was his intention to do that—I did not apply to a Magistrate till the Monday morning-an application had been made on the previous Saturday—I do not know by whom—I have never put the estate up for sale nor endeavoured to sell it yet—I have had Mr. Alderman Farebrother to look over it, to see what I should do to it-that was last December I think-part of the estate is in a very dilapidated state, and a great part of it untenanted-part of it is almost in a state of ruin-not half of it-one house has tumbled down—I do not recollect how long it was since I was at the estate before the 29th of May, it is not a year—I took possession from Dr. Sutherland in 1836—I never occupied it myself—I have not had any tenant in it since he left, because I understood there was to be a general en<lb></lb>franchisement act, and I have been waiting for that—I believe he estate about which Simpson and Fletcher had the discussion is in the same manor—I have heard that Fletcher is very distantly related to a person named Hammond, but I do not know it-1 have not heard it from any relation of the family.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it happen that any body was in attendance from you at Isling<lb></lb>ton church on any particular day, a year or two ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from me—</p>

               <p>I have known a person named Tomlins within these two or three days—I believe he is in Court now—I have not caused any communication to be made to the prisoners since they have been in custody—I should have thought it a disgrace to do so—my only object is to have quiet possession of my own property—I thought it my duty to do what 1 have done—I have been at a great expense to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the opportunity you have had of seeing Fletcher, is he a man of education, or a poor ignorant creature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I do not know whether Bickers is a broker—he never claimed possession of the estate that I know of—nor Norris that I know of—I have not caused any inquiries to be made after Esther Joburns—I have reason to believe she is alive—I have never seen her.</p>

               <p>justify bail in your life for any sum of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some years ago I did, for a friend of mine, but never but once—I only went to assist my friend—I never received a shilling for doing so—the defendant cannot be surren<lb></lb>dered unless bail be put in, that must be complied with, and that was the occasion on which I received the half-crown, for my trouble in going to the Judge's chambers—if I had been asked to go to Westminster, and swear I was worth any sum of money, I would certainly not have done it—what I did was to get a person into the custody of the Marshal, as we are obliged to do, or else the bail would be fixed—I think Bickers was present on the Monday when Fletcher was before the Magistrate—I do not recollect whether Norris was or not—I do not think he was in the office—I saw him in the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>" Dear Friend,—I grieve for your situation, most particularly for your family; but I trust you will have fortitude enough to go through your trouble, and keep your spirits up, as nothing shall be wanting on my part to serve you and the cause, we have gone hand in hand together, and believe me, I will not desert you. It is a most fortunate affair I was not taken as well as yourself. I am obliged to be from home; nevertheless, I am hard at work for you, and I feel well satisfied you will come off triumphant, as every thing is being done for you to meet your enemies. One thing you must do is, to make over your property as soon as possible, in case of accident. I understand there is about forty witnesses against you, such as they are. Myself and Mr. Cockerill have been to the Register<lb></lb>office, and found a lease granted to Mr. Hammond, in 1756 adjoining, and all round Fisher-house, besides other property Mr. Hammond was possessed of on that estate; and up to the two houses Weaver's, and the other Pickering has got possession of, I have spoken to Mr. Rogers, who is ready and willing to conduct your case, which I hope will meet your approbation and I do expect you will be well supported by counsel—there are two questions at issue, the production of Miss Joburns, and the title of Mr. Pickering to Fisher-house, and they must both be produced, or you must be acquitted, that is the question."</p>

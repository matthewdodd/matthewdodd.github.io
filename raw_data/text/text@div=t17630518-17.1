I was told, a servant of mine was put into the watch-house for stealing of hay; I went and saw the three trusses of hay, one of the trusses I could swear to, and I believe the others to be mine. The prisoner was carried to Justice Fielding, there he said, he had taken the hay out of my barn at Marybone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodman. I live in Marybone parish. On Monday morning the 25th of April, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I detected the prisoner in the field with a truss of hay on his back, he made his escape from me; I catched him again, then he said if I would let him go he would leave the hay. I carried him to the watch-house, there he offered me half a crown if I would let him go. I had watched him, and found two other trusses where he had laid them in the field. Before Justice Fielding he owned he stole the three trusses from out of his master's barn at Marybone that morning, and that he had sold two trusses to a man before.</p>

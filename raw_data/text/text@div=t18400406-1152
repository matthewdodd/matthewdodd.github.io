                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the West India docks, and live in Sophia-street, Poplar. On the 18th of March, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in Vinegar-lane, going home; I had got opposite the Two Mariners public-house, and saw four or five women standing on the pavement by a door there—(I had been up in town on business and was going home)—I know the prisoners were two of them—Hall stepped towards me and wanted me to go in doors—I cannot exactly say what she said—I refused and was about passing on—I then got abreast of the door, and instead of letting me pass the women hussled me into the passage and threw me on a bed in the room—there were five women round me—I cannot say whether there were more—I was thrown on the bed, my legs were taken from under me by somebody, and I was thrown on my left side, and was kept down by one holding my head—Lawson held my right arm back, while Hall tore open my coat—I struggled all I could—Hall stood between my legs, tore open my coat, and took half-a-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my waistcoat pocket, and a knife, a cork-screw, and a small box of steel pens from my trowsers pocket—they left the room—I followed them and called "Police"—nobody came, and I went to the station-house—a policeman went back with me to the house—I found Lawson and another woman there—I could not identify the other, but I gave Lawson in charge—in going to the station-house she said she had not got my property, but <hi rend="italic">Woolwich Ann</hi> had, and she was gone to Walker's, in Albion-street—we went there and found Hall in bed with a man there—I saw the constable find my knife, cork-screw, and box of steel pens in that room by the side of the bed—I was perfectly sober.</p>

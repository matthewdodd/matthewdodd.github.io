               <p>Last Saturday night was sennight, coming home thro' Shoreditch, the corner of Webb Square, from Hoxton-square Coffee-house, I met the prisoner Anson, and she took me to a house in Paul's Alley; it was dark and she desired me to give her a penny for a candle, which I did, and she brought a candle; then she asked me to give her something to drink, I put my hand in my pocket and gave her a shilling; then she asked me for something for supper, and I gave her another shilling; then it was time to go to bed, and she says to me, as you are so very generous and you look like a gentleman, I dare say we need not make any agreement, you will give me a compliment when we rise. She wanted me to go to bed first, I undressed myself, and going to put my breeches under my pillow, she snarched them from my hand and ran out of doors with them; I immediately arose from the bed, I thought I would put on the remainder of my cloaths; but before I could get my waistcoat on, entered the other prisoner, and demanded to know what I wanted there.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you saw the prisoner Underhill? - Yes, but before I could give her an answer, she shewed me a place in an entry with a well in it, and she says, here you rascal, if you say a word about your property you shall be smothered alive in this place, and nobody shall ever know what became of you; a place, I suppose, where there was six or seven load of soil, not above a week before emptied from the necessaries; I then thought it the best policy to give her the best words that I possibly could to get away with my life; she then said to me, you have behaved very generously, and I suppose you can live like a gentleman; the property you have lost is no object to you, if you will never mention it any more, I will go and fetch you your breeches back again; she went out of doors and brought me my breeches; after I had made the greatest dispatch I could out of the house, I acquainted the patrol with what had happened; he took me to the watch-house, and he and some more went with me to the house; when they came there they told them they were patrols, but they would give them no entrance; at last they forced the door open, and this woman that put me in fear,

The place was searched, and one of my buckles was found between the sacking and the bed, where Underhill was found, and the other knee buckle the prisoner Anson delivered when in the watch-house; that was the bed I was going to lay in. I was very much terrified. There were two pair of knee buckles, one that I had in my knees, a pair of set ones, and the other pair was in my pocket; the pair that was found were in my pocket; the other things were never found; it was the plated pair that was found, the stone pair was never found. The prisoners were searched, but no money was found.</p>
               <p>I think you say the first you saw of Underhill, was after the other prisoner ran out of the room? - Yes, I did not see Underhill till Anson was gone off, I did not see her in the house; I do not know where she was while I was in the room with the other.</p>

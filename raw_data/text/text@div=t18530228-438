                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth-common, and am a contractor.

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Wandsworth-common.

                  </hi>. I am a superintending constable of St. Ives. On 24th Jan, I went to the Ram Inn, and saw John Morrell in the parlour—the last witness was asking him to return some money which he had paid him for a horse—I asked him what his name was; he answered, "George Morris," that he was a bay and straw carter, and he came from Puckeridge—I asked him where he got the horses; he said he had had the horse two years, and he bought it at Stortford; and the mare eighteen months, and he bought it at Rochford—I asked him what his man's name was (the other prisoner passed as his servant)—he said it was <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Saville, and he had lived with him twelve months—I took him into custody, and went to look for Joseph Morrell—after looking about the town for him, I met him at the Ram—I asked him his name—he said, "James Wall"—I asked him his master's name—he said, "John Goddard," and he lived at Puckeridge—he said he had lived with John Goddard about six months—I asked him where the mare was—he took me to a beershop outside the town, where I found it, and took possession of it—there was some harness on the floor in the kitchen, which he said belonged to the mare—there were two bridles and a whip; he said he had lived six months with his master, and his master bad had the horse ever since he had been there; and the mare he bought since—I took him into custody—when at the station, John Morrell gave the name of John Goddard—on the following Friday they both asked me to write a letter for them; they said they were brothers; and their names were John and Joseph Morrell—they wished me to write to their father and mother, at Whitford, in Hertfordshire; I said I would, and I wrote it—John afterwards said a man at Puckeridge gave him the horse and mare to take to St. Ives, and he overtook them again at Royston, riding on a pony—they said the man sold a brown horse at Royston, and they saw nothing more of in—I received the black horse from Mr. Botell; I showed it to Mr. Rough and his son, and also to Mr. Rintor, who bought it first—I received a pony from Mr. Bryant, the superintendent at Buntingford—Mr. Blackley, who bought the pony, has since seen it also—I showed that, and the whip and bridles, to Mr. Rough and his sons, and they identified them.</p>

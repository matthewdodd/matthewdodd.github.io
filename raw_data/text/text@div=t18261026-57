The watch was safe a quarter of an hour before; I will swear that she took it - I found my seals and ribbon in my waistcoat-pocket - I suppose the swivel had broken, and in the scuffle the women had put them in my waistcoat-pocket while they were trying to get her from me - the scuffle lasted two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Were you quite sober? A. I was; she ran off directly she took the watch, up a court in Hosier-lane; I took her within eight yards of the spot - I did not say I did not know what sort of a watch it was, for I know where it was made: I was surprised to find my seals in my waistcoat-pocket, as my watch had been in my fob. I said it was a small silver watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not five minutes there - he said he did not know whether he had pawned his watch or lost it, and that he would have given any money rather than have given me in charge, if he had known his seals had been in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No; the officers were standing in a line, about eight yards apart - the pressure was so great that the gentleman could not hear me; he was carried away with the crowd - I was struck the very moment I caught hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say whether the prisoner himself struck you? A. He struck me several times, but not at that moment - he and I had a fight up as far as St. Martin's church.</p>

            . I was on duty, and saw Lancaster engaged with the prisoner and another; I went up, and Lancaster said, "Secure that hand, he has got some money in it" - I seized the prisoner's hand, which was then up, and found 8s. in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you off? A. Not two yards; I did not see the person who lost the purse, the confusion was so great, and we were so ill-used.</p>

The property belonged to me - I believe I have people here to prove it; there was 8s. 6d. in the purse, and I took it out to lend a young man sixpence- the Policeman took hold of it; I said, "You shall not have it;" he said he would - I said, "Mind, there is 8s. 6d."</p>

            . My husband is a broker. I have known the prisoner about twenty years; on the day the bridge was opened, I had seen him from about twelve o'clock to between six and half-past six - he then went out, and did not return; I know he had a dark red purse, with some silver, as he had been taking shillings and sixpences for allowing people to see the sight on the water.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You do not live with him? A. No; my husband is a furniture-broker - I went to Arundel-street, where the prisoner lives, to see the sight; the prisoner has been employed by my husband these three months, to carry furniture; I saw the purse in his hand that evening, and saw him put money into it - I have seen the purse before, but not to notice it; it is a silk purse.</p>

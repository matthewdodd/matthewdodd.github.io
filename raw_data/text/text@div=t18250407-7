I had sent in twelve chairs, two tables, a box of linen, and three silver spoons.

I slept at this house for the first time on the 15th of March, and between twelve and one o'clock I thought I heard somebody walking about the house; I listened, and heard a person coming up the attic stairs, without his shoes; I got out of bed, opened the window, and called the watchman, who came, and sprung his rattle; more watchmen came up, and while they were trying to break open the private door at the side of the house, I saw a man jump down from the fan-light over the shop door, and run away; the watchmen sprung their rattles, and pursued, but returned without him. I sent them to alarm Mr. Hewitt, who came. I had fastened the shop door the night before, but the space above was open, as the fan-light had not been put in. I let Mr. Hewitt and the watchmen in; we all went up stairs, looked round the front attic, and found the box of linen gone from there; it was there overnight: it was found at the bottom of the attic stairs, with three silver spoons on it, wrapped in a cloth; they were in the cupboard the night before, with a watch, which was found on the prisoner when he was taken: it belonged to Mrs. Winders, where Mr. Hewitt lodged; she had lent it to me. I am a widow. The linen still remained in the box.</p>

               <p>"What are you doing here?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am looking for a place to lay down;" I said,</p>

               <p>Court to Wood. How far did you pursue him? - Near a hundred yards; there was a lad with him, who was taken to the compter and who afterwards was proved before the alderman to be his brother, but the property not being found on him he was discharged.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

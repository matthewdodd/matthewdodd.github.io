On the 6th of December I let the prisoner my two-pair front room, furnished, at 6 s. a week. She said her husband was out of the way for debt, and she had 50 l. a year from the East India House. On the 16th of January, I found she had robbed her lodgings - she said she had been out a little way to pledge her bed-tick; that her 50 l. would be due next day, and she would pay me all - I had lent her 9 s. She went out again; I thought she was gone for good. I saw some feathers on my oil-cloth. I went up stairs, and found a candle on the landing-place, stuck in a bottle. I went out, and met her - I said I was ruined. She brought me back - I sent for an officer, who took her. I went up to the room, missed the bed, and every thing except the mattress and bedstead; she had taken the articles stated in the indictment. She said she had sold the feathers to Myers. I am a widow, with two children. She came to me by the name of Parsons - her real name is Wall.</p>

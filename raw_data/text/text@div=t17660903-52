On the 20th of July the prisoner asked me to lend him a pair of silver buckles; he had come with his master to lodge in the house but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030043"></xptr> on the Friday, and it was the Sunday after he wanted to borrow my buckles; I was busy below, and could not get up stairs for my buckles, which were in a box, so I gave him the key to go and fetch them, and about two o'clock I missed a crown piece out of the box; I did not tell any body of it till he came home, which was about nine; I called him into his master's room, and said, George, did you take a crown piece out of the box; no, said he; I said, if you have done it out of a joke, let me know and I will not tell any body; he said he did not take it; I said, if you will not tell, I'll let your master know; he said, so I might: on the Monday morning I told one of our men, and he told my master of it; my master called the prisoner into a room and asked him after it; he still denied it, till within about a quarter of an hour before his master came in, which was at half an hour after eleven; then he told my master he had taken it, and begged forgiveness; he said he had changed it at the other end of the town, and he would go and fetch it back: on the Tuesday about one o'clock, he asked me to get my master to lend him 5 s. to fetch it back; my master said if he wanted any money, to come and ask for it himself; he went and asked my master, and he lent him 5 s. he went out to fetch my crown piece, and did not come home again till the Thursday after; then he came and staid at the Mansion-house; a man stood there with him, and another man came with a letter to my master; the letter he said came from his mistress, for some shirts and things that were at our house; my master said, nothing shall go out of the house till the prisoner came himself; he did not come; a woman that washes for us saw him, she directed me; I went, and saw him and another man standing by the corner of the Mansion-house; he seeing me, ran away. On the Tuesday he sent a letter by two boys again; one of them said, we had better tell where he is; my master sent for a constable, and kept the biggest in the house, while the other went with the constable to St. Paul's Church-yard; they brought him to the Compter; he confessed to the taking my money, and he was taken the next day before Mr. Alderman Alsop, before whom he confessed the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gaul. The prosecutor is my servant. On the Monday one of my men said, he did not like this black boy, the prisoner; for that Davidson had missed a crown piece out of his box, and he was crying; I asked him the reason of it; he said he had lost a crown piece, and he was afraid of acquainting me with it; he said it was left him at his mother's death, and all she could leave him, and he had a particular regard for it; then I called down the black boy from his master's room; my boy challenged him with taking it; the Black said, do you talk so to me, how dare you; I said, if you have done it in a joke, return it; he answered, he had it not, and he that took it ought to be hanged; he was to learn to dress his master's hair of me, but he was very negligent; he stood it out till was it pretty late; I threatened to send him to the Compter; then he said, Mr. Gaul, I did take it, and changed it at Hyde-park-corner, and if you will forgive me, and not tell my master, I'll get it back tomorrow; the next morning he asked his master for some money, his master happened to have no change; then he asked my boy to ask me to lend him a crown to get it again; then he came himself; I said I could not trust him; he said, if I would believe him, as he was a Christian, I will bring the crown piece back; I lent him 5 s. he went away, and I did not see him for a week or nine days after; he kept sending false letters for me to deliver up his cloaths; after he found his master was gone to Scotland, he sent two boys; I threatened to send for a constable, then they told where he was; we took him in St. Paul's Churchyard; he was taken before Mr. Alderman Alsop, there he confessed the fact, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On a Sunday morning I asked the boy to lend me his buckles; he gave me the key; I took the buckles that lay in one corner; I never moved any thing; I brought him down the key and went out, and when I came home at night, he challenged me with a crown piece; he told his master, and his master told me of it; I said I knew nothing of it; his master said he would confine me; he charged the watch with me, and put me in bodily fear.</p>

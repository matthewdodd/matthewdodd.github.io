I will tell you my reason why I think he did not come by it honestly; he was a poor lad, and asked me if I would employ him; in consequence of his being very short of clothes, I told him, I should give him a little money for his pocket, and lay his wages out in clothes, till he was properly equipped out; the consequence was, I knew he had but a few shillings in pocketmoney, that led me to suspect him; he then fell upon his knees and confessed that

               <p>Court. Q. Did you take up Radford? - A. I did; on the Sunday, I had an officer, and took up Radford coming out of the Tower, and the constable brought him to my dwelling-house, in Tower-street, and I had them face to face, and he denied it all along.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you search his quarters? - A. I will inform you; he denied knowing any thing about the boy, then the boy informed me, that on the Saturday morning, he stole two notes out of this locker, and that they bought a key on Tower-hill, to fit the locker; I cannot inform you what Banknotes they were, because there were many in the locker, to the amount of between thirty and forty pounds; and he gave the lad one of them; when he found the lad made all those charges against him, he confessed, and I made him the same promises I did the lad, that I would shew him all the favour the law would allow me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you get the note from him? - A. He told me that his wife had got the note, and if I went to her, she would give it me; here is the note, it is five pounds; I know the note from the mark upon the back of it; (the note shewn to the Jury); there is a mark of 12l. upon it, an account of what I had received the day before; I was treasurer of the Inquest, and I put down that mark upon it; I have got no more than this five pound note and likewise a two pound note, which the boy left with a watch-maker.</p>

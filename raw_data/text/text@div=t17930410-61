               <p>I am a workman of Mr. Warner's. On the 8th of March about breakfast time, nine o'clock, the time of our going out to breakfast, I followed this man into Wine Office-court, and seeing him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100076"></xptr>turn about and lean against the place I suspected him, and from there I followed him into Fleet-lane to an old iron shop, and there I saw him take this metal and put it into the scale; I went into the shop immediately and laid hold of him and metal, and brought him to my master; he wanted to get from me; it is ridges of copper work; I know it to be my master's property; it was cut from a tea kettle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said at first it was cut off from a candlestick feet? - I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before we came out to breakfast there were five men working together, as close as we could; there was a woman out of doors who begged me to sell it for her; so by her persuasion I went to sell it for her, when I was talking to the woman in Fleet-market I see Mr. Stubbs, but had no notion he was looking after me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What part of the Strand. - A. Near Southampton street, and on the opposite side of the way; after walking some time, and feeling myself incommoded by this man, I looked at him once or twice; afterwards the witness

             told me that my pocket was picked.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing before to the prisoner in the Strand. - A. Not a word; when the witness told me that my pocket was picked, I put my hand into my pocket and missed a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your pocket. - A. Behind, similar to this, and part of my handkerchief was laying out, I had just put it in my pocket, I had been wiping my face, being very warm, just before I had seen him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290021"></xptr>I turned round and saw the prisoner running away, I immediately followed him, and I saw him throw the handkerchief from him in the street, by a cart; I got up to him, I accused him of stealing my handkerchief, he denied it, I immediately took him to Bow-street, he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the handkerchief. - A. The handkerchief was picked up by a boy, who gave it me; I know nothing of the boy, I have not seen him since; I saw the boy pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the handkerchief which you saw the boy pick up was the same handkerchief that you saw the prisoner throw on the ground. - A. To the best of my knowledge it was, I cannot swear to the handkerchief because there is no mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the same handkerchief that you saw the prisoner throw on the ground was the same that you saw the boy pick up. - A. Yes, the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, that is what I ask you; did you perceive the prisoner push against you at that side of your coat. - A. I felt him some few minutes before I missed my handkerchief treading on my heels, I thought it was by accident; the people passing and repassing, I thought he could not avoid it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the handkerchief. - A. The handkerchief was given to me, I kept it in my hand all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that handkerchief that was picked up. - A. It has been to be washed with others, I cannot pretend to say it is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How careless. - A. I did not know it was of any consequence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a new handkerchief, or had it been wore. - A. I had it some time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not sure the one you produce is the same. - A. No, I am not sure, because none of them that I have are marked; I did not know it was of consequence so I did not retain the particular one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all of the same age. - A. The handkerchiefs were all of the same age.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he ran before you over took him. - A. About fifteen or twenty paces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this handkerchief was an old one, you had it a long time, it would not fetch much if it was sold. - A. It would but fetch a trifle if it was sold.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the handkerchief into the side pocket of a new coat as they now make them, an handkerchief might easily fall out. - A. Certainly it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain that you had put it intirely in. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it might have fell, and this man might have picked it up. - A. I cannot say that he did not, the boy was just before me, stooping for the handkerchief, as I sprang to lay hold of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. However, it might have dropped down; if you had kept that handkerchief and looked at it now, you could not positively swear to the handkerchief - A. No, I could not, because I had no mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q. And the handkerchief I see is a very common one. - A. It is a very common one.</p>
               <p>JOHN JOHNSON sworn. Q. On the 7th of October were you in the Strand. - A. I cannot ascertain the day of the month, it was the day of Lord Percy's election; I was coming up the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) This was the day of the election. - A. Yes, the people was standing at the duke of Northumberland's house as I came by.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Johnson.) Whereabouts was you then. - A. I think I was nearly opposite Covent Garden, of the opposite side of the way, I saw this gentleman, Mr. Pritchard, walk very fast on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at that time. - A. I saw a person following Mr. Pritchard very closely.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person that was following Mr. Pritchard very closely. - A. He was a total stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him. - A. I cannot say it was the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the man that was afterwards taken to the public office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean, you say you saw a person following him very closely, was that the same person that was afterwards laid hold off - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself went to the public office, did you not go to give your evidence. - A. Yes, I gave my evidence there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see this person do, whoever he was, that was taken to the public office. - A. This person, or Mr. Pritchard, run against me, and hit me on the shoulder, I saw Mr. Pritchard pass on with the handkerchief hanging out in this manner (a corner hanging out), it was visible to every body; I had not got above three or four yards when I saw Mr. Pritchard's pocket empty; I saw a man huddling a handkerchief up in this manner. (witness describing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing at the time it was taken from the pocket. - A. I only saw the handkerchief out of the pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man with the handkerchief in his hand, did you not see him draw it out of his pocket. - A. I cannot pretend to say directly that I saw him take it out of Mr. Pritchard's pocket, I saw it not a foot from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see him take it from Mr. Pritchard's pocket. - A. I did not, I only saw it in his hand, and at that time there was no handkerchief hanging out of Mr. Pritchard's pocket, and directly after I saw the handkerchief in the man's hand, I informed Mr. Pritchard of it, I tapped him on the shoulder, sir, says I, you have had your pocket picked, the man after that turned back and ran off as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the man to Mr. Pritchard when you tapped him on the shoulder. - A. About a couple of yards, I passed the man to tell Mr. Pritchard, and in the mean time the man drew back, and endeavoured to make his escape; when I turned to see what became of the man, I pointed to Mr. Pritchard, and said there goes the man, Mr. Pritchard pursued him and laid hold of him; I did not see the handkerchief again till it was in Mr. Pritchard's hand; I accompanied Mr. Pritchard and the young man to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Was the man that you stopped the same man that the witness had pointed out to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290022"></xptr>you as having your handkerchief. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner. - A. That was the man, I never lost sight of him from the time he pointed him out to me till the time I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say who was the person that followed you so and trod on your heels. - A. I thought it was the same man, I cannot exactly say it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing more to say than I am a painter and glazier by trade; that on the day this affair took place I was so much intoxicated, in fact I cannot tell any thing what passed; I had been to work at six o'clock in the morning, I went home at eight o'clock in the morning to breakfast after getting some money of my master; I met a few friends, I got drinking till I got into the Strand, and whether I ran against this gentleman I do not know; as to the handkerchief being in my hand it was not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

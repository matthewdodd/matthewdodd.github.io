                  </hi> I lodged at Mr. Coombs'. On Saturday night. 18th March, I left the house at five minutes past nine o'clock—I locked the door, and tried it—I returned at twenty minutes past ten, and found the people who live in the back parlour standing at the door, and could not get in—I went next door and over the wall, and found the back door open, and all the doors in the house open—my own room door was also open—these trowsers are mine—I had seen them about nine o'clock, and missed them afterwards.</p>

On 18th March I lodged in Mr. Coombs' back parlour—I went out that about ten minutes to nine o'clock, and locked the door after me—Mrs. Coombs was then on the step, talking to a person—the street door, was open—I came back about half-past nine—I put the key in the door, and</p>

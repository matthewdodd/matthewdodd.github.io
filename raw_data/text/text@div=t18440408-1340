I return the bill, and beg to say it is my signature; I will take care it shall be provided for when due; I have been in business twenty years, and my father thirty years, and challenge any one to say either of our acceptances were ever returned. Messrs. Booth are my distillers, and for your satisfaction I refer you to them for my respectability; I trust you will then be satisfied, for when in town I was given to understand inquiries had already been made of two persons with whom I do business; I do not like so much inquiry about matters so trivial, and if I had not given Mr. Shoppee the bill, I would have made a different arrangement, paid cash, and taken a discount. <hi rend="smallCaps">G.

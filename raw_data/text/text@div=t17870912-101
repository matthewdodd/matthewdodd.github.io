               <p>Had she any thing when she came out? - She had her apron full of things.</p>
               <p>Did you see what the things were? - I saw nothing but the boots and the waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Could you see them in her apron, as she came out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you saw her? - I did not stop her till she had got almost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120163"></xptr>to the corner; then I run after her, and told her the things were my father's.</p>

               <p>What did she do with the things? - She said she had done nothing at all; she had them in her apron.</p>
               <p>What did you do with her? - I laid hold of her to bring her back, and Mr. Edmunds came up to assist me to bring her back.</p>

               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said, I was a cruel creature.</p>

               <p>I was going to Chelsea to see two children at nurse, and I was seized exceedingly ill; I had lately come out of a fit of illness; I went into the house, and there I saw a woman; I asked her if she would let me go backwards into the yard; I think she said she belonged to the house; she told me, yes; when I came back, she had a bundle in her lap, and she told me she was going to move to the next street; she asked me to assist her to take the things, which I agreed to, and she put them into my lap; I went as far as the door, and there I stopped a bit; the woman I missed; and while I was beating about for her, a child came up to me and stopped me; I was not off the threshold of the door, before I missed the woman; and immediately the child came up to me, and said, they were his daddy's boots; the woman gave them to me; she was a lusty, tall woman, with a light coloured gown, and a Bath cloak; the child brought me back, and called another gentleman; I believe, I do not know; I cannot say I recollect the gentleman; the child was at the door, and spoke to me, but I do not recollect the gentleman.</p>

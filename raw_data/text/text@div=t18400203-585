                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Dangerfield, and live in Queen-street, Pimlico. Between nine and ten o'clock on the morning of the 14th of January, the prisoner came to our shop for a halfpenny-worth of nails—I stooped to pick up a piece of paper to put the nails in, and during that time he must have gone to the centre of the window and took the knives—I did not see him take them, but when I went to him the knife which was tied outside the parcel dropped—he took it up, and said he was going</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030034"></xptr>
               <p>to give it to me—I had swept the shop just before, and know it was not there—I looked in the window, and found the place where they had been empty—in going to the station-house he threw the other knives into a dust-hole, and the policeman picked them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I picked them up on the floor, and before I could give them to you you gave me in charge. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—he picked up one, and I took it from him—he did not say any thing about having picked up the others—they were under his jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my brother-in-law, Mr. Sawyer, in Hoxton. On Saturday afternoon, the 10th of April, the prisoner and another man came for a pint of ale—I served them—they gave me a shilling—I put it into the till, gave them change, and was going to leave them, when they called for the paper—there were several shillings in the till at that time—I cannot say how many—I did not go to the till again—I heard my sister say, "What do you do behind the till?"—the prisoner said, "I was merely going for the paper."</p>

I was looking in through the prosecutor's window to see what the time was—I was the prisoner there—another man took a paper, and put it up before his eyes—the prisoner asked if it was all right—the other man said, "Yes"—the prisoner went and opened the till, took the money out, and shut it again—Mr. Sawyer asked what he wanted there—he said he had been for the paper—the prisoner and the other man then went off—I am sure the prisoner opened the till and took the money.</p>

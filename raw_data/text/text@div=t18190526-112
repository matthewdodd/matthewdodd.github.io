            . I am a constable of St. John's. On the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in company with the landlord of a public-house, talking at the door, the prisoner, Miller, passed us with a bag at his back - I followed and asked him what he had got in the bag? he replied it was his own property. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is lead, where did you get it from?" he made no answer. I collared him; he dropped the bag on my toes, and got away for about five minutes, I then secured him, took him into the public-house, and asked him how he came by it? he said a man gave him 1 s. to carry it to Dartmouth-street. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken it from Mr. Hodges's house, for I saw it put on this very day." I left him in charge, went to Mr. Hodges's house, and found the lead gone. I had seen the two prisoners together between six and seven o'clock that night. A man was with Miller when I stopped him.</p>

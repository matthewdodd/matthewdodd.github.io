            . The Prisoner was destitute of a place, and I employed her as a chairwoman, out of compassion, till she could get a better place. She was with us about three weeks. On the 23d of February she came between six and seven o'clock in the morning, in order to light the fire. I said who is that, Betty? She said yes, Madam. I asked her what o'clock it was, and she said between 6 and 7. I was in bed on the same floor, and gave her the key of the bed room for her to come into the dining room. - She could not get into the dining room without coming into the bed room; and she took that opportunity to rob me of these things. - Most of the things were in a chest of drawers, the spoons and some other things were lying in the room. I arose between eight and nine and went into the dining room, and found all these things missing, and that she was gone. I went to a neighbour to acquaint him with it, and he advised me to advertise it. The next day I put out an advertisement with two guineas reward, and the Monday following she was apprehended by a man in St. Martin's-lane by Charing-cross. My petticoat, shift, stockings, gown, cloak and bonnet, were taken from her by the Constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the rest of the things?</p>
               <p>Brooks. She was so good as to tell me where they were pawned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you give me these things to pawn?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I deny it, I never gave you any leave to do it; if I had, I would not have made any noise about it.</p>

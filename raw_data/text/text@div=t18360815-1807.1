In consequence of what I heard I went to No.2, Bull's Head-court, Fenchurch-street, I knocked at a room on the second floor of the house—the prisoner opened the door, I walked in and her mother was sitting with the child on her lap, washing it—the prisoner called her, mother—the woman lifted up the head of the child, and I said, "That is not your child"—she said, "It is my daughter's child"—the prisoner was present—I then turned to the prisoner, and said, "It is not your child, I know the dis<lb></lb>tressed parents of it, I live nearly opposite them"—the prisoner said, "It is my child, and I have got twins, and this is one, the other is a boy"—I then said it was not hers, and I would have a policeman—her mother said "If you say it is not my daughter's child I will knock you down"—in the court of a minute or two there were two or three persons came up from below stairs—they still persisted that it was the prisoner's child—I said I would not leave the room—the prisoner turned to her aunt who went with me to show me the place, and said to her "Aunty Mary, you have done this," the</p>

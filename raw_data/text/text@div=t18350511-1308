                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Chequer-place, Whitecross-street. On the 15th of May, I sent my son John to Mr. Whistler, in Shoe-lane; he was carrying two pairs of new shoes, and two pairs of old ones, which I had had to repair—it was after one o'clock when I sent him—the shoes are quite lost.</p>

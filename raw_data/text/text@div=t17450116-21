I had been at Mr. Crawford's in the Park at Southwark, and bought them there, and as I was going home, I fell down over some rubbish in Wild Street, and was very dirty. I went into a publick house, one Mrs. Murphy's, the corner of Colson's Court in Drury Lane, got some water, and washed myself, and the Prisoner [who was her maid] washed my apron, and I gave Mrs. Murphy three half peace to give her maid. Mrs. Murphy, another, the Prisoner, and I, had two pints of hot with a little gin. Between nine and ten o'clock I went away, and Mrs. Murphy insisted upon the Prisoner's going home with me?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your going into Mrs. Murphy's?</p>
               <p>Quin. Nothing; but only I had met with a man by Fleet Ditch who had frightened me, and I was under an apprehension that he would follow me home, and rob me, because he told me I had got tea, and that he might come in and search my house.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was Mrs. Murphy's maid to go home with you?</p>
               <p>Quin. Because Mrs. Murphy would have her. She would have gone quite home with me, but I would not let her, because I did not like her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bundle tumble from you, or did she take it from you?</p>
               <p>Quin. She took it from me. I struggled with her to keep it, and my nose was bloody in the struggling.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out?</p>
               <p>Quin. I went out about 11, and staid in the Borough till between 5 and 6.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink all that time?</p>
               <p>Quin. Only one pint of beer in the Borough. I drank no where else. When I came home I told my daughter I had been robbed. She went to Mrs. Murphys and asked if her maid was come home; she said, no. My daughter told her she had robbed me. Mrs. Murphy said, then she should be ruined, and her house indicted. The next day Mrs. Donelly delivered my daughter the gowns, the pillowbear, and the boy's shirt, which the prisoner had left with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you as you went along?</p>
               <p>Quin. She said, d - n the woman, why does not she go home - I can't tell why she d - d me, or why she wanted to go home with me, unless it was to take the things from me when I got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she offer to do you any harm when you was down?</p>
               <p>Quin. I can't say she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very innocent of the matter; she was so much in liquor that she could not stand.</p>
               <p>Quin. It was no such thing. I was as sober as I am now.</p>

She had a bundle, and I saw a shirt with ruffles hanging out. She said she was married, and those were her husband's things. Said I, Where is your husband ? she said, he was just by. I asked the man if he was her husband, he said, he never saw her in his life before. I met one of her companions, who said, Fanny, you will certainly be hanged if you don't tell the watchman the truth. She was very drunk indeed.

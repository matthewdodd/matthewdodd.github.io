My wife and I went into Smithfield on the 31st of July, about three in the afternoon, and returned home at half after ten at night. When I went out I double locked the door; on my return I found it on the spring; I borrowed a candle of my next door neighbour, and went up stairs; I found my first room door broke open; I had the key in my pocket; I came down; the watch was going by; I brought him in, and we all went up stairs together; I found my book-desk and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070046"></xptr> the drawers broke open, and the books and drawers left about the room; we went up two pair of stairs; there I found my chest of drawers broke open; the locks of the drawers were broke open, and the drawers broke almost to pieces, and my clothes taken out. On the Monday following, I was told by a young man, that the Kentish Drover, in Long-lane, Smithfield, was a likely place to find my things as, and advised me to search there; I went to my Lord Mayor next morning, and got a warrant to search the prisoner's house; in the one pair of stairs room I found two silk handkerchiefs, an India callico handkerchief, a white linen handkerchief, a worked muslin apron, and a callico apron; I asked them how they came by them; Mr. Pullen said he did not know any thing about them further than that the callico handkerchief was given to him; we found them in two different drawers, and some among the soul linen; we took the woman before my Lord Mayor; she denied some time knowing any thing about them; afterwards she said they were left there by one Jack, she did not know his other name, for two shillings. The prisoner keeps the Kentish Drover. (The goods were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

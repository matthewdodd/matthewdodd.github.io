            . My husband keeps the Pitt's Head, in Brunswick-mews, near Bryanstone-square. The prisoner came to our house on Tuesday, the 27th of September, and brought two of these books; he asked me to have the kindness to take care of them, and he would call for them when he left work - on the following afternoon he brought two more, and said, "If you will have the goodness to take care of them I will call for the four when I leave work;" I sent my servant to watch where he went to, and he went to the prosecutor's, in Berkeley-street - the prisoner came about six o'clock in the evening, for the four books; I said I could not let him have them, as I had put them into a drawer in the bar, and my husband had taken the key and gone out; he said he was sorry, as he wanted them to read; I sent to the prosecutor to know if any books were missing, and I gave the same books to the officer.</p>

On the 26th of October I fastened up their hop-warehouse, which has a double door, a bolt at the top and bottom, and a lock. On the 27th I went and found the doors pulled too, but they had been broken open, and some bags of hops had been removed - upon examination, six bags were missing; I gave information to the Police; they were taken entirely away out of the warehouse, and an old padlock was left behind, which did not belong to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BACK. I belong to the brewery. Danbrook came to me on the 27th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning; I went to Bell-lane store-house, and missed three bags from the right-hand side, and three from the left, immediately on getting in at the door - I had been there on the 24th, and all was safe then; on the 9th of November, I was sent for, and saw Mr. Willis and a constable - Mr. Willis had a sample of hops, which I compared with the hops which had been used that morning, and they corresponded exactly - I know Farren, and I told Willis to agree with Crouchman for the hops - on the 11th of November, I was at the corner of Wynyatt-street, and saw three bags of one mark, which were stolen, and one bag of another mark, which was stolen, in a cart, which was coming down the street, with Crouchman and Willis in it; they were delivered at a private brew-house, belonging to Mr. Farren's brother - these four bags were part of the property which was taken; I can swear they were part of the property of Messrs. Hanbury and Co.; Crouchman was then taken into custody - they were hops of two different growths,</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crouchman. There might be some hundreds of bags of that growth, which Hanbury's did not buy. Witness. There were one hundred and sixty bags of the mark of Selby, and they bought the whole of that growth.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 27th of October, I was walking adjoining Hanbury's brew-house, as I went along Bell-lane in the morning: it struck six o'clock - I saw a van standing at Hanbury's warehouse door, and a man in the van, pressing down the fourth bag of hops; the morning being so dark I could not swear to the man - he was dressed in a dark brown dress; I cannot say Crouchman is the man - he has not the same dress on now, but by his size he appears to me to be the same person; I staid there a little while.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you say at the office? A. I said I believed that was the man - he appeared to me to be the same sized person; that was five days after I had seen him - I believed he was the person then, and I believe so now.</p>

               <p>ROBERT CRANE. I live in Dorsett-street. On the morning of the 27th of October I was in Bell-lane and saw a van loaded with hops, and drawn with one horse -I could not see what horse it was; there were two men with it - each had fustian coats on; it was going from the place where the hops had been towards Spitalfields-market.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAYES. I am a watchman, and live in Cow-alley. On the morning of Tuesday, the 27th of October, I was in Aldersgate-street, about half-past six o'clock; I saw the prisoner Crouchman driving a van - I had seen him before, and have no doubt he is the man; there were six bags in it - I suppose that is three quarters or a mile from Hanbury's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIS. I know Crouchman - I met him in Old-street, and went with him to the Rum Puncheon, where we stopped an hour or more; he said, "I want to speak to you: I have got four bags of hops to sell, can you get me a customer for them?" I said I could not - he called me out again afterwards and I said, "I can't tell whether I can get you a customer or not" - he said, "If you will meet me at the Cock, at the corner of Golden-lane, I will bring you a sample;" I bade him good day, and did not see him again till the Wednesday morning, when he came to my house - I asked him if he had got rid of the hops: he said No - he wished I had got a customer for him; I said I had got one - by the customer I meant Mr. Farren, whom I had before agreed with; Crouchman came to my house afterwards, and we went to Mr. Farren's who agreed about the hops - I saw the hops in the place where they were deposited; I was to deliver the hops - I took the sample of hops to the prosecutor's - Crouchman carted the hops to Farren's from a place in Goswell-street-road, which I believe to belong to Crouchman; I helped to load them - when we got to Exmouth-street we were taken into custody by the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes, with the four bags of hops which were in the cart - I did not know, till the 11th of November, that the hops had been stolen, when Crouchman told me whose they were.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did he say from whom he got them? A. He said he got them from Trueman and Hanbury's; that he had sold two bags, and had only four left - he said afterwards where he had sold the other two.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140032"></xptr>HANNAH WILLIS. I am the wife of the last witness. On the morning of the 9th of November I found, in my husband's pocket, a brown paper parcel of hops, and on the 11th Crouchman breakfasted with us, between seven and eight o'clock - he inquired of my husband who Mr. Farren was whom he had recommended to buy the hops, and he went out with my husband; they returned, breakfast was ready, and they breakfasted - when my husband was gone out Crouchman said, "I suppose your husband has told you about the hops?" I said I had heard a little about it - the prisoner said, "It is a troublesome concern, I wish I was rid of them;" he said that he and another man took them from Hanbury's - I gave information.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crouchman. I leave it in the hands of the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

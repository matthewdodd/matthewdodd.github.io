I was hawking brooms on Saturday, the 3rd of June, at New Cross, about a mile from Camberwell, about a quarter-past five o'clock, and saw the prisoner with a cart-horse—I asked him if he wished to sell it—he said "Yes"—I asked where he brought the horse from—he said, from Mr. Sewell's, of Beckenham—I asked his own name—he said, "Thomas Beck," which I wrote down—he asked 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the horse—I agreed to give him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I paid him in two half-sovereigns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence—I sold it to Geddens the same afternoon—I am sure he said he brought it to sell for Sewell of Beckenham.</p>

            . I am cooper to Mess. Mason and Co. I was at Mr. Clark's, in order to search, and found some butt staves with our mark upon them [produced in court]; I found some staves, where it plainly appeared the marks had been cut out; I also saw whole butts with the marks cut out: On his cross examination, he said, he had known brewer's butts sold by auction, when a person had left off trade; but then it was not usual to cut the old marks out; that he never knew his masters to sell casks; that he remembered two being missing at the Robin-hood, in Charles-street, and that they had Mr. Mason's mark on them.</p>

               <p>I never went with a dray in my life.</p>
               <p>Clark's Defence.</p>
               <p>I deny the whole: I never lent my dray to Hester in my life; and as to these butts I know nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176209170033"></xptr> of them; I never saw Everitt in my yard in my life: In Mr. Cousemaker's sale I bought a lot of butts; he sold his butts into a great many peoples hands, with marks upon them: when I sent mine out, I told my servants, when the butts came home to take the marks out, and put my own on. I changed my marks in general: last summer I bought upwards of 130 butts, and changed all the marks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. I am a brewer: It never is the way in the trade when butts are bought at a sale, to take out the old marks; we put new marks on, and let the old ones abide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gyfford said the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cox. Was you at Mr. Cousemaker's sale?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner Clark bought any butts there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him there?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. One day when I was there, I saw him walk through the yard; I don't know that he came on any particular business.</p>

            . I am stoaker to Mr. Clark; I saw the drays go for the butts that were bought at Cousemaker's sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks were upon them?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks taken out of them?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I can't say any of the marks were cut out of them.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Everitt and Mr. Clark together?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I cannot give an answer to that; I don't know whether I have or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many butts have you taken marks out of?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I took none out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hester take any out?</p>
               <p>Hacket. Yes, I saw him; it was before he was discharged from Mr. Clark's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Hester bring casks into Mr. Clark's yard?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I have; he did one morning about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Clark letting him have his dray?</p>
               <p>Hacket. No; I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Hester live servant with Mr. Clark?</p>
               <p>Hacket. About four months ago, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you servant to Mr. Clark all the time Hester was?</p>
               <p>Hacket. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Hester take out marks?</p>
               <p>Hacket. Never but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was that before or after he left your master's service?</p>
               <p>Hacket. That was after, I believe.</p>

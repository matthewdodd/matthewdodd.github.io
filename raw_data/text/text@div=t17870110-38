               <p>How much of the window was broke? - The window had been broke several times and the piece was fastened in with lead; I heard no noise, and there was no noise in the street; the street was as quiet as the Court is now; I only found that one waistcoat; I am sure it is mine; it was one of these four that were in the window; there is my mark upon it; the prisoner is the man that Newman brought in; he has been in custody ever since.</p>

               <p>On Saturday last, about half past five, just as I came to the corner of Barbican, I saw the prisoner and another coming running by me very quick; they crossed over to Redcross-street; I then turned back again, and went down Redcross-street, and they ran down Redcross-street about twenty yards, and crossed over the way to the alley, called Paul's-alley, and the other got to the corner of the highway; I pursued this prisoner up the alley, and the other ran away directly, and never went up the alley; I overtook the prisoner in the alley; he appeared to have something under his jacket; he had a jacket on; I asked him what he had got; and as I laid hold of him this fell from the side of him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see it fall from him? - No, I did not; it was down between him and me in a minute.</p>
               <p>Had it been there before? - No, I am positive sure it was not there before: it was dirty, and fell down between his shoes and mine; it is a waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to say with certainty that that fell from him? - I cannot say any further than as we were both together this lay between us, and I observed something under his jacket when I caught him by the collar; there was nobody else in the alley as I could see.</p>

               <p>You saw nothing of them before what you have mentioned? - Nothing else; I searched the prisoner, nothing else was found upon him.</p>
               <p>No keys nor any thing of that sort? - No.</p>
               <p>Any knife? - No.</p>
               <p>Any chissel? - No.</p>
               <p>No instrument found upon him with which he could have taken out this piece of glass? - No.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was it? - Half past five.</p>
               <p>Was daylight entirely gone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no further to say, than this: on Saturday evening, I came from the house where I lived, I was going to the Nag's-head, in Aldersgate-street, to call for some money, and running to make the best of my way there, this gentleman laid hold of my collar; says he, what have you there? I said, nothing my good man; my waistcoat flew open as he laid hold of me; I had a white waistcoat under my red one.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

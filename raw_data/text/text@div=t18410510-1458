                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Watts, of Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square. On the 24th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into our shop together, and asked to look at some artificial flowers in the window—the woman spoke—I showed them to her—she chose three of them—I put them into paper and gave them to her—she told the male prisoner to pay for them—he said he had no change, could I change a sovereign?—I said, "Yes, Sir," and the female walked out of the shop with the flowers—I put 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the counter, and said I had not sufficient change, and must trouble him to send for change—he immediately put a farthing down instead of a sovereign, and in<lb></lb>stantly took up the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said, "Never mind, I will call to<lb></lb>morrow," and ran out of the shop—it was all done instantly—I detected my mistake, and when Mr. Watts came in, he went and gave information to the police—I took up the farthing, supposing it to be a sovereign, but the prisoner was gone—my husband came home in a quarter of an hour—I saw the prisoners at the station on the 7th of May—I had never seen them before the 24th of April—the male prisoner was shown to me at the station, and I saw the female next morning, pass the shop with a policeman—I am certain the prisoners are the persons—I know them both by their general appearance—when I saw the male prisoner at the station, I said, "You are the man that came to the shop and gave me a farthing for a sovereign"—he ap<lb></lb>peared not to understand me—he made some answer in French—I gave the farthing to the policeman—the male prisoner had a cloak on at the shop.</p>

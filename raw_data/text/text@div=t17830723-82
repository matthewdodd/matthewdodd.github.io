            ; and the prisoner in his defence goes so far as to say, that he gave him a shove: It is also in evidence, that the other man run away with the money: The sum, Gentlemen, to be sure is trifling, but then the man is poor, from whom that sum is taken, and he is to be protected in his property, as well as people in a superior station: If you think that these two men were in one common design, to do this poor man an injury, and to take away his property, the act of the one, in the construction of law, is the act of the other, and it is not extremely material which gave the man the shove, or which took up the money. Gentlemen, at the same time, that it may be right to discountenance a proceeding of this kind, especially in a man, who, from his own witnesses, cannot give any very good account of himself, and who appears to be a man of a very indifferent character; yet considering the sum taken, the manner of taking it, and that there was no very great violence offered to the man, perhaps it may let in a discretion, which in point of humanity, the law has permitted you to exercise, that is, to acquit the prisoner of the robbery, and find him guilty of the larceny, or it is in your discretion to acquit him generally, as you think the nature of the case in point of example requires.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I had no more intent to hurt the man, any more than I had to hurt you; I am only my own enemy and nobody else's, they speak against me from the market, because I will not work for them at under price, and I will not do it.</p>

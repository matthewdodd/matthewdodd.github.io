               <p>Q. What is the tankard worth?</p>
               <p>Watts. I have valued it at ten pounds, and it cost me 11 l. 7 s. last September.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>Watts. No.</p>

               <p>Q. to Watts. Is that lid yours?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find that lid?</p>
               <p>Watts. It was in the hands of Mr. Scriven, and I had it of him.</p>

               <p>Scriven. On Saturday was sev'nnight, between eleven and twelve, the Prisoner came to my mistres's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it noon or night?</p>
               <p>Scriven. It was night,</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your mistress?</p>
               <p>Scriven. I live with Mrs. Harvey, a pawnbroker in Houndsditch. I had a pretty many customers in the shop when the Prisoner came in, and after they were gone out, he said he wanted to ask me a question; I said, what is it? he asked me whether I bought plate, and I said I did not, unless I knew the person; he shewed me this lid, and I asked what he would have for it, and he asked ten shillings for it; I said, I believed it was stole; he asked me, whether I thought he stole it, and began to make words; I said I would stop it, and advertise it, and I did not doubt but I should find an owner; and I told him, if he would tell me his name, an d place of abode, I would return it him, if it was not owned, and he told me where he lived, but I found it was advertised in the paper: I went to Mr. Watts's with it, and he owned it to be the lid of his tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the right place of his abode?</p>
               <p>Scriven. He told me pretty near it, it was in the next street. Mr. Watts sent for the silversmith he bought it of, and he said it was the lid of the tankard he sold Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Scriven, that I found the lid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body by when you found it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a person by, but I don't know where to find him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you draw any in this tankard for the Prisoner, that night the tankard was lost?</p>
               <p>Rylance. I drew two tankards for him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What in this tankard, that was missing afterwards?</p>
               <p>Rylance. Yes, and, to the best of my knowledge, this is the same lid. The Prisoner went into the fields with us, under pretence of shewing us where the body of the tankard was; he said, if he had his hands loose, he would tell us where it was.</p>

               <p>Rylance. Islington-Fields, by the ditches upon a dunghill.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he own the taking of the tankard?</p>
               <p>Rylance. He owned he had it, but he would not own he took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not own it, for I could never own what I never had; and they kicked me, and beat me about, and used me very ill; they promised me money, half guineas, and two guineas, if I would tell them where it was; and I was willing to accept of it, because I was poor, and wanted money, and I pretended to tell them where it was, but I could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the top of the tankard?</p>
               <p>Wilks. It is the very same that I sold to Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of the tankard be, that you sold to him?</p>
               <p>Wilks. He gave me eleven pounds seven shillings for it. When the Prisoner was taken, he said, if we would let him, he would go with us, and shew us where he had hid the tankard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not tell you so.</p>
               <p>Wilks. You did tell us so. I will go further yet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You may go as far as you please.</p>
               <p>Wilks. I can go a little further yet. We went with him into the fields, and went on the backside of Islington two or three times; and he told us one place, then another, and we tried to find it, but could not, and then we brought him back before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice?</p>
               <p>Wilks. Justice Hole; and then he said where he had hid it, and insisted upon that to be the place, but they did not let him go; and there was a letter sent to Mr. White about it, and yesterday, in Newgate, he said he could tell where he had hid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to call?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have several here, but they are not come; my wife is here, and I believe she can call them. I have been a master of my business nineteen years, and never was before a Judge in my life before. I was very drunk that night, and I am sometimes mad and lunatick.</p>

               <p>Harding. My Lord, I know that the Prisoner has been deemed a lunatick person.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he deemed so?</p>
               <p>Harding. In the year 1745, when I served the office of churchwarden in Whitechapel Parish, and where he then lived, and I confined him to a mad-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he lunatick at the time he stole this tankard?</p>
               <p>Harding. I cannot tell that, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to let him abroad?</p>
               <p>Harding. I suppose they did not think him so then; he was better for some time, but he was confined again afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that?</p>
               <p>Harding. Yes, my Lord, he has been confined in Bethlem, as I have been informed. I knew him a great many years before that, and never knew but what he bore a very good character.</p>

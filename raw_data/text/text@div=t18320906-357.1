            .

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not Burnell tell you that he had taken these things to Worms' at different times? A. No; he said he had sold him the property, but he did not say when - I was not with Waddington when he took Burnell, but I joined him before he locked him up, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's, and about three minutes walk from Worms' - he was passing by a turning which led to Worms', but not coming from there - it was about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

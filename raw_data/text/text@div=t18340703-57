               <p>EDWARD WESTRUP. I live at Stratford, in Essex. On the 30th of May, in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18340703-57-crimeloc313">Smithfield-market</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What mark is on it which you can swear to? A. A W. - I marked it since it was picked up, but I knew it - I had used it a short time, and knew the pattern and colour - I have others the same - I have not the least doubt of it - I knew it when I gave him into custody - I swear I saw the prisoner drop it - I took hold of him instantly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, "You have picked my pocket, you young scoundrel," and the policeman told him to mark it that he might know it. Witness. I am sure I saw him drop it - I saw it in motion - I did not see it in his hand - part of it might be on the ground - it fell between him and me - I should think it impossible to fall from any body else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you try to get hold of the other, and say, "You young scoundrel, if I had you I would make you pay for all?" Witness. I did not say so - I think it impossible any body could drop it but him - there was no one directly behind but him - it was dropped right behind me - there was a lad within about a couple of yards of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030035"></xptr>the prisoner - it was dropped in front of the prisoner, and there was nobody in front of him - I think it is impossible any body could have dropped it but him - he was as close behind me as possible - I saw the handkerchief going in a direction from him to the ground - no one else could drop it, I am certain - I am certain it came from his hand - I saw it in motion before it was on the ground, between him and me - nobody else was near enough to drop it - I am certain it came from the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was any body by you and me when you accused me? - were not people stopping for a horse and cart to go along? - I was walking along. A. He was standing still.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a shop next door to the Crown and Anchor, St. Pancras. The leads of my house and the public-house join, and are only divided by an iron railing—I was serving in my shop on the 5th of September, about half-past eight o'clock, and heard Hardman calling me—I ran up stairs—when I got on the landing, opposite the door that leads to the leads, she spoke to me—I ran on to the leads, and while getting over the iron railing I heard a cry, "Master, master I have got a thief"—I ran in, and several soldiers said, "That is the thief"—I took the prisoner by the collar, and he dropped a child's whistle on the stairs, which I picked up—it is mine—this gown was seen in his posses<lb></lb>sion by the waiter—it is my wife's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Perry. I went up stairs that night—I heard a noise in the room as I opened the door—the table was against it—I peeped in, and saw a foot going out of the windows—I called my master—I saw nothing of the gown—I know it is my mistress's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Warner, and am sister to the prisoner Allen. My husband is at sea—he is a carpenter in the merchant service—I live at No. 3, Camomile-terrace, Water-lane—Allen lives at my father's house when he comes from sea—he is the son of Wil<lb></lb>liam Henry Allen—I also occupy a room in my father's house—my brother was in the house until Tuesday, the 3rd of February—on Thurs<lb></lb>day afternoon, the 5th of February, I went out—I secured the street door before I left, leaving nobody in the house—the back door was fastened with two bolts—I had locked my drawers—my room door was locked, and the key left in it—I left home about three o'clock—I returned between four and five o'clock, and found the front door fast as I had left it—the back door was open a little way—I missed some things from a cupboard—I went to my own room, and found the keys in the top drawer—one drawer was open—I missed a silk handkerchief, two silver tea-spoons, a cornelian heart, and breast-pin from the drawer, and the duplicate of a coat—they were safe in the drawer when I left the house, for what I know—they were there on Tuesday night—I had not seen them since—I had no reason to suppose my drawers had been disturbed before—the handkerchief was a very bright colour, a belcher—my brother had no such handkerchief when he left the house—the handkerchief belongs to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Williams, of Duns'-court, Homerton. He is a labourer—on Thursday afternoon, the 5th of February, I was at work near Mr. Allen's house—about half-past four o'clock, I was carrying mould for my master into his garden, at the back of the house immediately adjoining Allen's—I saw Allen get over the back wall, and by a wall which parts the two houses, he got on the privy, and in at the back window of his father's house—he came to the front window with a knife and fork in his hand—he opened the window and let the other prisoner in—I saw them enter the house—I saw nothing more—Southgate was standing by the door—when he let him in through the window it was shut down again.</p>

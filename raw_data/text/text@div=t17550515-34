               <p>Q. Did she own she had taken the things away?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. She did, and had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you miss?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. I missed a quilt, two blankets, a pair of sheets, two copper saucepans, and lids to them, a looking-glass, a copper tea-kettle, a pewter tea-pot, a brass candlestick, two flat irons, a pail, a frying-pan, and several other things more than are mentioned in the indictment. I went and got a constable, and took her before a justice, there she confessed where the things were pawned, some at one place and some at another. We went and found the quilt and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150032"></xptr> two sheets, a blanket, one copper saucepan, and the copper tea-kettle, at Mrs. Hill's. We never could find the looking-glass. We went to Mrs. Kennet's the prisoner said she pawned the saucepan there; but we could not find it there. About a week after, Mrs. Hill went by our desire there, and asked for a saucepan in the name of the prisoner, and Mrs. Kennet gave her the saucepan, and said it was pawned for six-pence, and took seven-pence for it. The prisoner said she had pawned other things at Mr. Wood's; we went there, but could not find them; but Mrs. Hill went there, and she got them.</p>

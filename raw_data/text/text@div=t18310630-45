Bank of England notes, and, I believe, seventeen or eighteen shillings in change, but I had taken five shillings from it before I counted it, to give to the person who brought it to me - the prisoner is one of the person who were behind me in a state of some confusion when I turned round; the other ran by me towards Soho-square, and the prisoner towards the Haymarket - I followed the prisoner in preference, from a particular circumstance, and cried Stop thief! - while I was running a person called, "Here is your purse;" I, supposing it was the prisoner's confederate, continued to pursue him, till the purse was delivered to me - I then gave up the pursuit and lost sight of the prisoner - I went into Mr. Hamlet's shop, and was brushing myself, when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300044"></xptr>officer came in and took me to an office, where I saw the prisoner; this was in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I believe it is called Mr. Baker's office; I had been purchasing some goods in a shop near Regent-street, in Piccadilly - I there put my purse into my pocket and walked on to Princes-street - when I turned the second time in Princes-street, I saw a sort of shuffling between the prisoner and the other man's hands; I pursued the prisoner from this circumstance - while I was speaking to my mother's coachman, at the shop door in Piccadilly, a person passed by me very close, who I at first thought was the servant, but seeing he was not, I did not notice him particularly, but when I turned in Princes-street, the impression on my mind was, that the prisoner was that person, which was my reason for pursuing him: the first time I turned in Princes-street, they both stopped when I did; I then felt my pocket, and turned again - they separated, commenced running, and I followed the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you swear positively to the prisoner at the office? A. Yes, as positively as I could - I spoke with a perfect conviction that he was the person; I think that was taken down, and I signed it - but I am really so unused to these things, that I do not know; the impression on my mind is, that I did sign it - I think I did, but I do not wish to swear to any thing I am not certain of; what I swore was read over to me; but I am in some confusion, as I went to two offices - what was read to me was at Marlborough-street, but I think what I signed was at the other office - my only doubt is at which office; I am positive the deposition was read over to me, and that I signed it, and in that I identified the prisoner - I believe that was taken down; I have evidence that it was taken - it appeared to me that that was what I had stated; all that I stated was correet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure that you stated at the office that you believed the prisoner to be the person who brushed by you? A.When I went into the office the prisoner came up with great violence, and said, "Do you mean to say it was me?" I said, "Stop, stop! this room is dark, let me see you in the light;" he was then taken out into the light, and I said, unhesitatingly, "That is the man I pursued," and I had a vague impression that he was the person who brushed by me.</p>

            . I am a servant; I did live in Poland-street. I was in company with Thomas Lee on the 30th of May - I saw the prisoner running down Princes-street, and the prosecutor pursuing him; I saw the prisoner throw something into a gig, which was standing in the street, opposite Mr. Hamlet's door - I went to the gig, and found on the rug a purse, which I gave to Mr. Hyndman, in the same state as I found it; the prisoner was pursued some distance further, and was then taken - I am quite clear he threw something into the gig, and I found nothing in it but the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner stop to throw the purse into the gig? A. No, Sir - I am quite sure I did not throw it there myself; I was not about to leave town - I never stated so; I was not going to Scotland or Liverpool- I lived as servant with a Mr. Wallis two years ago; I have since then been in the Police for about six months - they would not keep me any longer; I was too found of drink, that was the only reason - no thieves got off through me; the commissioners did not charge me with that - I had been drunk once or twice; I was reported once or twice - I cannot say how often I had been drunk; the prisoner told me where his father and mother lived, and I went to them - I dined and drank tea with them; I did not coax them out of any cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Be careful, I have witnesses here, I tell you? A. I did get 1 1/2d., but not from them; it was on the table - the prisoner's wife told me to take it up - she wanted to speak to me, and told me to come to her down Holborn; I said I would go home, and get shaved - she said, "There is 1 1/2d., take it and go and get shaved;" I did not, at the dinner, or tea, or in the conversation with the prisoner's wife, say that the witness Lee had false-sworn himself from beginning to end, nor anything of the kind - there were persons at dinner and tea with us; the dinner was then ready, and I took some - I drank some beer and some gin; Lee was in the Police, but he has resigned of his own accord - he told me so; after I gave the prosecutor his purse, he gave me 5s. - I did not ask him for money.</p>
               <p>MR. HYNDMAN. He did not ask me for any money at the time he gave me the purse, but he afterwards called at my house, and said he wished to see me particularly - I met him afterwards in London; he said he wished to go out of town, and if he was obliged to go who would pay his expences.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEE. I am a porter at present - I have been in the Police, but left it on the 21st of March. On the 30th of May I was near Mr. Hamlet's shop: I saw the prisoner running down the street, in front of the mob - he went up to an empty gig, and threw something into it; he was running - he inclined to the left, and threw something into the gig; Mr. Hyndman was in pursuit of him at the time; Bean and I went up to the gig - Bean took the purse out in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Whose porter are you? A. Mr. Downing's, the floor-cloth manufacturer, in King's-road, Chelsea - I have been there a fortnight; I was out of employ when this happened, and had been so nearly three months - I formerly belonged to the Life Guards, and I have a pension of 6d. a day - I had drawn my quarter's pension just before this happened; I was in the Police ten months, but I had bad health - I do not know that there was any complaint made against me; there might be some frivolous things, such as being too late - there was a complaint made against me; I forget whether I was put on my defence before the commissioners - I cannot recollect what the complaint was; I will not swear there were not two complaints against me - I was only once before the commissioners; it was for quarrelling with an officer - I went to see the prisoner in Tothil-fields prison, by the request of his wife, as he was very ill and low - I do not know what I was to do; I did not ask him for money, but he offered me money to go out of the way - he said he would give me as much as I liked; I never said before any body that I would do my best to convict him - I went to the prisoner's father; they sent for me - I did not dine there, nor did Bean, in my presence; I once or twice drank some beer there - I was not going to Scotland.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at any time suspended from your employ as a Police-officer? A. No, I resigned through bad health.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On the 30th of May I was in Oxenden-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I went to Panton-street; it was a little after twelve o'clock in the day - the prisoner was pointed out to me, and I took him; I received this purse from Mr. Hyndman - there is now one 5l. note in it, the other was delivered to Mr. Hyndman; when I took it there were two 5l. notes, five sovereigns, and some silver in it - I searched the prisoner, and found a gold mourning-ring on his finger; a pin, and one sovereign and a half in an inside pocket, on the left of his waistcoat, and half a sovereign in his left waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deny all knowledge of the robbery - I was coming down Panton-street; there was a mob, and a young man running - the officer came and took me; I was taken to the house, and the prosecutor said, "I cannot be positive, but there is a person outside can recognize him;" - they came to me for money - I had none, and they went to my father and mother, and had money - when they told me of it, I said, "They have been to me and wanted money, have nothing to do with them."</p>

            . I am a house-painter, and live at No. 15, Denmark-street. I was at the prisoner's father's, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane - I saw Bean there; there was some meat and vegetables on the table - I did not hear Bean ask the father for any money; I do not know whether Bean had been sent for - I heard the prisoner's wife say to Bean, "You know you told me that the Scotchman had foresworn himself at the Police-office;" Bean did not seem to wish to own to it, as there were other persons there - he was sitting in his chair, and moved his hand back, as if to stop her speaking; she asked Bean to come out from the father's house - I had seen him there twice; we were talking about this case, and he said he could not tell what the prisoner threw into the gig, and if he had any sort of counsel, he could get him through; he told me afterwards, that he did not like to speak in the presence of the prisoner's wife, but if she had offered him a sufficient sum of money to bear his expences, he would have gone out of town long ago - I have known the prisoner ever since he was quite a lad.</p>

            . On the 18th of June I was at the Royal Exchange, about half-past eleven o'clock - I saw the two prisoners following several gentlemen at different times; I then saw them and another person follow Mr. Phillips out of the Royal Exchange into <placeName id="t18310630-147-crimeloc790">Threadneedle-street</placeName>

               <p>PHILIP PHILLIPS. This box is my property; I had it about me at the Royal Exchange, on the 18th of June - it is worth about 40s.</p>

               <p>Brown. Q.Might it not have fallen from your pocket? A.It is not very likely - it was in my inside coat pocket, inside the flap of my coat; there was nothing else in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was coming along Throgmorton-street, and picked it up where the men were paving; two or three men saw me pick it up - the officer called; I took it out, and showed it to him.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. I had been looking after the omnibusses in the City; the officer took me three days afterwards.</p>

             re-examined. They were looking after different gentlemen; they were about the prosecutor's person for five minutes, and followed him ten yards; I did not see Bennett touch the prosecutor.</p>

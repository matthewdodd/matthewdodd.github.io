               <p>J. Donaldson. That is the woman. ( Pointing to the prisoner.) I did not intend to speak to her, till she got both her arms round mine, and asked me to go home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she had your watch?</p>
               <p>J. Donaldson. Because no other person was near me at the time, and I felt her hawl my watch out of my pocket. I said, What are you doing with my watch? I never found it since.</p>

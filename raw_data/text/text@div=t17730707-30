            . The former witness and the prisoner Hyde both lodged at my house; Hyde came on the 29th of May. On the 4th of June I had been out; when I came home in the evening, about five o'clock, the prosecutrix informed me her door was broke open, her things stole, and the prisoner Hyde was gone. Bryan came a few days before to see Hyde, and left word she should be glad to see her at the Hercules and Pillars, George-street, Soho; the prosecutrix and I went to that house about nine o'clock, and found Hyde; she had the cloak, handkerchief, and ribband on; I took her to the round house; she owned before the Justice she took the things, and said they were pawned in Prince's-street, Leicester-fields; the prosecutrix and I went there, and found the things (repeating them. They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix).</p>

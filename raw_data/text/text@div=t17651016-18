The serjeant was very much in liquor: the prisoner called me out of the bar, and said, he was going to the Indies, and the serjeant was full of money, and he would noint him: I said, how: he said, in oil: I said, you shall not noint him too much in this house; they went up together to bed: the prisoner came down: I suspected he had robbed him, seeing him come down with a pair of silver buckles in his shoes, and remembring I had seen the serjeant with silver buckles in his shoes: he pulled out a shilling to pay: I heard money rattle: (he had said he had none when he went to bed.) I put three men at the door, and locked it: he found he could not get out: he put his heels over the top of the door, and his back-side next, and hung on the top of the door, and went to make a push off, and the three men stopt him: he began fighting with them: I was in such a taking, I sainted away: they took him in custody: we searched him; and just below the waistband of his breeches, under his shirt, above his private parts, we found the serjeant's silver shoe buckles, and one of his knee buckles, the other he had dropt out of his pocket; we took 6 s. 9 d. out of his pocket, and two pocket books, belonging to the serjeant; all which the serjeant owned: and said, he had the books in his pocket when he went up stairs, and the buckles in his shoes, and knees of his breeches: the serjeant was drunk, and in bed fast asleep, at the time the prisoner was searched.</p>

               <p>Spencer. He said the prosecutor trusted them with him: but the prosecutor said to the contrary in the morning. (The two pair of buckles, two pocket books, and 6 s. 9 d. produced in court.)</p>

I saw the two pocket books in the prosecutor's possession before he went to bed; and heard the prisoner say to him, the next day, he hoped he would spare his life: and at the Angel and Crown, in Whitechapel, he hoped we would be favourable to him. The prosecutor was bound over; but was obliged to go to Scotland: so he took some papers out of the pocket books.</p>

I stepped on the splinter bar and he run away; I pursued him, and cried stop thief! and another coachman stopt him. I never lost sight of him.

               <p>Freeman. I do not know; I brought him facing the coach, and delivered him to the watchman, who took him to the watch-house; I drove my coach to the watch-house, and we searched him, and he had this knife open in his waistcoat pocket; (producing a clasp knife.)</p>

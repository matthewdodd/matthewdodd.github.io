About three weeks after this parcel was taken, I heard the Regulator coach had been robbed of a parcel containing 20l., and, on inquiry, I found the prisoner had left the Blue Boar, and gone to Mrs. Nelson's, at the Bull inn; I went to him, and said, "Young man, I hear you have found a little money;" he said, "Yes, I have;" I said, "How much might it be, pray?" he said a 10l. note; I said, "Where did you find it?" he said, "In Cheapside;" I said, "Was it loose in the street?" he said,"No - it was wrapped in brown paper;" I asked if there was any more; he said, "No - only a 10l. note;" I asked if it was a Bank note - he said, "No - a country note;" I asked where he changed it; he said at Mr. Meason's, the hatter, in Aldgate, and that he gave his address, James Thompson, Leadenhall-street, on the back of it; I went to Mr. Meason, and found this note with that written on it, and here is the hat which he bought; I found thirteen sovereigns in his box.</p>

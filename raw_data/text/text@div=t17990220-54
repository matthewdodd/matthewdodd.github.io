             sworn. - I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: On Wednesday evening, the 23d of January, I and some of my brother officers went to a house in Bowl-yard, St. Giles's, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; we went, in consequence of an information coming to the office, of a trunk, which belonged to Dr. Perfect; my brother officers went into the back parlour, I stopped in the passage, and the prisoner, and another man who made his escape, came in; the other man came in first, and the prisoner behind him, with this crane upon his left shoulder; the man who made his escape, accosted me, and asked me what I did in the passage; I told him not to stop there, but to come along up stairs with me; the prisoner was behind him; I immediately ran up to my brother officers, and desired them to come down, for there was some property come in; the prisoner at the bar and the other man followed me as far as the foot of the stairs; my brother officers came down stairs, and the crane was then standing against the bannisters of the stairs, and they were going out of the passage, when I secured the prisoner; I turned him into the passage to the other officers, and the other made his escape; I saw the crane upon his shoulder, it is a copper crane. (The crane was deposed to by Swanscoat and Hemmings).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is an envious piece of business of Crocker's; he has known me a great many years; a few years ago, he licked my brother; and he told me, he would lick e'er a one of the family; I licked him at the corner of Goodge-street, and he told me then, that if ever I should get into his hands, I should never get out any more. Another time, he met me with a bundle, and made me put it down and untie it, and said, he supposed I had got sugar or coffee.</p>
               <p>Crocker. I have not known him till within this year and a half; I have known his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have any quarrel with him at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten him, as he has described? - A. No, I never did, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was before a Magistrate in my life, till he took me up, and that he did once before this. He has been a terror to my life ever since I have been from the East-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Crocker). Did you ever take him up before? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t17990220-54-verdict280" type="verdictDescription">

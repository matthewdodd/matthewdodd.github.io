                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Clark, a boot-maker in South-street, in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I went to bed on a Friday night above five weeks ago—I was the last person up—I secured the house—I fastened down the window, closed the kitchen shutters, and bolted the door—to the best of my recollection I bolted the shutters, and am not sure—I am sure I put the window down—the boots and shoes were all safe, at eleven o'clock, in the kitchen—in the morning, four pairs of Wellington boots, and two pairs of shoes, were missing—one pair was taken and the other pair dropped in the area—they were all new—the prisoner was a journeyman of my husband's about three months previous—I saw the things at Queen-square on the Tuesday following.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for and found seven sovereigns and a half on the prisoner, and three keys - I had asked her if she had any money about her, and she said no - I said there was 7l. 10s. gone, and it could not go without hands; I then said "Have you any boxes?" she said "yes" - I followed her up stairs, and saw her putting her hand to her pocket; I took her hand, and found in it the seven sovereigns and a half, and the keys - I found forty-two sovereigns in the box - she said she had taken the money and deserved the greatest punishment, for her master had been a good master to her.</p>

On the 26th of September I was in my parlour, which is separated from my drawing-room by a passage; between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was alarmed by a violent ringing at the bell - I got up, and went to the window - I saw two persons standing by our rails, the gate was locked - they said a robbery had been committed - I went into the drawing-room, and found the window and blinds wide open; the blinds had been shut before, and the window a little up, to admit the air - I was then desired to look about the room, and I missed the desk, which I had seen on the table; but I cannot say I had seen it that day.</p>

            . I am a milkman. On the 26th of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoners with another person, at the corner of Prospect-row - I passed them twice, and went home, which is two hundred yards off - I was working in the field, and saw them looking about - I saw Bishop go into the fore-court, and get over the iron-rails into the prosecutrix's fore-court, and get in at the window: he came out in two minutes with something wrapped in a bag or apron, and gave it to the man, who is not here - Dumon stood at the corner, while Bishop went in, and the other received the article from Bishop, and went down Brooksby-street - the prisoners went another way - I rang the bell, and told the lady - I followed, and took them in Park-street - a man, who works for the lady, seized Dumon, who knocked him down - the street-keeper came by, and took them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor belonging to the George the Fourth, which laid in the Thames. The prisoner was an apprentice on board-on the 26th of May I went on shore to get provisions for the ship—I went to my chest and took my purse out, meaning to change a sovereign at shore—I did not look inside my purse—I did not spend any money, and came back without taking my purse out of my pocket till I went to pot it into my box—I then looked into it and missed two sovereigns and a half-crown—when the prisoner was accused of it he called me, and said if I would go on shore with him, he would make up the rest of the money which he had <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> overboard—I had put my purse in my waistcoat pocket the money must have been taken before I took the purse out of the chest to take it on shore.</p>

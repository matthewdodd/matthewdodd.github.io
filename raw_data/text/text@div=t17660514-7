               <p>Jones. I have left that about 2 months.</p>

               <p>Jones. I got acquainted with Walters at Statute-hall at Charing-cross: I never saw Plumber in my life before we took the stockings, (that was another offence.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet together that night?</p>
               <p>Jones. We met in Leicester-fields between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon; Walters said he was going to break a window for some gold rings at another shop. We went to Plumber at the Horse and Groom in Castle-street, by Leicester-fields; we staid there till it was just dusk, and when we came to the shop where the gold rings were, it was shut up: that was in Carnaby-market: then we went into Oxford-road, and Walters went into a baker's shop and took the till out; then we walked down almost as far as Soho-square; we passed by Mr. Hudson's shop 2 or 3 times and looked in; Walters said he would break the window, which he did with his fist, and cut the palm of his hand with a piece of glass; the other prisoner and I stood on the opposite side the way; Mr. Hudson came and asked what we stood there for; we said a person was gone to a cheesemonger's shop for some cheese, and we staid for him; he went there, and we went down Poland-street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw three lads walking over the way, and one of them said he would go for a pennyworth of cheese; I followed him, and said, you are one of the lads that broke my window; he vowed to me he was not, so I let him go.</p>
               <p>Jones. We followed Walters to the King's-arms in Prince's-street and had some beer; the young fellow that went for the cheese came to us, we gave him six-pence because he should say nothing; then we went into the Meuse and cut the handkerchiefs off; they had 3 each; Walters shewed them us at the King's-arms, they were brown, green, and white silk handkerchiefs in one piece,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140006"></xptr> all of a pattern. Walters said he had like to have ran over a man, and we told him how the gentleman came to us.</p>

I went to the King's-arms, there the evidence and Plumber came to me; I told Plumber I had got some handkerchiefs, I believe we had one or two pots of beer; after that he and I went out, I having agreed to go some where with him, for I wanted to speak with him; I sold him one of the handkerchiefs, then we went into Cranbourn-alley, there we saw the evidence: we passed him, and did not say any thing to him.

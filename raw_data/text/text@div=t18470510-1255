On Saturday, the 1st of May, about eleven o'clock at night, I locked the shop up safe—I went next morning, the 2nd, and found it just as I had left it—I locked it up again safe about eleven, or half-past—I went there again next morning, the 3rd—the doors were safe, but the ceiling was broken through—there is no story over it—there was an opening made wide enough to admit a man's body—I examined the shop, missed 9lbs. of soap, 36lbs. of candles, 3lbs. of cigars, and 3lbs. of to<lb></lb>bscco, which was safe when I left the house—they are my father-in-law's property—I went and told him, and gave information to the police—the goods have not been found.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 7th of June, at three in the morning, I was coming from Butcher-row. The prisoners asked me to give them something to drink. We took a coach, and went into Holborn, and had half-a-pint of brandy. The coachman brought it out to us. From thence we drove to the Goose and Gridiron, in St. Paul's church-yard. There I got out of the coach. I went to pay the coachman, and missed my money, my pocket-book, and my handkerchief. The women were still in the coach. I was in liquor. I felt my money in my pocket before I got into the coach, and afterwards, when I paid for the brandy; and I think I felt it in my pocket at the end of Fleet-market. I charged the prisoners with robbing me, and told them, if they would give me my property again, I would let them go about their business; if not, I would call the watch, and give charge of them. They would not give it me again. I called the watchman, and charged him with the prisoners; and they were taken to the watch-house. As they were going along, I saw Thomas drop the pocket-book. I took it up, and said it was mine: and in the watch-house she dropped the handkerchief. She was searched afterwards, and my money and some more was found upon her.</p>

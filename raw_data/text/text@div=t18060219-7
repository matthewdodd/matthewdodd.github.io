               <p>Q.When you was in the cellar you could not get into the house. - A. No, there is no way but turning back the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any time alarmed by any noise. A. I was sitting in the parlour about eleven o'clock in the evening, on the 13th of this month, I heard a noise in the cellar, I called to

            , and said there was somebody in the cellar; he was in the room with me, he lodges in the house; he went out and saw the turncock stand at the door; I ran instantly to the door with the candle in my hand, I saw part of my pipe laying over the flap of the cellar near a yard, I saw the remainder laying underneath the flap; I called out, Thieves, Watch, and seized hold of part of it; the constable came, I gave the pipe to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that pipe before: - A. It was impossible for me to see it; the New River company have occupied the cellar about two years, the steps were broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. This pipe you had not seen for a long time. A. The water came in the same afternoon, the pipe goes through the cellar; it must have been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190006"></xptr>the very same day, the water comes into the yard from that pipe; the door of the cellar was fastened by a nail on the outside, we never could keep a padlock on it; it was fastened at eight o'clock in the evening. I saw it myself, I went over it, and when I discovered the pipe laying there the nail was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the pipe to see whether the pipe was unfixed from the wall or taken away. - A. I had the constable to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. After this evening did the water come in as usual. - A. No, no water can come in now, because the pipe is gone; we were obliged to stop it up, because the water would float the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that pipe down in your cellar. A. It was put down five years ago, the man that had the house paid for it, I had the charge of it, and if any thing was gone I was to make it good, it belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at all that night. - A. Yes, in the afternoon he had been to the next door taking the pipe out of the tree as they call it, he was a turncock to the New River company.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him did you. - A. Yes, he had been in my house that day; he was the last man that I should have thought of; he was taken to the watchhouse, I saw him at the watchhouse, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. No part of the pipe was carried away further than the flap of the cellar door. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him with the pipe. - A. No.</p>
               <p>HENRY FIELDER sworn. Q. You were with Mrs. Dibble in the room that night. - A. Yes, she heard a noise at the cellar door as well as myself; she said to me, Fielder there is somebody at the cellar; I immediately ran out of the door, and saw the prisoner standing at the cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing when you went out. - A. He was standing against it, he was just on the curb by the flap.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe him doing any thing at that time. - A. No, he had not anything with him at the time as I perceived. When I went to the door I asked him what he had been doing in the cellar, he cried out What, that is all the answer he gave me; I put my hand to the door, and there was his spoon-hook entangled with the pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stand still all the time while you examined. - A. Yes, he stood still all the time; I put my hand to shut the cellar door, I took hold of the hook which was entangled with the pipe; I says to him you have been and cut the lead pipe, he immediately rushed to me and snatched the hook out of my hand and ran away with it; in running he fell down, and when he rose again I found that one of his shoes was off, he was in George-court; then I heard his hook rattle against the pavement; by his running I perceived he had lost a shoe; I pursued him, he got into a stable, he having gained ground of me. I came back to Edmonds-court, my landlady says go to his lodgings in Green's-court; I went, and in less than five minutes he came there quite out of breath; I was standing just opposite, I took hold of him by the collar, he said it was not him, I said he was the man standing at the cellar door taking the leaden pipe away. He asked me to let him go. I told him I would not, I gave charge of him at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you examine this pipe to see whether it was broken or cut any where. - A. I did not examine it till the constable had got it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say when you saw it laying over the flap of the cellar whether it was cut or separated from the wall where it had been fixed - A. I did not observe whether it was cut or broken then, I know since that it had been broke off. The next morning I went into the cellar I observed the lead pipe was gone from wall to wall; the leaden pipe was fixed in the main and went from wall to wall of the foundation of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time that the pipe had been twisted off from wall to wall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the pipe left in. - A. There was part of the pipe left in the but in the value, I got it out, it matched with it; a part was missing, with a brass cock, before he was detected, that part we never saw again.</p>
               <p>JAMES SLADE sworn. I am a constable; about ten or fifteen minutes after eleven o'clock at night, I pursued him down Rupert-street, and missed him; I returned back to Mrs. Dibble's, there I found about a yard of the pipe out of the cellar, and a yard in the cellar; I took it up, it was entirely loose from the wall, I took it away; the prisoner was given into my charge at the watchhouse; there were about nine yards of pipe gone from the wall. The prisoner had this instrument in his hand at the watchhouse, I told him he must deliver it up to me, I was obliged to take it away from him by mere force.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it. - A. They call it a spoon hook, it is what they use in their business, I took the lead to my own house, and marked it on the next morning; we examined the cellar, we found it was stripped off from wall-to wall, and this end of the pipe seems to match the end that was cut next to the but, the other end was gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is only a spite against me: I am the turncock that belongs to the New River company; I informed against all that let the water run to waste, because a great many got no water, the foreman came along with me, and cut the pipes off, because they should not run it to waste. I was going into my door when they laid hold of me, they said I was going to steal the lead pipe; there is Mr. Nash, I took his water off; it is all their spite because I cut their water off.</p>

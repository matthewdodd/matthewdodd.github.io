On the evening of the 21st of June, my house was left safely futened in the usual manner—I was called up about four o'clock in the morning, and found somebody had entered—I missed a tea-pot, eleven spoons, and some other things—this bread-basket and toast-rack were thrown away under the arches of the Adelphi, proving to be only plated—these are mine—these boots are my son's—this pocket-handkerchief and small double gold breast-pin is mine.</p>

I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock—the scullery-window was then safely shut—Flatt had been working at our house as a carpenter, with his uncle—he used to wash his hands in the scullery when he was there—the window was protected by iron bars—I awoke about four in the morning—when I came down the area-door was open, but there were no marks of its having been forced—I think they got through the kitchen-window—there was a place where they had rubbed themselves against the wall—a row of garden-pots stood against the window, and two of them were thrown down opposite an opening of the bars, just wide enough for a thin person to get through, the person had torn off a shirt-button, and we found Gordon's shirt had a button off just the same site and pattern as the one found.</p>

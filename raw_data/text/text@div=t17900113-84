             was in the front warehouse; he was unpacking a case; I ordered him to take two of the parcels contained in that chest, to a house in Aldermanbury; I called him as he opened the hatch to go out, to look to see what proportion I should charge for freight and carriage of these goods; on returning to me, he did not shut the hatch; and in that moment, I lost some prints: we immediately pursued, I one way, and he the other: and we were informed the prisoner was gone into Wood-street; and looking down Wood-street, I saw the prisoner was by himself: I called no assistance; but just at the corner of Lad-lane, I laid hold of him and the prints, and asked him where he was going with them? he said, to the Cross-keys; I said that was the wrong way for that; and he put them down upon the post; and a young man came by I knew; I desired him to take care of the prints, while I secured the prisoner, and took him to the Wood-street Compter: then I sent for an officer, and charged him: Dixon, the constable, took charge of him and the prints; there were seven whole pieces, and five half pieces of printed callico.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. When had you seen the prints before? - I had not seen the prints for some time before; the hatch was left open: and going through Clement's-court to Wood-street, I saw the prisoner, and he told me some person had employed him to carry them to the Cross-keys, Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask the prosecutor to stop the man that gave them to me? - No, he did not.</p>

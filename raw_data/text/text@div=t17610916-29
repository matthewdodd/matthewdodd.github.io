            . I was coming through Newgate, on the 2d of July, between eight and nine at night; I was going towards the city. I happened to be behind the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it into his other hand, and put it behind him. I laid hold of the handkerchief, and also of the prisoner; and called to Mr. Gosling to stop, and asked him if he had lost his handkerchief. He saw it, and said it was his. [Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.] The prisoner was a little surprized when I took hold of him. We took him before a magistrate, there he said he found it.</p>

               <p>I was walking along, and saw the handkerchief lying on the ground; I stooped and picked it up. A gentleman was by, I said, have you lost a handkerchief? He said, yes, and you have got it. That gentleman did not say then he saw me take it out of his pocket.</p>

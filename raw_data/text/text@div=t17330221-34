I did not then suspect them to be Rogues, but thought they had broke the Glass by Mischance. But while I was looking, Walter came out, and putting his Hand in at the broken Pane, took out a Piece of Sarcenet, and went again into the Entry: Then the other Prisoner took out something else, I think it was a Pair of Stockings, and went after Walter; in a little Time they both came out again, Hastings with a Pair of white Stockings in his Hands, and Walter with the Sarcenet in his Apron. Walter came up toward where I stood, and Mrs. Wells took him by the Collar, and pulled him into her Shop; he said, he had found the Silk. Another pursued Hastings, and took him. As we were carrying them before a Justice, Hastings threw something into a Shop Window; we look'd and found a Pair of white Stockings, and the other Pair was found upon Walter, when he was search'd before the Justice.</p>

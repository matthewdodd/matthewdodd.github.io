Here is one duplicate of ours for a pair of half-boots, one for three spoons, one for a table—cloth, one for a shirt, one for a shift, and one for a shawl—the spoons were pawned in the name of "Frewin, for Mrs. Smith, Thanet—place;" the table—cloth the same; the shirt, "Ann Frewin, Ship—yard," only; the shawl, "Ann Frewin, Ship—yard"—I am quite sure Frewin is the woman who pawned all these things—the earliest date is the 3rd of January, and the last the 18th of April—I know Clarke by sight—I have seen her about the place sometimes, looking into the window, and sometimes standing at the door while Frewin was pledging.</p>

I was in company with the prosecutor and Mr. Stronginthearm, we no sooner got out of the house where we had been drinking, but Mr. Stronginthearm saw two men in pursuit of the prosecutor; he immediately called to me, and said, Gentlemen, have you lost any thing? Then I saw Mr. Wiggington's handkerchief one part under the prisoner's feet, the other corner he held in his hand under his coat. When we searched him there were more handkerchiefs found upon him.</p>

            . The last witness called upon me, we had been drinking, when we parted I saw the prisoner Winter jump out of Shoemaker-row, he had a partner with him, they followed them close under the arch in Aldgate; I followed the prisoner and his companion close almost through ; the Prisoner turned upon me, I suspected he had got his prey, so I called to my friends; Mr. Gohl said he had got his handkerchief, but the prosecutor replied I have lost mine. I had got the prisoner by the hand; I cast my eye under his foot and there lay the handkerchief; the prosecutor said it is mine, and I will prosecute him cost what it will.</p>

When we had been there some time, the other prisoner came in. I had a 10 l. Bank note in a purse in my left-hand breeches pocket. I went to sleep, and when I awoke it was dark, and the prisoners were gone. I then overhauled my pocket, and missed the note. I went down stairs, and found Wharf in the kitchen or parlour, but I did not say any thing about my loss - I staid in the house till morning. I then saw Wharf again, and asked her where the purse was - she said she had not seen it. I said "Where is the 10 l. note;" she said she had not seen a 10 l. note for some time. I afterwards saw Garratt. I did not ask her about the note in the house, but I asked her out of doors - she said she had not seen it. I afterwards made inquiries if two such women had changed a note, and Mr. Fletcher said he had changed it for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you go with Garratt? A. Yes; and Wharf was there. I undressed myself and went to bed. Garrat was in bed with me a short time - I had put my trousers on a chair. I had not made any observation on the note.</p>

            . I live at the Ship and Gun, public-house, in Sun-yard. This note was brought to my house about four o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, the 20th of August, by Garratt, who bought half a pint of gin. Wharf was with her. I gave Garratt nine sovereigns, 19 s. and 3 d., and wrote her name on the note.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I went with Cusons on the 21st of August to Wharf's house in Sun-yard. I saw Garratt, and asked her what she had done with the note - she said she knew nothing about it. I searched her room, but found no money. I came down to Wharf's room, and saw her standing at a drawer. I said "I must look into that drawer." I found three sovereigns and 1 l. 13 s. in silver there, which she said was for her landlord; but as we were going along, Garratt said it was part of the change of the note.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CUSONS re-examined. Q. Did you exchange the 10 l. note which you received of Mr. Wickers for any other 10 l. note? A. No - I did not.</p>

I came to town on the 26th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, with a load of garden-stuff; I put my horses up, and met the prisoner about three o'clock in the morning, in the market - she asked me to go with her and lay down an hour or two. I never saw her before - we went to her room somewhere in <placeName id="t18270712-171-crimeloc945">St. Giles'</placeName>

We went to bed - I fell asleep, and was awoke in about twenty minutes, by the prisoner opening the door; I jumped out of bed, and went to my hat; my watch and money were gone; I charged her with it - she said I had no such things with me; she then went into another room, where a person was laying; I followed her; the prisoner said, "What do you want here?" I said, my watch and money - she said, "You had no watch." I looked about, but could not find it; I went and fetched the watchman up - she again denied it ten or twelve times, but after some time she drew it from her pocket, but she would not deliver up any money.</p>

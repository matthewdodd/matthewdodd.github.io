On Monday evening, the 26th of May, a piece of Bandana was found in his trunk, in his presence - he opened the trunk himself; there was a general search, in consequence of a piece of linen being missed - he said he bought the handkerchiefs of Mr. Davis, in Chiswell-street, two years ago, but the price he could not recollect; he has been there two or three months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many servants has your master? A. Twelve or fourteen; two or three slept in the prisoner's room; I am certain his box was locked - he said on the Wednesday that a friend, named Thompson, wished to buy some handkerchiefs, and he had put these apart to shew him, but he never said so before; Mr. Graham sent him away that night, as we were not certain we should be able to identify the property, but we afterwards found one of the shopmen could identify it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was done with the property? A. We kept it there - the prisoner was to call next day for his salary.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Graham's employ, and know these handkerchiefs - I sold two off this piece last Saturday week; I took particular notice how I cut it - I had a pair of scissors which would not cut well, and they made a particular mark, and it was missing on the Monday - I can swear this is the same piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the mark? A. It is notched - there is no shop mark on it; I was not asked about it till after the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoners' Defence. I met Thompson on the Sunday previous - he asked me to bring him some handkerchiefs to look at - I selected this, and when I went up in the morning to dress.

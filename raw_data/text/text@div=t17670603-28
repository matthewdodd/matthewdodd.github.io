The constable came to me on the Sunday morning; I told him if it was mine, it had a single cannister in it, and described it.</p>

            . I live in Basinghall-street. On the 7th of May, about twelve o'clock in the day, I found the prisoner in my parlour, he had this tea-chest in his hand; I asked him what business he had there; he said he was an apprentice to a cabinet-maker, and he brought it for one Mrs. Walters, and that he came from one Mr. Walters in Foster-lane; he told me a great number of lies, the street-door being open, I stopped him, and sent a person to Foster-lane, to know if there was any such person, but found there was not. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176706030020"></xptr> was taken before the sitting Alderman; there he said it belonged to one Mrs. Swift; there was one of that name sent for, but she said she knew nothing of the chest or him either; we advertised the chest on the Saturday, and Mrs. Houghton came and owned it on the Monday; (produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went up to a young fellow that was in the hospital, he asked me to drink; we drank about five or six pints; coming home to my father's in Coleman-street, when I got into Lothbury, a man met me, and asked whether I knew Basinghall-street; I said, that is it before me; we went into a place by Guildhall; said he, my lad, I should be glad if you will take this tea-chest till I go to enquire for the people I am to carry it to, that is one Mrs. Walters, but I do not know the house; I went into Basinghall-street, and asked several people if they knew Mrs. Walters; I went into that gentleman's house, and asked for Mrs. Walters; the man said, no such person lives here, what business have you in the entry; I said, I did not come for any harm, I want to find Mrs. Walters, because a gentleman left this chest in my care.</p>
               <p>Waldron. He had been up to my bureau, I could see the marks of his feet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was made by a dog belonging to one Mr. Wicks; I did live in Lothbury; I did live at the City Arms, and Mansion-house alehouses; my father-in-law is a sailor, and my mother is a cook.</p>

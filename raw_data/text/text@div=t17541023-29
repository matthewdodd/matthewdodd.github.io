On the 11th of Sept. I found the chamber over the stable broke open, and on the Friday following in the evening, I had been in town and saw an advertisement of these things mentioned; the two brass pillars belonged to a marble slab. They were packed up in a case, the soup-plate I had set in that room with some food in it for the chickens.</p>

               <p>Young. The plate, pillars and a towel, my master's property, were found upon the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 10th of Sept. last I had been riding about my ground, as I was coming home I heard a knocking at a stile of mine; between 9 and 10 in the morning I rode across the field and there was the prisoner. I thought he was stealing my gate-irons, I seeing they were not gone I bid him go about his business; he us'd me with a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175410230017"></xptr> deal of ill language; he had got a bundle with him. I told him I thought he had got some stolen goods there: he said, to let you know I have none of your gate-irons, I'll let you see; he opened the towel or napkin, there; I saw these brass pillars and a plate doubled up together; then I rode to some of my men and desired them to follow me; they did, we took him, and carried him to justice Green, he sent him to New Prison; he told the justice he had them of his mother in order to sell to buy some tools with the money. Produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. to Young. Do you know these goods produced?</p>
               <p>Young. This is the plate of my master's, in which I put barley for the chickens over the stable; it did belong to Mr. Nightingale; here is his crest upon it. I can be confident the brass pillars belong to my master likewise, because they fit the irons which I have here (producing them and fiting them on.) I never saw them at Enfield, only I saw the case they were packed in; I have seen them in Hanover Square at my master's house there, and the case was broke open when I missed them. I can swear no farther.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going over 'squire Gore's-park; as I was making water I saw the corner of a napkin hang out. I thought there was something in it. I looked and found the things mentioned. I asked several people if they had known whose they were, and was going to London to have them advertised. Mr. Young said he knew I could not be the person that took them away, if I was to swear till I was black in the face when he came to me in the New Prison.</p>

               <p>Young. No, never to my knowledge.</p>

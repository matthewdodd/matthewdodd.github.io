I found the back door unbolted - it had been taken out that way; I found it about - half-past nine o'clock. at Mr. Pontifex's in Shoe-lane. Head's father and mother lodged at my house, and he often slept there; I was fixing this copper about a fortnight before - he came down and said I had got a troublesome job; I said Yes, and got him to finish it for me. Thompson gave me information on the morning that I lost it; Jones was brought to my house about twelve o'clock on Monday, charged with stealing it; he said, "I am not the person who stole it;" I said"Who was it?" he said a person named Head, and I should find him at some place in Shoe-lane, or at the Bull's Head, in Peter-street; that Head gave him the copper in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050048"></xptr>morning at my back door, to take to Pontifex's to sell - I found Head by his account.</p>

             sworn. - I am a warehouseman in Round-court, in the Strand; I was coming down Jermyn-street, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Newton's door; I saw him take this dress, and put it into his cap; I followed him, and delivered him to the serjeant, while Mr. Newton was looking for a constable; Mr. Newton took the things from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home from a fieldday, and met with a comrade just come home from abroad; he said he wanted to buy a dress for his little boy, and going by this gentleman's door, he said he thought it would do; the pin came undone, and, in stooping to pick them up, my cap fell off; this gentleman came up, when I had my cap in one hand, and the dress in the other, and said, I had been stealing it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him seven years, and gave him a good character as a soldier, but could not say any thing as to his private character. <rs id="t18020714-40-verdict211" type="verdictDescription">

There I saw the mill; [produced in court] this is the same mill we lost, it is my master's property. I saw the prisoner when he was secured. I asked him how he came by the mill, he said he was employed to sell it by one.

            . The prisoner and another man brought this mill to my shop, I was not in the way when they came first. My servant came to me and told me there was a mill brought to be sold. I went home and ask'd the prisoner what he expected for it?

On the Wednesday following, Mr. Russel's servant called upon me, I shew'd him the mill; he said it was his master's property; he and his master desired me, if I saw either of the men, to secure them: after which, my servant secured the prisoner; I desired him to go with me to Mr. Russel; he charged him with stealing the mill.</p>

I was present when Mr. Russel's man came to enquire if a mill had been sold there; and also when Mr. Russel, the prisoner and my master were together.

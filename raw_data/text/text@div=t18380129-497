On the 27th of January I met the prisoner at the corner of Fleet-street, about nine o'clock in the evening, and remained with her till about twelve o'clock—I was quite sober—she spoke to me first—we walked as far as Temple-bar, and back again, and then to Glou<lb></lb>cester-street, Tower-street—we went into a bed-room together—I gave her about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we were on the bed together—before I went on the bed, I had thirty-three sovereigns in a bag in my left hand trowsers pocket—we were on the bed for five or ten minutes, and before I got up I missed my money—my pocket was buttoned, and I had my hand in it—the light was nearly extinguished—I accused her of taking it while I was on the bed—there was not another soul in the room but her and me—she denied it—I knocked for the landlady to bring another light—another female and the landlady came into the room—I still held the Prisoner, and kept charging her with robbing me—she still denied it, and while I was holding her she dropped four sovereigns from her cloak, and five more and</p>

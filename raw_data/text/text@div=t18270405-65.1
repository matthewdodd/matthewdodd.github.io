               <p>SAMUEL EYCOTT. I am fourteen years old, and am in my mother's employ - she <rs id="t18270405-65-viclabel367" type="occupation">deals in spice and grocery</rs>

On the 26th of February, about half-past four o'clock, I was coming from Somers'-town with these things in a bag - I had collected the money from different shops; the money was in two bags, which was put into a third bag, containing the salts - as I was going up Long-lane, I had got about fourteen yards out of Smithfield, the prisoner accosted me, and asked if I could show him the way to Cripplegate - he was alone; I said I was going that way - he kept in my company for a quarter of an hour - I am sure he is the lad; when I got to <placeName id="t18270405-65-crimeloc368">Cripplegate</placeName>

On the 6th of March my mother and I were passing along Well-street, Mile-end, and saw the prisoner talking to another young person - he saw me - he touched the other one on the arm and said,"That is the cove we served last week;" my mother asked if I noticed him, and when I looked at him, I was certain of him - I went after him - he tried to make his escape, and hit me in the face; my mother assisted me in securing him; I told her what had happened as soon as I got home; I am quite sure he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you say at Guidhall, that there were three more in my company? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH EYCOTT. I sent my son to sell some goods for me - this money was the produce of the goods; he returned about half-past five o'clock, and stated what had happened; I was with him in Mile-end, about a week afterwards, and met the prisoner with another boy - as the prisoner passed he looked at my son, and said, "That is the cove we served last week;" this induced me to notice him; I told my son to look at them; he said the one with the blue bag round his neck (which was the prisoner) was the boy who had robbed him; we pursued - the prisoner ran away, but was at last secured; I held him till Pasque came up; he denied the charge; the other boy went away.</p>

I was equerry in waiting on Thursday, 27th June—Her Majesty left Buckingham Palace about six o'clock that day, in an open barouche, of the usual height—it drove up Constitution-hill and down Piccadilly, to Cambridge-house, where Her Majesty alighted—she left Cambridge-house about half-past six; the carriage came out of the east gate, the one nearest St. James's-street, and furthest from Hyde-park—there was, at the gate, the usual crowd that always attends on such occasions; not an unusaal crowd—the carriage necessarily proceeded slowly, to enable the leaders to turn into the street; it was almost stationary—I saw a well-dressed man step forward as the carriage passed the gates—what he did I could not exactly see—I saw Renwick, the footman, who was behind, lean forward and seize that man by the collar; and that man was the prisoner—I was on horseback behind, and had not got out of the gate—as I was passing on the prisoner came behind the rumble, and the crowd instantly closed in—I saw the police take hold of him, and I went after the carriage, which drove on—when Her Majesty arrived at Buckingham Palace, Sir James Clark was sent for—I afterwards saw a bandage on Her Majesty's forehead, and the blood was coming through the bandage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, living at Norwich-court, Fetter-lane. On Thursday, 27th June, about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I was among the crowd waiting for Her Majesty to leave Cambridge-house—I was standing in the front part of the crowd, and the prisoner came and took his station at my right elbow, so close as to touch me; he made an attempt to get in front of me, and I put my arm in front of him again—while stand<lb></lb>ing by the side of him Her Majesty came out in an open barouche, and at the moment it was in front of us it halted a second for the outriders to clear the way—we were at the Hyde-park side, the right side of the carriage, the same on which Her Majesty was sitting, and the prisoner made one step in advance and struck Her Majesty—he had his right hand free, and he struck with that hand—the blow appeared to me to fall partly on the Queen's bonnet and partly on her face; I could not see distinctly.</p>

                  </hi>. I was Lieutenant-Colonel of the 10th Hussars in 1841, when the prisoner joined it as cornet—he became lieutenant in due time—he remained in the regiment till March, 1846—when he joined it was quartered in England, we were afterwards a few years in Ireland, and then went back to England—about 1844, when we were quartered at Cahir, and he at Clonmel, an accident happened to some horses and a dog of his—between the time of his joining the regiment and that time, I had noticed peculiarities in his manner—the very first day he joined I thought there was something very odd about him—he had his hair cut close to his head, and I was under the impression that be had had his head shaved for some complaint, and he had rather a wildish look about him—as an officer he discharged his duties very well, to the best of his abilities—I never had occasion to find fault with him; and as to his being a gentleman, there was no doubt about that—he was very much liked by his brother officers, and respected by the regiment—he had a favourite Newfoundland dog, and, I think, as many as three valuable horses, to which he was very much attached—Major Walling<lb></lb>ton had then the command of the regiment at Clonmel—it was reported to me that Major Wallington's dog bit Mr. Pate's dog, and the horses after<lb></lb>wards went mad, and were shot—after that I noticed a change in the prisoner's conduct and appearance; and there was another circumstance, he had a very sensitive mind, and he appeared to be exceedingly annoyed at some correspondence that took place between his father and the Duke of Welling<lb></lb>ton, in respect to the loss of these horses—there was some claim made on the Major for the value of the horses, in consequence of the accident having arisen through one of his dogs—he felt hurt that his friends should make such a claim on a brother officer—after that he appeared not to have the same love for his profession; he did not seem to do his duty with the zeal that he did before—previous to that be used to mix with the other officers—afterwards his life was more secluded, and he was in the habit of taking very long walks, particularly when he went to Newbridge, in very wild secluded places—I cannot speak positively whether he estranged himself more from the company of his brother officers, because, from my position in the regiment, I was not so much among these gentlemen as the junior officers were—some time after that, at New-bridge, he complained to me that he was unwell, and said he had applied to the doctor of the regiment, and he had given him no relief—I asked what was the matter with him, he answered, and said his stomach and bowels were full of bricks, and that the doctor had not the skill to remove them—I saw directly the delusion he was under, and endeavoured to persuade him what was the fact, that the doctor was a person of great ability, and be was considered on the sick-list after that—to the best of my knowledge he did not replace the horses—he may have replaced one; I cannot speak positively, but I had great trouble about them—in June, 1845, I sent him from Newbridge with a detachment to Dublin, ordering him to return the following day; he left the detachment at Dublin, without leave, absented himself, and I was told he went to Eng<lb></lb>land—that is a military offence of a serious character—I communicated with General Wyndham on the subject—he came back after some days; I forget exactly the number of days he was absent—he was not brought to a court-martial</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185007080051"></xptr>
               <p>—I saw him after he came back; I thought him very wild, and he could give no account of himself why he went away—in consequence of what I observed in his conduct and demeanour, I made a communication with his father, putting it in as delicate a way as I could—I did not like exactly to tell his father that I thought him insane; a few months after, I think, he left the regiment.</p>

               <p>one particular spot; near a pond which he used to pass in his walk, and he would frequently stop there, and stand and notice it for a few minutes, and then run and jump into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he would sometimes order me to go as fast as I could gallop, and then he would pull me up, and order me to walk down Roehampton-lane—I then used to take him to Barnes-common—he used to get out at one certain place there, and take a regular walk over the common among the furze-bushes and briars—I used to take him up again at a certain point, always the same point, and then drive him home—he would sometimes stop at a nursery-garden and buy 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of flowers; we always came the same road home, over Hammersmith-bridge—his manner was very peculiar in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—his manner of ordering me first to gallop, then to stop, and jump<lb></lb>ing from one side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the other—as I sat behind, I used to open the trap and look through, my curiosity was very much excited—it used to be dark in winter-time driving down Roehampton-lane, a large avenue of trees; it would be dark before we got to Barnes-common—he would walk through the furze-bushes there in the dark, hail, rain, blow or snow—while in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he would sometimes jump and start very much, and sometimes he would sit still and never stir the whole journey—he used to have a small cane with him, which he used to flourish about this way and that way—I cannot say whether this is the cane (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one produced</hi>)—it was similar to it, if it was not that—he would lay on the front of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and take the cane and cut it this way and that way—I do not know what performance it was; he seemed to be thoughtless, or something of that kind—I suppose some sudden thought caused him to jump and start, as if he did not know what he was about—many respectable people on the road would stop me in their carriage, and gentlemen on horseback, to ask who or what he was, whether, he was not a madman—this lasted every day for fifteen or eighteen months, without any interruption, whatever might be the weather, and Sunday the same—he used to pay me every day when I brought him home—at first it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and afterwards reduced to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know how it came to be reduced—he said to me one day that he should only give me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me with the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he contined on paying that, and I never contradicted it, as it was a sufficient remuneration for the journey—he always paid me in shillings, never anything but shillings, and they were always placed with the man upwards, and all the men's faces one way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say he is not a man of strong mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, wanting in earnestness of intention on any subject, indifferent, apathetic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am afraid that is the characteristic of a great number of persons who are perfectly sane, and at large? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At large; I doubt about their being perfectly sane—of course the line must be drawn somewhere, but I take all the circumstances into consideration in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you perceive any specific delusion at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at present; no delusion whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And I presume he is well aware that he has done wrong in this matter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and regrets it very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gather that, from what he has said to you on the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—he seems quite unable to give any account why he did it, or any account of the act at all, any more than it was not done by another person—he does not deny having done it, but he expresses him<lb></lb>self very sorry for it—I asked him a great many questions on the subject; he had no motive whatever in committing such an action, no premeditation, no powers of deliberation or reason at the time; but he acted under some strange morbid impulse, which he had no power apparently of resisting.</p>

                  </hi>., <hi rend="largeCaps">M.D</hi>. I have had five interviews with Mr. Pate since this occurrence—I saw him first on the 2nd of the month at Clerkenwell, and again on the 3rd; and I saw him afterwards in Newgate on the 5th, 8th, and 10th—from my own observation, and from what I have heard to-day, I believe him to be of unsound mind—from his own lips I have heard a statement of what occurred in 1844, in Ireland; how he came away driven by his own imagination that he was watched, that he was persecuted, and I have no doubt in the world that he was then labouring under a delusion—I have heard the opinion which Dr. Conolly has given to-day—I do not remember precisely all the points of his evidence—I agree generally with him, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with that part of his evidence in which he says there is no specific delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At this time I am not aware that there is any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that he was aware he was doing wrong in doing this act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very possibly aware—a madman might choose the wrong and do the act perversely—there are a great many degrees in madness—I think the characteristic of his, is a morbid love of seclusion; no friends, no pursuits, no object in life; that is what I find continually; what I should call an unsound state of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is he, in your judgment, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In many things, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that apathetic state of mind, listlessness and inconstancy, consistent with occasional paroxysms of excitement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes—the whole history that I have heard to-day is quite conclusive to my mind of his being in an unsound condition—I think that a man conceiving he had bricks and stones in his stomach, and being hunted by persons, and imagining that the cook and messman had conspired to poison him, are indi<lb></lb>cations of insanity.</p>

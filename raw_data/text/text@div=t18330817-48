On the morning of the 14th of June, I left my room, locked my door, and hung the key over it, which I did every day, for the landlady to go in to make the bed, and she puts it there again for me - I went out before ten and returned about half-past nine o'clock at night - I then missed a gold pin from my table drawer, worth about 7s. - I did not miss any thing else that evening, but early the next morning I found the things in my cupboard had been disturbed, where I had secreted my bunch of keys - my boxes were still locked as I had left them, but on opening them I missed the articles stated in the indictment and some other things - I sent for my landlady and the officer - I went with the officer to Lisson-grove, where I saw my own portrait in Mr. Farley's shop, also the picture of a lady, and the interior of Lincoln College - here are some articles which Mr. Baker, the pawnbroker, produced, and Mr. Solomon brought some articles; they had all been safe in my boxes on the 14th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What is the value of the portrait? A. I valued it at 3l. 10s. - I gave 3l. 17s. for it; it was done by Mr. Burke - I do not know what the canvas is worth; these articles are marked J. W.; I believe they are all marked; this shirt is not marked, but I believe it belongs to me - there may be other shirts like it; my initials are on these tongs and spoons; I have no mark on these shoes, but I purchased them and wore them; I can swear to them by the ribbon, and altogether; they were not made for me - there may be many yards of ribbon like this - any person might get the key of the room and go in - I cannot tell who went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DAWSON. Q. What value do you place on the picture of the Lady? A. Ten shillings on the two; no one would give me that for them perhaps - I am not now married; I have been - I lived in service at General Pilkington's, in the park; and before that at

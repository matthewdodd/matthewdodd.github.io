               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe some persons were cruel enough to suspect that you did not put it into the seat at all? A. A great many were cruel enough against me; the prosecutors had me apprehended- I was in gaol for a fortnight at Birmingham, and was then brought to town; I swear that I put it inside the seat - I saw Foyle at Bow-street.</p>

On the 11th of April I got into the Birmingham coach at the Bull and Mouth; the prisoner and a gentleman were inside when I got in - the prisoner was dressed very shabbily in black, which fixed my attention on him - I am certain of him - I noticed him as I had property about me; I merely asked him how far he was going - he said to Stoney Stratford - I asked afterwards if he lived there - he said No, he was only going there for a few days; the coach stopped in Market-street, Bedfordshire, to supper - it is about thirty miles off - I got out first, the other gentleman next, and then the prisoner - we had taken up a female at Islington, and put her down be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220008"></xptr>fore we got to Market-street; I took some refreshment, but did not observe the prisoner till I had nearly done supper - he got into the coach with us again - I was the first who got in.

            . I keep the Bell inn, in Market-street. On the 11th of April, about ten o'clock at night, the Birmingham coach arrived - three passengers got out- Mr. Chase was one, and I recollect the prisoner very well - he took some liquor and water, but did not sit down; I noticed that he went out of the house three times while the coach was there, and the last time he staid in the passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You must have taken great notice of him? A. Yes. Persons do not always take supper; some only take liquor and water; they more generally sup than not; I noticed the prisoner by his going out three times - there was a back place for him to go to without going out in front.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You learned soon afterwards of this loss? A. Yes, on the Friday.</p>

            , JUN. On the 11th of April I remember the Birmingham coach stopping at my father's - I was on the near side of the coach when the prisoner got out - I was looking after the coach to see the things were all correct, and observed him go to the near side and open the coach door, while the others were at supper; on hearing it open I went to the near side - he left the coach, and afterwards went away in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were watching the coach - now did he take any thing out? A. I did not see him open the door, as I was on the other side - it hardly took me a second to go round - his right foot was on the step; I asked him what he wanted - I saw him leave the coach but cannot say whether he had any thing in his hand or not - I saw him shut the door with one hand - I told him what he wanted to ask the guard for, (and he went towards the house) because the guard said he had lost two coats a few nights before - I was with the coach from the time it arrived till it started - there was a lamp on each side, but no other light.</p>

            . I am guard of the Union Birmingham coach, which meets this coach at Stoney Stratford. On the 11th of April, about one o'clock at night, we met it about a quarter of a mile on the other side Stoney Stratford; at Stoney Stratford the prisoner asked if I had room outside to London - he was very meanly dressed in black, and had no great coat - it was a very wet morning - I lent him my box coat - he came to London with us, and got down at the Pitt's Head public-house, at the corner of Old-street, about eight o'clock in the morning. The rain cleared off about day-break - he pulled off my coat, and from inside his coat I saw him pull a smallish parcel, covered with a kind of light brown paper - it appeared to be chafed a little on the edges with wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A person with plenty of money would rather go inside? A. He said he had not plenty of money - the parcel appeared to be in common rought brown paper - I only saw it once, as he pulled it out to look at it and put it in again.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a light whitey-brown paper parcel? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Inspector's office in the Bank. On the 12th of April, about one o'clock, the prisoner brought two hundred 1l. notes, to be changed for gold - they were in four parcels of 50l. each. with the Bank halter on them - we always issue them tied in fifties; I am confident of his person; he handed this paper to me as his address, "Thomas Matthews, No. 21, Euston-square; 200 1l. notes;" I have kept the paper ever since. I inspected the notes, then took him to the Treasury, to get a 200l. note for them, which I gave him, with a pen, to write his name on the large note, which he handed to the pay clerk, with a name on it - it was quite a new note, with no writing on it; I delivered the same 200 1l. notes to the cashier at the Treasury, but did not see the 200l. note after he wrote on it; I saw him deliver it to Mr. Higman, to get gold for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he his hat on? A. He took it off in the office, but when I first saw him it was on; he was there full twenty minutes; I do not suppose more than one or two other persons were with me that day - ours is a private office; he happened to be admitted within the office by accident, that makes me remember him - he was shabbily dressed.</p>

            . I am a teller at the Bank. On the 12th of April I paid two hundred sovereigns for this 200l. note in the name of Matthews, which is in front of the note, as required; I paid no other 200l., in sovereigns, that day. I am certain this is the note for which I paid them - it is No. 51,862, and the address "Thomas Matthews, No. 21, Euston-square."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you find that, by any mark you have made on the note? A. No. by the book; the name in the book is the same as on the note.</p>

On the 19th of April, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I left the casement of the garret fastened with an iron catch; nobody else had been in that garret that day, that I know of; nobody else had any business; no other servants: I went up a little after nine, to put two children to bed; I took up a candle; it was quite dark; I observed the window open, and the trunk gone, which was the side of the window in the garret; the trunk was in the same window that was broke open; on my giving an alarm, in about a quarter of an hour, some persons were brought in custody; I did not go into the empty house which there was next door; when the garret window is open, there is a lead gutter, and a wall above the gutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Is your master a married man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you be precise to the particular time you went up stairs? - It was after nine, I suppose about a quarter of an hour; or it may be more.</p>
               <p>What do you know about the time? - Because I was in the shop; and I asked my mistress if I should put the children to bed; and she asked what it was o'clock; and I looked at the clock; and I said it was past nine.</p>

               <p>You could not, of course, perhaps, see very well beyond the stair-case, without the candle? - But there was some day-light.</p>
               <p>If you had been looking through the window: you do not mean, to be sure, that it might not be light enough out of doors, for you to see the face of any body you knew; you might have distinguished the face of a person who was looking in at the out-side of the window? - If I had a candle, I might.</p>
               <p>Suppose now for instance, the servant at the next house was peeping in at the outside of the window, coming along the leads, could not you have distinguished his face without a candle? - I will not be sure I could not.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time examine his coat, to see if it was rent? - I did, at the Compter, the same night; he never was out of their custody; his coat was rent across the flap, in the main cloth.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that he is the man you had the scuffle with? - Not the least doubt in the world: then I got a ladder and got over the party wall, into the empty house; the street door was shut after he got away from me; I put my hand against it, and found it fast; we found it within-side, on the spring bolt to the lock, that would open with a key; I saw the trunk found; I was in the passage of the empty house: the trunk was brought to me by Wilson, when I was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was darkish; it must be dark; it was a dark evening.</p>

               <p>You seemed at first of all to say that it was darkish, which led me to conclude you did not mean to say it was quite dark? - It was a darkish evening, as we may call it.</p>

               <p>I live at Mr. Campion's, in Cloth-fair: I am a butcher. Mr. Dixon's maid came to our house, and desired me to go to her assistance, somebody had stolen all her clothes; that was a quarter past nine, quite dark; just as they got from the door, I saw Vale jump from the top of the door; whether the door was open or shut, I do not know; I immediately pursued after him.</p>

               <p>How far did you pursue him? - Two hundred yards, to the top of Middle-street; I lost sight of him only turning the corner from our house; I took him in a minute and a half, or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you took on the ruins, was the same man you saw jump from the steps? - Yes; that is the same man; he laid down in the ruins; I took him by the collar, and pulled him up; I asked him how he came to do the fact? he said, what did I mean? I brought him back to Mr. Dixon's; I left him: me and another young chap went to the place, and within a few yards of that place, where I took him, I found a dark lanthorn; and a little further, we found a match and tinder-box in the way that he had ran, from the empty house to the ruins; and a little farther than that, we found a man's shoe and buckle, and gave them to the constable: the prisoner had no hat, nor shoes, nor buckles, when I took him; it might be fifty yards or nearer to the empty house.</p>

               <p>Was any thing else found in your presence? - I found nothing else, nor saw any thing else found.</p>
               <p>What sort of a waistcoat had this man on when you took him? - A red waistcoat; I did not go to the empty house, after I went to the other: I did not see Mr. Dixon examine the coat of Thurley.</p>

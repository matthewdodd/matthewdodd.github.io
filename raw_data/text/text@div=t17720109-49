I met Mr. Smith on the 11th of April, a little after three o'clock. It has been some time since I have seen Smith. He met me, and said, You look pure well; he asked me when I went to Lynn again; I said, I was going down to New-castle; he said, he had a friend who had some goods to go there. I went down with him to see these goods in Whitechapel. He asked me what I would have to drink; I said, a pint of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090038"></xptr> beer. He said, they don't sell beer. I said, half a pint of wine would do. He said, he had a brother had two bales more. His brother came in soon after, a stout portly man; half a pint of wine was called for; he sat about a minute or two, when in came the prisoner and another gentleman like a countryman; it was in a little narrow room backwards, at the three Lemons, Goodman's-field. This country gentleman said he saw this young man at cards one night, and asked him how he came off. He stew about the room like wildfire; said he, I lost so much money. How? Said he, in cutting the cards. I lost 40 or 50 l. but I don't mind that a farthing. What, said he, did my uncle say when I was gone out? Why, that you was an idle young rascal, and would spend all your fortune. But said he, you got a prize, did not you? He said, yes, he got 5000 l. He then proposed to cut for some money. He brought in the cards; all under five was this gentleman's and all above five this man's. Zounds! thinks I, you have a good chance to beat this man; so they went on several times; this countryman won every time. At last this man said, Captain, cut you for me, he wins every time. I said, I beg to be excused, I will have no hand in it; I never played for a sixpence in my life. They said, it is no harm for you to cut. I cut once or twice, and this countryman won. The prisoner said, you are all devils, I will cut no more; I will toss up. He swore again, You are all a pack of lousy scrubby fellows; I will lay any thing you cannot produce forty guineas apiece at one time. Smith sitting by me, said, Captain, have not you got so much? I said, No. He said, Could you not get it? I said, Yes, I could in an hour. Then he said, Lay it. I was foolish enough to lay; I paid the money down, and I went cut, and Smith and the other countryman went away with me. I put down three guineas; O! said Smith, I will take care they shall not run away with the wager; I will take care of you. I went away innocently enough. I went into the city, and drew my money from the banker's. This stout fellow went with me, and we received the cash. As soon as we got into the house, he said, Captain, you are too late by two or three minutes, it shall be a drawn wager; (though we were within the time) they shan't use you ill. We returned the money. Then they proposed play at cutting for a sum; I said, I would rather go about my business. One of them by me, said, You shall not go yet, captain. I saw a little woman put her hand to the door, and push the bolt too. When this was done, O! thinks I, I am gone; then I began to be terrified. Thinks I, now what will become of me; I shall be certainly lost. After this they went on and cut away, sometimes for two guineas, then five, then sixteen. My money held out longer than the countryman's and this Smith's brother's; then they had nothing but mine to work for. I thought to keep some back; one of them minded me. I told them all mine was gone. I lost 41 l. 2 s. 9 d. I had drank nothing that blessed day but one glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Council. Oh, it was a blessed day indeed!</p>
               <p>Abbot. I wanted to keep this money fast. This stout fellow stood close to me; he said, You have more money yet, out with it; d - n me, turn it out; and up with his fist at me. I was obliged to take it out. As soon as it was done, I saw no money put to it; no wager betted, nor card cut; but the prisoner, as soon as I had put down two guineas and 3 s. 6 d. swept it up, and said, that is mine. I stood up and said, surely you will not take my money from me in this manner? I said to Smith, You know I am a poor man; you have brought me here to ruin me. The prisoner stood there all the time, and he took the whole tote of the money. After this Smith said to me, You shall not lose your money; I have a merchant over the way owes me 100 l. I will draw that and pay you. I went out with Smith. I said, Where is the house? He said, Not far off; and so brought me on, till he turned the corner by the Magdalene. There was a little alehouse by the Swan; he said, Go in there, and call for a pint of beer, and I will go to the house, it is over the way. I went in; I could drink none. When he got out, I went and peep'd round the corner; when I peep'd, he ran as hard as he could. I ran heard after him, but before I came at him he had turned the corner. I never saw any more of him. I came up to London last November with corn, and on the 4th of November I had been to dinner, and I saw this Smith, and a man with boots and sours walking together. I seized Smith directly. I said, Do you know poor Abbot now? He said, no. I am an Irishman. I came up last sessions to attend on him, and walking down the Strand on the 5th of December, I came plump on him. I said, Ah, young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090039"></xptr> man, what have you done with my money you got from me? He said, I don't know any thing of you. I took him before the Justice. The other man drew his hand from me, and ran away as fast as he could. He ran up a court; I called stop thief; they ran round me, and the man got off. We had the prisoner before Sir

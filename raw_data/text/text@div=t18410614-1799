                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Union-road, in the parish of Claphara—I keep the house, and am a general shopkeeper. On Saturday night, the 12th of June, I went to bed at twelve o'clock—I was the last up—there is a cellar door outside my house, which opened into a enclosure in front of the house, but which had been thrown open—it had been a front garden, but the pales were taken away before this—the flap fastened with three bolts, and a wooden bar across it—it was all secure at twelve o'clock that night—the cellar goes under the whole of the house—there is an entrance to it from the kitchen, I secured that also—I keep some goods in the cellar—every thing was safe at twelve o'clock on Satur<lb></lb>day night, and on Monday morning, about a quarter before seven o'clock, my attention was directed to the flap—I found the ring had been raised—I lifted it up, went into the cellar, and missed a bladder of lard, twenty-eight pounds of sugar, a small quantity of butter, and a side of bacon—the entrance from the kitchen had not been disturbed—there is an "S" marked on the lard, and the bacon is marked—I gave information to the police—here is my name on the towel now produced which was round the butter, on the top of the tub, and this sugar<lb></lb>bag I can swear to—I have no doubt the bacon is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant of the same division of police as the prisoner and Halter.

               <p>Q. When had you seen the things last?</p>
               <p>J. Farrel. They were there when the prisoner came into the house, and I lifted the box the Sunday following into another place; it then was heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss the things?</p>
               <p>J. Farrel. I missed them on Saturday was seven-night after they came: when we went out that time I was speaking of, he left word, if his wife should come he would be in presently. I ran out, and left the candle in the room, to get somebody to take him, there being nobody in the house; before I came again he had opened the parlour door and took the key and was gone. On the Monday morning following I went with a bit of the same of one of the gowns, and found it at Mr. Beesley's a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane. I found also a yellow petticoat, and another gown, at Mr. Frear's in Budge-Row. I took the woman and carried her to Justice Fielding's; there she confessed where the rest of the things were; that some of them were at another pawnbroker's in Aldersgate street. [The Goods were produced in court, and deposed to] I had observed, when they were at my house, the woman would carry things out in her apron.</p>

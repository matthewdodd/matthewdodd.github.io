On Monday, the 16th of October, I hung some linen on a line in my master's orchard, at eleven o'clock—there were some shirts marked G. H. T., some neckcloths, some boys' shirts, and night-gowns, some ladies' apparel, and some pillow-cases—about two o'clock I received a communication from my mistress, and missed all these articles from the line—I saw them again last Wednesday at the watch-house—they were the things that I had hung up in my mater's orchard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of my father, Thomas Hutton, a silk and worsted manufacturer, in Newgate-street.

               <p>evening, the 14th of Jan., while I was there, I saw the prisoner leave the premises—his pockets looked rather bulky—I followed him down Newgate-street, into Huggin-lane—he saw us in Carey-lane, and commenced running-Sickle followed, took him, and found on him 3lbs. of crimson worsted, part in each pocket—it was my father's—he had no right to have any about him-when we took him to Guildhall, he said some Welshman had a spite against him, and he had no doubt he had put it into his pocket.</p>

On Monday morning I found a bundle of worsted was broken, and some gone—I have compared this worsted, and to the best of my belief it corresponds exactly—the prisoner had no right with it—I do not know where he was working that day.</p>

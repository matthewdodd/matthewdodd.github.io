                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, carrying on business with my partners, in Wigmore street. Our premises are part in Wigmore-street, and part in Welbeck-street—I reside on the premises—about the beginning of Dec., we were making alterations in the premises, so as to throw in the house, No. 65, Welbeck-street, and labourers were engaged there, and had been that day—there is a large shop door which enters from Wigmore-street into the shop, and communicates with the house part of the premises in Wigmore-street—there is also a door at the house, No. 65, Welbeck-street—on 10th Dec., the party wall had been thrown down, so as to communicate from No. 64, Welbeck-street, into the premises in Wigmore-street—at the back of the premises in Wigmore-street, are leads which cover the rooms on the ground floor—on 10th Dec., I retired to rest at 11 o'clock; my ser<lb></lb>vants retired at the same time—the shop had been fastened up previously; the door in Wigmore-street was fastened also, but it only fastens with a patent latch, there is no bolt to it—on the morning of the 11th, I was awoke by the ringing of the bell in Wigmore-street—my bedroom is on the second floor, at the corner of Welbeck-street—I looked out at the window, and saw a policeman in Welbeck-street—I went down to the door of No. 64, Wel<lb></lb>beck-street, and found the door standing open, and the prisoner at the door in his policeman's uniform; another policeman was there also—as I came down I heard the prisoner say to the other policeman, "Do not you leave, if you do, I will report you"—I spoke to the prisoner first—there is a large well hole, which leads down to the basement of No. 65, without any railing; and I said, "Last night I saw a candle left burning there, by the basket of one of the builders; we will go down here and see whose basket it was by which the candle stood; it may lead to some discovery"—I then went down the ladder of the well hole, to the basement floor, and found the basket and candle, and said, "We will take away this basket; I will take it into my private room, and I will find in the morning whose basket it is"—the pri<lb></lb>soner went down with me (I had sent a person to put the candle out when I discovered it)—I afterwards discovered that the basket belonged to one of the gas fitters, one of my own workmen—you can easily get from the base<lb></lb>ment to the street by coming up the ladder—the prisoner said, "I will carry the basket"—he went forward, and did not go up the ladder that we had come down by, to my surprise, but went up a new staircase which was in an unfinished state; there are about four steps, and then the frame of a landing, but nothing to step on—that staircase brings you up into No. 65, Welbeck-street, to the ground floor; it is the intended communication from the ground floor to the basement—the house looks east at the corner of</p>

               <p>Wigmore-street and Welbeck-street—the well hole is inside the house (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out the different positions on a plan</hi>)—I came up the staircase which brought me up to the ground floor of No. 65, Welbeck-street again—I then went over the show room on the ground floor, which extends over the premises in Wigmore-street, and also to the back, but we went merely over the premises in Wigmore-street—a party wall had been taken down, and in the partition an aperture was made by which we go through at the west end of the other house; we went through, and then went eastward the whole length to the lamp room—nothing appeared to have been dis<lb></lb>turbed—I said to the prisoner, "Here is nothing disturbed, everything is precisely as it was"—he made no observation upon that, and we returned; I intending to take him out into the street again, to let him out—in doing so he came to a little enclosure in which there was a desk belonging to one of my sons, and he said, "Let us look in here"—it is a little recess between the shop and No. 65; it forms an aperture in the party wall—it is visible from the shop, and there is a railing, a little gallery—I looked at my son's desk, it had been apparently disturbed, the papers inside had been moved; it was shut, but not locked—I said, "Well, here is nothing gone;" for I had no suspicion of money whatever—he said, "Look here;" referring to a drawer which was standing open on the left hand, under the desk; the bolt was shot up, and it evidently had been forced open by some means—I had no suspicion that money had been kept in that drawer—I said, "It has evidently been broken open"—we then went into an adjoining office belong<lb></lb>ing to my eldest son; it leads towards Welbeck-street; the prisoner went in first—I did not cause him to go in there; I think I said, "We will go to the next desk," but I do not remember—I lifted up the desk, and saw the papers in great confusion, but said, "They have taken nothing however"—he then said, "Look here," pointing his light down to a drawer below the desk which had been forced open; he said also, "Here are two porte-monnaies lying open on a chair, and empty"—I did not know to whom they belonged, but I suspected to my son—we then went into the shop where the clerk's desks are, and he directed his light to another little drawer under the first desk which we came to—he went first, of necessity, to the clerks' desks, for on entering my second son's counting house, it is so narrow, that whoever went first must continue first—I did not direct him which way to go; he went forward into the shop first—there was another small drawer which had been forced also—he then went forward, I am not sure who went first, to another office, where the writing clerks are, and there he pointed my atten<lb></lb>tion to a cash box which had been broken open—an erasing knife was lying by the side of the cash box, it had been broken evidently in the attempt to open the cash box—I was not still under the impression that nothing had been taken when I saw that the drawers had been forced; but my impres<lb></lb>sion was, that they were very trifling sums—we kept money in that cash box, we generally give out 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. among the clerks for change, and that I imagined would be the extent of the loss—I conducted the prisoner to the door by which he had entered, and the other policeman was still there—just before he went out we had been up stairs, into the drawing room of No. 65, and found the window open—the glass had been taken out of that window for the convenience of the workmen going backwards and forwards—the window opens on to the leads of the premises in Wigmore-street—the leads are bounded on one side by Easly-news—on 10th Dec., the builders were employed in going out of the room in Wigmore-street, over those leads to the mews; but the builders who ascend that ladder were not employed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185701050045"></xptr>
               <p>there, but in a different show room; it was not the builders employed in Welbeck-street, but others—the prisoner went through the window by means of two planks that were there; he walked up the planks, looked about and came back, and said, "One of your windows is open"—I said, "We will find that out, I can see none;" and I went into the house again, and asked the servants if one of the windows was open—I found that it was not one of my windows, but one at No. 20, Wigmore-street—my drawing room window was open—we examined the street door, but there were no marks of violence whatever—the other doors were quite secure—the inspector came to me about 9 o'clock next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed at Mr. Benham's. I have a desk there where I put money—on the night of 10th Dec., when I went away, I left there 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and seven penny pieces—it was not locked—when I came in the morning the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was gone, and the coppers left—I saw a shilling at the station house, which I certainly believe to be a shilling that was in my drawer on the night of 10th Dec.—I noticed it when a porter brought it to me—a piece was knocked out of the edge of it, and it was rather black on the right hand side of the woman—I certainly believe it to be the one, but I did not swear to it at the police court—I think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shilling.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> You say you could not swear to it at the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say I could not, I said I would not—I do not swear to it now, still I believe it to be the shilling—there is something dark at the right hand of the woman; there was, I do not know whether there is now or not, it has been through a good many hands since I first saw it—it appeared to me as if a person such as a sweep might have had it in his fingers, and so left the mark on it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 288). On the night of the robbery my beat was on the right hand side of Welbeck-street—that is adjoining the prisoner's beat, he took one side of Welbeck-street, and I the other—I know the prisoner's beat, I believe it describes the figure 8—he starts from the corner of Wigmore-street and Marylebone-lane, goes down Marylebone-lane, then up Bentinck-street, and up one side of Welbeck-street, he then goes down Wigmore-street as far as Wimpole-street, he then turns down Wimpole-street till he comes to Little Welbeck-street, goes along Little Welbeck-street, and then up on the other side of Welbeck-street—I sup<lb></lb>pose he then goes into Eastley's-mews—in going back he would go through Eastley's-mews—that is the whole of his beat—I should think it would take him about twenty or twenty-five minutes, walking at a usual pace—I</p>

               <p>saw the prisoner that night a few minutes after 12 o'clock—his duty commenced at 12 o'clock—I saw him about a quarter, or rather better past 12 o'clock, at the corner of Little Welbeck-street in Welbeck-street—there is a shutter-box there, where we put away our capes if we do not want them—he and I did so that night—we then walked a short way together through Little Welbeck-street towards Wimpole-street—we had some little common conversation together—he said that he had spent 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his week's money, and had given the rest to his wife, and that she had laid it out in domestic purposes, grocery, and things for the house—the wages were paid the day before—he was merely saying that he had spent 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his money, that his wife rather objected to it, and he had given her the rest, and he said he had no money—when he said he had given his wife the money, and she had spent it, I merely said that I did not lay out the money myself, but I knew pretty well what things cost, and that was the whole of the conversation, and I went on round my beat—I saw him again that night at 1 o'clock, as near as I can say, as I came round my beat—I met him in Little Welbeck-street—as I went one way he was passing another—I saw him again at a few minutes before 3 o'clock, just upon the same place, just as he was going down—each time that I had met him I met him there, passing round—he went one way and I the other—I did not see him between 1 o'clock and a few minutes to 3—I had been round my beat, and through Little Welbeck-street as usual, and I had not seen him—I saw him at 4 o'clock at the corner of Welbeck-street, at Mr. Benham's house—that was the time for me to go off my beat—I came down on the left hand side of Welbeck-street, and passed over there—he was at the corner of Welbeck-street and Wigmore-street, with his lamp turned on—he called my attention, and said there was a street door open—I saw that the street door was wide open, standing back—he was standing close by the door—it was the first door from Wigmore-street—he rang the bell—Mr. Benham came down, and the prisoner went into the house—I went in afterwards—I did not go over the place with him, I stood in the unoccupied part of the house, that is, the house that is being taken into the premises—I stood so as to have a view of the street door—we went in at that door—no person could have left the premises by that door after the prisoner went in, without my seeing them.</p>

               <p>in calling this person more frequently than me—before I was examined before the Magistrate, I made a report to the inspector—that was on Thursday, the 11th—I made a verbal report to Mr. Hughes, our superin<lb></lb>tendent, and a written report was given in to Inspector Mackerell in the usual way—I wrote it—I told Mr. Hughes about meeting the prisoner at the early part of the night, a little after 12 o'clock—I told him that the prisoner had told me he had got no money—I was examined twice before the Magistrate—I told Mr. Hughes that the prisoner said he had no money between 12 and half past 1 o'clock—I cannot say whether Mr. Mackerell was standing near when I made the communication to Super<lb></lb>intendent Hughes—my period of going off duty was 4 o'clock—when the prisoner went into the house with Mr. Benham, I did not want to go off my beat and go away, I went in with him—I do not remember the prisoner telling me to wait there, or saying if I went away he would report me—I do not remember his saying anything about reporting—there was no other officer at the door beside myself and the prisoner—he did not say, "If you leave here before I come back I will report you"—he might have said so, I did not hear him—he was walking on to go into the premises, and I went in behind Mr. Benham and him.</p>

I was on duty as sergeant to visit the different police<lb></lb>men on their beats—the prisoner was on duty that night on the beat that has been described—I first saw him on his beat between half past 12 and 1 o'clock; he was then working his beat all right—I had no conversation with him, I only called out, "All right?" and he answered me "All right"—I saw him again at a few minutes before 3 o'clock at the corner of Welbeck-street and Wigmore-street, Mr. Benham's corner—I asked him if it was all right—he said it was, and I told him there was a penny to pay for the widow of a late constable—it is a custom to collect a penny from all the officers in the force for the widows—he said, "I do not think I have got one"—I said, "Give me a shilling, I have plenty of <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi>"—he then pulled a penny from his great coat pocket, and gave me, at the same time he said, "I am not short of a shilling either," and he pulled out his pocket book, and opened it, and it was full of large silver—I did not form any opinion as to how much there was—I said to him, "You have plenty of money, Compton"—he said, "Yes, will you have half a crown to drink my health?"—I said, "No, I do not want your money," and left him to go from him, and he slipped a half crown into my great coat pocket—my wrapper was in it, and my pocket was a little way open, and he dropped the half crown into it—he told me it was there, or else I should not have known it—he said, "It is in your pocket"—I took it out, and threw it on the pavement, and asked him the reason why he took such a liberty as that, that I did not want his money, and I ought to report him for it—he had never offered me any money before—I told him to leave his beat at 4 o'clock, and go in reserve to the station to look after the prisoners—I then proceeded on my rounds—it was my turn to go off at 4 o'clock, and go to the station—I saw the prisoner again, a little after 4 o'clock, at Mr. Benham's door, with a lamp turned on—I was not close to him—I called to him, and told him not to forget to go in as a reserve man—he was not going off till 6 o'clock, but the reserve men</p>

I have done nothing"—I said, "I did not find the gold that several persons say they saw in your possession this morning"—he said, "I had no gold, and I do not care if 100 people swear that I had"—I made no reply—the charge was read to him shortly after by the inspector on duty, and the prisoner in my hearing said that he was innocent—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the money I got from Carruthers'—one crown piece, twenty half crowns, four florins, thirty-four shillings, and six sixpences—I then returned Mr. Carruthers his 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I went to the</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the New Inn, Marylebone-lane. On the morning of 11th Dec., about 6 o'clock, the prisoner came to my house with five or six other constables—I have a bagatelle table up stairs, and they went up stairs when they came in—the bar is down stairs—the prisoner asked me to give him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for some silver, and gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and two half sovereigns—there was a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, some half crowns, florins, shillings, and sixpences—I placed the money in a cash box, and gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for it—there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in the cash box when I put the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in; it was silver which I had taken the day before—after that the prisoner went up stairs again to the other constables—at the time he gave me the two half sovereigns, I saw over ten sovereigns and half sovereigns in his hand—he took that gold out of his pocket, I believe—I did not take notice where he took the silver from—I afterwards went to the cash box, and took some silver out to give some one change for a sovereign: that left 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in the cash box—Mackrill called on me that morning with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I had given to the prisoner, and I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver that was then in the cash box—I had put no silver in after the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 162). I was on duty at the adjoin<lb></lb>ing beat to the prisoner's on the night of the robbery, from 10 till 4 o'clock—I saw the prisoner three times that night at 1 o'clock, again at 3, and again at 4 o'clock—I did not see him between 1 and 3 o'clock—I go round my beat every quarter of an hour.</p>

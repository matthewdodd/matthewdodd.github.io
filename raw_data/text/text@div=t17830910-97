               <p>Was any body running after them when you first saw them? - Nobody at all.</p>

               <p>What is the consequence? - Doing wrong.</p>
               <p>Then I hope you will not do wrong now, but speak the truth? - Yes, I saw one of these boys, Popplewell, the inside of Mr. Creed's court yard, on a Wednesday, about a quarter past four o'clock; the other was outside the court-yard, and took the things over; Popplewell gave the things over to Owen; the parlour window was on the jar, I was against the rails before the house; I was going into the fields and I saw them.</p>
               <p>Did they see you? - Yes, after they gave these things to the other boy, they were taking the other case out of the window; they run away the moment they saw me, I went and rang the bell, I saw the gentlewoman herself, and I told her the boys were taking the things out of the window.</p>
               <p>What became of the case? - It was dropped under the brick wall, I saw them take it away, and they lifted it over and dropped it under the brick wall; I did not see them drop it.</p>

            . I lodge at the Hungerford coffee-house, Strand. On the 27th of May, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18230625-4-crimeloc26">James-street, Covent-garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230625-4-crimeloc26" type="placeName" value="James-street, Covent-garden"></interp>

I said I should give her in charge if she persisted in annoying me; she then desired something to drink; we were passing the <placeName id="t18230625-4-crimeloc27">King's Arms</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230625-4-crimeloc27" type="placeName" value="King's Arms"></interp>

She took the purse out; I saw it in her hand - she ran from me into a crowd of persons, who were in the room; I kept my eye fixed on her, and followed her. I seized her, and drew her out of the crowd; she told me to let her go, and denied robbing me. I made towards the street door, and gave her in charge. She entreated me not to expose her, but if I would go to the next street she would return the purse; I followed her there, keeping hold of her; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250005"></xptr>gave me the purse; I examined it, and found two of the sovereigns were taken out of it; she had turned round before she gave it me; she might have taken it out then, or when she ran into the crowd. I told her she had robbed me of two sovereigns, and if she did not return them I would charge the watch with her - she denied it. I met a watchman, and gave her to him - she appeared agitated at the watch-house, and kept moving her mouth about - the watchman seized her by neck, and one sovereign fell from her mouth. She appeared from the motion of her throat to have swallowed the other. I found a farthing put into my purse instead of the sovereign. I was perfectly sober.</p>

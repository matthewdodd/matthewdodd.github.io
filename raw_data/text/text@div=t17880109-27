               <p>I am a watchman; I was called in at six in the morning to this house by the pot-boy; I went in, and stood by the side of the bar door five or ten minutes; the prosecutrix said, her bar door had been broke open, and robbed of two large table-spoons, and a black cloak out of the bar, and her till broke open, and all the halfpence taken out; I went up into the garret, I pulled all the clothes off the bed to find what was lost, and I could find nothing there; I looked under the bed and I saw nothing there; I looked about the room, and could see nothing; I went to an old cradle that stood at one end of the room, and I lifted up a man's coat which is here, there I saw the two table-spoons lay, and the half-pence, and a small tea-spoon; I said to the prisoner, what have you in your pocket? he said, it was a black handkerchief; he took it out, and chucked it over the head of the cradle, and it was the black cloak.</p>

               <p>I went up to bed to see if my bed-fellow had got any candle; there was a soldier that was quartered in the house, and a coachmaker that lodged in the house; there was no locks to the doors; I went down for a candle, and my candle went out, and I lighted it at the lower room, then I went to bed; in the morning about six, I was going to work, I am a printer by trade, and they came and took me; it was a black handkerchief that I took out of my pocket, not a cloak; I have the black handkerchief round my neck now.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the soldier here? - He and the coach-maker were in the room at the time the property was found, which has been produced by the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know about this? - A. On the 10th of March, I was sitting in a little room level with the shop, I heard a noise similar to a window being broke, I immediately ran into the shop to see if it was my window that was broke, and found it was my shop window, and two umbrellas taken out; I missed one immediately, because I had sold it, and was to have taken it home that night; I went out, and a person of the name of Spearing delivered the prisoner to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark at this time? - A. Nearly dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You could see the face of the boy when he was delivered to you? - A. Yes, I remember him very well.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Bedfordbury, and this gentleman came and touched me on the shoulder, and brought me to that gentleman's house, and said I had taken two umbrellas; I am quite innocent of it.</p>

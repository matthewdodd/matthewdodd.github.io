                  </hi>. I am a barrister. On the 8th of May, between four and five o'clock, I was in Dover-street—I was informed by a woman that my pocket had been picked by three boys—I turned back, and went into Albemarle-street, where I asked a servant if he had seen three boys—he gave me information—I saw three boys at a distance—I pursued and laid hold of one of them—I taxed him with having robbed me, and at the same time called out, "Stop thief!"—he told me he was not with the others, and persuaded me to let him go—in the meantime, my calling had attracted some persons, and they took the prisoner, who was one of the boys—this pair of gloves fell from him, which are my property—the rest of the property I have not recovered—I lost my purse with five sovereigns in it—my seals were attached to my purse, which was with my gloves in my hind pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 129.) The prisoner was given into my charge—as I was taking him to the station, he tried several times to get his right-hand to his pocket, and he pulled out these gloves, which dropped on the ground—I stooped to take them up, as I had got hold of his left-hand, and he kicked them off the pavement—in my trying to get them, he made his escape, and got a few paces but I took him again.</p>

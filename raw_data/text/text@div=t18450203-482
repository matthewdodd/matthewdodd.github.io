                  </hi>. I am an officer of the London Docks. Between the Western and Eastern Docks there is a small dock, called the Tobacco Dock—between the Western Dock and the Tobacco Dock there is a bridge—a person standing on it can see a shed which is near the Eastern-quay warehouse—there are two cranes near the shed—the roof of the shed is not so high as the warehouse—a person by the cranes could get on the roof of the shed, and then to the top of the warehouse—the eastern side of the Eastern-quay warehouse is bounded by Bird-street, and the wall of the warehouse on the Bird-street side is very steep, and is thirty-five feet high—in going over the roof of the shed to the top of the warehouse there are several lanterns—my attention hat been called to two of them in particular—they shut with a swing sash, which is fastened by a cord—&amp; person out<lb></lb>side, by cutting the cord, could get into the warehouse, and they can cut the cord outside—Bird-street and Tent-street meet, and form a right angle near the East-quay warehouse, and there is in that angle a privy, the dome of which is fifteen feet high, and the top of the wall of the Eatt-quay ware-house is ten feet above that—a person could easily get down there by means of a rope or line—there is a lantern on the top there—opposite that there is Johnson-street, which is at right angles with Bird-street—on Saturday morning, the 4th of Dec, I went on the roof of the warehouse, between four and five o'clock—I looked at several of the lantern—I did not find that the cord of any of them was cut then, but between nine and ten I found that a cord of one of them was cut, and near to it I found tome lucifer-matches, some of which appeared to have been tried to be ignited—there was another lantern nearer to Tent-street opposite Johnson-street, the cord of which had been cut—I found some small pieces of leaf tobacco on the roof, in a direction from the lantern which I found open nearest to Tent-street—they had carried the tobacco from there to the light opposite Johnson-street—I went to the angle formed by Bird-street and Tent-street, and found an iron hook fastened in the wall, under the cap-stone—this is the took, and this thimble and rope were attached to it, and the thimble was lying over the edge of the cap-stone, towards the street—I could per<lb></lb>ceive a cord had been drawn through it, and there were marks on the cap<lb></lb>itone of the rope having been drawn over that—I examined the tobacco warehouse, and found one hogshead of tobacco, with the head out lying almost immediately under the lantern nearest to Tent-street.</p>

On Monday, the 30th of Dec., J saw Johnson and Clark there with Mr. Salter—Mr. Salter told me, in their presence, to take the key, and go to No. 3, Johnson-street, and show them a room that was to let there, which belonged to Mr. Salter—I took them—they looked at an empty garret there—there was no bed in it, and no grate—after that they went back with me to Mr. Salter's—they had asked me if I knew what the room went at per week—they both took a part in asking—about a quarter of an hour after that I delivered the key to Clark, in Johnson's presence—I have seen that key since, produced by Clements, the officer—this is the key I delivered to Clark—they did not tell me what they wanted the room</p>

On Friday evening, the 3rd of Jan., about eight o'clock, or a few minutes after, I saw Cantelo on the top stairs—there was a man with him, and they were trying the top door—after they tried the door I came out of my rcom, and Cantelo asked if I would lend him my key—he said his sister, or the woman, had given him a wrong key—I said "You can have my key, but I do not know that it will open the door"—I gave him my key—I held the candle in my other hand—he opened the door, and they went into the room—Cantelo came and returned me my key—they remained in the room a little time, and then went down stairs—I was at home the following morning, when Hurley was taken—during the night I had heard footsteps going up and down continually to that room over my head—on the following morning three men came up the stairs as I stood at my door, talking to Nash—they said, as they passed up, "We will go and see how the fire goes on"—I said, as they passed, u That is the man I gave the key to," meaning Cantelo, who was one of them—I think Johnson was one of the others—I do not know which of them spoke about the fire.</p>

At half-past twelve at night, on the 3rd of Jan., I was at the window, and saw two men standing at the corner of Johnson-street and Bird-street—they stood there about five minutes, and then went away—about two o'clock in the morning I saw two men come from No. 3, Johnson-street, which is next door but two—they went towards the dock wall, and were joined by a man and a woman near the wall—I told my uncle—he and I went down after the men, but they were gone—about three o'clock I heard a noise like something falling from the dock wall in Bird-street, at the bottom of Johnson-street—I looked in the direction where something had fallen, and saw a female come from Bird-street and go into No. 3, Johnson-street, and directly after I saw a man go into No. 3—he had something with him—I saw two other men go in there—I did not see any one come out.</p>

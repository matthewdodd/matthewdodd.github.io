The prisoner lodged there—on Saturday night, about ten o'clock, be came to pay his rent—my mother asked him for some more money—he said he would not give her more till he got better conveniences—she said she would not give him any more conveniences, because what she had given him were made away with; that a feather bolster which had been in his room was made away with—he said, "No such thing;" that if it was, it was me that made away with it—I said it was no such thing, and caught hold of his arm by the sleeve of his shirt, to make him stand and listen to me—he pulled himself away, and a piece of his sleeve, about the breadth of my hand, tore out—it was very tender—he went up-stairs—I heard him going up—I went up three or four minutes afterwards, to know the reason, and saw him outside his own door—I did not speak a word to him—I had to pass his door to go up to the next floor—he struck me a blow with a hatchet on my fore<lb></lb>head—I became insensible—no altercation had taken place between us—I was in the hospital ten days.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 2, New-way, Westminster. On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 13th April, I saw the, prisoner at Mrs. Hefferman's—he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rent—there was more owing, and she said, "Will you pay some off the score?"—he said, "No, not until I get better conveniences"—she said, "I cannot give you any more conveniences, for your wife sells them as fast as I give them to you"—the prosecutrix came in—he said that his wife said Ann Hefferman sold the bolster—she stood in her own defence, and said, "I never sold any bolster, nor <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> belonging to my mother"—she caught him by the shirt sleeve, and said, "Will you stand until I tell you all about it?"—I did not see the shirt torn—he went up-stairs—in a few minutes she said, "I will go up to Mr. Neal's wife, and will know all about it"—she went, and knocked at the door—Neal opened it, and came out with a chopper in his hand, and knocked her on the forehead with it—she called out, "Murder!" and I went up, and saw her getting the blow on the forehead—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi> Neal, don't you do it any more"—he said, "I will, I will kill and slaughter at I go"—he gave me two strokes, and struck her again on the arm—I went to try to protect her, and got my finger nearly chopped off—I saw no sign of liquor about the prisoner—the light went out—I went down for one, and showed the constable up-stairs—the prosecutrix became insensible—she stumbled, and lost a great deal of blood—she gave Neal in charge, and the policeman took her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there with a scalp-wound on the left side of the forehead—it was very deep—it was not bleeding then, but she was covered with blood—a very large portion of the bone was exposed; it was about two inches long, and of a very dangerous nature indeed—this chopper is a very likely instrument to have inflicted it—on the Monday I considered her too ill to go before the Magistrate—she went on the Wednesday, and returned and remained till the following Tuesday, and then went out of her own accord—I told her I did not consider her out of danger—the blow went off obliquely, if the axe had fallen perpendicularly, it would most likely have fractured her skull; and from the appearance and the force would most pro<lb></lb>bably have killed her.</p>
               <p>(Robert Greig, a plasterer, and Patrick M'Carthy, of Westminster, gave the prisoner a good character).</p>

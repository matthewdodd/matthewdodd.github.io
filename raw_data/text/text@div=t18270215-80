            . I am a watchman at Mile-end. I was with Palmer on the morning of the 1st of February, about one o'clock; I saw some lead in the corner; I was not there more than a minute before the two prisoners came to the place where it was placed; I had a full opportunity of seeing them; I looked round by the shop window, and saw the lead taken up; when I got near them one looked over his shoulder; I was about to take them both, but they ran away - I took my cutlass, and struck Cain on his hat; before I could get up close to him he made his escape; I called to Palmer - they ran up Globe-lane, and escaped into the fields. The next morning I saw them, and knew them to be the persons - as such I took them up.</p>

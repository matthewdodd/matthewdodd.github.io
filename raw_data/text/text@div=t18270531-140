            . I am a watchman of Shoreditch. On the 7th of April, about a quarter-past five o'clock, I was coming off duty and saw the prisoner running with a bag at his back, about one hundred and forty yards from Mrs. Goodwin's - I and my partner pursued him, he ran down a very bad place, and we lost sight of him for a short time. We found the bag over a fence and his shoes near it - he was taken in the chimney of an empty house. When he came to the watch-house, he said "These are not my shoes- I shan't have them." I said "You had better put them on," he did so - he said a cap, which I picked up, was not his. I said he had better put it on, which he did; they both fitted him well - the bag contained two quartern loaves, a plate, some butter, three aprons, and a towel.</p>

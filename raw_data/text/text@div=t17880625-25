               <p>I know the prisoner; he worked for me about six months; I found a parcel of things, as many as a man can stand under, at his lodgings, by a search warrant.</p>
               <p>(All the things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner was taken into custody; he fell a crying, and begged for mercy; said he would be a faithful servant to me, and never serve me so again; he said, I should have no reason to repent of overlooking it, if I would be so good to forgive him, and take him into my service again; I asked him how he could expect forgiveness from me, when I had been so very much distressed; I told him, I could not do any such thing; I had been almost ruined; I was present at the apprehending of the prisoner, and I knew the things.</p>

               <p>No man upon earth can swear to that piece of iron; it is a piece of new bar-iron; that watch-case that lays there, the boy brought out one day to burn, and he gave it me; I took it home, and had it repaired, and kept it on the mantle-piece, and the half-boots he was going publicly to sell to the shop's company; they were all mouldy; I bought them for six pence; the witness knows that; as to the other tools, Mr. Smith knows that he never checked me for carrying tools in my pocket; I had several articles; I was paid off from a man of war; I have a whole chest of tools; and I did my endeavour to do a little business for myself when I was out of work; I never took any thing with intent to keep it; the Monday before I was taken, I went to six a gate, and I did not return to the shop that night, there is a whole chest of tools now at the justices.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the apprentice boy offer to sell the half-boots? - I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Were these half boots left about the shop, mouldy and not used? - I never saw them mouldy.</p>
               <p>Were they left in the shop for the apprentice to do what he pleased with? - No, they were left off to be mended, and the apprentice might wear them; I cannot say he did not; I never saw him wear them; he seldom works with me; I know nothing of the watch-case.</p>

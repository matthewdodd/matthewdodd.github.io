On the morning of the 21st of April, about one o'clock, I was on duty in the Edgeware-road—I saw the prisoner in company with two females, whom I knew to be prosti<lb></lb>tutes—the prisoner had a bundle and a shovel under one of his arms, I cannot say which, and his other arm was round one of the females—I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he had in the bundle—I was in my dress as a policeman, and had my cape on at the time—the prisoner asked me what business I had with him—I told him I wished to see what the bundle contained—he refused to let me see—I said if he did not, I would bring him to the station-house—I stepped up before him, and he instantly</p>

I was on duty on the opposite side of the Edgeware-road, about five minutes after one o'clock, on the morning of the 21st of April—I was coming from the Harrow-road, in the direction of Chapel-street—I saw several persons standing at the corner of Chapel-street, but I did not know who they were, or what they were—all at once I saw a scuffle take place, from the pavement into the middle of the road—I saw the prisoner and the constable go from the pavement into the middle of the road—I heard something drop, which proved to be these trowels—I then saw the prisoner with the shovel raised, and my brother constable was <hi rend="italic">singing out</hi>. for help—I ran across the road—the prisoner struck the shovel on the ground before I got over—he was then lifting it up again, when I struck him between the two shoulders, but the blow not taking the effect which I intended, he immediately turned round to me, and struck me a violent blow with the shovel, on the hat, which stunned me, and my hat fell off, but I did not fall—I was about to <hi rend="italic">come up</hi>. at him again, when I saw he had got the shovel again raised, and was <hi rend="italic">coming</hi>. at me; and I found that if I advanced any further, my head would have been severed in two, my hat being off at the time—he found that I retreated back, and he then made his escape—he ran down Burns'-place—I was unacquainted with that place, and it being dark I sprung my rattle, but did not then overtake the prisoner—I saw him, in about an</p>

                  </hi>. I am store—keeper at Buckingham Palace. The pri<lb></lb>soner Nicholls was employed there as a labourer, and I placed confidence in him—there was a box containing lace in one of the top rooms—Nicholls had access to it—It was old silver-gilt lace, and of a particular pattern—the box was nailed and screwed—I did not see the lace put in, but I opened the box, I think in November last; I saw the lace safe then—then box was full—It was again fastened down in the same manner, with screws and nails—I opened it again on the day after the prisoners were taken—I believe it was the 1st of September—I found it had been opened, as the screws were so very slack and the nails had been forced—I opened it in the presence of a witness, and a quantity of the lace was missing—I cut a piece of the lace off, and gave it to the officer—It was His Majesty's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Smart, a refiner, in Princes-street. I do all the-work in the back shop, where lace is burned—I remember the prisoner Shadford coming to my master's on the 8th of June—he brought a quantity of silver-gift gimp lace, which had been used—I burnt it for him—It came to rather better than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make any inquiry of him them—he came again the same afternoon, and brought some more lace, unburned—I asked him where it came from—he said it came off some coats; that he was a tailor by trade, and he had taken it in exchange—I told him I never saw such lace come off coats—he said that was very likely, as they were foreign—he told me some name which I do not recollect, and said his address was No. 55, St. Martin's-lane—I burnt that lace, and he went into the shop and received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. some odd silver for that—he then continued to come to our place once or twice in a fortnight, and brought burnt lace, which appeared to me the same as the first he brought, as far as I could judge, but the burning would a little alter its appearance—a person would lose by burning the lace himself, as he does not understand it—on the 22nd of August he brought two parcels of lace, which had been burnt—I observed to him that the lace had not been properly cleaned, and he gave it me to clean for him—I said, "This is some of the same sort of lace I have done for you before?"—he said, "Yes, it is; I had it from the same man, and the same place"—we bought that lace of him; it came to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had a quantity more at home, and I said he had better bring it, and let me burn it, as he would receive more for it, as he must lose by doing it himself—he came again that day week the 29th, and brought a small piece of lace, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—It was about seven o'clock in the evening, and he asked me if it was too late to burn it—Mr. Smart was then in the way—the prisoner came again on the 31st about eleven o'clock—he asked me if I wanted a Job—I asked him if he had any thing to burn—he said, he had—I told him he must wait a few minutes till I made another fire, as I had a pot of gold on the fire—Mr. Smart then came into the shop—when I told the prisoner I was ready—he put out this piece of lace—Mr. Smart then told him that before he burnt that lace he must se the coats it cam off from—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Oh, no it did not come off coats, it came off bed furniture"—that he bought it, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but he did not know the man he bought it of—I told him it was no use, he must know him—as he said he bought it all from one man, he must know him—he then said he would tell the truth, that he had exchanged some clothes for it—that exchange was no robbery, and therefore it was no use to make a bother about it—I asked him if he could not find the man, and said if he could not he must stand in that man's shoes—he then said he could not find him, as he might be a hun<lb></lb>dred miles off—he then said he thought he could find him if any body would go with him—by Mr. Smart's direction I fetched the policeman, but previ<lb></lb>ous to that the prisoner was asked his name and address—he did not state his name, but said he lived at No. 4, Catherine-street, Pimlico—when I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your solemn oath, do you know no passage in your master's life that would render it very imprudent for him to appear here as a wit<lb></lb>ness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard of it, and I believe you defended him—he has been here as a witness since then—I allude to the time when some strips of lace were sold at his house—he was convicted, and sentenced to pay a shilling—he was to have twelve months, I believe, but he did not stay his time out—I heard from his own lips that he was about to be fined a shilling, and Mr. Alley and you spoke to the Judge, that he might have a heavier men<lb></lb>tence—Nothing makes me think it would be imprudent for him to be here; it might be unpleasant—he was taken up again, and I was sent for to Marl<lb></lb>borough-street—he had the <hi rend="italic">luck</hi> to get off—I do not think he has any rea<lb></lb>son for not coming here to corroborate me—I was apprentice to a wheel<lb></lb>wright and coach-maker in the country—since then I have been a grocer—I was not in any service till I went as a shop man to a grocer—I then went into business, I lost my money, and then went into the police force—I never was in the army—I did not know the late Duke of York—I resigned my situation in the police, they will have me back at any time—It was while I was in the police that I knew Mr. Smart, because I apprehended two men who sold a gold chain in his shop—that was the only way that I knew him, except by seeing him at Marlborough-street, when he was there respecting some property stolen at the fire in Oxford-street—It was about two years after that that I entered his service—I left the police in the morning, and he sent for me the same evening, as the man who hand lived with him had robbed him—he knew I was out of the police, because Hobbe told him—Mr. Smart was present when the prisoner said he would tell the truth—but he is not here, and he did not go to Marlborough-street office, if he had he must have shut up his shop—he has no other shopman—I am employed in the back shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you know about burning lace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing, till I was sent to a place in Jewin-street to learn to do it; any labouring man might do it—I told the prisoner he had better bring it to me to burn, because I wanted him to bring it in its original state, that I might see if it was the same—I suspected him from the first day; but after that he never brought any bit what he had burned, but not sufficiently—I was obliged to burn it again—I went to No. 55, St. Martin's-lane—I saw the name of "Day" on the door—there is no one here, that I know of, who ever saw the prisoner at my master's, though sometimes, when he was there, the shop was full of people—my master knows that I am come here to day.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 35.) I went to Buckingham Pa<lb></lb>lace with Dudley—I had before that been to Pimlico—we went first to a public-house, and then to several other house—we went to No. 4, Cathe<lb></lb>rine-street; a woman came to the door and answered—she afterwards went with us to the Palace, and we took Nicholls into custody—we took him to the station-house; the inspector there put some questions to him; he told him not to say any thing unless he thought proper—he asked him if he had taken any lace from the Palace; Nicholls said he did on several occasions, and had sold it to Shadford—I was present when Shadford was searched—I was two pieces of silver-gilt lace found on him, and some dust in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Downey, the upholsterer. I was present when some silver-gilt lace was put into was put into the box at Bucking<lb></lb>ham Palace—It was quite full, and there was a difficulty in screwing down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210122"></xptr>
               <p>the lid, from the great pressure against it—I have seen the same box since this robbery—there was about one hundred yards of lace gone; about two thirds of the quantity, as near as possible—here is a sample of lace from the bulk—these parcels found in Shadford's hat have, in my judg<lb></lb>ment, been taken from the box; and this, produced from Mr. Smart's, is of the same description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As you say the box was so full that it pressed very much on the lid, of course that pressure would con<lb></lb>tinue to draw open the serews and nails? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the screws, when it was once pressed down and screwed—I saw it secured, and placed in an upper room with a variety of other boxes—there was nothing in the ap<lb></lb>pearance of the outside to enable a person to know what was in one box more than the others—It is a common packing-case—there have been a vast, number of workman at the Palace—there was some calico and old curtains in that room, beside the boxes—they were kept as stores—I do not know whether persons were ever sent there—I was in the room once—I had the key from Mr. Gleaves—he was present, and Mr. Wilson, a cabinet<lb></lb>maker, who was employed to repair some of the furniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if a box was pressed upon by what was in it, would not unscrewing that in November weaken the worm of the screw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not, because the screw would take an extra turn, and it was nailed down afterwards—I was present in November when the box was opened, to look for some tassels that had belonged to the old throne—they were not there—they were found in another room—I do not know any thing of Nicholls—I am only on the Palace occasionally—when I have passed through I have found all the doors secured—there were four hundred yards of lace in the box; upwards of one hundred yards were missing, and same other things.</p>

I am clerk to the Magistrate of Marlborough-street—I acted as clerk there when the prisoners were examined—I took down what was stated by Nicholls—It was read over to him—he was not asked to sign it—he made no observation upon my reading it—It is not the practice of our office to have it signed by the prisoner unless it is a confession.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Read.</hi>) "The prisoner, Nicholls, says, 'I found the bundle of lace behind a box in the Palace—I concealed it in a dark cellar, and took it away at different times. "</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Timothy Huffam, a tailor and woollen-draper in the City-road. In Oct., 1845, I remember seeing the pri<lb></lb>soner, and another person with him, dressed in black—the prisoner asked for a pair of straps—I said we had not any at present—he went away, and two days afterwards he called again with his companion—I knew him again posi<lb></lb>tively—he inquired about the straps—I said we were very sorry we had not got them yet—he came again on 20th Oct., with the same man, dressed in black—the prisoner said, "Have you got the straps in?"—I said, "Yes, but the shopman is away, I don't know what to charge you"—he said, "I wanted two or three pairs"—I said, "I will let you have one pair"—I charged him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left his companion against the door, and walked to the bottom of the shop—he jumped on the counter with his face towards the door, and said, "I will trouble you to fasten these straps"—I went to do it, but I found very great difficulty in fastening them, the buttons being sewn on so tightly—I got one on, and then he jumped down, and said, "I can't wait"—I said, "You had better let me finish"—he said, "No, I am in a hurry"—he went out, and I found his companion was gone—I then looked, and saw the blind was torn from the top of the window, and I missed from the window a piece of doe<lb></lb>skin, a piece of velveteen, and some cloth, worth altogether about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the window comes close to the door—that was where the prisoner's companion stood—I went to the door, but they were out of sight—on the 7th of Dec., 1846, I saw the prisoner with two other men, peeping in at the window as I was standing at the other counter—I recognized the prisoner again the mo<lb></lb>ment I saw him, and when his eyes met mine he went he went away immediately—I went to the door with Fossett to see if I could see him again on a Sunday morning in Jan., at the police-station—I pointed him out of six other men.</p>

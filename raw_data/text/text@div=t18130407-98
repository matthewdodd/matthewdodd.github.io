I left the house soon after twelve o'clock. I locked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070065"></xptr>door, and put the key in my pocket. I returned a little after seven o'clock; it was dark then; the lamps were lit. When I returned I heard a rattling among the shavings. A person bolted out of the coach-house. I live in a room over the coach-house. I shut the coach-house doors, that nobody else should come out, and I called out for assistance, and I saw the two prisoners, Imber and Gard. I took Imber from behind a door in the stable, and

            . I am a coachman. I live in this Mews. I assisted in taking the prisoners. They were taken in the coach-house. I heard Marr crying out, thieves. I ran with my pitchfork in my hand. We found a sack on the stairs; Marr said it did not belong to him. We went into Marr's bed room; the door was open. I catched Imber behind a door in the stable. I told him not to resist, if he did I would run him through with the fork.</p>
               <p>Imber's Defence. I am innocent of this robbery. I have been acquainted with a young woman; I intended to make her my wife. I was well persuaded that the prosecutor had persuaded her to leave me and to live with him. On Sunday she told me she would leave me and go with the prosecutor. I told her if she did it would be at the hazard of her life. We went to the prosecutor's premises. I thought I heard her voice. I knocked; no one came. I wanted to get her away, and that is how I was found in the premises. I am no thief, and never had any intention of robbing any one.</p>
               <p>Gard said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Imber called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

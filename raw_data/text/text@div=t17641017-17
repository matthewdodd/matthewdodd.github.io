               <p>Q. Is he bound over?</p>
               <p>Waldron. He is. Upon his information, I charged the constable with the prisoner, for stealing quantities of soles and top leather: we had a search-warrant to search the house of Ross; they live together: they both pleaded ignorance, and said they had no leather but what was their own, which they bought at the Black Prince, in Old Bedlam. We found a parcel of leather secreted in a garret, up three pair of stairs, and locked up in a cupboard; they work below: they are what we call chamber-masters and coblers: they make and mend shoes. (A parcel of leather produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the leather?</p>
               <p>Waldron. We found it a fortnight ago to-day. When I first took them up, they said they knew nothing of me, nor my apprentice neither. I verily believe the whole of this leather to be mine; here is a pair of top-pieces with my own handwriting upon them. When the old man was taxed with it before the alderman, he said, he knew some of it was mine, but not all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he knew it to be yours?</p>
               <p>Waldron. No, he did not.

               <p>Waldron. The old man was going on with his confession, but he was stopped by the alderman, who said, it was a thing not desired of a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise Shadwell should have mercy, if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Waldron. No, I did not; nor nobody else, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Holder. I was present at Guildhall, when this confession of Shadwell's was taken by Alderman Kite; it was read over to him before he signed it; I saw Sir Robert sign his name, and the prisoner also. The two Ross's were asked some questions; the old man was going to speak, but the alderman thought he could say nothing that would clear him, he said, he did not want him to say any thing to accuse himself. The old man said, he believed some part of the leather was Mr. Waldron's; he owned he had connections with the boy; that he call'd to see him frequently, and the boy said he frequently called to see them. The alderman thought the old man's confession might proceed from ignorance, so gave him warning.</p>

Andrew told me he had no leather in the house, and knew nothing of any, but what was there below. I took up several pieces, and asked Mr. Waldron if they were his? he said, he could not swear they were: he said he was informed there were some up stairs; they both said there was none above. I asked them if there were any concealed any where? they said they knew of none. Then we went up stairs, in order to search, into the room where William lies; after seeing no appearance of leather, I asked what was in some trunks that were locked up? William said they did not belong to him, but to a lodger, who was gone to Scotland. Mr. Waldron said I must search farther, but it being at that time of night, I refused to break open the house, as the warrant expressed to search in the day-time. I said to

Said I, we must go up stairs: I then asked young Ross, (who was partly undressed, and going to bed) if he could not procure me the key of those trunks? he said, he could not: there was a closet by the bedside; he said, that did not belong to him. Upon that, I wrenched the door open, and found a great quantity of leather, 53 pair of soles, and 76 or 86 fore-pieces. I asked him if he knew any thing of them? he said, nothing at all. I said, you must put your things on, and must go to the Compter; he said, he did not follow the shoe-making business, but rather followed portering, and opening shops for people, and hoped we would not take him away. We put the leather into a sack, and took him to Wood-street-compter; his father was in the Poultry-compter. The next day we had an examination before Mr. Alderman Kite:

               <p>Shadwell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Waldron. As I carry work to my master's men, I go by Ross's stall to the chief of them. He call'd to me, and asked me if I would take share of a pot of beer? I offered to pay for it, but he said I should not pay a farthing. They told me never to let any body have any leather but themselves, and never to let any body know of it.</p>
               <p>Andrew's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never bought a bit of leather of this boy in my life: I had none of him, only to make soles for him, and mend his shoes; he never gave any to me, neither did I ever give him a farthing. Mr. M'Cloud has done all this out of spite.</p>
               <p>William's Defence.</p>
               <p>It is a great falsity in saying he brought me leather; he only brought some once to mend his own shoes.</p>

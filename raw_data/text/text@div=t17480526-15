               <p>Reynart Pieterz. On the 16th of this month I lost a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose it?</p>
               <p>Pieterz . Just by the Exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Pieterz. It was upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. But where was it before?</p>
               <p>Pieterz. In my pocket, and I found it lying by the Prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Pieterz. About two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to think the Prisoner took it? was it only because you saw it lying at the Prisoner's feet?</p>
               <p>Pieterz. No, my lord, here is a gentleman that saw him take it out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he drop it immediately?</p>
               <p>Totton. No; he held it about a quarter of a minute; I believe he was confused, being so suddenly seized; and then he struck me, and endeavoured to force himself from me, and got away; but by the assistance of the keeper of the Exchange, he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I am troubled with fits, and sometimes I don't know what I do.</p>

               <p>Kitchen. He is a poor fellow that goes of errands; he used to run of errands for gentlemen at our house; he is very much troubled with fits, and is half an ideot.</p>

               <p>What did she say for herself? - She said that a young man let her into the room; I asked her how she came in, for I had locked the door; she said a young man let her in, unlocked or unbolted the door; she could not say which; there was no bolt on the outside, it was within; she was searched, but there was nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Then you had not lost any thing? - Nothing was taken out of the room, but the sheets were taken from the bed, and every little thing that laid about put into a pillow case that was taken off the pillow.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find the room; were any of the doors or windows forced? - No, not at all; somebody held out their hand, and gave me a key, which in my slurry I thought was my own key, but found the next day it was a strange key; there was nobody present but the people that are here; my servant went out about half past one; I went up before four, and double locked the door, and put the key into my pocket; when I heard the noise I said, my God, there is somebody in my room, I am afraid.</p>
               <p>Were the windows shut? - They were shut; they were casement windows, and a two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>What time had you been up? - Rather before four.</p>
               <p>Not after that? - No.</p>

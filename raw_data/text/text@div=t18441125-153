                  </hi>. I live in Melin's-place, Westminster-road. Early in Sept. the prisoner called on me—he asked for Mr. Wall—I said I was he—he said, "No, I want an elderly person"—I said, "Then you mean my predecessor in business"—he said, "No, a Mr. Wall, who previously lived in Union-place, Lambeth"—I said it was my father, but he had been dead eight or nine years"—he said, "Has he, indeed, I have some good news for you"—I asked him in, and he said there was some pro<lb></lb>perty unclaimed in the Court of Chancery belonging to me—we held a conversation about my father's family and so on, and I asked him how to get the property—he said I must get an order under the Court of Chancery, the use of which was to search in Doctors' Commons and examine the will—he showed me several orders, similar to those before me—he said the expense would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made an appointment to see him the next day—he called, but I was not at home—he called a day or two after<lb></lb>wards—I saw him, and told him I would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if he would procure this order from the Court of Chancery—he called in the evening, brought the order, and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believed it was an order from the Court of Chancery—he represented it to be so, and I paid him two half-crowns and a sixpence—I took the order in my hand previous to pay<lb></lb>ing him the money—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I had it in my possession five or six weeks—he said he was not bound to say what the property consisted of—I asked him if it was freehold or funded—he said he thought it consisted of both, and he thought it amounted to about 1900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I do not admit that you did say so—I cannot recol<lb></lb>lect—you said, after the order was procured it must be taken to Doctors' Commons, and the costs of it would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to look after a will if there was any there—that was for your trouble, I suppose, in examining the will—you left then, and was absent four or five weeks, and called again to know if I had further considered the matter—I said I had given the order to my solicitor, and I gave you his address—I employed you about a bill of exchange—you represented you could discount me a bill.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to me last July and asked me if my name was John Harding—I told him it was—he said he had come concerning property which had been laid by for sixty years and would go to the Crown—he did not say what property—he said he came as an uninterested person—I began to tell him about my family and my forefathers—he said it was right, and I ought to prefer my claim—I said I would consider of it—he came again the first week in Sept., and said I must get an order from the Court of Chancery, and that would cost me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he showed me a small paper, which he said was an order from the Court of Chancery, and asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my demand—he wrote the account which I stated to him, and he said, "If they approve of this statement, the Court of Chancery will grant you an order"—this was on a Thursday morning—he came again in the evening and brought this order folded up—I said, "Did you write this?"—he said, "No, I did not write it myself, the Court of Chancery wrote this"—I believed it came from the Court of Chancery, and, believing that, I gave him half-a-crown, and told him if he would call in a day or two I would give him the balance—he said it was a considerable deal of landed property, and I understood in the county of Hampshire—I did not pay the prisoner any more money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I trust, in giving you a statement of the facts of the case, you will he able to give me the benefit of an acquittal. The greater part of my life has been spent in business, and having some small resources for old age, I thought I was independent; but in consequence of calami<lb></lb>ties, one of which was fire, I was reduced, in forty-eight hours, from ✗ ence to penury. I was unable to follow the profession I had been in, and was engaged as commission-agent to two gentlemen of the highest respect<lb></lb>ability. ability. Mr. West employed me to find out parties that he gave me in<lb></lb>struction had property in the Court of Chancery. I had to walk very often from one part of London to the other to find the right parties; if I found them I had a small commission; if not, I had my labour for my pains Mr. West lives at No. 18, Throgmorton-street, and I do not consider I am the responsible person in this case. I only acted according to my instruc<lb></lb>tions, and am entirely innocent of any guilty intention, in reference to the orders that are given me by my employer: through not being able to In<lb></lb>verse, I have not been able to get Mr. West and other witnesses for my defence; I came here not prepared for my defence, Mr. West having employed me. I made numbers of applications, and where the party has not been the right heir to the property, it has been no charge or expense to them. I do not know whether they are entitled to the property or not; that has to be proved, according to the nature of the case. I beg to state, that the answer to each of the cases that have come this morning is to be given in Nov., and without waiting for the expiration of that month, I was brought here without witness or evidence, or even the evidence of Mr. West. I am brought here like a man bound hand and foot, and am rendered totally defenceless. If I had employed a party to embody these particulars, I could prove I am not guilty of the charge. I leave my case for your consideration. I solemnly declare I had no intention to wrong any individual; and I trust you will give me the benefit of your merciful consideration.</p>

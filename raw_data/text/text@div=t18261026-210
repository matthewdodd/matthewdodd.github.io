            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 6th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw Harris at the corner of Liquorpond-street - I stopped in a door-way, and saw the other prisoners come up to him; they stopped under the alms-houses, and talked together, then went on to the corner of Elm-street, and stopped at a grocer's-shop, and bought a basket for 3d.: they came out; Edwards had the basket in his hand - they went on to an oil-shop - Powell and Edwards went in, and Harris staid at the door; they came out, and went on to Mr. Hicks' shop, a turner, in <placeName id="t18261026-210-crimeloc1163">Gray's Inn-lane-road</placeName>

Harris was at the end of the counter; they came out across the way, and went a little distance - I crossed over, and pushed Edwards and Powell into a shop, at the corner of Henry-street - Mills brought in Harris, and I found this comb on him - also some stamps, and two wafer-stamps.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mr. George Hicks. Powell and Edwards came in, and asked for a comb for graining, and said it must be three inches and a half long; I showed them some, but none would do; in about seven minutes, while they were there, Harris came in, and said he wanted a brush for graining; I went to look for some, but not finding them readily, he said he would call in the morning, between nine and ten o'clock - he did not appear to know the others; they all went out; Powell had a rule, and measured the comb. In a quarter of an hour the officer came in - I then missed a comb. They had taken up several in the shop, and I missed one then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had you counted them before? A. No; we sell a good many such. I believe this to be the one I missed.</p>

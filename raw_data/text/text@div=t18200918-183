On the 22d of June I had two silver watch-cases in a bag, between twelve and one o'clock, Jacobs came up, and asked which was Clerkenwell-green - I told him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Come and shew us." He gave me a little broken whip, and asked me where I was going - I said, to Mr. Stodhart's, No. 61, Red Lion-street. He then asked what I had got in my bag, which hung over my shoulder. I told him I was going there with two silver watch-cases. He followed me up Bishop's-court, and I went straight to Red Lion-street. I knew him before, he went to school with me.

Jacobs had left me in Bishop's-court; I had not seen them speak together. I looked back and saw Asbury running past Mr. Stodhart's house as hard as he could tear. I was frightened, and went home to my master, but did not like to tell him. I went and dined at my mother's, then returned, and told him. I saw the prisoners together that afternoon, about four o'clock, in King-street, Goswell-street, standing under a gateway, I ran by them to St. John's-square, where I was going, and as I returned I saw a whole parcel of them on Clerkenwell-green. I described them to my master.</p>

On the 22d of June I delivered Faulkner one gold and two silver watch-cases, the silver ones were for Mr. Stodhart - he informed me he had lost them, and gave me the same account he has now. I apprehended Jacobs myself, Asbury was with him at the time, but I was not certain of him; he answered the description the boy gave, but a boy was with me who knew Jacobs.</p>

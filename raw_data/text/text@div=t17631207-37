On the 24th of November, betwixt seven and nine o'clock in the evening, I laid myself down on a bench, in my own tap-room, to sleep, having been up almost all the night before.

            . It was a silver watch. I went to the bar to my wife, and asked her, if she had taken it out? she said, she had not; I turned into the tap-room, and challenged all the company with it; they all said, they would stand search: the prisoner was out of place, and came with a man, whom I knew very well, and had laid one night in my house. I gave the watch up as lost, for about an hour; a coal-heaver said, he had seen the prisoner lean over me two or three times, and he, at the time, begged of the prisoner not to awake me. The prisoner was gone to bed: my servant-girl went up stairs, and came down again, and said, she had awaked him; then I went directly up to him, with two or three men with me: I searched his coat, waistcoat, and breeches; he was awake, I believe, but, when I spoke to him, would give me no answer, but spoke like as if he had been asleep: I attempted to awake him, I found nothing; he would not come out of bed, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070033"></xptr> took him by a leg and an arm, and pulled him out, and ordered him to dress himself; he denied knowing any thing of the watch.

I saw the prisoner leaning over the box, and over him as he lay, and was in that position sometime: I said, don't awake him, for he is weary, then he came from him, and turned towards the fire: I saw nobody so near him as the prisoner, but, having no suspicion of any thing, did not observe his hands.</p>

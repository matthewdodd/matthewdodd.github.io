            . I am nine years old. (The witness appeared perfectly to understand the obligation of an oath.) About a month ago I had these things in a bundle; I was bringing them from the mangle, in Little Mary-le-bone-street, and taking them to my mother's, in North-row, Mary-le-bone; the prisoner came up to me in Duke-street, and asked if I would go on an errand for her; I knew her before; I said, Yes; she took me into another street, and asked if the things were not very heavy; I said Yes; she asked if she should carry them; I said Yes; she then unpinned the bundle, put her foot on a step, and asked if I had a pin - I had none; she then took out a paper bag, took a pin out of it, pinned it up, and said, "Come along with me;" she took me into Hanover-square, and then into <placeName id="t18270712-112-crimeloc612">Hanover-street</placeName>

            . I am Ely's brother-in-law. I went out, from her description, and found the prisoner in Newport-market; she said, "That is the woman;" the prisoner turned round, and said, "Did you speak to me;" I said Yes; and told her what my sister had said; she denied having seen her; I asked if she would go back with me; she said Yes; and when we had got a little way, she wanted to return to her friends; I saw in her hand a paper bag; I then told her it was of no use to deny it, as my sister had described her as having such a bag as that; she again wanted to go to her mother's in Covent-garden; I went part of the way, and then gave her into custody; I asked her again about the things - she said she was so agitated she could not tell if she had taken them, but she had not.</p>

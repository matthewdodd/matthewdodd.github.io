I was on duty in Chapel-street, Edware-road, about 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoners walking very fast—I asked them where they were going—Watson said they were going home—I asked where they had been—they said, to a coffee-shop—I asked what they had about them—they said they bad nothing—I asked Watson to let me see what he had, and I put my hand to his coat—I found there was money, and I asked him where he got it—he said he worked for it—I said, "That won't do for me"—I took them to the station—when there, Neary said to Watson, "Don't fret; they cannot hang us for this"—I found on Watson twenty-six pence, seventy-four halfpence, and thirty-one farthings, and this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); and on Neary, two shillings, a halfpenny, a knife, and a comb—the inspector asked Watson where he got these coppers—he said he played at skittles for it, and won it—it was about 6 o'clock when I took the prisoners—I went on day-duty, and went out just before 6, and I saw the prisoners a very few minutes after I got out—I can positively swear it was not 5 minutes after 6—the prisoners were about twenty yards from Mr. Parkbouse's.</p>

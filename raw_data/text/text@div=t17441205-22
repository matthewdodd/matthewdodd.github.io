On the 25th of Oct. last, I sent the Prisoner out with some empty casks to an inn; while he was gone, I was getting another parcel ready, and looking for some old Ropes in a lumber hole, I found a parcel of tea in three papers, the whole about a pound and half; I shewed the tea to my master, and said I had found a hoard of somebody's, but God knows whose it was: my master bid me put a private mark upon it, and I put R W and a little cross between, and put it in the same position as I found it, and watched to see who took it away; It was not moved that day, but the next day I was looking through a sash-window, and saw the Prisoner come out with a candle from behind a partition, and set the candle upon the counter, and went behind the partition again; I thought he was going to make off with what he had, and presently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174412050012"></xptr> I heard the door go, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, and caught him with this bag in his hand, and brought him back. There were in the bag, three men's hats, three papers of tea and a hard brush; the hats were marked with my master's mark, and the tea had the marks I put upon the papers; the Prisoner owned the thing, begged pardon, and said it was the first time.</p>

             These things were found in a lumber hole; my master ordered me to go down to take an account of the marks that were upon the papers, which he had ordered to be put upon them; as to the hat, they were my own marking: the prisoner confessed he took them out of a press, close to his bed-side.</p>

On the 20th of October, she went out in the morning to nurse, and I was in bed hardly sensible; the prisoner came in as a friend - I had known him before; he asked where my daughter was- I said nursing; the drawer was open, and he sat close to it, and out of it he took these things, but I did not perceive it; I saw him take hold of the cloak - I did not miss the things till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw him take them? A. I saw them in his hand; and I saw him wrap the boots in the shawl and the cloak at the street-door; I was at that time at the window; I missed the things, and went as far as I could go, and then I went to the window, and called out"Mr. Clark, you have robbed me - come back! come back;" I had been almost insensible from a pain in my head - my sight is not very good; I did not see any other man in the house, and never saw Hilton till I came into court.</p>

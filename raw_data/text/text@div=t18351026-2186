I was at the corner of Harp-alley, at twelve o'clock at night, on the 10th of October—I was coming down, and was accosted by two or three girls, who jostled me very much—a man made a grasp at my watch, and ran off with it—I cannot tell who it was—this is my watch—it was fastened round my neck by a ribbon—this alley is just leading into Farringdon-street, on the left-hand side going from Fleet-street.</p>

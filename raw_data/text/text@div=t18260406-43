            . I live with my father, in Union-street, Ratcliff-highway. On the 21st of March, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was playing about, and saw Dove - I think he came out of the Black Horse, public-house - he went to a corner for a necessary purpose; I saw both the prisoners - I knew them before by sight and by name; Munns is a <rs id="t18260406-43-deflabel227" type="occupation">salesman</rs>

I and Bridges went up to them; Munns made a blow at Bridges; I went to the Black Horse, and told Mr. Tavernor; he came out after them - they ran away. When he came back from running after them Dove got up, and went into the Black Horse; he was very drunk. Tavernor sent five of us to watch him home: he went across the Dock-hill - Munns came up there again, and shoved him down; he laid down with him, searched his pockets, and put something into his own pocket; this was half an hour after they first went up to him. I went and told Tavernor, and while I was talking Munns came up the lane; Tavernor came out, and he ran off.</p>

            . My brother keeps the Black Horse - I live there. On the evening of the 21st of March Dove was in the house, very tipsy indeed. I saw neither of the prisoners there - he had his pockets turned inside out; he went out, and did not come into the house again; his right-hand pocket was inside out - his breeches pocket and one side of his flap was unbuttoned; his fob was hanging out, but I felt his watch in it; I followed him to the door; Hagerty and some other boys there said he had been robbed; I sent them to follow him. I went to the door, and saw two men standing by the bricks; I cannot say who they were; they run away when I went towards them - I followed 150 or 200 yards, then returned, as I had left nobody in the bar. The boys came back, and gave me further information - I did not then see either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His watch was safe when you saw him? A. Yes; I cannot say whether he had a chain.</p>

            . I was in the street on this night, playing with Hagerty, and saw Dove go into the Black Horse - his pockets were inside out, and his flap half down. I saw Munns, but cannot say who the other man was; they were dividing something; Hagerty and I went towards home - they were going to hit us - we ran away; I saw the shape of Dove's watch in his fob after I had seen them dividing something; he went down the lane; I did not observe whether any body followed him; Munns said to Dove, "This is the way to Old Gravel-lane," directing him down New Gravel-lane.</p>

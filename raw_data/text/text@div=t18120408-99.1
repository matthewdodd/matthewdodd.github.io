I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BRITTEN. I am a patrol in Holborn, I came up at the call of watch, and took the prisoner to the watch-house. I knew the prisoner's person well.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAWSON. The prisoner was left, in the watch-house in my charge. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief, it is worth five shillings.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.(to Prosecutor.) Could any person run away and make his escape upon the spot without your seeing him - A. I think it impossible.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of straw was it - A. It was oat straw; it grew upon an half acre, near 'Squire Littleton's. There is a rookery there. It was cut before it was ripe, in consequence of the rockery, or else it would have stopped a fortnight longer. On the 15th, I was going my round, I saw a trace of straw from my house to these men's premises. I traced it across the road, up to their doors, and when I got there, I saw two pig sties, and two hogs in each sty. One of the sties belonged to one of the prisoners and the other to the other. The hogs were feeding on oats, with chaff. I found one bundle of straw in each of their sheds. The oats were not cleaned to send to market; they had been thrashed. They always stand in the barn until we clean them up. The oats that the hogs were feeding on where like oats just thrashed. I clean them up every week, and send them to market. They had one bundle of straw in each of their sheds, and they had some oat straw in each of their sties; a very good bed for the hogs. I took samples out of each. I took it home and compared it with my straw at home. I found three bundles of straw missing. I do not sell straw. I use it all up on my farm.</p>
               <p>Q. These were bundles of straw, not trusses for sale - A. No; there were three bundles for my own use. I bound them myself, my man being unwell. I am sure that these bundles of straw in the hog sties were my property, and that they had growed upon that half acre. I enquired of

             whether he had got any hogs in his sty. He answered, no, he had not get any; then I enquired of Thomas. He said, he had got two. Then I enquired of William who the other two belonged to; he said, what is that to you. I then said, who feeds them; they are feeding upon my corn. He made use of bad words; he said, d - n and blast your eyes, if you swear we stole your property, we'll do for you.</p>

            . On the night in question, I saw the prisoner on Mrs. Burt's garden wall, and another man preceded him with a bundle under his arm, they got off that wall, which was about four feet from the ground, and they went along a piece of ground belonging to the East India Dock Company, to some paling, about eight feet high. I never lost sight of them until they got to the paling; then the prisoner struggled up the pales; then I approached the prisoner, and stopped him, and said hallo, what have you got here; then the other man came up, and as he opened his coat, I saw the but end of a pistol, and I said you villian. if you draw another inch, I will cut you down with my cutlass. I immediately called out for assistance, but could get none. The other man made a run, and I took the prisoner to our night officer. When I examined the house, the brick work was cut away from the front door; there was a glass door inside, and there were two squares of glass cut away from the wood work, and the locks were wrenched back.</p>

            . I am an officer of the East India Docks. When I came from the docks between four and five in the evening of the 23rd of October, I heard that the door of Mrs. Burt's house was broken open. I got into the house, and I found three or four bricks cut out of the wall, by which means a crow had been put in, and the door forced open; on a round table there were four glasses, each full of wine, with a newspaper to each glass. There were two large trunks which had been gutted, and were cut all down to the bottom. In fact the place was intirely plundered.</p>

               <p>Golden-square. On the 28th of November, I met the prisoner Downes in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and went with her to a public-house in Drury-lane, about a quarter before 11 o'clock—she took me to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I understand it was No, 2—we stopped a while in the room—she then lighted me down stairs—when I came to the street door I met Magner—my money and watch were quite safe then—she asked me to treat her, and I went with her to a public house round the corner—I then returned to the same room with her, and stopped some time—I did not undress then—she asked me to allow her to go out for a little gin—I said yes, and in her absence I looked at my watch—it was twenty minutes after five—she returned with the gin, and we drink it—after a short time, when we were partly undress, she said she was very thirsty, and asked me to let her go out for a pint of porter—I said yes—she requested me to go to bed, and she would return immediately—I went to bed, she stopped in the room backwards and forwards till I was in bed, and she then went out for the beer—I laid in bed about as hour and three quarters, when Gray came into the room and said, "who the b----h----is in my room?"—I said I was—he asked who brought me there—I said a young woman—he told me to get out of bed instantly, or he would break my neck down stairs—he took my clothes and threw them from one chair to another—I heard two persons speaking outside the door, and then both the female prisoners came in together—Magner spoke to Gray, who then pulled a clasp-knife out of his pocket, and said he would run it into the b----guts of any body that con<lb></lb>tradicted him—I put on my trowsers—I found my watch and purse, containing my sovereigns, were gone—I did not wish to say any thing then, being in fear—I took up my waistcoat, where I had eight shillings in silver, and two watch-keys, and found them gone—I dressed, and then he kept saying if I did not leave the room quickly he would break my neck down stairs—I went down, and met a policeman in the lane—I asked him how I was to act, and showed him the place—the light was still in the room—he got a brother officer, put him at the door, and took me up stairs—he three prisoners were still in the room—he commenced searching, and found my watch, two keys, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver on Gray I believe.</p>

Early on Tuesday morning, the 29th of November, I was on duty in Charles-street, Drury-lane, when the prosecutor complained of being robbed—I accompanied him to No. 2, Charles-street, with another officer—I went to front-room, third floor, and found the three prisoners there—Gray asked what I wanted—I said the prosecutor complained of being robbed, and I had come to search him and the women—he said he had not robbed him—I then saw him take his right hand from his trowsers pocket with the watch in it, and throw it on the bed—I instantly called an officer up and searched Gray—I found two watch-keys and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket, and a large clasp knife in life left hand—it was shut—I also found another knife in his pocket—two</p>

               <p>hours before I took the prisoners, I saw Gray and Downes together, at the corner, opposite No. 2—Downes said, "We will wait:" and in about two minutes I saw Magner come out of the house, No. 2—Downes said to her, "Have you got it?"—she said, "Yes"—she said, "How much?" and she counted into Gray's hands a sovereign and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., one by one—Downes then asked what she had done with the purse—Magner said she had left it in the room—they then proposed to get some<lb></lb>thing to drink, to change the <hi rend="italic">cooter,</hi> as they called it, meaning the sove<lb></lb>reign—they then walked round different streets, and about two hours after they returned (about three o'clock) I heard a noise in the house shortly after, as if somebody had been fighting, and the prosecutor came to me, and said he had been robbed of a sovereign, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and his watch—I went up, and saw Gray throw the watch on the bed, as I stated before.</p>

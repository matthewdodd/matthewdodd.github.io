On the morning of the 18th of February I saw the prisoner come out of Raven-street, Mile-end-road, with a sack on his shoulders—he crossed over to the corner of North-street—I asked him what he had got—he said, "A few shavings"—I felt and found the sack was hard—he then threw the sack at me, and ran across the road—I pursued him—he fell down, and after a short struggle I took him—I then said, "What is in that sack?"—he said, "Only a few cocks, but do not take me, it is what I get a living by"—I called another police<lb></lb>man, who took the sack, while I took the prisoner to the station-house—this is the property—(<hi rend="italic">producing it.</hi>)</p>

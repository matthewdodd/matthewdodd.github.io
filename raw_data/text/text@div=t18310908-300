            . I am a Police-officer. On the morning of the 14th of July, I was on duty in the Strand, about two o'clock, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner - the prosecutor seemed to wish to get rid of him- I told the prisoner I did not believe he had any knowledge of the prosecutor; he said he had known him for four or five years; I soon afterwards saw the prosecutor asleep on the bridge - he had no hat on - I awoke him, and he complained of his loss; I took the prisoner about three o'clock the same morning - I took from him this hat, five half-crowns, three sixpences, and two shillings, but no watch.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner walking towards Waterloo-bridge - one of them had his handkerchief hanging out, and I told him of it; I saw them turn, and both fall down - I assisted to help the prosecutor up - he then walked towards Waterloobridge; he appeared to have been drinking - the prisoner said, "He is an acquaintance of mine," and walked after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When they fell down were their hats off? A. Yes, and they might be changed at that time.</p>
               <p>J. C. RAWLEY. The prisoner had only this one hat when I took him - I recollect seeing their hats fall off, and I particularly noticed the prisoner's hat; he put his own hat on his head, not this one - his hat was a very indifferent one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this such a hat as the little boys in the street follow, crying "Shocking had hat?" A. I should think not - I went to the hatter, and found the prosecutor by that means; I took the prisoner opposite Wellington-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I was very much intoxicated, and cannot say whether that was the gentleman I was with or not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there many people passing and repassing? A. Yes, but the street was not thronged; I felt my coat move, and then missed it - the prisoner was twenty or thirty yards from me; it was a yellow handkerchief, with red spots - I do not know whether it has any mark; I took it from the prisoner, and gave it to the officer - it is by no means a common handkerchief.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALSH. I am an officer. I received this handkerchief from the prosecutor, and have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Dean-street, and saw the prosecutor pass; there were two young lads on before me - I do not know who dropped the handkerchief, but I found it at my feet, and the prosecutor took me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery, at Woolwich. On the 28th of April I had been to London—I had a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note, which I changed at Mr. Crump's, in Goswell-road—I received for it a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. banknote and sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and silver—I put the note and money in my purse into my watch-pocket—I did not take the number of the note, but I observed some writing on it which enables me to know it again—I then went to Dalston, and from there to London-bridge, to get back to Woolwich—it was then past eleven o'clock at night, I dare say—I was perfectly sober—I went to a stand of <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> and called for one—Jenkins came up as the driver, and brought the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the curb-stone—I asked what he would take me to Woolwich for—he said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I could not afford that, and offered him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he could not take me for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Finch was standing near him, and he said, "O take the gentleman down, take him down for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he will likely stand a pot of ale on the road"—that was the first I had seen of Finch—Jenkins said very well, he would do</p>

               <p>it—I got in, and Jenkins said, "Will you allow this man (meaning Finch) to go with you as far as Greenwich in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?"—Finch was by at the time—I said, "Yes, you may get in," and he got in—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> went on between half and two-thirds of the way between London and Greenwich, and it there stopped—Finch said, "Draw up here," or "We had better stop here"—Jenkins drew up by a public-house on the left hand side—Finch got out on the right side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, went round, and went into the public-house, and, as I presume, got a pot of ale—I paid for it—I did not get out, and cannot say whether Jenkins was on his box or not—Finch was away five or six minutes—he then came to the left side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and said to me, "Here, take a glass of this ale"—I said, "Is it good?"—he said, "Yes, very good"—I drank it and gave him the glass, which he took into the house again, then came and took his seat in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I then fell asleep, and did not awake till we got to Woolwich—I was still asleep, Jenkins came and awoke me up, and said, "You are at Woolwich"—Finch was then gone—I said, "Very well"—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and found Jenkins in the act of getting on the box again, never having asked me for his money—I said, "Oh! I have not paid you, I must pay you"—I went to feel for my money, and found my purse and money were gone—I said, "Good G—! I have been robbed; you know something about it; where is the man that you asked my permission to let ride with me?"—I seized hold of Jenkins and said, "I will detain you until I give you in charge"—two policemen came up—I gave him, his horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, in charge—I have seen the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note since, and identified it—this is it—here is the word "York" upon it—when we arrived at the station I gave so minute a description of Finch that he was taken the next day.</p>

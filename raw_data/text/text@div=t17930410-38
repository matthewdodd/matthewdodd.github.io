On the 1st of March, Friday night; I saw the prisoner going into an old iron shop, he went into the shop, one Bury's shop, he had a bundle on his head, and he put it down, and I went in and asked him what he had got there? he said, for God's sake say nothing about it, for it would be the ruin of him; I told him I was an officer, and must do my duty, and take him to the justice; I took the bundle and him to the justice; I have got the bundle here; the bundle was a great quantity of hemp, and in the hemp packed up these four hammocks.

               <p>—perhaps I bad this case about a month before I gave it to my brother—he was then at Knightsbridge barracks—I was visiting him there as I was out of a situation—we were alone—I have seen him sometimes smoke—cigars—I made him a present of a handkerchief at the same time—he was complaining of wanting one, and it was not ready for him—I took one out, and said, "I will make you a present of one," and I said, "There is a thing that I pur<lb></lb>chased the other day; if you smoke I will make you a present of it"—I told him I bought it at Maidstone—I mentioned the person who sold it—I did not say how that person obtained it—the person did not tell me how he obtained it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the parish clerk of Newington. I produce the register of marriages of that parish—on the 18th of February, 1833, I find an entry of the marriage of John Wishart, bachelor, with Sarah Alicia Lushman, spinster, married by banns, by the Rev. Thomas England, in presence of Richard Chipperfield and Hannah Chipperfield—I was present, but I cannot swear to the prisoner. Richard Chipperfield. I live in James-street, Clerkenwell. I how the prisoner, and was present at the church of St. Mary, Newing<lb></lb>ton, in February, 1833, upon the occasion of his marriage—he is the person that was married to Sarah Alicia Lushman, whom I saw last evening.</p>

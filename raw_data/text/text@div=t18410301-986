                  </hi>. I live in Erith parish. On the 13th of January I was in the Coach-and-Horses' public-house, at Woolwich, and I saw the prisoner there—I then went to the Crown-and-Mason public-house—I pulled off my coat, and laid it on the table—I began dancing—I told Elizabeth Han<lb></lb>cock to look after my coat—after dancing, my coat was gone, and the pri<lb></lb>soner also—I have not found it—the prisoner was in the room while I was dancing.</p>

I was at the public-house—the prosecutor put his coat on the table, and told me to watch it—I took it up, and gave it to the prisoner—I asked him if he would hold it till the prosecutor had done—when I saw it last the prisoner had it under his arm, and was sitting near the door—when the dancing was over, the prisoner and the coat were gone.</p>

A young man that was going by, heard me say to Mrs. Jones go after a constable, and stopped; I told Mrs. Jones to call that young man in, and he assisted us; he said why did not you let me take them out before you took me; the young man came in and I see him take the red handkerchiefs out of his pocket after he came in; the waistcoats are worth 30 s. and more, the cotton handkerchiefs 13 s. and the linen handkerchiefs, 10 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you take them out of my breeches when you said they were in first? - I thought you was a stronger man then me; and I thought I could get to the door and lock you in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I tell you I was the person that was in half an hour or three quarters of an hour ago? - You did.</p>

As the prisoner at the bar was stooping, I there observed him pull out some red handkerchiefs out of his pocket, and drop them on the floor, pretending to buckle his shoe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman says, I pulled them out of my pocket; and the other says, I pulled them from behind me. - Whether it was from behind you you pulled them out, or out of your pocket, I cannot say positively, but you pulled them from you.</p>

               <p>I produce the articles delivered to me in Mr. Jones's shop (deposed to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into this shop to buy a pair of breeches, and the gentleman pulled me down five or six pair; two pair I tried on, and they were full large, - They would not do. I want a pair says I with strings. I went out - there were none fitted me. I went to the Coach and Horses, in Clerkenwell-green, and I stayed about an hour. When I came back, I called for a pair of breeches;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150148"></xptr>and the gentlewoman came to the door, and she called this young man in. When I went in, says I, you remember I was here about three-quarters of an hour ago. He took me down a pair of breeches: says I, they will not do, because they are straps, and I want strings. Trying on the breeches, I pulled down my apron, and a parcel of things tumbled down with it - Some fell behind my breeches, and some just at the knee of my breechs. The young man came round, and says, What are you at? - If you stir, I will cut your head open. You talk foolish, says I. He calls out, directly, for the gentlewoman of the house; and she came, and the gentleman came in; and the neighbours picked up several things at the same time: but as for having any thing about me, I had not.</p>
               <p>Court. How came this bundle up your back? - I had nothing behind my back - Is it possible to suppose, that a man should have such a bulk about him without being perceived? When the constable came he searched me, and found 17 s. and 6 d. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

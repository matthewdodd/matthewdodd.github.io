On the 5th of November the prisoner came and asked for lodgings, and said he was related to Mr. Lamb, a carpenter, who we knew to be a respectable man. He said he was going to be employed in Lamb's business all the winter - we let him a lodging, and he staid all night, and at a quarter to six o'clock my sister let him out, and told him he had something not his own. He said he had not - it was a pair of boots which he was going to get mended. She said they were Pink's boots, and he ran off, and she called after him.</p>

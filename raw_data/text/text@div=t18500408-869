               <p>and a quantity of other screw-drivers and things—they are very good housebreaking tools—I have compared this part of the screw-driver with the point I found in the book-case, and they exactly correspond, so much so that when it is put together you cannot see where it is broken—John Burns was at that time in custody—I went to the station, showed him the tools, the iron bar, and the screw-driver, and asked him whose they were—he said they were his, and the iron bar he said was, a burnishing tool, and showed me how it was used—the shoes of John Burns would not fit the other footmarks; they were larger.</p>

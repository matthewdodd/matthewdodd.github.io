               <p>EMMA HERBERT. I am single, and live in Wardour-street. On the 11th of May, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon I had been out a very long walk, and was taken very ill; I sat down on a stone in Compton-street; I had been walking all day, seeking a situation as a servant - I sat down, and put my hand to my forehead; the prisoner came up, and said, "You have been drinking; " I said I had not, but was unwell: I never saw her in my life before - she asked me to go with her and have a cup of tea; I refused, but she pressed me - I got up and followed her to <placeName id="t18290611-1-crimeloc4">No. 29, Rupert-street</placeName>

I found my shawl in pawn at the top of Compton-street, early the next morning; I informed a constable, who went with me to the house in Rupert-street, and took the prisoner - I am quite sure she is the person. I am a native of Wales, but have been in London thirteen or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did we have any thing to drink together? A. I did not drink with her at all, nor go to any public-house with her.</p>
               <p>PETER TATE. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Princes-street, Soho. This shawl was pawned with me for 5s. in the name of Jones, on the 12th of May, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, by the prisoner; I did not ask where she got it, as she had pawned things before - she mentioned no name but Jones.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. James'. On the 12th of May the prosecutrix made a complaint to me; I went with her to Rupert-street, between twelve and one o'clock, to a house; I saw the prisoner on the stairs, and asked if her name was

             - she said No; I was going up stairs - the prosecutrix called me back, and said,"That is the party;" I took her to the pawnbroker, who said she had pawned the shawl; she denied both the robbery and pawning it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was rather in liquor, and met this woman who was drunk, and a mob was round her; she complained to me of being ill, having knocked her head against a post - she said she dare not go home in that state, and if I took her home and gave her a cup of tea, she would pawn her shawl to pay for it; she gave me the shawl in the passage to pawn, but I said, "Let us put the kettle on first;" as we went up stairs my husband came home, and found us drunk - he threw us both down stairs- she told me she would come and breakfast with me after my husband was gone in the morning, instead of which she brought an officer.</p>

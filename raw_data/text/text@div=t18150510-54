On the 26th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner take the bacon from off the bench inside the shop close to the door; one piece of bacon between sixteen and seventeen pounds. He came into the shop, asking for an ounce of tobacco, I told him we did not sell it, and pointing to a shop opposite where they sold it; he went over, I saw him cross the way; in a few minutes I saw him walk by the door, and look in, at last I had some suspicion, as I had lost some bacon on the Saturday before, I kept out of his sight concealed, he walked backwards and forwards, he had a bag under his arm; at last nobody appearing to him to be in the shop, he stole the bacon, put it into his bag, and walked off. I pursued him, in about an hundred yards I laid hold of him; I said my friend, walk back, he went back, he had the bacon under his arm covered with the cloth, he laid it down on the bench, I got a constable and he was secured; the bacon is worth ten shillings.</p>

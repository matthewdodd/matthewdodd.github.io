He went to enquire after the printer in Earl-street, but could not find no such person.

In consequence of what was told me, I went to the house of Francis; when I went in, he was at home, and on entering, I informed him who I was, and stated that I believed our warehouse-man, had been with him in the morning; he told me, that since our warehouse-man had been with him, he had discovered more; a bundle he said, of the Sparkles of Glory. He then went down to his warehouse, and brought it up. He then said, that perhaps I and my brother, who was with me, would like to walk down into his warehouse, and examine it ourselves. We immediately went down, and found a large quantity of our paper there was a portion of Banks's Peerage, a quantity of lberia's Crisis, and a large bundle of Observation on the Cure of Cancer, by Dr. Denman; also about fifty volumes of the works of the Earl of Surry; the works of the Earl of Surry had never been delivered for publication, but the others had. It would cost one hundred and fifty pounds to replace them. The prisoner Francis, described to me that he had purchased it of a boy whom he described so accurately, that I had not the least doubt but that it was the other prisoner at the bar. He said that the boy had told him, he worked for a printer in Earl-street, Blackfriars, and was allowed waste paper, as a perquisite. I went to Francis's house again on the 24th, in company with Read, the officer. The prisoner Francis had entered the house just before us. On turning over some old pamphlets on a shelf in the shop, I discovered two copies of Denman on the Cure of Cancer, stitched, and Francis said he had stitched them for his own reading.</p>

I went to Francis with a hackney coach, to take away the papers, and Francis asked me did I think it necessary for him to go with me to Hatton Garden office?

                  </hi>. I am confidential clerk to Mr. William John Felton. I had some conversation with the prisoner, about hireing a cabriolet—I saw him in Westbourne-place, where he inhabited a house, elegantly furnished—he described the whole of the furniture as belonging to himself—in con<lb></lb>sequence of what took place there, I let him a cabriolet—I saw him again I think, on the 28th of December—he said the cabriolet was lent to his steward to wait upon the gentlemen who were going on this excursion, and he wanted a carriage for a month, to drive Mrs. Tadman about—upon that I let him a phaeton, at the rate of six guineas a month—this was on the 28th—he was to fetch it away the next day, 29th, but he did not come for it till the 30th, about twelve o'clock—I afterwards re<lb></lb>ceived information, and waited on him, respecting this carriage—I found him at Westbourne-place—I asked him where the phaeton was—he said at the ship livery stables, at Brighton—he said he had been to Brighton himself, but he came up, I think he said the night before, by the mail, and he had left it there with some friends—I made some enquiries at Brighton, and afterwards found the phaeton at Robinson's repository, in Little Britain—I am sure it is the same carriage as the prisoner hired.</p>

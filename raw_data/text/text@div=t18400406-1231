Miller was formerly in our employ for eight or nine months, and left about a twelvemonth ago—on Monday night, the 30th of March, I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I was the last person up—the windows and doors were all safe—I got up at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and found the parlour-window open—the shutters had not been shut—we never shut them—it is in a back yard—the window had been shut down quite tight at night, but any body could lift it up—there is no fastening to it—there are gates to the back yard, which are shut at night, and bolted inside—the porter is the first person to open them—I found them open in the morning—they were bolted the night before—I missed the articles stated in the indictment from the parlour—they were all safe the night before—they were worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me—I should not think they would sell for that—they would fetch more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of the silk dresses was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can safely say they were worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Thursday following I saw the lustre, cruet-stand, and glasses at the prisoner Asher's house, in Petticoat-lane—I found the Bible in Kings<lb></lb>land-road, the knives and forks at and there place, and the tumblers and salts were found next day in Asher's house—he is a Jew, and deals in glass.</p>

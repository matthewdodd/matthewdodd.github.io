I went into a public-house in the Borough—I called for some gin and water—I was the worse for liquor when I went in—after I had been there a short time I saw the prisoner and others come in front of the bar—I found myself very much the worse for liquor, and I left the house—I had not got twenty yards before some person came and asked me to go back and have something more to drink—I refused—he gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>—I fell, and felt him draw my watch and guard from me—the watch was in my pocket, and the guard over my neck—I got up as well as. I could, and called, "Stop thief!"—I lost sight of the person, but I went on. and met the policeman coming back with the prisoner—I went to the station, and soon after saw my watch and guard brought in by a female—this is it—it</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Saturday, the 26th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I observed some dirt on the palisades of Mr. Wyatt's new house. I called Hollingsworth to watch while I informed Mr. Wyatt. He was not up, but sent word for me to go in and search. I did so, and on the third story I found Munt in a corner of the front room - there was a crow-bar by his side, bent. He advanced towards me, and I took him down to Hollingsworth. He said he came there to ease himself. I took him to the watch-house - returned to the house and searched the premises. I found no person but Munt there then. Davis was found in the same house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you searched the house after you took Munt, what did you find - A. I found three pieces of lead packed up, fresh cut. They laid on the top of the ledge, and weighed about 30 lbs.</p>

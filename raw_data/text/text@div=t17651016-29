               <p>Mr. Davidson. I am a pawnbroker, and live near Temple-bar: the prisoner brought this silk gown to me on the 23d of September, and asked 16 s. upon it: she said, it was a gentlewoman's, from whom, at various times, she had brought several things: I lent her the money upon it: I seeing it advertised, let the prosecutor know I had it: when the prisoner came again, I stop her, and she was committed: she said, she had it of a woman, but would not mention any name: there were seven shillings found in her pocket.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Hatton-garden; just by Holbourn a woman met me, and said, she would give me a shilling if I would go and pawn the gown: I did; and when I came back again the woman was gone: so I kept the money.</p>

               <p>Did they wound you at all? - Yes, across my face, they cut my eye, they cut me across my forehead, and I cut my hand almost off, they cut my throat here, and stabbed me in my breast, then I cried out as hard as I could for assistance, then they made off, and another gentleman came up to me and asked me what was the matter, I was almost killed, bleeding like any thing; they were not pursued and taken immediately, but one of them the week following, and the other the next week.</p>
               <p>They did not take any thing from you at all? - No, they knocked my hat into the dirt, and took my watch almost out, but not quite, they had tried several times at it, the watch was almost drawn out, so that you might see part of the watch, but they did not get it quite away.</p>
               <p>Did they take your hat off? - No, they did not take it away, they were obliged to go away on people coming up.</p>
               <p>Did they take it off your head or knock it off with their blows? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140084"></xptr>Did you know the prisoners before this time at all? - I have seen one of them pass by two or three times, he lives near where I live in Whitecross-street, I cannot say I knew Hooker before, or whether I ever saw him before I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was a fine night, and the lamps were lighted; they took me between two lamps.</p>
               <p>It was not moon-light? - It was quite light, I was with my back just against a lamp, and their faces near a lamp that I could see them very plain, I was within a very few yards of a lamp.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing their faces well? - I had.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing Hooker, who came up the last, distinctly? - Yes, he came up facing the lamp with his face towards me, and gave me a blow on my shoulders.</p>
               <p>In the struggle with Bates had you sufficient possession of yourself to see Hooker so as to know him again? - Yes, I had, and I did know him again, I am very sure these are both the men, I have no doubt of it in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Councel for the Prisoner Bates. The first person that came up to you was the man that you suppose to be Bates? - Yes, it was Bates.</p>
               <p>Before the other man reached you, you had been cut by the cutlass? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You felt at that time the pain in your hand? - No, I felt no pain at all, till I was taken to the surgeon's.</p>
               <p>Before this other man came up, you closed with Bates, and you was struggling with him? - I was in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>You was struggling with Bates before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When were the two prisoners taken? - Hooker was taken the Saturday following, and to the best of my knowledge, Bates was taken the Wednesday after that.</p>
               <p>Who did you receive the information from, that Hooker was taken? - I gave information against them to the patrols, and after they had taken him, they came and told me, Newman took him; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>When you gave the information, you did not know the names of these persons? - No, but I gave a description of their persons, and I went to see whether they were the persons I suspected; Hooker was taken on Saturday, and I saw him at Guildhall on Monday, I did not see him before, I knew him directly, before he came near me, he was so perfectly in my knowledge; I first saw Bates at Guildhall the second day after he was taken, I think it was on the Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Did you know him directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at Hooker's examination? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did he say anything in his own defence? - I do not recollect, he said, he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he could shew where he was that evening? - No, I did not hear, to the best of my knowledge, he said at Guildhall, he could bring somebody to prove where he was that evening.</p>
               <p>He said so, did he? - He said something like it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that he said where it was that he was? - No, he only said generally, that he would bring somebody to shew where he was.</p>
               <p>Did Bates set up any defence of that kind, when he was examined? - No, he did not; these are the clothes I had on then.</p>
               <p>(Produces a hat cut through, and a coat cut through the shoulder, and a waistcoat cut through, and the handkerchief that he had about his neck cut through, and shirt cut through all bloody.)</p>

             came into my house, about twenty minutes or a quarter after five, and called for some porter.</p>
               <p>Any body with him? - Not at that time to my recollection, in the course of about half an hour, came in two young men, and a young woman, apparently acquaintances of Hooker's who asked each other how they did when they came in.</p>
               <p>Do you know the name of either of these young men? - I never saw them in my life before.</p>

               <p>How long did Hooker stay in your house? - Till within about five or ten minutes of seven, I am not sure to a few minutes, but I will give you a reason (give me leave to express the matter that happened during this time) after these two young men and the young woman came, they called for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140086"></xptr> some crank, which is gin and water, and not being warm enough, they put it on the bar which belongs to the tap-room grate, where we put a pot or pint of beer to take the chill off; about five minutes after six my wife came into the tap-room, and said she expected her sister, whose name is Foskett, and lives near Covent Garden, to tea, but she said she would go to tea, for it was five minutes past six, and passed the compliment to two or three people that were there, and asked them if they chose to drink a dish of tea; Hooker said, he did not care if he had one, and he went to tea in the parlour with her, and returned in about ten minutes, the parlour joins to the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Did you drink tea with them? - I very seldom drink tea, but I did that afternoon, and saw him in the room.</p>
               <p>Who else drank tea? - No person but my wife and Hooker, I took one dish without sitting down, Hooker and my wife sat down, nobody else, I do not imagine there was any other person in the place; the two young men, and the young woman went out of the tap-room, and came in again in about five minutes, where they were I do not know, that was before Hooker went to tea, that was not when Hooker was at tea; while Hooker was at tea, they were in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Court. What had they with their tea? - Toast, my Lord, that I recollect particularly well, because Mr. Hooker took a piece, and the servant girl that was there was rather jocular with him, and said he would take all the toast.</p>
               <p>Who made the toast? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What had the young men and the young woman while you was drinking this tea? - Nothing but the crank, I saw them have nothing to eat, Hooker was at tea about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What became of him after tea? - He came into the tap-room after he had been in the parlour to tea.</p>
               <p>Did he drink any thing in the tap-room? - He might, I do not remember.</p>
               <p>What time did he go away? - About five minutes before seven, the reckoning was paid, I do not know which paid it.</p>
               <p>Did they go out together? - I do not recollect whether they went out together or not, a neighbour of mine, one Mr. Taylor, a box-maker, was sitting with him, and looked at the clock and said it was almost seven, and he would go home to supper, he sat on the right-hand side of the first box in the tap-room, Hooker sat the right-hand side fronting him.</p>
               <p>You have a dial in the tap-room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go away first or Hooker and his company? - Our dial was right, it is a good dial, Miller came in about a quarter or twenty minutes after five, Hooker came in before five: Miller had two or three pints of beer, nothing but beer, except some tobacco, I smoaked half a pipe with him and drank with him, nobody else was in that company but Mr. Miller and me, Hooker and these people sat opposite, I do know whether they talked.</p>
               <p>Were there any other companies? - There might be people, but I do not recollect; the box is long, and there is a seat at that end, and a seat by the fire place, Hooker sat at the corner which is at the table: I have known the family of Hooker a great many years, but have only known the prisoner by sight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Your dial was a good going dial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had had no complaints of it that day? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Well-street? - I suppose it is about a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>From the time that the prisoner Hooker came into your house to the time he went out of it after Mr. Miller, was he absent at all? - He was not absent to my knowledge out of the tap-room, only to go to drink his tea, he might go out for a minute, but nothing more, for I staid in discourse with Miller; Hooker's father is a man of very good character, the son is his <rs id="t17851214-86-deflabel401" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

               <p>Then while he was at tea, the two young men and young woman were together in the tap-room? - Not together, because the benches were apart, and not both together, in the same room.</p>

            . I see you are here accidentally: do you know Mr. Bell's house? - No, my Lord, I never was in the house, but there were once some coiners taken out of this house.</p>
               <p>Bell. The stair-case goes at the back of the street door, and a man gave a woman a bad half guinea to lie with her all night, the man was taken up for tendering this bad half guinea to the woman; and Mr. Silvester was counsel, and I there appeared like a man to prosecute; there never was a man for a felony in any respect, taken out of my house; I have never been convicted of any gaming, or serving in service time, or any thing of the kind.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Davis, the keeper of the Borough compter; I am the turnkey, I know the prisoner Bates.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had him in custody? - No.</p>
               <p>What do you come here to prove? - He came to see a prisoner at our prison, in the dusk of the evening, on the 6th of November, which happened to be on a Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember the day? - That day he had a nosegay in his bosom, and Mr. Davis himself saw him come in; says he, this is not a day to wear a nosegay, it is next Thursday, we had lost a prisoner just before, and were very particular in persons coming in and going out.</p>
               <p>Why was he to wear a nosegay next Thursday? - I suppose his meaning was because it was hanging day.</p>
               <p>What time did the prisoner come to the compter? - Between four and five o'clock, I cannot positively say to a minute.</p>
               <p>When did he go away? - I cannot possitively say the time he went away, he stayed there some considerable time and had several pots of beer, he went away by candle-light, it might be seven o'clock, but I cannot undertake to say when it was.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear it was six o'clock? - No, I cannot swear that; I cannot swear to any time particular.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing more? - Not at present.</p>

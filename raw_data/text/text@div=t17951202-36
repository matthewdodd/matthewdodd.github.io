            , the constable, George Taverner, and a Mr. Munday, who is not here; he denied it; we told him of a hamper, which we supposed contained wine; he said it did not contain wine, but that it contained china; I told him he had been seen to take a hamper across Tower-hill: we then went to his lodgings, and upon going into the room, he took this bottle of port from under his bed, and he accounted for it in this way-that it was the remaining bottle of three bottles of wine that he had bought in Bond-street, and it was the only wine he had ever had since he came to London: we then desired him to open his trunk, and on opening his trunk, there were three bottles of rum, and a number of letters, and other papers; and among those papers I found a lift of the wine which the hamper contained.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell me whether that is the paper? - A. Yes, it is; and I found the wharfinger's receipt for a hamper at Glasgow wharf, and a counter part of the letter dated the 25th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the thing you say you found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is this the hand-writing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I went to Hawley's wharf; he said it was a contrivance to take away his character: he was examined before the Lord-Mayor, and the examination taken in writing.(The hamper was produced in Court).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the direction, and tell us if you know the hand-writing of that direction? - A. It is the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>I am the brother of the prosecutor: I went to the prisoner's lodgings with Mr. Harrison, the clerk; and I am not certain whether I went with George or not; but I went to the constable, and desired him to come before I did any thing; and as I thought I might do something improper without him, we did nothing till he came: we found a bottle of red wine under the bed; we searched all over the room after we had found the bottle of wine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020054"></xptr>I said I thought it was high time we called the prisoner: I told him I had very strong suspicions he had robbed the cellar; and asked him for the key of his box, which he gave me, and the constable opened it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to the prisoner before you took him to his lodgings? - A. Yes; I taxed him with having had a hamper in his possession; he said it only contained china; he said three bottles of wine was all the wine he had had since he had been in England; and that he had bought them of somebody, I think, in New Bond-street; and we discovered, I think, four bottles of rum, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in his box? - A. Yes; a great many papers; and, among the rest, one respecting a hamper.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers; tell us if you know the hand-writing; and tell us where you found them, if you found them at all? - A. I think this different from his common writing; it seems to be more of a running-hand than his; but this I can swear to be his writing; I believe this to be taken out of his box; but as they were not opened till after I came home, I cannot say; I sent the porter to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and see if that is the direction you talk of about the hamper? - A. Yes, that is the same direction.</p>

I know that this is all malice against me, and I am innocent: this man in particular, the porter, told me, I had a right to sell all the beer bottles in the vaults; he wanted me to sell them and give Mr. Allnutt half the money; there was scarce a day but they were trying to bring me into a scrape; I told Mr. Harrison so, and he cannot deny that I told him of these circumstances.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of April last I was in the stable in same Mews; I left the stable for about five minutes, I went to borrow a truss of hay at the next stable, and when I returned I met the prisoner coming out of the stable with a coachman's frock in an apron under his arm; I throwed down the truss of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290040"></xptr>hay from my back and ran and catched him by the collar; then he desired me to let him go, I would not let go; he said there was somebody at the top of the mews wanted to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did he speak english? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he understand what you said to him? - Yes. And then he offered me his money and watch if I would let him go; I told him I did not want any thing of the kind, he should go back along with me to the stable, for he had got something more in his bag; I got him back to the stable and then I sent for somebody to come to my assistance, and then I sent to the house to let them know what had happened, and then they sent for the constable and he was taken to Marlborough-street; the constable emptied his bag and there was the coachman's great coat in the bag.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came through the street I called clothes, and as I came along to this door this man laid hold of me, two minutes after I had bought this great coat, and this man came up and seized me by the collar, and I told him if he would go back with me to the place I would shew who I bought it of.</p>

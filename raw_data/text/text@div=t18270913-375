On the 12th of September, I was returning from Fulwood's-rents, and was getting towards a state of intoxication - a friend accompanied me as far as the House of Correction. I remember after that being in company with one or two females - I will not swear there were two. I remember afterwards being told I was robbed. I remember being in a house where there was a piece of work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you not quite in a helpless state of drunkenness? A. I was going that way. I know my money was safe about half-past ten o'clock. I do not remember being at an oyster-shop or seizing any persons there.</p>

On the night in question, within ten minutes of eleven o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, and heard two females talking with a man. I knocked at my window, and said, "I don't approve of such language, and if you don't go away. I'll give charge of you." I soon after heard the watchman, I went to the door, and saw two females, and a gentleman in light trousers. Johnson who sat on his left hand took a watch out of his fob, and gave it to the one on his right - she then took something dark, which looked like a purse or pocket-book, and gave that to her; she then took something, which looked like a ribbon or chain and gave her. Johnson lives within three doors of me, I knew her well - the other had a light dress on; she went to Mrs. Hart's oyster-shop - Johnson followed, and left the gentleman within thirty yards of me. Mrs. Green called to me and said, "You saw that done, why don't you tell the gentleman where to go." I called the watchman, and pointed the house out. Mrs. Green fetched the gentleman and told him, that was where the women were gone - the watchman had got to the door by that time. I am certain the women who went into the shop are those who had been with him; but I will not swear to Bull's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. Yes - my husband is a bricklayer. I have lived there nine months; the street is infested with loose women - I frequently drive them away.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Charlotte-street, and keep an oyster shop. On the night in question, about eleven o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop; I was in the back room at supper; I went to them - they wanted a piece of fish; they gave me a penny-piece and a halfpenny for it, and one penny-piece fell on the floor; I took the candle to look for it, and the prosecutor ran in and seized me by the throat; I called Watch! the watchman came in, and said, "You are mistaken, these are the parties you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130151"></xptr>want;" and caught hold of the prisoners; they said what did he want with them, he might search them; the shop door was closed; the watchman was looking about, and a voice through the door said, "Look into the fire-place:" the watchman looked, and found a pocket-book there; I found a silk handkerchief; they searched every where, but found nothing more; the next day but one I found this Irish penny-piece on the floor; no women had been into the shop except the prisoners - the handkerchief and pocket-book could not have been there before they came; my sister was in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you kept the shop? A. Not three weeks; I let my first floor to a female, who says her husband is in Scotland - she was in bed at the time; I shut up immediately the prisoners were taken away; I was taken to the watch-house, and detained till morning, and taken to Hatton-garden, on account of the pocket-book and handkerchief being found in my house; I said they might search me; I was liberated - I do not know whether I was bailed - I do not know the meaning of it; they had not been a minute in the shop when the prosecutor came in; the handkerchief was near a basket - I pawned my ring after I left the office - I did not give any of the money to the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I searched the prisoner as far as decency would allow; but found nothing on her - the prosecutor was quite sober, and stated the same as he has now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going for some starch; he dragged me on the stairs; I said it was not the first time he had accused me wrongfully; he said he would transport me; I had a 1d. in my hand - he said on the stairs he would give me so and so: he had me here before for 4s. a year and a half ago, when I first came from Ireland; he was dragging me along, and the halfpence fell from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any arms he had got ?</p>
               <p>Tricket. No, I did not then; I said, what demand have you of ten guineas upon me? he said, for fun; I said, fun, what do you mean by fun, have you no other demand? then he put his hand to his pocket and pulled out a pistol, and clapped it to my breast, then my son pulled out a purse from his pocket and said, here friend, here is ten guineas, for God's sake take your pistol away. As I got up from my seat he still held his pistol in the same position directed to my breast, I gave a spring and took hold of the arm that held the pistol, and turned it from me, and took hold of his collar, my son jumped upon him and took hold on his other arm and collar too; I found I was not strong enough to take the pistol from him, but he turned it towards me again, I turned it from me again, and then took hold of the barrel of the pistol and let go his arm, and took hold of the handle of the pistol and wrenched it out of his hand, then he strove to get away, but we secured him. When we came to examine the pistol we found it was not charged; we carried him to the justice's and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was I sober or in liquor?</p>
               <p>Tricket. When I took the pistol out of his hand I thought he had been drinking spirituous liquors, but he came to me very straight as if he was sober, but when he was taken away he did appear to have had a little liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. By what did you judge him to be in liquor, by the smell of the liquor or by any other behaviour?</p>
               <p>Tricket. Only by the smell of the liquor, he walked as well as I can, but before the justice he behaved as if he was in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you think was his Intention, was it fun, as he called it, or was it real?</p>
               <p>Tricket. When I offered him my purse, I made no doubt but that he wanted the money, because he answered every question so readily that was asked him.</p>

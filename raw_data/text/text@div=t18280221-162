            . I am a carpenter, and live at Beckenham. On the 2d of February, I was coming from Hanworth, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, when I saw the two prisoners standing still, in company together, in a cross-road that leads to Hounslow; they saw my dog, and I said, "It is only Henry Hubbard." I knew them both before; Chapman lived at Twickenham, and Beaks used to live at Hampton. Beaks said to Chapman, "Find the jemmy." Chapman said, "You find it," and he found it by the ditch - I said, "Let me look at it." which they did, and I asked what the round end was for; they said, "For staple work." I then went on to Mr. Simmons's, and gave information: we went and laid wait for them about seven or eight yards from Mr. King's - they came up, passed, and walked on. We heard a crash, similar to a door being opened - I said, "I think they have got in." We then went and fetched two more men from a little distance - we waited there till about half-past three o'clock, and then saw the prisoners come out with some wet linen, ten fowls, and this thermometer: they were together, and had the property on their shoulders - we went afterwards and saw they had opened a door to get into the hen-house.</p>

            . I am a constable of Twickenham. Hubbard gave me information, I went and laid wait with him; I did not see the prisoners go into the house, but they came out at the back, and threw the bundles over the pails - I jumped out of the hedge and followed them: Beaks was stopped by an officer in about an hour; I am quite sure they are the men. I examined the premises, and found they had broken open the door of the out-house - the crow-har was found on Beaks.</p>

            . I keep the house, which was broken open. I lost ten fowls, and this thermometer from my green-house, it is marked, "J. Young, Hampton." The hen-house was broken open, but the green-house was not locked: they opened a gate to get into the garden. I saw the fowls before the magistrates, but they have not been kept.</p>

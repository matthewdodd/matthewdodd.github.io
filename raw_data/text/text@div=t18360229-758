                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday the 10th of February, I was in white cross-street at half past four o'clock in the morning, near the prosecutor's shop, on the other side of the road—I heard a noise in the shop—I went over and found the door secure as usual, with a chain and padlock on—I called to my brother constable Bartlett, and went to find Mr. Hill—he does not sleep at the shop—I left Bartlett there—I returned with Mr. Hill in about twenty minutes, and found Bartlett still there—Mr. Hill opened the door—we found the back door broken open—I searched the premises outside, and during the time I was searching there, the two prisoners dropped over a wall into a passage—Barlett apprehended Ross with the eels in his cap, and brought him into the shop—Ross said if we would only let him go he would never do so any more—he said that it was his brother-in-law who was with him, and that they both lived at No.3, Chequer-alley, with their father-in-law—Bartlett had some salt fish in his possession, which the other prisoner dropped as he ran away—I took Ross to the station-house—Hargrave we took Browm on the Saturday.</p>

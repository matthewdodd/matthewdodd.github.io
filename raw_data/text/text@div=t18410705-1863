                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Hemmings, and live in King-street, Lower-road, Islington. My daughter, Mary Ann Hemmings, is six years old—she went out to play on the 23rd of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening—she had her petticoat and shift on—I did not see her again till half-past eight in the evening, when I heard she was taken away, and I went in search of her—I was in great anxiety about her—I looked about for her—she was brought home from the watch house—she had been stripped of her shift and petticoat—I never saw the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father. I went out to play in the street after tea-time—the prisoner came and spoke to me—she asked me to go on an errand for her, and said, "Come along with me, and I will give you a new white frock with two flounces"—she said she would give me a new shift and a new pinafore, and a pair of white Adelaide boots—she took me into the fields, and asked me to sit down—she said, "Let me look at the pattern of your frock"—then she took off my shift and petti<lb></lb>coat, and put them in her apron, and then got up and walked on, and went away with me, when the gentleman came up and took hold of her.</p>

On the night of 5th Jan., I was coming home—I was in East Smithfield—I sat on the step of a door for a few minutes, to tie my boot-lace—the prisoner interrupted me, and began to pull me about—I told him to go away, I did not interrupt him, and he should not interrupt me—he would not go away—I came off the step, and walked towards home—he walked by the side of me, but he walked much quicker than I did, and he got a distance before me; he then returned to me and tore my apron clean from me; and from my pocket he took my money—I had a five-shilling</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" on Tower-hill, close to the Mint, near East Smithfield—I saw the prisoner walking, followed by the last witness—I stopped him, and she said in his presence, "Search that man, he has robbed me of a five shilling piece, a half crown piece, and some odd silver—she was drunk—I asked the prisoner what money he had got about him—he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out some coppers—he said, "I have got about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of coppers"—I observed he had got something in his mouth; I asked him what it was—he said he had some tobacco—he threw a shilling out of his mouth on the pavement, which I picked up—I then observed he had got something else in his mouth, which he was endeavouring to swallow—I told him to take it out—he made a motion with his head and throat, as if he were endeavouring to swallow it—I took him by the throat, and squeezed him—I told him not to choke himself, but put it out—another constable came up, and did the same—I said, "Take it out of your mouth, and don't choke yourself"—he said, "If I do, you won't hurt me, will you?"—I said, "Take it out of your mouth"—and he took out with his hand a half crown piece, four shillings, some of which were counterfeit, and one sixpence—I searched him to see if he had any more—he had not any more—he said some of the money was bad—the four shillings were bad—the half crown was given to the prosecutrix by order of the Magistrate—the four shillings I gave to the Mint solicitor yesterday.</p>

I had come from Manchester nine days previous; I received a letter, telling me that my box would be sent to Castle Inn yard, by the waggon - I went there, and on my way to the booking-office, I saw this gentleman, who accosted me by saying "What is that man doing with the box?" I said "I suppose it is his own, you had better ask him;" he walked round, and said "I shall detain you," and collared me: he said I was going to steal the box; I said I had nothing to do with it, and did not know the other man. On the way to the watch-house the man said "This is a very curious business, if you will give me some money I will make things pleasant for you." I said I had no money, but if drink would do, I would give him some rather than be locked up.</p>

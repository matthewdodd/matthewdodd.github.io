               <p>I am a watchman, I saw the prisoner go through the gate this night with two bags thrown upon his shoulders.</p>

               <p>Court. Do not you think this was a great neglect of duty? - I think it was one of the carpenter's men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Are you sure it was me that came through at that time of night? - Yes, I will take my oath of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you know him before? - I took notice of the colour of his dress, his hat, and trowsers, and every thing.</p>

               <p>Not from the features of his face, did you see any body in company with him? - Nobody at all.</p>

               <p>Court to Giles. Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I know it is the same man, I gave a description of him immediately.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He was the man that advised me to it, he was in the shop with me before he met me, and asked me where I was going.</p>

               <p>Court. It is impossible to prove that these are the things that were stolen, having put no mark upon them.</p>

               <p>Fryer. My Lord, his confession was taken in writing.</p>

               <p>Court. But it is not here, you cannot give evidence of that.</p>

               <p>Fryer. I can swear to this screw-driver which was made out of a hanger, which I took out of Wallis's lodging by the confession of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Wallis. I know this screw-driver, I saw the prisoner put it in the ceiling, the next morning he said he would get it sharpened and go on the highway.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. How could I get out of the gate when the watchman was there, I have not a friend in the world.</p>

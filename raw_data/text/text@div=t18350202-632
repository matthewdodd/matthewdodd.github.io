On Friday, the find, of January, the prisoner came into the hall at the Hummums, a few minutes before three o'clock—he had a green shade over his eyes, and a cloak on, which resembled this one—he inquired for Major James—I said I did not know Major James—he said he was going to dine there—I said I did not know him, but very possibly he might be coming to dime there—he then said, "I want a porter to walk with me a little way, I have something for him to do"—I went out with him—we went down Tavistock-row, and down Bedford-street—when we got to the bottom the prisoner went into Mr. Webb's shop, at the corner of the Strand and Bedford-street, and he desired me to wait outside—he came out again with a letter in his hand, and crossed over to the other corner of Bedford-street—he held the letter up, and directed me to go with it—he said, "Take this to No. 16, St. James's-street, and wait an answer, and I shall be at the Hummums"—this is the same letter, I have every reason to be<lb></lb>lieve</p>

               <p>—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I went to No. 16, St. James-street—I found it to be the Banking-house of Herries, Farquhar, and Co.—I went in and gave the letter to Mr. Hance, one of the clerks—I was taken into a back parlour where some gentlemen sat—they asked me from whom I brought the letter, and I told them I brought it from a gentleman, but I did not know his name—there was some conversation between them, but I cannot tell what, and I was allowed to come out—when I came out, I saw the prisoner looking at me very intently, and watching me—he was facing the door in St. James-street—I had my hand in my pocket, and walked on—the prisoner fol<lb></lb>lowed me round into King-street—I noticed him very much, and was al<lb></lb>most positive he was the man that gave me the letter—I went back, and stated my suspicions to the clerks at the banking-house—there was some time elapsed, and Mr. Hance then came out with me—we went up to St. James-square, and saw the prisoner on the right hand side of the square, nearly facing No. 6, on the Pall-Mall side—I tapped him on the shoulder as he was walking gently on—I said, "I beg your pardon, but I believe you are the gentleman who gave me a letter from the Hummums, and took me to the bottom of Bedford-street—he said, "No, I think you are mis<lb></lb>taken"—when I heard his voice, I was almost positive he was the man—Mr. Hance then came up and spoke to him, and asked him to walk back to the banking-house with us—we came back together, Mr. Hance taking hold of his arm, and I walked a little behind, just behind the prisoner, as close as I could walk—as we were going along, Mr. Hance said, "He has thrown something down, pick it up"—I saw a person walking behind me, and he picked up a green shade—he was holding it in his hand—I said, "I beg your pardon, give that to me, it belongs to this gentleman"—I might have said, "I beg your pardon," I will not be positive—the person gave me the shade—this is it—I do not know whether the prisoner heard what I said about the shade—he might have heard it—I do not know that he did—this shade is very similar to the one the prisoner had over his eyes when he came to the Hummums.</p>

            . I overtook the prisoner at the White Hart on this side Newington, about five o'clock that morning that the prosecutor was robbed; I asked him where he was going; he said, to Leadenhall-market to see a friend; the coat he had on was blue-grey, with a black cape and black buttons, and a red waistcoat; he had a parcel in a sack on a stick on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Wakefield. One of my coats and waistcoat were as Frazier has described.</p>

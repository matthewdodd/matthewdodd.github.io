               <p>Q. Where was he? - A. On the bottom stair of the stairs leading from my room; as soon as he saw me, he dropped them; I told him to go up stairs, and let somebody search him; there was a great mob round the door; after a great deal of persuasion, he went up.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the petticoats that he dropped? - A. I made him pick them up; I found the room-door unlocked, and the padlock taken off; I went into the room with him, and desired him to let me call some man or other to search him; he would not have any body to search him; he pulled a bed-gown from under his coat, and said, now you have got your property, let me go; I told him, I would send for an officer if he would not let somebody or other search him; I called out at the window, and somebody fetched an officer, Mr. Trott; the prisoner was not searched till he got to the office; Mr. Trott took fourteen keys out of his pocket, and Mr. Osman took a cloak and a key out of his other pocket; then Mr. Osman took a black silk cloak and a black silk petticoat out of his hat; one of the cloaks belonged to my sister; she had lent it me; her name is Margaret May.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - I am an officer: On Wednesday, the 13th instant, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I was sent for; the office is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's; I went up into Mrs. Crouchman's room, and saw the prisoner; I knew him; I asked him what he had been about; he said, he had done nothing; I found two petticoats, a bed-quilt, and a night-gown, lying close by him; I took him to the office; I met one of my brother-officers, Osman, he walked behind, endeavouring to keep the people back; the prisoner said, cannot you try and compromise this matter for me? I told him, I could not, he must go to the office; he seemed very uneasy, and shuffled his left-hand about; Osman laid hold of his hand, and he immediately pulled out a silk cloak; at the office we found in his hat a silk cloak and a silk petticoat; I searched him in the office-yard, and found some keys in his right-hand coatpocket, I cannot exactly say how many there were; I found some others in his right-hand coatpocket, I cannot exactly say how many there were; I found some others in his right-hand breeches-pocket, I believe altogether thirteen or fourteen; there are two of them that will open Mrs. Crouchman's padlock.( - Osman, another officer, produced the keys and the property found upon the prisoner, which was identified by Mrs. Crouchman.)</p>

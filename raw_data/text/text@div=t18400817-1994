                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Dormer, an undertaker, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the 27th of June I saw a boy about the size of Brown going out of the front shop, with a bundle in a blue handkerchief—I went out, and when I got to the corner of the next street he was in company with another boy in a fustian dress—the boys were about the prisoner's size—the other boy was without a jacket—I went into the house, and missed my husband's coat—I found it at the station-house about an hour and a half after, and the prisoners were there dressed as the boys were—this is the coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

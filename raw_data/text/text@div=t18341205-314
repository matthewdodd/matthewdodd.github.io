                  </hi>. I am a City officer. I took the prisoner on Thursday, the 4th of December, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars—I found some papers on him—I took him to Giltspur-street Compter; and, on the 10th, after he was committed, as I was taking him to Newgate, he asked me if I thought he should be as comfortable there as he had been at Giltspur-street—I told him I thought he would—he said, "I shall give no trouble; I intend to plead guilty"—I believe that was all he said, except desiring me to call for his coat and bundle.</p>

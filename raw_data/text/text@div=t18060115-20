She missed some sheets. The prisoner was called up stairs, and she said they were gone to the washerwoman's; I said to her, you have no right to send the sheets to the washerwoman's without your mistress's leave. I asked her where the washerwoman lived, she would not tell me; she said that was nothing to me so long as I got my things back again. I then fetched an officer to search her, taking the key of her room with me, in the mean time she went up stairs and broke her room door open, and when we searched her, we found a vast number of duplicates, and two duplicates were found upon her of sheets belonging to me.

               <p>Q. How do you know that she broke the door open? - A. There was nobody in the house besides her, I had locked the door. The officer came and searched her, and found a great many duplicates upon her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Eagle-street, Maryle<lb></lb>bone. About half-past seven o'clock on the morning of the 4th of March I went to a public-house—I was not drunk—I was a little the worse for liquor—as I was going along the prisoner accosted me, and asked if I would treat her—I said I would—she took me to the Red Lion in Gilbert-street, and we had something to drink—I fell asleep, having been up all night—I had five half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences—I saw it safe when I paid for some purl when I went in—I fell asleep immediately; and was roused up again by feeling the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I Put my hand in and missed ray money.</p>

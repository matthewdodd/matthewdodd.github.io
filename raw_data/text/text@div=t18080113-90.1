               <p>Q. When had you seen these clothes. - A. On the 13th of January, between two and three o'clock; when I went up stairs the prisoner was supporting the lid of the box with one hand and turning over the things with the other hand; the box had been left locked, and strapped over; besides I had seen the box about half an hour before that, it appeared safe then; the prisoner said he had been taking things out two or three times and selling them.</p>
               <p>Q. This room did not belong to the prisoner. - A. No, he went through that room to go to his own.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this, did you alarm the house. - A I did, but he went down stairs and went out; we did not see him for two or three hours; before he got to the foot of the stairs, I called my mistress, she was cleaning herself, she came as soon as she could, he was gone then.</p>

I am a constable of St. Geerge's; Hanover-square; I examined the box and the room, the room door was wide open, the staple of the box had been forced and the lock drove back; at nine o'clock the prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house; the prisoner never spoke a word till he got down stairs at the watchhouse; I said it must be him that had sold the three waistcoats, two without sleeves and one with; and I told him he had got other things besides; he immediately said, I suppose you mean those things I have got under my pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Lawler's house did you see the things that were under the pillow. - A. Yes, I took them out.

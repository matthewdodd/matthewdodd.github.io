            . I was in the service of the prosecutor in August. I know this dozen of locks to be his property; there is something peculiar about the make of the lock, but more about the make of the key; the bit of it is short, and it is not glazed as they generally are - they are common locks, but of a different description to the generality of them; they came to my master's on the 9th of August, from Mr. Wright, of Wolverhampton; the basket was unpacked on the 10th of August, which was Friday, and on the Tuesday following I looked on the shelf on which I had placed the parcels, and missed some of them, but did not notice how many; nineteen dozen came, and I believe one dozen was missing - I had not sold any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you unpack them? A. Yes, and marked them all; they came in four and six dozen papers - the papers have been taken off these - they are worth 3s. a dozen.</p>

            . I am a wholesale ironmonger, and live at Wolverhampton. On the 9th of August I sent some parcels of locks to Mr. Hawkins, these are a part of the nineteen dozen I sent him; they are made to a particular pattern - there is something peculiar about the bolt and the key; we never had more than the nineteen dozen which we sent to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they ordered from this particular pattern? A. No, but from my representation; another manufacturer might have such, but I should think it very unlikely; I saw them packed, and these are the locks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in South-street, Finsbury-square. I was walking along Ratcliffe-highway, between twelve and one o'clock on the 5th of December, and felt something moving at my coat tail-pocket—I turned suddenly round, and found two young men close behind me, one of whom, the prisoner, had my handkerchief in his hand—finding he was detected, he immediately threw it away—I seized him and called "Police," and in about five minutes the beadle came forward, and I gave him into his charge—the other one ran away immediately.</p>

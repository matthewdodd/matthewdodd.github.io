I received possession of the table from a house where the prisoner was lodging; he was then in custody - the prisoner took my brother officer to the place, and I waited at the door; I went again afterwards - we broke the door, and I took possession of the table; the prisoner said that he had taken the tiles off the house and got it out, and then he said there was a square of glass broken and he put his hand in.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hackney. I went to the Weavers' Arms on the 6th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and said I wanted him about a table - he said if I would go into the parlour he would speak to me about it; he then said he saw the parlour window of the house open, that he got in and took the table to his own lodging, and if I would go with him he would show it to me; I took him to Mrs. Peachey, and she identified him - I then went to his lodging; he took the key out of his pocket, opened the door, and showed me the table - he told me in the room, and also on the way to the station, that he went to the back of the house, got up the tiles, got in at the one pair back window, and took the table to take care of; he then said it was on the Sunday evening - he had before said it was on Saturday; he made no difficulty in showing me the table, but I had a good deal of trouble to coak him away - I took him to the station-house, and got from him a knife which he had; I then wanted the key of his lodging, but he said the whole five of us should not get that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On the 3rd of June last I was going towards home - I found the shutters, door and window of my mother's house open; I went into the house, found no one there, and all the goods were gone with the exception of a table, which I took away, for fear some person should go and take it away, when I took it to my lodgings three doors off - on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300062"></xptr>Monday I was taken into custody; I had not the least intention of making away with the table - when the officer came I immediately took him where the table was, knowing myself innocent of any intention to steal.</p>

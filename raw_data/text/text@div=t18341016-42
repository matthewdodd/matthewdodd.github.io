            . I am the prosecutor's son. The prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some water, but I did not hear him - my father had a gold watch in the shop, which he lost - I stood in the shop while my sister went to the yard to get some water - I have seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Was there a woman in the shop when the prisoner was there? A. Yes; and half an hour after they had both left, I missed the watch.</p>

             (police-constable S 155). On the 2nd of October, I saw the prisoner at No. 7, Skinner-street, Somer's-town - he had a watch, and was fitting a key to it- I asked him how he came by the watch - he said it was his father's, who had sent him to get a key to it - I asked him where he lived, and he said in Little Coram-street - I knew he did live there, and I let him go - on the Saturday afterwards, Mr. Barling came to the station-house, and gave a description of him, and I went and saw him in Coram-street - I said a gentleman wanted to speak to him - he walked a little way by my side, and then ran off - I pursued and took him - I found this watch on him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

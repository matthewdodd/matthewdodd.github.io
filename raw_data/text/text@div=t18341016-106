               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been drinking that day? A. I had during the morning; from the time I left my lodging before I met her, I had three glasses of ale - that was between nine and three o'clock - I cannot say how many public-houses I went to - I did not drink any thing at the house I went to with the prisoner - gin was sent for, at my expense, by her desire - but I did not desire it to be sent for - I drank none of it - I gave 6d. or 1s. for it - I believe it was 1s. - I was quite sober - the watch-chain was not put about my neck by the prisoner - I did not go down stairs and return again - I swear I was quite sober - the person who was with me that afternoon, is in France now - I did not miss my watch for an hour - I went straight home after leaving the prisoner, and at tea-time was asked what o'clock it was, and missed it- the prisoner did not state that I had left the watch with her until I should meet her next day - I was not present when she gave up the duplicate - I went to a house after she was in custody, and she there threw down the duplicate on the table, and said there it was for me if I wished - I was lodging at No. 48, Park-street, then.</p>

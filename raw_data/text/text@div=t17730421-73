On the 26th of March I missed one of the silver spoons that were in my care: the prisoner was a milk carrier that served the family. A man came in the afternoon from the Rotation Office, and asked me if I had lost a spoon; I said we had; he said if I would go to the Rotation Office at five o'clock that evening I should see the woman that took the spoon: I went there; the spoon was produced; it had my master's cypher upon it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in West-street, Seven Dials: the prisoner offered me this spoon (producing it) on the 25th of March; I stopped her; she said it was a family spoon of her husband's; I asked her if she would go before a magistrate, and swear it was her property; she said, yes, and went eagerly; when I came to Mr. Welch's office it was shut up; I kept the spoon, and told her if she would come next day, and bring any body to prove it was her's, she should have it; she came next day and brought another woman, who said it was the prisoner's property, and gave her a good character. I would not deliver it up but took her before a magistrate; she there said she found it in Mr. Steward's passage.</p>

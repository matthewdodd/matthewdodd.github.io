                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick William Crouch, and live in Brook-street, Kennington-road. On Wednesday, the 21st of Aug., about two o'clock in the day, I was walking near Garden-row, London-road—I missed my purse, containing five shillings and two sixpences, from my right-hand pocket, on being spoken to by a person in the street—I had my purse safe about ten minutes before—I did not perceive it done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Folkard, a pawnbroker, in the London-road. On the 21st of August, about two o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner near Mrs. Crouch, who was walking in Garden-row—the prisoner was in company with three others—I saw him take up Mrs. Crouch's gown in his hand, and put his hand into the pocket, take it out, and put it into his own trowsers' pocket, as if he delivered something into his pocket—they then all turned round, and seemed consulting which way they should go—they walked out into the middle of the road—I ran down into the shop, and told our young man what I had seen done—I took him to the side door, and showed him the prisoner—I said, "Shall I go and lay hold of him?"—he told me to wait till he saw a policeman—he went, and saw one, and directly they saw him call a policeman they all ran away—I was on the second floor, and had a full view of the street—I distinctly saw the prisoner lift the dress and put his hand into the pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What side of the road was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The opposite side—the street is about fifty yards wide from where I saw him—I was not in the warehouse—that is on the third floor—Young was the person I spoke to—he is not here—I showed him the prisoner—he took the purse from the lady's right pocket, and put it into his left—I did not see what it was—he had it in his hand, closed—it was a fine day—I had never seen the pri<lb></lb>soner before—I was looking at him four or five minutes—I ran down—I thought that was the best way of catching him—this occurred on Wednesday—I saw him two days after in Tower-street station; not in the ceil; he was brought out by a policeman to me into a room—the policeman said, "Is this the man?"—I said, "Yes"—I have made mistakes in my life very often—I do not attend in the shop—I am seventeen years old next month.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is your sight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very good indeed—the prisoner had on a green frock coat, black trowsers, Wellington boots, black satin waist<lb></lb>coat, and black silk handkerchief—I described him to the policeman, by his countenance and dress too.</p>

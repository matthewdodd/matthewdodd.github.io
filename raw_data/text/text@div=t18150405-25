            . I was in company with Mr. Miller. When I stepped off the pavement Miller called me, and said he was robbed of his watch. I saw a young man run directly from him, that was the prisoner. I followed him through Fleet-street into Fetter-lane. He was stopped; I am sure the prisoner is the man. I followed; I desired the constable to take him into custody, and to be particular that he did not let any thing fall.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of stop thief. I stopped the prisoner; a person came up and gave me charge of him. I conveyed him to the watchhouse with difficulty. On taking the prisoner into the watch-house he squatted down on his bottom; I put my hand down to help him up round his waist; I found in his hand the watch ribbon. I took the watch from him; the prisoner denied all knowledge of the watch and seals some of the young men about the watchhouse said, they had seen the ribbon hang out of the prisoner's breeches. A search was made for the seals; the ribbon and seals were found in the constable's chair, close by the fire place; the prosecutor came into the watch-house, and owned the watch and seals; I produce the watch and seals.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my watch and seals.</p>

I was coming home from Kennington, and coming along Fleet Street there was a mob; I went to see what was the cause of this mob; I then proceeded towards my home; I heard the cry of stop thief. This gentleman came up and said, I was the person that had robbed him of his watch; I was then dragged to the watchhouse; I told them I had not robbed any one of his watch.</p>

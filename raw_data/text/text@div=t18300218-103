               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you told the whole of this story? A. I believe I have - I did not go out of the road at all; I live at Hoxton - I do not work so late as that; I had no halfpence about me, and gave her none - I cannot say why she cried Murder! I had my hand on her, trying to keep her down, and more were fighting me; I do not know that there were any halfpence found on her - there were three penny-pieces; they had not been in my pocket - we were not walking arm-in-arm- I felt her hand in my pocket, drawing out the money, at the corner of the turning, when she introduced my hand to her person; I did not give her the three penny-pieces to do that - I do not know whether I was at the sign of the Hare on the 8th of February. I deny, on my oath, calling on the prisoner's father - he came to my house on the Monday night, and asked if a carpenter lived there, and said he had a job for him; I did not ask 30s. to let her go - I had money offered me; and at the office a young man pulled out money and offered me; I do not know one Mautz by name- I went to the Hare on the Monday; no money was offered me there, but I have had it offered by him - Chapman and another person were with me at the Hare; I did not say "It was not the prisoner took it, but I believe her name is not Susan Jones" - Chapman and I did meet at the Green Dragon on Tuesday; I will swear I did not ask a man there to pay 30s. into the hands of my principal witness, and then I would have the bill thrown out.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHAPMAN. I am a carpenter, and was with the witness - three girls came up: one of them kept me behind, and the other two walked on; the prisoner was one: she was detained by my mate - I did not see what was done, but he called out that he was robbed, and I ran up - the prisoner wanted to get away, and he held her down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it a light night? A. Yes - there were a good many people round; the witness cried out for the watch, and she cried Murder! I do not know which cried out first; he had had 25s. paid him by his master at the King's Arms - I do not know any thing about money being offered him but what he told me; I saw no money offered him at the Hare or the Green Dragon - he said they had been trying to make it up, and he would have nothing at all to do with it.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN WOOD. I am a watchman. I heard the call and went up; I found the prisoner, the two carpenters, and some women - the prosecutor had the prisoner down; I collared him, and asked what he was doing with her - he said, "I give you charge of her - she has robbed me of part of my wages;" I said, "Let her get up, and we will overhaul her" - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use - she has given it to another girl;" she got up, gave me three penny-pieces, and said  that was what he had given her for a certain purpose; in going to the watch-house she ran up a passage, and the patrol took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she appear to have been illused? A. I thought so at first. I think the cry I first heard was of a female; she gave up the 3d., and said that was all she had.</p>

The warehouse in question is in his occupation, and joins the dwelling-house—there is an internal communication—on the night of the 11th of April, I was alarmed—the warehouse window was three or four inches up—it is sixteen feet from the ground—they might have got in by getting up the water-spout, which had been moved out of its place, and partly pulled down—the door leading from the dwelling-bouse to the warehouse, was broken open—the lock was nearly wrenched off—the counting-house desks were both broken open, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper missing, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, about 2lbs. of cigars removed from a box in the counting-house, and put on the counter in the warehouse—I saw a match-box there—the prisoners were found in the cellar, which they must have gone through the warehouse to get to—the tobacco was wrapped up in a coat of mine, and had been moved from its proper place, and is the prosecutor's property—we found seven locks broken altogether—one in the dwelling-house—that was the warehouse door leading to the dwelling-house—I saw the chisels found—there was several hundred weight of tobacco on the premises manufactured, and a great deal of leaf tobacco.</p>

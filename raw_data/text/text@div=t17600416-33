I went there with my son, and we found other parcels there; I had left orders at home to let him go. There were about eight ounces in the whole. I had not spoke to him about it at that time. Then I called him into the shop, and asked him if these filings were not my property, and told him where I found them. He said they were, asked pardon, and said he was sorry for what he had done; he owned he had taken all that, and what he had about him, in about a week's time. I got an officer, and took him before Mr. Fielding, where he confessed the filings were my property, and the justice committed him.</p>

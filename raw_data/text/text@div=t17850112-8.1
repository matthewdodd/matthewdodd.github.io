               <p>I live in Blossoms-inn, Lawrence-lane, I am a Coachman, and drive the Manchester coach, I came out of Northampton, about five in the morning, and when I came four miles on this side Newport, I picked up the prisoner, and brought him as far as Highgate, when I came there it began to be dusk, and I asked him to pay me his fare, before he got into London, he said he should not pay me till he came to London, I asked him the reason, and he made many words, he said he should not pay me, for he had no money, I told him he must be a bad kind of a man, not to have money, and we had a few words, and I put him withinside the coach, as it was very cold, to ride a little way, having but few passengers, and he had a great bulk in his pocket, and I did not know but he might have some of my parcels about him; the only satisfaction I could get of him, was that he had friends in London, and he would pay me before he slept, I said if he did not I should be satisfied, with putting him in the Poultry Compter, as his fare came to seven shillings, then I insisted on searching him, to see if he had any of my parcels, and in searching him, I found this tankard with the lid screwed off in the situation it is now, and there being many people in the house, (which was the Red Lion at Highgate) they advised me to charge him with a constable; we have had four stolen from Northampton, and it was advertised, I did not know but it was one of them, the next morning at Hickes's Hall, the prisoner said it was his father's, and his grandfather's, and they were both dead, and now it was his.</p>

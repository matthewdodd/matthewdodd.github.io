               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 6th of June, seeing the two prisoners at the bar? - Yes, very well; the tall one I observed at a distance off, at Mr. Ghrimes, as I supposed lashing something to a long stick that they had in their hands; after that they both proceeded down to Mr. Ghrimes's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the long stick? - I cannot say perfectly; they were both close together. They looked at the house to see if any body were looking out of window, and up and down the street; on which the short one laid down on his belly, and presently I see him pull up from the window a piece of white linen, which the big one put in his apron, and went out to the middle of the street and looked round, and by that time the short one had another piece up with his stick, and after that he hooked up another; and by that time the watchman began to come his beat, and they walked away, and went down and informed the watchman what I had seen, and I went down the back street to endeavour to meet them, and before I got to the watchman again he had got Smith, the tali one; the other I did not see; then we took him down to the watch use, and there I left him.</p>

               <p>Q. You remember the last witness pointing out these persons to you? - Yes. This gentleman came over to me, just after four o'clock in the morning, and told me that he had seen two men lurking about there, and observed them drawing some linen out of an area window, and that the best way to take them was to go up the back street; accordingly we did, he went round, and I went the other way; I caught the biggest of the prisoners with the hook in his hand, tucked up his sleeve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did; he had nothing else but this.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the other prisoner? - We took him on Saffron-hill, the same morning, soon afterwards; he had a bundle in his hand, and that bundle contained the things that were lost.</p>

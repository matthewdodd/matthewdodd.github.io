            . I am an officer. On Tuesday October the 18th, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I meet the prisoner along with two more that I thought suspicious characters; I immediately seized the prisoner, and under his arm was a large bundle; the other two made their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I suppose, seized him because he had the bundle - A. Yes; I asked him what he had got, he told me a large box coat, he had brought it from his father in Shoreditch; I then asked him where he was going to carry it to, he said to No. 111, Lower Thames street; I asked him if he knew the gentleman's name in Thames street; he did not; I was not satisfied; I took and locked him up; I told him I would go and enquire, and if I found it was true, I would come and release him immediately; he made a jeer of me and said it is all right. I went to both Lower and Upper Thames street, I could not find any one; on the Wednesday I took him before the lord mayor, he was committed till the Saturday, and the coat was ordered to be advertised by his lordship; Mr. Nowlan came forward and proved his property before the lord mayor.</p>

            . I saw the coat taken from the chaise on Tuesday the 18th of October about one o'clock - one took it off the chaise and threw it on the other's arm; and this one was walking up Mr. Nowlan's gateway, he was one of the party.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you know his person - A. Yes.</p>

I was coming from my mother, she lived by Shoreditch church; when I was coming up past Spital square I met a man, he asked me to carry this coat, he would give me a shilling; it was tied up in a black apron; I took out my pocket handkerchief and tied it up; coming along by Union street I met Mr. Sapwell, he asked me what I had got; I said a great coat, I was going to carry it to Thames street; he never asked me where I brought it from.</p>

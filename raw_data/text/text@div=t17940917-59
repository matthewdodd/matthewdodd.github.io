               <p>Q. What did you do with them? - I pledged a shirt with one Mr. Warner, in Spicalfrelds, and I pledged the stockings, tied up in a silk handkerchief, in the same place; I cannot say particularly to the day.</p>

               <p>Q. To Stratford. Is that the young woman that pledged the things with you? - It is; on the 20th of August the stockings and handkerchief, and the shirt on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Carr. That there watch, shirt, and pair of stockings, and this shirt which I have got on now. I bought in Rosemary-lane, about five weeks ago, there were two jews standing together, I was coming by, one of them said, young man, do you want to buy any shirts? Yes, says I, I do; says he, here are two shirts I will fell you for half a crown a piece, I took the shirts; and I gave her three shillings for the stockings; and for the watch I gave three guineas and a half; I took them to my lodgings, I put them in my drawer; and I also bought a pair of boots, which Mr. Arm strong has got; I told the young woman of it that I lived with; and since I have been in New Prison I told her to take the key of my drawer, and to go and pawn the watch, shirt, and stockings, which she did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reynolds. I know nothing of the property, but that shirt that was taken off my back, which I bought about three weeks ago, as high as I can guess, and when I bought it the srill was on it, and as I examined it I saw a place sewed up in the slap, and the person let me have it the cheaper for that; the man asked me five shillings for it, and I bid him four; and by means of the place sewed up in the slap, he let me have it, he told me it had been tore; the young woman that they have got an evidence against me, is witness to my shirt.</p>

Young and I, and the mate of another ship, about ten o'clock, found the prisoner Elber at a public-house, in Limehouse, He had hid himself behind the door of the necessary, where Young took him; he confessed he took the tallow, and had sold it, to one Taylor, in St. Ann's, Lime-house. We went to Taylor's, he said, he had bought none; the prisoner said, he had, and that he had took it over the way and weighed it; and told him it weighed forty-one pound, bag and all. We asked Taylor where it was; then he said, it was gone out, but he believed he could get it presently: we insisted upon it being got, that I might see it: then the prisoner said, he took it to Brigg's lodgings, and said, he had got a prize, and did not know where to sell it, and Briggs shewed him Taylor's shop, where he might sell it; the tallow was brought to Young's house, where I was; the tallow looks like the same, the bag I am positive to.</p>

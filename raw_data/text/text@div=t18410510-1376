I am a soap-manufacturer—my factory is in Dock-street, Rosemary-lane—Flynn was one of my labourers—about five oil six o'clock on the evening of the 7th of April, one of my men came and told me something—I went round another way to meet Flynn, but did not see him—I then ran through a back alley into Barnes's, who has a shop in Glasshouse-street—he appears to sell very little—I ran into the shop—there was no one there—I went into the back room, which is a bed-room—I saw Flynn, Barnes, and Mrs. Barnes, all together—thirty-seven lbs. of soap, worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was by the side of the bed, covered over—Flynn tried to scramble under the bed, out of sight—Mrs. Barnes attempted to go out at a back-door—Barnes asked me to forgive him, that he had never brought it there before—I understood him to mean Flynn—he asked me to let Flynn carry it out of my back-door, and carry it back to the factory again—I got a policeman, and gave them into custody.</p>

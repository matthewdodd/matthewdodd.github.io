The prisoner Paxton asked me, if I had a single room to be let; I told him I had one with two bedsin it, in one which two young men slept. He agreed to take this, and brought several little bundles there that night; the other prisoner came in on Friday following and asked for these bundles; he came and said, has not Harry something here? I said he has; he said I am come for his things, has he not a packing case here; I told him he had, but refused to let him have his things at first, but afterwards permitted him to take them. I can't say what were taken away. My servants brought the things down, and Pope packed them in the packing case. He said Harry, meaning Paxton had got a place as coachman in the country, and he, Pope, was to send his things down to him. Pope was dressed like a coachman, and I said where do you live coachman? he told me at the other side of Russel square; but it afterwards appeared he did not. I said if Paxton went to him to tell him to send his clothes into the country, he might have called upon me in his way; but Pope said it was he that went to Paxton.</p>

I told him that Paxton was charged with having committed a my on that night. Then said the coachman if that is the case, I won't tell a lie for any body; he never did sleep here.

            , at Cheney's Mews; and he said the reason he did not tell me the truth at first, was for fear he should get the coachman anger. I then went to 25, Cheney's Mews, with Paxton; but Pope was not there. We then went to his lodgings, which Paxton knew, and which were in Mortimer Market. I found Pope there. I put some questions to him whether Paxton had slept at his stables on the Wednesday night; he said he had; he had lent him a horse cloth, in which he slept in the hay loft. I said if you can prove that, this man must be innocent; you had better come with me down to the magistrates; he said I can't do that, for I must drive my master out in about three quarters of an hour. I told him that Paxton should not be examined until he came; and the magistrates waited until five o'clock in the evening in order that he might come down, but he never came at all. In consequence of some information which I received, I went to Pope the next morning, and said, you did not come according to your promise yesterday; he told me it was not in his power, for he could not get time. I then asked him whether he had fetched anything from Mr. Hough's and said if you could not find time to come to the office, you could find time to go to Hough's to fetch the things away in the packing case; he denied that he went to Hough's immediately. I told him he had brought Paxton's things away, and the landlord knew him. I then searched the stables, but found nothing relating to this charge. I then went to his lodgings with him but found nothing there; I told him he had fetched something from Mr. Hough's; and he certainly must know what it was, for he packed it up himself. He then said, well I will tell the truth, and pointing to a box, that is the box I fetched away; I looked into it, it was empty. I said that can't be the box, it was a large packing case, and so full, that you could not put a hat in it, and you were obliged to carry it in your hand. He then began crying and his wife fainted away, and there was a great deal of distress; and he said he had fetched them away for Paxton, and when I and Paxton went together to his stables, Paxton made a signal to him to say he slept there. I asked him what he had done with the things, he said he brought them away from Hough's to save Paxton if he could, as he had a friendship for him, and had sent them to Camberwell by the Peckham stage directed to

I had my watch, key, and the beef at the time - the beef was taken up stairs, but not dressed. I had not been with any other woman that evening; the door was not bolted. When I awoke, about half-past three o'clock, she was gone. I found the watch, key, beef, and the coat at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Essex-street, Whitechapel. I know the prisoner, and know the house she lived at. On the 26th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw her coming out of Sugar loaf-court with something in her apron. I asked her what she had got? she said a blanket, but I saw it was a coat and a piece of beef, and stopped her - there was no watch found on her. When I had taken her to the watch-house we searched her room, but found nothing; the bed had not been laid upon. We afterwards went to a room in Sugar-loaf-court, where a companion of her's lodged, and found the prosecutor. We asked him if he had lost anything? he said he did not know. We asked him what clothes he had? he said a great coat and a body coat. As he was getting up he said he had lost his watch, went to the watch-house, and claimed the coat.</p>

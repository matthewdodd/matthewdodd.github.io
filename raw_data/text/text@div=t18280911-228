            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 15, Norfolk-street, Middlesex-hospital. The prisoner pawned some things with me, but they are not in the indictment.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110133"></xptr>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Monday, the 16th of August, I was in bed about ten o'clock at night, when my mistress came to my bed-room door, and desired me to get up - my master followed her, and insisted on my getting up, as he had missed a sovereign; they searched my pocket, and found nothing in it but an old purse - they then searched my work bag; in it was a pair of black silk stockings that I had washed and mended, but had omitted taking them up stairs; in my box was a waist ribbon I had purchased in the shop of my master after I had been there about a month, a black handkerchief I had bought in the country, a small ganze scarf I gave 1s. 3d. for in Charles-street, Soho-square, all of which they have sworn to as their property, as well as a collar I had given to me by a friend, and was in pledge, with some other things, for 10s.; my master and mistress both said if I would say where the sovereign was they would not send for an officer, but pay me my wages, and I should return to my friends; next morning, when they searched the shop, the sovereign was found on the floor; though they had found it, they sent next morning for an officer.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARRISON. I told her if she did not tell me where the sovereign was, I would send for an officer; she then came down into the shop, and took it up from a corner, as she pretended, but I think she had it in her mouth; she brought me down 10s., which she said she had picked up, but I do not think she had; I had frequently missed money out of the till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the lamp into the shop to have oil in it- I saw the sovereign lay in the shop; I touched it with my foot, but not with my hands - I thought it did not lay in my way, and I did not meddle with it; they called me up, and took my key - my mistress unlocked my box, and searched it; I told them I saw the sovereign in the shop - my mistress took it up, and put it into my master's hand.</p>

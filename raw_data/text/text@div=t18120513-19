             I am an officer of the Thames police. On the 13th of April Mrs. Warner applied to me, I could not hear any thing of the prisoner until the 18th, I then found the prisoner in a back room, Cock Hill, Ratcliffe. I found in the room a chair, and in the room three duplicates; I put the duplicates in my pocket. I asked her if she knew any thing of Mrs. Warner's things; she said, no. She said her name was not Griffiths. I then called Mrs. Warner in to identify her; I asked her if that was the woman that lodged with her; she said, yes, it was. I asked the prisoner whose duplicates them were; she acknowledged to pawning the things, and said she ment to get them out. I took her to the office, and desired the pawnbroker to attend with the things, and they are here now.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What time of day did the prisoner come to you on the 9th of April - A. About two in the afternoon. She hired the lodgings the day before, and then I saw the state of the bed. I put the two sheets on the bed myself the day before. That is my blanket, and the sheets are mine, and the chair is mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

            . I am an officer - on the 27th of January, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, Mr. Mason came to the Mansion-house, and stated, that he had been robbed of the cart and flour - I went with my brother to Artillery-lane, and saw a cart with two men with it - I saw the name of Mason on the cart - one of the men had hold of the horse, and was turning him into Duke-street - when they saw us, they left - I followed one of them; he turned into Steward-street - I called "Stop thief," and he turned back again to Duke-street, and was taken - that was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had lost sight of him? A. Yes, there was another person with the cart - I only followed one - I did not notice his dress in the first instance; but I believe the prisoner is one of the men who was with the cart.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see him do any act? A. I believe one of them had his arm on the horse's head; I cannot say which.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Monkhouse, the prisoner's father. On the night of 4th Oct. I answered a ring at the bell; when I opened the gate, I found a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man gave me a message—I did not at that time see any other person—I shut the gate and went to the front of the hall door, where I met my master—I delivered the message to him, and he told me to go and ask his name—I went to the gate again and opened it—I said to the cad-man that my master wished to know the gentleman's name—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man hesitated for a moment, and all at once my master's second ton, the prisoner, rushed past me, and nearly knocked me down—he said, "I am a Monkhouse, and I will speak to him"—as soon as I had time to turn myself round, I saw him at the moment in front of my master, close to him-my master was still standing in front of the hall, on the threshold of the door—I saw the prisoner put his hand quickly somewhere about his breast, in front, and take something from it; I thought it was a pistol—his back was towards me—I merely saw the movement of his arm—I then saw him fire at my master; I saw the flash and heard the report—I heard a second one, and my master was just falling while the second one was going off—he was as close to him as he could possibly be—he turned round and passed me, and said, "There!"—I was so struck I could not move or do anything—I only saw him when he passed me—I never turned to look after him—I was so</p>

               <p>wound generally is; faint and trembling—I expected he would die in a few minutes—he was standing in an upright posture, supported by Mrs. Monkhouse and the servant, who was holding a bason to his mouth, out of which issued a great deal of blood—I undid the collar of his shirt, and there found a gun-shot wound with a very large blackened surface—he was cough<lb></lb>ing and vomiting blood at the same time—the ball appeared to have entered at the front of the neck, passed through the handkerchief which I produce, and which has a horse-hair pad to it, which no doubt deadened the action of the ball in the first instance; it would probably have perforated the trachea, but the stiffening of the stock appeared to have turned it on one side, and it went upwards—it appeared to have been fired at a considerable altitude, at an angle I should say of forty degrees at least, and after striking on the trachea, it went through the membraneous portion of the aesophagus into the cavity of the throat, at the back of the mouth; it must have struck against the basis of the skull or the cervical vertebrae, because it went in at an elevation, but came out downwards—it bad met with some considerable obstruction—it went in directly in front of the neck and upwards—what obstruction it met with I do not know, but it came out on the collar-bone—it must have passed between the carotid internal and external, because it did not cut either, or else he would have bled to death—it met with some resistance, which in my judgment altered its course—there was a distance of five inches between the two openings—it was a dangerous wound, I did not expect he would have lived the night out—I got his clothes off, and found the bullet, which I produce, at the posterior open<lb></lb>ing—from the blackening round the neck, I conclude it had been burnt by the explosion of a pistol or gun—I should say the weapon could not have been more than two feet from him, at the time it was fired—I am not the regular medical attendant of the family.</p>

I took charge of Mr. Monkhouse, in conjunction with my partner, Mr. Bowling, after Mr. Perfect—I saw him about eleven o'clock, and found him wounded in the manner Mr. Perfect has described—in my judgment it was a dangerous wound—I continued to attend him for about a month—he is now quite recovered, except that his voice is more hoarse than it was before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's younger brother, and live at 83, East Smithfield. I cannot say whether I saw him on 3d Oct.—I saw him on the 4th, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I went with him to a fishmonger's, and he had some oysters, and bread and butter—we stayed there I should say half an hour, during that time he was most curious in his manners—he attended to every customer that came—he made observa<lb></lb>tions at the people that were passing, and stopped at the shop—we went from thence to many public-houses—he had brandy to drink the whole time—I should say he had at least twelve or fourteen glasses—he bad no water to it—I tried to restrain him, that was why I went with him from house to house—he appeared quite intoxicated—he went up to a man who was eating something in the street, and offered to give him something to drink—this continued until about five or half-past—I recommended him to take some tea to counteract the effects of the liquor, and we went into a coffee-house for that purpose—while it was getting ready he put his hand to his head, and complained severely of feeling a great swimming, and he fell imme<lb></lb>diately</p>

               <p>on the table, with his hands and head together—he seemed to be quite in a state of stupor—when the tea came I awoke him, and the blood rushed to his face, and his face was a deep crimson, so much so that I felt quite terrified, and asked what was the matter with him—after that we went out of the house, he staggered—I asked him to come and have part of my bed-as we went along we came to the Three Tuns public-house—he said he was going to sleep there, and so got rid of me; it was about half-past five when I left him—at that time he was quite intoxicated, extremely so.</p>

On the night in question I was in the tap-room of the Coach and Horses, at Turnham-green, between half-past nine and ten o'clock—the prisoner came in—there was a little fire in the room—he turned himself round to the fire-place as I was going out of the room, and when I came in again he presented a pistol at roe, and asked if I was afraid of it—I told him I was not—he turned it over a few times in his hand, looked at it, and put it back again into his pocket—I cannot tell whether there was a cap on it at that time—a short time after he pulled out that, or another pistol, and pulled the cock back, and I then perceived a percussion cap on the nipple—he turned it about—I told him it was not a fit place for such weapons, and he turned the hammer down on the nipple again, turned it about, and looked at it, and put it into his pocket—I should think he must have been drunk, by the ways of him, or something of the kind—he seemed very queer, and looked very wild about the eyes at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday the 11th of February, had any accident happened to any of the panes of glass at your shop window. - A. Before the 11th of February, an accident happened to a pane of glass, there was a hole in it about the size of the palm of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover at any time on Tuesday, the 11th of February, that that pane of glass had been broken to a greater extent. - A. I missed the property between six and seven o'clock last Tuesday week, my husband was out.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you had missed it had you seen the property. - A. I cannot tell, I missed twelve swansdown waistcoats, of different patterns, they were placed in the window, near the pane of glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. When you so missed them, did you examine the pane of glass, and find that it had been still broken more than it was before. - A. Yes, there was a hat before it, which had been moved and some of the waistcoats had been taken from the hole, and the hole was as big again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the hole was large enough for an hand to be put in, and the waistcoats to be taken out. - A. Yes, the next morning I went to Monmouth-street, and took an old marcella waistcoat with me to the different shops, and among the different shops I went to Galloway's, when I went into his shop, I asked him if he had any swansdown waistcoats, he said, yes ma'am; I told him I wanted one, and I had the size with me, I produced the marcella waistcoat of the size, he took two or three waistcoats from a shelf, and one from the outside of his door, and shewed me, we measured them; I looked up to the shelf, and I thought they were the whole of the property that I lost; I said to him, I cannot agree with you about one, I will go home and send my husband; I went home directly and sent my husband. Mr. Galloway<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190048"></xptr>gave me a card of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw them hanging outside of the door. - A. No, he went out and brought one from the outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him go into the street, therefore, it must be hanging outside there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And any body going by, must see them hanging out, exposed to public sale; were you present when these were purchased by your husband. - A. No, he gave four shillings a-piece for them, he bought them at a sale at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. The other waistcoats that you saw on the shelf, he pulled them down very readily, they were exposed openly in the shop. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pound reward. - A. I am satisfied with that, God forbid I should do it for that.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, what is said by one prisoner against another is not evidence; in the first place, it is not upon oath, no man can be convicted by the law of his country but upon taking a solemn oath, that what he says shall be the truth, therefore, what one prisoner says of another, even at your bar, cannot be evidence, because, it is not under the sanction of an oath; here is a confession, that goes no further than he was one of the parties that stole the property, I am not fond of confessions obtained by officers, because it is not a thing which is easy contradicted, it is generally made by a prisoner in private, and we have no way of ascertaining the truth of what a man unfortunately says; therefore, I keep a tight hand on all confessions, I would much rather a guilty man escape justice, than an innocent man be punished.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Benjamin) Produce the waistcoats. - A. These are the waistcoats (producing them). They are my property.</p>
               <p>Lucase's Defence. When I was in Castle-street, I met these young men, he said he was going of a message for his mother, he asked us to go with him, we did, and as we were coming back we picked up this bundle, we immediately looked at it, and found they were waistcoats, we went immediately to Monmouth-street, and asked Mr. Galloway if he would buy them, he said, yes, he would give three shillings and sixpence a-piece for them, that is all that passed; he paid us and we went away; the next morning

             asked us if we would go with him to Mr Galloway's, to have his button sewed on his breeches, we went with him, Mr. Galloway told the man to sew on all his buttons; Mr. Galloway went out and brought in three constables.</p>
               <p>Haycock's Defence. As Lucase and I were coming along Castle-street we met Osborne, he said he was going of a message, he asked us if we would go with him, we said, yes; coming back we found this bunble, we saw they were waistcoats, we took them to Galloway's, we asked him if he would buy them, he said, yes, or any thing that we brought.</p>
               <p>Osborne said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Galloway left his defence to his counsel, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             (Police-constable E 123.) I went with the inspector, and took these boots from Smith's legs - I was in Gray's Inn on the 2nd of July, and saw Hollman against the door opposite No. 14, which are the prosecutors' chambers; I had seen him in the square three or four times before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to fix on the 2nd of July? A. Because it is the day the robbery was committed - I saw him there about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and I heard of the robbery about twenty minutes before nine; I am quite sure I saw him that evening, but I did not know that I had seen him till I took him up - I had seen him lurking about on the 19th; I recollect the date by the Hue and Cry, in which all robberies are inserted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him on the 2nd? A. Yes, and on the 19th he was lurking about the square; I saw the Hue and Cry after we had taken him, about the 23rd or 24th; I know the date by the Hue and Cry; I was called up into the chambers on the night of the robbery, about half-past eight o'clock, and I had seen Hollman that night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are these chambers held from the society of Gray's Inn? A. No, we hold them of Adlington and Co. - I was not the last person in before the robbery.</p>

I think about Kentish-town; I do not know exactly - I have a wife and four children; my wife is not here, she is ill -I have two rooms in my house; I went to bed, and the prisoner and his father slept in the next room; I have two beds in one room, and one in the other; two children slept with me - my eldest, who is a girl, and the next, which is a boy, slept with the prisoner and his father, in a turn-up bedstead about six feet long, and four feet six wide - the prisoner and his father did not go home, because I wanted my cart mended the next day; I cannot write - Hollman's father wrote this receipt - they began to work at my cart that night about seven o'clock, as soon as they came, and worked as long as they could see, and finished it the next morning.</p>

I recollect going with him to Curtis' on the 2nd of July; I live at Camden town, but we did not start from there, but from the bottom of Oxford-street, about five o'clock, and got to Curtis' between six and seven o'clock; we went there to repair a cart, and returned the next day - we got to Oxford-road about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, were you an hour and a half walking to Kensington? A. No, we stopped and had something to drink; we started from No. 31, Crown-street -Hubic, my daughter, lived there, and I called there to say where I was going; I met my son there - he did not live with me; we stopped at a public-house when we got to Tyburn-gate; it was on the right-hand side - I do not know the sign; we then went on to Notting-dale,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060120"></xptr>and got there about half-past six o'clock - I expected to finish the job by the time it was dark; we stopped there that night - there was plenty of room; I did not undress, nor my son either - the children slept at the bottom of the bed, with their feet to ours; we did not go to bed till eleven o'clock, or a little after, and got up at three - we had bread and cheese, and beer; the cart wanted a new tail-board, a new bottom and sides - the shafts were very good; the cart was about three feet six inches wide', and four feet in length - the timber was there, and we took our tools; we finished about ten o'clock the next day - I do not know where my son lodged at that time; it was on a Monday we went.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Bath-court, Cold Bath-square. I have known Smith from a child; I had occasion to go to Mile-end, to get some stuff, about the 10th of July, and as I came back I met Smith in Whitechapel - I had not seen him before for two or three months; he asked me if I could tell him where to get a pair of boots - I told him in Petticoat-lane; I went there with him, and saw him purchase a pair of one of those Jews who sell them; I then left him, and went up to Hampstead, where I work; I cannot tell whether these are the boots or not.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You have heard the evidence - now are you sure it was on the 2nd of July, that you saw Hollman in Gray's Inn-square? A. I am quite sure it was the night the robbery was committed; I had seen him three or four times before, but not again till the 19th.</p>

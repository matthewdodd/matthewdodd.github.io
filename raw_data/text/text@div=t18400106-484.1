On Monday, the 30th of December, I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, leaving nobody in the house—my husband left before—I shut the outer door, locked it, and left the key in the door outside—there is an inner door, which I left shut, but that has no fastening—I returned a little before eight o'clock, found the outer and inner doors open, and missed the property stated, which is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, besides the money—I have since seen a piece of cotton print, which is part of what was taken.</p>

            . I lost a silver watch on the 25th of February, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon: I used to hang it over the chimney piece in the kitchen; I saw it hang there at three o'clock, there was nobody in the kitchen, but the prisoner; we keep a chandler's shop, and the prisoner deals with us, he is a seafaring man; he was brought to me the same day by Simons; Simons asked me if I had lost any thing; I told him I had lost a watch about an hour before; he asked if I should know it, I said yes, if I saw it; he pulled it out of his pocket, and I said directly that is my watch.</p>

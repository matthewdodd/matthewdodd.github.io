On the 25th of June I fell in with the woman prisoner in St. Giles's. I went with her to her lodgings. During the time I was with her I sent for something to drink; I got intoxicated. I laid down upon the bed, and when she found I was asleep she robbed me of my watch, and four pound nineteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the woman - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the man there - A. Yes, he was in the room and drank with us. When I awoke from my sleep I missed my watch and money, the man was gone, I asked the woman where was my watch and money. She told me that she had given it to this man, and when the man came in I asked him for the watch; he said he knew nothing about it. I asked him for the money; he held the purse up, he said, touch it if you dare. I went to

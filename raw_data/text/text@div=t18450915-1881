                  </hi>. I am the manager of some flour mills, belonging to Messrs. Pavets at Execution Dock. I live on the premises. The part of the premises where I reside communicates with the room where this money was kept—on the 2nd of Sept. I locked up in the desk the cash which I bad received on that and the previous day—the balance was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it consisted of gold, silver, and copper—I should say there was from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half—sovereigns, about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of copper, and the rest was in silver coin—there were two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of coppers tied up, the rest was loose—one parcel was all penny pieces, and tied in brown paper—the other was pence and halfpence mixed, and tied in a periodical paper or an old newspaper—I locked it up safe at six o'clock at night on the 2nd of Sept.—it was on the second floor of the mill—the front of these premises is next the street, and they are continued to the waterside—at the water side there is access to the premises over a folding door, through which they get the coals in—anybody could get over the folding—doors from the water—on the following morning I went into that room in consequence of what was said to me, from three to four minutes after six o'clock—I found the desk open—I perceived it had been forcibly opened, and I found an iron crowbar on the sacks—all the money I have statea was gone—some bad money was left—I sent for the policeman immediately—I noticed the window was partly open—it had not been fastened on the previous night—it is usually opened for air—I looked out of the window immediately, and there was a ladder against the wall which had not been there before—it was a ladder usually brought and used by the coal porters to get coals in—it does not belong to as—anybody getting over the folding doors could get to where the ladder was immediately—they could then mount the ladder and get into the room—I know the prisoner perfectly well—he had been engaged in coal work at the mill—I have paid him money, and he has been present at the desk, so as to know where the money was taken from—I live in the house—it is my dwelling-house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector.</hi>) I was seat for to the mill, on the morning of the 3rd of Sept., by Mr. Prest—I found the desk had been broken open by a crow-bar, which was on one of the sacks—I found marks on the desk, which satisfied me it had been broken open with that bar—the window was open, and the ladder stood as Mr. Prest has described—I went to the Tunnel-pier that morning—I went there again in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner in the waiting-room at the Pier, before you come to the wicket—I knew him by sight for many years, and had been in the habit of seeing him at that pier—I did not say any<lb></lb>thing to him in the first instance; but he said to me, "What do you think, master, I am suspected of this robbery last night"—I said, "What rob<lb></lb>bery?"—he said, "At the mill"—I said, "Who suspects you?—he said, "I do not know; I have been told I am suspected—I said, "Well, if you are suspected, perhaps you could tell me where you were last night"—he said, "Yes, I will tell you everywhere I went; in the afternoon I was drinking at the Old Rose, along with a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Nathan, who sells fish; we went from there over to Taverner's, and from there we walked together down to No. 11, Devonshire-street, Commercial-road, where I stopped till past two o'clock in the morning, or about two—he said, "You can search me—he pulled off his jacket, and unbuttoned his clothes—he took a silver sixpence and a halfpenny out of his pocket, and threw it down, and said, "There is every copper I have got in the world "I then left him—he has a girl living at No. 11, Devonshire-street—I saw him again on the Tuesday week following—he was coming on shore in a boat at the water-side—I walked down to the place and met him—he said, "I have been hard at work; how do you get on with that job? I hope I you will find it out; I will never believe but some one in the mill has I done it"—I had then made inquiries of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, and I said to the pri<lb></lb>oner, "When you told me where you went the other night, you did not I say anything about your riding in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "that was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I hired for a drunken sailor, and when I went to look for him he was gone, and I could not find him—I took him into custody on the Thursday evening following, which was yesterday week—I told him he was charged on suspicion of entering the mill, and stealing 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of a desk—he said, "I have got nothing to say about it"—there were two exami<lb></lb>ned—nations before the Magistrate—I remember the witness Frazer being exa<lb></lb>mined—after I had heard him examined, I went to the Pier where I had met</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Devonshire-street, Commercial-road; my husband is at sea; his name is Edward M'Callow. On the night of the 2nd of Sept. I saw the prisoner at my house—there was a young woman there whom he has known a length of time—she has been confined at my house—there was Mrs. Elliott, who has the front room, an old woman that does for me and my little girl, who is fourteen years of age—I know Frazer—he was in my house that night—I was in the room with him and the other parties—they had some beer to drink—Mr. Evans was told of that—I saw Frazer go away—I think that must have been half-past ten o'clock, or a quarter to eleven—I brought a policeman in when the quarrel took place—Moss and the young woman quarrelled, and broke a chair of mine, and there was a brass candlestick thrown—I did not see anything that the prisoner had—I said I would not have the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in my house—they fought terribly—Frazer left the room and said, "Come along with me, old <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, come along out with me, for you are an old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine; don't quarrel any more with her."</p>

               <p>I have my room broken up like this"—I did not see any money in the pri<lb></lb>soner's possession—the fight was while Frazer was there—the quarrel was about this young woman and some person that the prisoner was jealous of—I she had come home from the Old Rose, and her gown was all blood—she said he had given her a blow—after Frazer left they fought till half-past two in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

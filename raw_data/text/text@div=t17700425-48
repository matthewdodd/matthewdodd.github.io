In the year 1768, the prisoner came to me at Paris; he could not speak a word of French; I pitied him very much. He told me, the reason of his leaving England was, his friends were for forcing him to marry against his inclination, and that he had no money. He said, his name was Howard, pretending himself to be a relation to the Duke of Norfolk. I returned to England in the year 1769, about October; and brought the prisoner over with me. He lodged at an inn, and used to come every day to see me. I keep a warehouse. I lost a box of joining lace, more than 100 yards, and fifteen or sixteen pair of gentlemens Mecklin ruffles, in the year 1769. After I found the prisoner was not the man he pretended himself to be, which I found about the 6th or seventh of last February,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250040"></xptr> I desired him not to come to my house. After that, may be he would come once a fortnight. He brought these Mecklin ruffles to me the 10th of February; (the very moment I saw them, I knew them to be mine.) He offered to sell them to me. I did not claim them then, thinking he might bring more of my goods that I missed. I think, the Wednesday following he brought some joining lace, which I knew to be mine. I said, Sir, I think you may make me a present of this piece of lace. He said, he would give me two yards of it; I said, I wanted it all. I said, This is mine; I shall keep it. He said, he did not understand that; he should send his sister for the money. I found at the bottom of the lace my own paper, with my marking, in figures, and my name on it. Then I said, Now, sir, I will stop it, and I will swear it to me mine. I desired him to tell me where he bought it. He said, he bought it at Lisle, of one Carpentear. I said, I should write to that person. Then he said, Carpentear sold it to one Clark. He went away, and came again about six, and told me, my husband was by when he bought the lace of Carpentear. He told me, it was very lucky Mr. Carpentear was in town; he had just met him; and said, if I would deliver the lace to him, he would bring Mr. Carpentear the next morning. I said, I should keep the lace till I saw him. Then I demanded the ruffles that he had shewed me. He said, they were at Mr. Child's, a banker, at Temple Bar; and he could not have them back again. I said, I would have them. Then he said to me, Send your son for them. I desired him to give my son a note to Mr. Child for them. He said, he did not know his hand-writing; but he bid my son give his compliments to Mr. Child, and ask for them. When my son was gone; the prisoner went away; I sent my maid to follow him, but she lost him. (The lace produced in court, sealed with Justice Spencer's seal, and the prosecutrix's.)

               <p>Cha. Compagnon. I am son to the prosecutrix. It was agreed upon betwixt my mother and the prisoner, that I should go to Mr. Child to ask for the ruffles. He desired me to go in his name, for the two pair of ruffles. I went: when I was near Mr. Child's house, he came and tap'd me on my shoulder, and said, We have no business to go there; let us go and drink a glass of wine. Then we went up the Strand; I think he said, Mr. Child was not at home. We went near the New Church; he there said, he would go and see if Mr. Clark was at home. He went, and soon returned, and said, he was not at home, Then we came to the Goose and Gridiron in St. Paul's church-yard: there we drank; I said, What excuse can I make for staying so long? Said he, You may say Mr. Child was not at home; and when I came home I did say so.</p>

            . I lived a little better than three months with Mrs. Compagnon. I have heard her complain of losing lace: at that time the prisoner used to come every day; he went by the name of Howard. The lace was kept in the dining-room, and he used to go there.</p>

               <p>I bought this lace in France; there were no marks on the ruffles. There may be ten thousand more ruffles of that pattern, besides what she had. If I would have given her the piece of lace, she would not have prosecuted me.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL GREEN. I live in Church-lane, Wellclose-square. On the 30th of October, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was going home; I had been drinking, but I had my senses; I met the prisoner, Sinclair, in White-chapel. I went to a house with her, which was in <placeName id="t18161204-108-crimeloc593">Rose and Crown-court</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18161204-108-crimeloc593" type="placeName" value="Rose and Crown-court"></interp>

I had my watch in the room with me;it is worth 2l.15s. I had the other things mentioned in the indictment, in my pocket; my watch was in my fob, in my small-clothes, which I put under the pillow. I went to sleep, and was awoke by the noise of a person coming into the room. I heard him walk up to the bed, and draw my small-clothes from under the pillow. I heard the voice of a man say, if he stirs, I will do for him. I was alarmed. The prisoner, Sinclair, was awake; she turned round. I waited until I heard persons about in the streets; I then asked her, for a light; she got up, and said, she had no matches; and then she said, she could not strike a light. She said, somebody must have been in the room. In about half an hour she got me a light. My watch and the other things were gone. I gave her in charge of the officer. The prisoner, Blues, was taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIAN MATHEWS. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner, Blues, pledged this watch with me, on the 30th of October, for 25s., in his own name. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL WILSON. I am a constable. The prosecutor gave the prisoner, Sinclair, into my custody. The door appeared to be broken open.</p>

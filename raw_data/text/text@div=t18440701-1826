                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. James Glass, who keeps the Gun public-house in High-street, Wapping. On Friday, 21st June, the pri<lb></lb>soner came there, and asked for half-a-pint of beer, which came to a penny—I served him—he gave me a shilling—I looked at it and saw it was bad—in consequence of what Jervis had said to me, I rang the bell—on doing so, the prisoner caught hold of my arm, and said, "Here is another one," and was going to give me a good one—I had not said the other was bad—when Jervis came, I gave him the shilling, and told him it was a bad one—a scuffle then took place between Jervis and the prisoner, and he got away from Jervis—I saw him go to the tap-room fire, and throw something in—I stood close to the fire-place, and saw a shilling in the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at this public-house. On the afternoon in question, I saw the prisoner sitting on a form outside the house—I knew him and watched him—he was changing something from one hand to the other, and wrapping it up in paper—I could not see what it was—I made a communication to Douglas, and went up stairs—I afterwards heard the bell ring, and went down—she gave me a bad shilling, and said, "This man has given me another bad shilling "—I said to the prisoner, "Have you any more?"—he said, "No"—I said, "What is that you have got clenched up in your fist?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have got some more bad money there"—he said, "No, I have not"—I opened his hand, and tore some paper, and saw two, three, or four shillings in it—I am sure I saw two—I caught hold of him—we had a struggle—he ran into the tap-room, and threw the paper into the fire, from the hand I had tried to open—I had the other bad shilling in my hand—after the paper was burnt, I saw two shillings in the fire—I went to take the poker up, to poke them out, and before I could do so, they had melted and fallen through on to the cinders under the grate—I kept him in custody for about a quarter of an hour, till a constable came—he asked me several times to let him go, and repeatedly offered me a good shilling—I gave the bad shilling to the constable, and showed him the metal that had run through the fire—he picked it up.</p>

I did; she came to me that morning, I believe, about nine o'clock; when I went to his shop Bastin was not at home, I searched his shop, and I found five heads of Dutch flax behind the counter, placed in a corner; Bastin came into the shop; as soon as I had found the flax I said to him, Mr. Bastin I am looking for some property that does not belong to you, and here is something here that does not belong to you; he replied I have been to the barber's shop to be shaved, and since I have been gone somebody has thrown this into the shop, I know nothing about it, if it is your property take it away; no, says I, I cannot take it away, I will tell my son of it; I went and told my son of it, leaving the flax with Bastin in his shop: my son and his partner went.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that these heads of flax were placed in a corner behind the counter, could they have been in that situation from any person throwing them. - A. No, they must have been placed there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there was time enough for the flax to be removed and taken away - A. I suppose there might.</p>
               <p>Q. How long distance do you live from where Bastin lives. - A. About one hundred and thirty yards.</p>

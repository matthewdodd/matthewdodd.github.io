               <p>MR. BEALE. Q. I believe you are cashier in the house of Meux, Reid, and Company - A. I am. They are brewers in Liquorpond-street. The prisoner was a clerk in their employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of his duty to receive money on their account - A. It was. He was the principal clerk in that department; to receive money he was.</p>
               <p>Q. When he received the money in what mode was he to make the entry - A. In the money journal.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that money journal, 14th of February, in the present year. Is there any entry of the receipt of fifty-five pounds four shillings and sixpence, of Captain Smith - A. No, none on that day, nor on any one day there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book in which he should have made the entry - A. Certainly. If the entry had been there it was his duty to pay the money to me, and I should have put my initials in that money journal, and then the entry would be transferred to the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received that sum of money of the prisoner - A. No, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this was the prisoner sent for from Portsmouth - A. He was, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion was he charged with having received sums that he had not accounted for - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, upon being so charged, tick a list of sums of money he had so received - A. This is the list he gave to me, a list that he had by him, of his own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that list include the sum in question - A. It does include the sum of one hundred and seventeen pounds seven shillings and sixpence, of Captain Smith. The sum in question in this and other indictments.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the partners in your firm - A. I do. There are nineteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not you communicate to him, that if he would let you know the sums that he had received he might pay it when he could - A. Certainly not.</p>

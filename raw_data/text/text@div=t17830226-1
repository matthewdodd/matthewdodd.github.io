             called me, I went as fast as I could, the prisoner had got away from him, and ran to the Fighting Cocks, in Tottenham Court Road, and the sack was dropped just by a pawnbroker's door, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260004"></xptr> corner of Chapel-street; Croker called to me to take care of the sack, for he had the man safe enough.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that Croker brought across the road? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing else with him? - The things were all in the sack, I asked the prisoner what he had in the sack, he said nothing but apples, I laid my hand on the sack, and I found it soft, I said there is something else; I laid hold on the sack, and the first thing I took was the frock, the prisoner snatched it from me, and said it is only a pair of breeches of mine; I took him and the sack to the watch-house, and then we pulled all the cloaths out; there was a wad of straw over the apples, he said the apples came from Chatham to him, and that they were left at the Blue Posts, in Charlotte-street, my walk was within 100 yards of the prosecutor's house, and I heard a man calling out watch; he said his house was broke open, and that he had lost such and such things; I told him not to frighten himself, I believed we had his property, and the man and his wife, and son went to the round-house with me.</p>
               <p>Were the things that were shewn to him at the round-house, the same which are now produced? - Yes, the prisoner fell on his knees, and begged we would let him go, and he would give us 4 s. then, and send us 5 s. the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me with the sack the next morning? - No, only Croker told me he saw him with the sack.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it very dark? - Yes, about ten minutes past twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you from the time that Croker called out to the time that he brought the prisoner back to you where the sack was, see the prisoner at all yourself? - No, I did not know what he called me for.</p>
               <p>When you ran it was after Croker, you did not see any body else? - No, only a woman that was upon her trial here the last sessions for this matter, she was the first person that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was the woman standing by the sack when you first came up? - She was the first person that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish your Lordship would look into his character for every word that he has said, is very wrong.</p>

I did not think I was able to contend with them both, and I let the man go, and he ran away, I followed him one hundred yards, and I threatened to shoot him, and overtook him, he was never out of my sight; in the mean time the watchman came up, I desired him to take care of the sack, I took the prisoner and brought him back to the sack, and we opened it, and there was these things, he said they belonged to him, but his father and mother had had some few words, and he was going to another lodging, and he had brought these things away from them; I gave charge of him to the watchman, and we took him to the watch-house; he made a proffer of the apples, and to treat, and some money to let him go; I told him if he could prove the property his own before a magistrate, he might have them again the next morning, but I found they were the property of the prosecutor.</p>

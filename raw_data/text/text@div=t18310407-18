On the 15th of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070027"></xptr>rang at the bell - I went to the door, and he asked me if Mr. Taylor was up; I told him No, and asked what he wanted - he said Mr. Carter wished to see Mr. Taylor as soon as he got up: he was to wait for an answer - I went and told Mr. Taylor, leaving the prisoner in the passage; Mr. Taylor said he did not know such a person - I came down, and asked him where Mr. Carter lived; I forget where he said - I went and told Mr. Taylor where he said Mr. Carter lived; I came down, and found the prisoner still in the passage, and asked him to walk into the office, and wait till Mr. Taylor came down; he did so - I went down, leaving him there: I heard Mr. Taylor come down in about a minute, it was a very short time - Mr. Taylor called me; I came up, found the street door open, and these things gone - I was down on the basement; Mr. Taylor said some things were gone - I went up to the office, and missed a great coat and a time-piece off the shelf - I had seen them safe when I showed him into the office; I saw the prisoner in custody at Marlborough-street on the 3rd of March, and am quite sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The man who called was a stranger to you? A. Yes, I never saw him before; I left him on the mat the first time, four or five yards from the office door - Mr. Taylor sleeps on the second floor; the coat was on a rail in the back office, which he was shown into - when I saw him at Marlborough-street he was brought out of the lock-up room to me alone, and I was asked if he was the man; I never said I only believed him to be the man - I am quite sure of him.</p>

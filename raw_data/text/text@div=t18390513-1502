                  </hi>. On Sunday night, the 28th of April, I was coming from Bristol to London—I was at Colnbrook, in Bucks—I saw a cart with 2 dead horses—the prisoner drove it—I rode a few miles in his cart—I felt his hand about me two or three times, and told him not to take any liberties with me—I afterwards got out of the cart, when I got to the night-house, not liking his company—I went into the public-house, and he went in too—we had a drop of beer, which he changed a sovereign to pay for—before that lie had said, "I have no money; will you give me money to pay the 'pike?'"—I did not get into his cart afterwards—I went along the road, and got a cup of coffee of a woman at a stall—I then missed my money, and could not pay for it—I went back to find the prisoner—I had not been into any house after leaving him—I told Patrick Welch, who was with me, of it—when 1 got back to the night-house, the prisoner was gone—this ring was on my purse at the time—(looking at one)—but this purse is not mine—I lost 5 sovereigns in my pocket and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was a red purse with 2 rings—the prisoner sat on my left side in the cart, and three times I told him to leave his hands off me, and not take liberties—I left him about half-past twelve—I had rode in the cart about eight miles, I think—he paid for the beer, because he did not want me to feel for my money.</p>

               <p>Q. The calf was slaughtered I suppose? - A. Yes, it was chopped down in two sides, it was weighed, I paid for it, and Mr. Hunt's man put a ticket on it with my name. I then employed a porter to deliver it into my mother's cart, which was standing very near <placeName id="t18060115-19-crimeloc107">the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see it again? - A. Yes, I saw it again, at about seven o'clock in the evening at Lambeth-street office, Whitechapel; I knew it very well, the ticket was on it, and I took another breast of the same veal, and they matched.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a police officer? - A. Yes, on the 4th of January, in company with Griffiths, I went to the prisoner's lodgings in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and there I saw a side of veal.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. He was in the passage of the house close to the room; the prisoner told me it was his room; I asked him who the veal belonged to, he said it belonged to him; I asked him if anybody slept in the room along with him, he said nobody but himself; I asked him who brought the veal there, he said he did not know, he did not bring it there, it was his property. I employed a man to take it to the office, Mr. Hunt saw it there, and said it was the veal he had sold to Mr. Greenfield. At seven o'clock in the evening Mr. Greenfield saw it at the office, he examined it with another breast of veal, it appeared to be the same kind of veal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my Lord, I know nothing about the veal; I live at Mrs. Julian's, two doors of this side there; Mr. Nowland knows that I do not rent them rooms, he knew very well that Merrick rents them two rooms.</p>

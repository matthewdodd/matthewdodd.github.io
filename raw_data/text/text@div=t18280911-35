               <p>WEST MAWER. I live in the country. I was in town on the 5th of August, and lost a pocket handkerchief, but did not see who took it; two persons came up and asked me if had I not lost one - I felt, and missed it; I had used it about five minutes before.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I saw the prisoner go up and take a handkerchief out of Mr. Mawer's pocket; I was not above half a yard off - another person was with him: it was in <placeName id="t18280911-35-crimeloc173">Smithfield</placeName>

            . I was with Murray; I did not see the handkerchief taken - I was near Mr. Mawer, but not close enough to see what he did; other persons were behind - Murray was within half a yard of Mawer, and the prisoner was close to him; Murray spoke to Mawer, and asked him if he had lost a handkerchief; he then ran and caught the prisoner - it was all done in a moment, for he ran and turned Elliott round, and I saw him throw the handkerchief over the pens; I picked it up in four or five minutes - I saw it in his hand before he threw it.</p>

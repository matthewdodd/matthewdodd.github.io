               <p>Q. How long has he served you? - A. He has got fourteen months to serve, he was a turn-over to me, he had been with me about eleven months; about five o'clock in the afternoon he asked me to let him go down stairs to fetch a pair of bellows up to blow the fire in the shop; I told him, no, he should not go down stairs; in the course of a quarter of an hour after that I missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not let him go down stairs? - A. I did not like him to go down into the kitchen by himself; I looked in the shop, and found his two hats, he had gone out without a hat; I went down stairs, I did not miss any thing; I did not miss the box till my wife came home; he took two razors with him that were not in the box; his indentures were in the box; they were taken out of his breeches pocket when he was taken prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since? - A. Two gowns; the pawnbroker has got them; I found one razor out of the two.</p>

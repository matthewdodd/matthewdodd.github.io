I called for the said parcel, by the desire of the man who gave it to me, three times, and was refused it by the woman who keeps the coffee-house. I persevered, according to my employer's orders, and ultimately was taken into custody by a police constable. If I had come by the said property by my own act of burglary, I should have taken it to my parents' residence in Cow-cross-street, within three hun<lb></lb>dred yards of the said coffee-shop; but I obeyed the mandates of the man who employed me, also would I not have brought it to my poor parents, on Saturday morning, the time of the robbery? My Lord, I was deprived of the clothes I had on then, and furnished with my present garb. My parents had purchased my said clothes from a master tailor on Clerken<lb></lb>well-green, in September last, and the police constable satisfied his inquiry on that point."</p>

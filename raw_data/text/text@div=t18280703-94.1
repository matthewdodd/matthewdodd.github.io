               <p>THOMAS ATTO.

            . I was on duty; I heard Waddington's voice, turned round, and saw he had hold of West - he told me to take up this handkerchief, which I did.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WEST'S Defence (written.) I followed the engines to see the fire, and what the officer swears arises from a mistake; between me and the prosecutor there was another person, who disappeared on the officer touching me; I am quite a stranger to my fellow prisoner.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I was going from Hackney; I saw the people, and heard there was a fire; I went there, and had not been ten minutes when I was taken.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WADDINGTON re-examined. Q. How long had you seen them together? A. For near three quarters of an hour, or an hour, trying different pockets - that induced me to watch them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a grocer's shop in Mary-street; Stepney. On the 15th of November, about half-past five o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner entered my shop under the pretence of purchasing a halfpenny-worth of string—I showed him several sorts, and no kind seemed to suit—while I turned my back to get some, he put his hand in my weight box, and took out the brass pound weight—he went out, and joined two other boys—I followed him to several other shops—a shopkeeper detained him—I stepped over and took him—I do not know what became of the weight—the other two boys had gone off—while the prisoner was in my shop, the other two, who were outside, kept saying, "Thicker, thinner," and so on, and the prisoner said, "D—n the string altogether, it won't do."</p>

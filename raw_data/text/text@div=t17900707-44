               <p>I lost the things in the indictment, from a drawer, on the 29th of June; I saw them in the morning, and at night I discovered they were gone; I desired my landlord to stop any person with a bundle. The prisoner is my own son; he has robbed me several times; I am very sorry to appear against him: I cannot help it; he has always been robbing of me; I cannot say that the drawer was locked.</p>

               <p>Did your son work with you? - Yes, I told him he was old enough; he could get his bread himself; I work very hard, and he always laid upon me; I have another child eight years old, at nurse, that is a cripple; and I am forced to pay eight shillings a week for her.</p>
               <p>Did your son in fact work for you? - Not much; he went out when he liked.</p>
               <p>When he worked for you, did you allow him any thing for his work? - I gave him victuals and drink, and bought him clothes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070034"></xptr>and gave him six-pence to spend of a Sunday.</p>

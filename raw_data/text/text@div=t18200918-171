            . I am a labourer, at Staines. On Wednesday night the 21st of June, I was at the Phoenix, public-house, at Staines; I saw the prisoner there with two more - I knew him before. I left them there about twenty minutes past ten o'clock - it is about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's stable; he lived in the neighbourhood. Between two and three o'clock next morning, I saw him and two others within thirty yards of the stable - I only saw their backs; they were going in a direction from the stables. I did not then know of the robbery.</p>

            . I am a postboy at Leatherhead. On the 23d of August, I was at the Swan at Egham, and saw the prisoner on the road. On the 25th of August, I was at my father's at Staines; the prisoner came and asked if I knew who wanted to buy a saddle and two bridles; I said No, and asked him what they were worth; he said 15 s., I said I would buy them in the morning. I informed Mr. Finch, and went next morning to the prisoner, to buy them, he was abed; he said I was to wait at the Phoenix, public-house, until he came; I asked him where the things were? he said it would not do, I could not have them till night, and they were at a house at Knowl-green, where there was no suspicion. I found him at the Phoenix, public-house, at eight o'clock at night - I gave him a bag to put them in. We went to Knowl-green - he brought them out in the bag. I gave him 15 s., and went away. It was a saddle, two bridles, and a martingale.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband. On the night of 26th June, I was taken to the hospital—I remained there eleven weeks, and am there up to this time—on 26th June, I was living apart from my husband, and had been doing so about five weeks—before 26th June, I lived with him in Ferdinand-place—my husband has repeatedly come to my place for the purpose of getting me to live with him, and I refused—on 26th, he came be<lb></lb>tween 9 and 10 o'clock at night, came into my room, I was just sitting down—he took hold of me by my left-hand, and said, "Old lady, I have <hi rend="italic">drop<lb></lb>ped upon</hi> you at last"—I think he was sober—I did not see any sign of drink on him—I answered, "You have left me no home, and I shan't go with you; I will do for myself, and get my own living"—I had work then from a gentleman in the same street—I had just come in from work when this happened—an old lady keeps the room—my bed was in it—the prisoner sat himself on the bedside, and said, "Will you come home with me, or shall I stop with you?"—I then gave him the answer I have stated—he had on a jacket, and I saw him put his finger to the jacket-sleeve to some<lb></lb>thing which I thought he had in the sleeve—I said to him, "What have you got in your jacket-sleeve?"—he said, "Why, you foolish woman, do you think I have anything in my jacket-sleeve to take away your life, and send my soul to the devil?"—with that Mrs. Bryan knocked at the door—I said, "Come in"—I asked her to sit down—I was very glad to see her in the room—the prisoner then proposed some beer, and said he would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> It—he still had hold of my hand—I said, I should go for the beer—he said we should all go out and have it—we went out, and went to a pub<lb></lb>lic-house kept by Mr. Gurney—it was a goodish distance from my lodging, I believe in the high road—he called for a pot of beer between the three of us—he paid for it—after it was drunk he asked me to stand a pot of beer—I told him I had no beer-money to spend—we then all went out together, and went to another public-house in Kentish-town—he called for a pot of beer there—I made signs to the landlady not to serve him, and she did not—he was not tipsy at that time, but he was cross-like—I saw him drinking part of the pot of beer with me, that was all—we then went into the Black Horse in Kentish-town, and there he was served with a pot of beer—Mrs. Bryan was still with us—we did not sit down at all in that public-house—we were there about a quarter of an hour—the clock was then on the stroke of 12—we then came out together, and came down the Kentish-town-road as for as a turning towards my lodging—I said to Mrs. Bryan, "Do not go far away, stand where you are; I shall be back in a few minutes"—at the same time I shook hands with the prisoner, and said, "Good night! God bless you; and get to bed as well as you can, and I will meet you to-morrow</p>

Mr. Sullivan, you have killed your wife"—he said, "She is not dead yet, what does she want sitting down here?"—he came and laid hold of my arm—I still had my hands on my stomach, endeavouring to retain my bowels—he on one side and Mrs. Bryan on the other, brought me to Dr. Mushat's—I saw a policeman, and said to him, "I throw my life in your hands"—he came along with me, but I was getting very weak, and by the time I got as Mr. Mushat's I had not a bit of sight—when the prisoner was asking me to come home with him, and I refused, he said, "If you don't come home with me on this night it will be either death or glory," and swore—I said "If you do anything to me you will be surely punished for it; you will surely suffer for it, both in this world and in the next too."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of University College Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there about 10 o'clock on the night of 27th June—she was then in the casualty-ward, lying on a stretcher—I examined the lower part of the abdomen—I found, both on the outer and under gar<lb></lb>ments, a vertical cut about two-thirds of an inch long—they were wet with blood and the contents of the intestines—on removing the clothes I found a coil of intestine about eight inches across, comprehending, perhaps, about a yard of the small intestines, protruding from the lower part of the abdomen in'a red congested state—the most prominent part of this coil presented two wounds in the intestine itself; they were almost opposite to each other, trans<lb></lb>fixed somewhat obliquely—it is no doubt that the two wounds were made by a single stroke—the contents of the intestine, both fasces and flatus, were acaping at the time; there was also a wound in the mesentery—those wounds were of about the same length as the cut in the clothes—no doubt all was done by one instrument and one stroke—the entrails were cleansed with water about the temperature of blood, and I then attempted to return a part of them prior to sewing up the wound—I found it necessary to make the cioatrix wider in order to do so—I was enabled finally to restore them—the injury she had received was excessively dangerous—she is now perfectly recovered, as far as we could judge.</p>

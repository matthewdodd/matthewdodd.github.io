            . I am son-in-law to Samuel Castle. the officer brought in the prisoner and this bundle of ten pairs of stockings, which are his property; the gentleman came in with him, he said he had done his duty. and would have no more to do with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did the gentleman come into the shop till I was there for some time time? A. Yes, he came in with you, I am sure; I went into the parlour, and as I was coming out again the officer and the gentleman came in with you; he went away directly - my uncle had been in the shop before, and he came in again, and kept the people from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were two gentlemen who saw me pick up the stockings, and they came in and said"You have got some property which a person stole and ran away with;" I said "I have picked it up;" they said"Come into the shop, and clear yourself;" I turned back, and went into the shop, and in five minutes the officer and a gentleman came in, and asked what was the matter, as there was a mob round the door - these two gentlemen are kept out of the way.</p>

               <p>Bullock. She asked me a Shilling for them; I thought she had stolen them, and I refused to buy them. I had taken down a couple of new Candlesticks, and set them upon the Compter. I had several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050032"></xptr> People in the Shop at the same Time when she was there; I refused buying them, so she goes out, I had a Suspicion she had stolen them, then I asked her what she gave for them; I stopped them, and said she would bring her Husband, or somebody, and give Proof that she honestly came by them, and she should have them again: When she went out again, my Wife missed the Candlestick, and I turned about and missed it too. Mr Miller was in my Shop, and when she came in again, Mr Miller turned up her Cloak, and she had the Candlestick tucked up under her Apron.</p>

               <p>As I was going to Islington to work, I met a woman big with child, who said she'd give me two pence to carry her load to Kingsland-Road for her; it was as much as ever she could do to stand under it. I being willing to earn the two pence took and carried it for her, and these people came and hawl'd me about, drag'd me, and push'd me up against a wall; I never was so used before in my life.</p>

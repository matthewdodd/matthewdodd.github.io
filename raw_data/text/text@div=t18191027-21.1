Johannah Lawrence was our servant; she had been about five weeks with us - I was absent at Godstone, where I have a house; I returned home on the 16th of September. On the 18th, in consequence of what West, my clerk, told me, I made enquiry, and searched Wearing's box, who slept at my house. I asked him to let me see his box, and he opened it for me, in which I found a hair and a toothbrush, also a large key - the brushes had been used a little. My firm opinion is that they are mine, from a particular mark. He acknowledged they were mine, and said he intended to return them to the place, from where he took them.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Cowdry, and was with him when he found the brushes in Wearing's box; there is a stamped mark on the hair-brush, by which I know it to be his. He found the key, and took the brushes out of the drawer - I never saw Brown at the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The stamp on it denotes that it was made by the prosecutor - A. Yes. I could not say that it had not been sold, if he had not said that he took it.</p>
               <p>SARAH BONNER. I live at No. 35, Crown-street, Soho. Brown lodged at my house for six or seven weeks until he was apprehended; he kept bad hours, and said the reason was that he was employed at Vauxhall-gardens; he had a trunk. He asked me once for the key of my street-door, which I lent to him, but never got it again.</p>

             re-examined. On the 21st of September Mr. Cowdry brought Brown to Covent-garden watch-house. I found the box in his room, which I opened with a key, and found seven brushes, a drinking-horn, a shoe-horn, three combs, and a little box. One of the combs has been used.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You searched the house of Wearing's mother - A. Yes, but found nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the City-road, and am a watch and clock maker—I have one partner. On the 2nd of March I left a brown paper parcel wrapped up on my work board, which contained two pairs of silver watch cases—I was absent from my shop about an hour, and when I re<lb></lb>turned the parcel was missing—one pair of the watch cases are here now in fragments—here is enough for me to identify it—I have compared it with the movements which I have here with me—they correspond exactly—I have no doubt of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. On the 4th of April, the prisoner came to me with this watch-case broken up as it is now—I asked her how she became possessed of it—she said it belonged to a cousin of her's—I asked her how it came to be in this condition—the said her cousin destroyed it in a drunken fit—the case appearing new I asked how long he had had it—she said five years—I knew her and let her go—I asked her address—she said No. 7, Osborn-place—she was to come for it the next morning, but she did not.</p>

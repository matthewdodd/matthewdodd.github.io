            . I live in Lower Brook-street, with Miss Emma Wilbraham. On Saturday last, the 27th of November, her trunk was taken from behind her carriage. I was on the box - it had been strapped on, with a chain and belt. The carriage was coming into town from Cheshire - we had changed horses at Barnet - the trunk was safe before we got to Whetstone - we missed it when we got to Colson's hotel. The chain has not been found, but the straps are found, and they are cut - I did not see the prisoner at all. There are five gowns in it.</p>

            . I am a servant to Lady Guildford. I was sitting on the box of her carriage on Saturday night last, about half-past five o'clock, in <placeName id="t18241202-73-crimeloc395">Princes-street, Hanover-square</placeName>

I could not distinguish them at that time. I saw them take a trunk from behind the carriage when they were about five yards from me - they drew it over to Brunswick hotel, and one of them knocked or rang at the door - they then assisted each other in putting it on the prisoner's shoulder, who was one of the two persons who took it from the carriage. I jumped from my box, and followed them. I never lost sight of them - they went together into Hanover-square - I then stopped the prisoner with it on his shoulder - he threw it down, and pointed to his companion, who had ran away. I took him back to the Brunswick Hotel - he was not known there - and was taken into custody. I left the trunk at the hotel - it had a brass plate, with the name of Miss Wilbraham upon it - he said the man who ran away asked him to carry it - I said I should not let him go after him. I gave information to a relation of Miss Wilbraham's, in Stratton-street. The prisoner then said it was no interest to me, and I might as well let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, at Marlborough-street, that there was only one person at the carriage. - Witness. No; I said as I have now.</p>

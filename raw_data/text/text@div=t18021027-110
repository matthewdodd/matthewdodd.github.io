               <p>Q. Did any women come in? - A.

               <p>Q. Will you tell me who the lady was at whose house you slept the night before, and who you slept with? - A. I slept with no woman, I had the bed to myself; I was going round the corner of a street the night before and met two girls, whom I asked where I could get lodging; they took me to a house where I slept, but they did not sleep there; I paid sixpence for my bed, it was the day I came from the country.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 1st of April, having been out about ten minutes, I was informed, on my return, that two shop-lifrers had been at the shop; I ordered the shop to be shut up, and standing at my door, I was informed the two girls were gone into another haberdasher's just by, and I heard the prisoner Johnson say to the other, it will not do; so they went on a few doors farther, and they stopped suddenly, and Johnson said to the other, let us go back: after a pause of about a minute or two, they turned round; I let them pass me, and as they passed me, she said, I will buy, but God bless you, mind you are not seen; I concluded from that they were going into the haberdasher's shop, and I intended to watch them; but they passed it, and went into my shop, and the prisoner Johnson asked to look at a piece of cloth she saw when she was there before; she was shewn it, and made no difficulty about the price or quality, but upon the quantity; at last, she determined on buying a yard and a quarter of it; there were some printed cotton stockings lay upon the counter; I did not see either of them take any thing; Johnson paid, and they went out together, but I suspected Cole to have something, and I observed her to make a move with her arm, as if she wanted to throw something away, and she let fall a parcel of stockings, nine pair, with my mark upon the paper; I am sure of the property.</p>

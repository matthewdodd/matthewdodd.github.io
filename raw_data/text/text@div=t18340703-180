            . I keep the Cheshire Cheese, in Dean-street, Holborn. On the evening of the 26th of June, the prisoners came in about seven o'clock - I had not known them before - they and two other men brought seven pieces of timber to my yard - I said I would not have it there - I thought they had stolen it - they became very abusive - I went to get the policeman, as I was afraid of my life - they threatened to split my skull open - when I came back they were gone, and had taken three pieces of wood away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Have you told us all that passed? A. Yes - I had not ordered any wood of the prisoners - I did not say that would not do for me, if they would bring me some thinner, I would give them some more beer - they had three pots of beer.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM OLIVER. I am a <rs id="t18340703-180-viclabel1002" type="occupation">builder</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on it? A. No - I was with the man for two or three hours, and told him to put one piece in a particular place - that one I can swear to - it has a particular mortice at this end, and it has some slips nailed on it - it is a kind of door-post.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many pieces altogether did you lose? A. I suppose about fifty - one I can swear to - the other three I believe to be mine - they were taken from my pile at the back of those houses.</p>

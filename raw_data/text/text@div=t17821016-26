We followed them, and lost sight of them about half a minute or something more, they turned up Symonds-inn, and when I came to the turning into Symonds-inn, a woman informed me a lad was run up to some chambers, which were then under repairs, and I believe, uninhabited; I went up stairs with a stranger or two, and met the prisoner Hawkins, whom I charged with having picked my pocket, which he denied; I searched his pockets, but could not find my handkerchief, I brought him down stairs. I met Stapleton at the foot of the stairs, who had got the prisoner Larcher, and likewise the handkerchief which I had lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you, or not, say whether Hawkins whom you took on the stairs, was one of the men that you saw going up Chancery-lane? - I am positive he was one.</p>
               <p>Was Larcher the other? - I am sure he was, I am positive to both of them.</p>

The man went up Chancery-lane, the one that picked the pocket was first, the other ran after him, they turned into Symonds-inn, one ran up a stair-case, and he that took the handkerchief ran through the inn into Bowling-pin alley; I missed sight of him; and that moment he throw the handkerchief away, and the next witness took it up, and gave it to me; he saw him throw it away.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you lose him? - I lost him about a minute; he was taken by himself, he threw the handkerchief away, and the gentleman was at the other end of the alley, and he laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Did you know these lads before? - I have seen one many a time.</p>
               <p>Which was the person that actually picked the pocket? - Larcher, but they were both in company.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you do with the handkerchief? - I kept it in my possession for some time, then I gave it to the constable; but I swear to the handkerchief, particularly by a spot of ink on it, which I wiped off my writing desk, and the colours are very much run, I am positive it is mine.</p>

               <p>This man has been convicted here himself, and one Barnet can prove it who is here; as I was going up Chancery-lane, this young man asked me the way to Staples-inn, I told him I believed that was it. This gentleman followed me, and Stapleton laid hold of me, and said I had picked a gentleman's pocket; he searched me, I had no handkerchief but my own; he said he saw me do it: he took me to the gentleman, the gentleman said he did not know any thing of it; he said he would send me to the Compter, and send me for a soldier or a sailor. I have not a friend in the world.</p>

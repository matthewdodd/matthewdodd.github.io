                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Curtis, of Queen's-place, Hoxton, in the parish of Shoreditch—it is our dwelling-house. On Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 25th of Jan., I left home, at one o'clock in the day—I locked the door—the windows were down, and the shutter shut—I left nobody in the house—I was fetched home at eight o'clock in the evening, found the house had been ransacked, but no property gone—the articles stated were moved from their places, and placed on a chest of drawers—the policeman had got into the house.</p>

On the 25th, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was passing the door, and saw a light between the shutters—I stopped a moment, and listened, knowing Mrs. Curtis was out—I saw the prisoner Carter come out at the door—he said, "Good night," turning round to the door, as if bidding somebody inside good night—I ran and alarmed my husband, and then Grant came out—I am sure they are the men—I had seen them before.</p>

I am the husband of the witness—she called me—I ran out, and looking round saw Grant in the act of closing the door of Curtis's house after him—I followed him to the corner, four or five yards—he joined Carter, and they walked to the corner, then began to run—I followed them, calling "Stop thief"—I did not lose sight of them till they were stopped—Carter was stopped by a postman—I did not lose sight of him till he was stopped—I was within four or five yards of him.</p>

I was never in the street, and do not know where it is.</p>

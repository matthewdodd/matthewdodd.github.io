            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 29th of August I and Cooper went to No. 23, Carlisle-place, Lambeth, and inquired for Neil and Bruce; we were told they were not at home; we said we would call at nine o'clock. We went round another way, and came into the Carlisle Arms, where we could see the door; in about an hour the two prisoners passed us and knocked at the door; they were answered from the window by Bruce's wife, and both immediately left the house, and came down towards us, as soon as they saw us they ran in different directions. Cooper took Bruce, and I took Neil. We took them to the public-house; and then went back to No. 23, Carlisle-place, and found a hat in the back parlour, with Cole's name in it. We found a parcel of matches in Neil's pocket.</p>

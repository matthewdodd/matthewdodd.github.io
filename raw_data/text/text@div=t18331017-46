The witness said, that from the first of our entering the shop he had suspicion of the female, and he saw her fumbling among his goods; I should have thought that he would have stopped her, but instead of that, he said, he saw her pass the window with something, and then he put on his coat and hat, and came after us - he accused me first, and said, he was told that I knew something of a waistcoat piece; I said, "I will go back with you" - he then said, he saw this prisoner drop it; now if he had, would he not have taken it up and not have given another man time to have crossed and taken it up? while I was in the shop, I thought I heard a bustle, and I saw a man's arm going out of the shop; I was at that time at the other counter looking at some buttons; he had but four, but he said he should have some more the next night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the workhouse of the parish of St. George in the East—I live and sleep in the workhouse. On Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, the 15th of September, between seven and eight o'clock, in consequence of a report made to me, I went to the men's dining-room, and missed five table-cloths and five weights—the prisoner was formerly in the house, and had left a few days previous—I found the room in a filthy con<lb></lb>dition—I found a window broken next to the fastening, which was not so over night, to the best of my knowledge—a person could get over the front railings, and then obtain access to the house—I have examined these pieces of table-cloth produced—they form the greater part of one of the five I lost—here is the workhouse mark on one of the pieces.</p>

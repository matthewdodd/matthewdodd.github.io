                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old, and live at Greenwich work-house. I saw the prisoner on a Wednesday, some months ago, (but I do not know the day of the month,) in South-street, between one and two o'clock—I saw him open Mrs. Harris's door, go in and take out the two tea-chests, which stood on a table—he brought them out, and tied them up in a blue handkerchief—there was nobody in the shop—I gave in<lb></lb>formation directly they inquired about it, to the pot-boy outside the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I was sitting at dinner below the shop, and heard a footstep—I went up, and heard the door shut—I went into the shop, and missed the two tea-chests which stood near the door—I ran out, and saw the witness, who said she saw a man go by a moment before—she said she had seen him go into the shop, and directed me after him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. When taken before the Magistrate, I had a chair in the middle of the room, and there were four policemen in their police dresses, two standing on each side of me, and Mr. Harris—the girl was then introduced, and asked if I was the person—she looked round—there was nobody in plain clothes but myself, Mr. Harris, and two Greenwich constables, and of course I was the only stranger to her in the office—I was to have a fair chance of being identified, and that was the chance I had, being placed between six or seven officers—the girl might have seen me at the end of January or beginning of February go up and down that street, as I called in at Mr. Harris's about the 26th of January or the 2nd or 3rd of February—she stated before the Magistrate that I walked two or three times before the door before I entered the shop, and I certainly did so at that time—I saw nobody in the shop, and rang the bell, and Mr. Harris and his son came to me—Mr. Harris told the Magistrate that he had no recollection of my calling, and when I did call, he told me he was not in want of anybody—I asked him the nearest way to Deptford, and he directed me—the officer took me to Mr. Harris's son—he said he certainly had a slight recollection of me, but could not identify me as the person who called for employment.</p>

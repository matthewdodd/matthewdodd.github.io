            . I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of June in Chapel-street, Clerkenwell. from a description given at the station-house; I saw him sitting on the steps; I went up to him, and said,"Is not your name Darby?" he said, "No" - I was satisfied it was him, and told him I apprehended him for robbing his aunt of eight sovereigns; he said, "I will go with you any where, don't handle me" - on the way to the watch-house, I said, "I am persuaded you are the boy;" he said, "Oh! it don't matter, there are others in it as well as me;" and then he said two boys had persuaded him to do it; I said, he had better not say any thing; he said No, it did not matter, that he took the money, and went to a public-house and changed a sovereign, and one boy kept the change from him; and they persuaded him to go to Gravesend, and introduced him, to the landlord of the Marquis of Cornwallis, that he went to sleep, and the landlord took the money from him, and kept him while it lasted, and then sent him to London - I found a box of fish poison on him, which he said he gave twelve shillings for.</p>

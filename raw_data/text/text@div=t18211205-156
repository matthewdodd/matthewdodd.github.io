I then felt and missed it, and saw two or three boys running away. I followed them, crying Stop thief. They turned down St. Martin's-court into Cecil-court, and then I lost sight of them; but as I returned I met my friend with the prisoner; the handkerchief was found on him.</p>

            . I was walking with the prosecutor who missed his handkerchief. I saw two boys running towards Cecil-court, they crossed over into St. Martin's-court, and about the middle of the court I saw the prisoner running before me; I caught him as he turned the corner. I told him he had been picking a gentleman's pocket and must come back. He said he did not pick the gentleman's pocket, he only picked it up. I said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got it?" and he produced it from his hat.</p>

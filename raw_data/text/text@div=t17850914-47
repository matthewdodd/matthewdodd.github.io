               <p>What did you give him for them? - Eighteen-pence, one shilling for the shovel and sixpence for the bill.</p>
               <p>What would you sell them for now? - I ask fifteen-pence for the shovel, and would have taken fourteen-pence, as for the bill, I did not know the value of it, so I told him.</p>

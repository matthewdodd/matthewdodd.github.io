            . On the 6th of November, a little before seven o'clock, as I was passing down <placeName id="t18181202-8-crimeloc43">Holborn-hill</placeName>

The prisoner, Brown, passed me on the outside. I found my handkerchief safe, I took no notice of him, but walked on - I kept feeling if my handkerchief was safe. When I came within a few yards of Giltspur-street, by St. Sepulchre's church, I felt something touch my pocket again - I felt, and missed my handkerchief. I immediately turned round, and saw the prisoner Brown, close to me, and two men close to him, covering him - all three were in motion, with their hands moving. I seized all three, and said,</p>
               <p>"one or the other of you has got my handkerchief, give it to me". They all denied it - I said I would take them to the watch-house, and give them all in charge, as I was certain one of them had it. The two men became violent, and said they would not go to the watch-house, as they knew nothing about it. I looked on the ground, and saw my handkerchief lying there - there was nobody but the prisoners and myself near. The two men got from me - I kept hold of Brown, and picked up my handkerchief - I tried to take hold of the two men, but they retreated. One or two persons came up, I asked their assistance - they got as far as Giltspur-street. I called out Stop thief! and saw one of them stopped, about fifty or sixty yards off, on the pavement - it was Swain - the other kept in the middle of the road, and got away. I went up to Swain, and found a man lying on the ground, and Swain holding him, and saying,</p>
               <p>"This is him, I have got him" - he was holding Attfield, and said he was the man. I took him to the Compter with Brown.</p>

            . I am horse-keeper at the Saracen's Head Inn, Snow-hill. I heard the prosecutor call Stop thief! and immediately laid hold of Swain, who was running. He immediately tripped me up, threw me under him, and called out</p>

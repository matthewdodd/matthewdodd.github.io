A boy came into the shop when my master was up stairs, and wanted a twopenny loaf; the key was in the till, and I gave him change, as I saw there was a great quantity of silver in the till; I took out nineteen shillings in silver, and two shillingsworth of penny-pieces, and put three seven-shilling-piece in for it.</p>

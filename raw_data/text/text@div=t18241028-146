            . I occupy the ground floor and kitchen of this house. I went up to bed at half-past eleven o'clock at night: the kitchen and street doors were then fast; the back parlour shutters were not closed, by mistake; and I am not certain that the sash was down. The kitchen door is an inner one, and had marks of violence on it, and a pane of glass taken out. The parties appeared to have entered by the parlour window. I found all four dresser drawers open, and nearly empty. I lost a miniature set in gold, out of the kitchen; there were footmarks on the cill of the back parlour window, and footmarks also.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Little Pulteney-street. On the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was at work (one Phillips rents my shop and parlour); I heard a knock, looked out of the garret window, and saw a person standing at the door with a bundle under his arm; I heard the knock again, and then heard a disturbance in my passage - I ran down, and saw Cook in the custody of Yates, who had two bundles. I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October, about twenty minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Wardour-street, and saw Cook and another man, (whom I cannot swear to) coming up Little Pulteney-street; they each had a bundle. I crossed over to the corner of a court to watch them, and saw them go in at Frost's private door; I followed, and picked up a pen-knife which Cook dropped; I then shut the door, and collared him with a bundle in his hand; the other made his escape, leaving his bundle behind. I asked Phillips to assist me, but he would not. Cook said a man gave him 2 1/4 d. in the Haymarket to carry the bundle for him. In the pocket of one of the waistcoats I found some cards, by which I found out Mr. Hople.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which of the two went in first - A. The other man; he did not say that was the man who had given him the 2 1/4 d.; he said he should know the man again.</p>

On the 8th of October, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was going to my mother's at Knightsbridge, and was stopped by a man (not Barton;) he said he had two bundles, and would give me the price of a pot of beer to carry them, and as I was going into the house I was seized. The man escaped.</p>

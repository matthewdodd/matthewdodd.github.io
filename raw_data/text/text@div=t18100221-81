It was then about half after eleven; we staid there till half after twelve. After this I started to go home, as I suppose. I cannot recollect any thing more till half after five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You was drunk then - A. I suppose so. At half after five I found myself at No. 2, George-yard, Whitechapel; and the reason of my coming to recollect myself then, there was a kind of riot in George-yard. I found myself sitting on a chair before the fire, and a young woman at my right hand; I laid my hand upon her shoulder, she put it away again; she d - nd me, and said, what did I want, I had got no money. I laid my hand on my breeches pocket, which contained three one pound Bank notes, they were gone; I laid my hand upon my left pocket, which had two dollars and seven shillings in silver, that was gone; I laid my hand where my watch was, it was gone; the next thing, I clapped my hand to my side, my pocket-book was gone; this alarmed me very much. How I lost all this, I cannot tell.</p>

I went up stairs, the prisoner Hughes was sitting in her room; the next door was open, where the woman sent for me. I asked the woman, how that gentleman came there; she said, she supposed he must have come in while she came to fetch me.

            . I live with Mr. Matthews, pawnbroker, 105, in the Minories. On the 5th of January, between four and five in the evening, a man, that I think is the prisoner, came accompanied with two Jews, for the purpose of redeeming a watch to sell them, upon which they offered him three pounds; he refused to take it. Mr. Matthews looked at the watch; and shewed it to me. I thought they had not offered a fair price for it, I offered three guineas and a half; he refused, and said, he would ask his wife. He then went to the door, and brought in a woman, which I am certain is the prisoner Hughes; she likewise refused to take three guineas and a half; she rather wished him to pledge than to sell it; the man made answer, you know if I pledge it I shall not have money to redeem it in time; on that he agreed to take three guineas and a half for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man - A. I have but little doubt upon my mind about it; I should not like to swear positively to the man. Mr. Matthews paid them the money, and they went away. The watch I now produce is the watch that was bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that pawned the watch with you - A. A man.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January, the Saturday after the robbery, the woman prisoner came to me about eleven o'clock, she was rather intoxicated with liquor; she said, she wanted to speak to me. I took her of oneside, she said, there was another watch lost in our court last night; and she said, I have every reason to believe that the devil that lives with me had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who lived with her - A. Yes; the prisoner Bankes; she said, he went out this morning without any money with him, he has come home to-night full of money and drunk; she said, if I could come up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210052"></xptr>and pull him, no doubt but he would come it, and if he would not come at that, she would tell me where the capped and jewelled watch was, and shew me the door in the Minories where it was lumbered, that is pawned. I did not pay any attention to her that night. On the Monday morning I called upon her, she then was very much confused, and begged I would not take any notice what she said when she was drunk; she begged that I would not tell it to Bankes, he would murder her, and seemed very anxious for me to go away; she asked me to drink. I had not time on that day, nor on the Tuesday. On Wednesday I went to Mr. Matthews, they told me they had bought the watch; they shewed it me, it is capped and jewelled; a very valuable watch it is.</p>

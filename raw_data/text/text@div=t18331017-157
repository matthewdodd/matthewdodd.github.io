On the night of the 12th of October, a person resembling the prisoner Hickford brought a letter which was in the writing of Hinks - I had known Hinks before, and seen his writing several times; he had lived in her ladyship's service, and his wife is there now - I went to the door and took this letter, which is directed to Mrs. Lacey, who is our housekeeper; she is the inventress of some famous fish-sauce; I handed the letter to her - this was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; and about a quarter-past nine o'clock I heard that this writing-desk was missing - I saw it again about four o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Hickford. Q. Did you not say you could not swear to me, but you believed I was not the man? Witness. No; I said I could not swear to you, but I believed you was the man.</p>

On the 12th of October this letter was brought to me; I went to the hall and saw, as I believe, the prisoner Hickford - I could not positively swear to him; but from his dress and size I believe he is the man - I asked if it was necessary that I should send a written answer; he said,"No" - this letter is the writing of Hinks I firmly believe - it did not come from the person it purports to come from; I know no such person - (letter read).</p>

               <p>Witness. About nine o'clock this desk and the property in it was missing; I had seen it safe about five o'clock the same afternoon - the desk was locked, I had not seen the whole of its contents for twelve months before - I had seen the snuff-box about five weeks before, when I brought it into the drawing-room to her ladyship - the upper part of the lock of the desk is broken - here are all the articles stated, and one hundred sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Hickford. She said at Worship-street, she thought it was a shorter man than me. Witness. I said I thought he was a younger man, but his dress and every thing else corresponds; his voice seems very much the same.</p>

            . I am inspector of the police. I took Hickford into custody on the Monday morning - I asked if he knew a man of the name of Hinks; he said he did, and he had been in his company about eight o'clock on Saturday night - I told him Hinks had committed a robbery, and from the description I had received of a person who was with him, I believed him to be the man - I took him to her ladyship's, and Lacey said, from his appearance and his voice, she believed him to be the man who brought the letter - he said he had taken a letter about three weeks before, and that it was addressed to the cook of the house, who was Hinks' wife - he said he lodged and slept with Hinks, and they worked together as paupers for the parish of St. George - he said Hinks came home that Saturday night and wanted him to go out for a walk, but he had refused, and Hinks then left him.</p>
               <p>Hinks' Defence. I left work at half-past six o'clock with the other prisoner, he went home - when I went home I found him in bed; I went to take a walk, but he would not go, as he said he was tired; I came out, left him in bed, and saw no more of him till we were at the office - I went out and saw a young man who asked me to go and have something to drink; we went and had a glass of liquor; and from that time I recollect nothing that happened till I was in Queen-street; I was then just as if I had awoke from a dream, and found I had the desk - I then lost myself again till I was near Marylebone workhouse; I then took a coach and drove to the public-house - I recollect no more till I was called up on Monday morning - the man I took a walk with was shorter than Hickford.</p>
               <p>Hickford's Defence. I went home to bed; the other prisoner came home and asked me to take a walk, but I declined it; and I saw him no more till I was taken.</p>
               <p>JURY to LACEY. Q. Did you let the man out? A. Yes; he had no desk then - I did not see him in a good light, and cannot swear to Hickford, but I believe he is the man.</p>

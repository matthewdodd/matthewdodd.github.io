             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the prisoner take some lead from Mr. Hollis's, it was on a Monday, I cannot rightly tell what week it was, it was in April last, between one and two, as the men went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the house inhabited? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the lead affixed to the house or loose? - Affixed to the house.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you guess what quantity there was? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the man taken with the lead upon him? - No, he sold it in St. Giles's; he told me to stand at one corner, while he went and sold it.</p>
               <p>You assisted him in taking it? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Wader. He took my apron from another man whom I had lent it to; I did not object to his taking it, nobody was about at that time; he took the lead away in the morning about ten, the other men were backwards at work; he put it into a stable.</p>
               <p>Was it one pound of lead? - More than that, it was more than twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any part of the money he sold it for? - After he sold it he gave me eighteen pence of the money; I refused it, and told him I would not have it, and he forced into my pocket; my hand was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I take it for granted,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080010"></xptr>my young man, that you are perfectly innocent of all this business yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never was suspected at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You had no kind of concern whatever in the transaction yourself? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>None at all? - None.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think you say he insisted on your taking the one shilling and six-pence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Williams? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Williams had no concern in this? - None.</p>
               <p>He did not persist in your taking it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never swear that he and Williams forced you to take it? - No, I never have.</p>
               <p>You never did? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Now here is the examination returned, in which he says he did; you never agreed to take part of what the lead came to? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How soon did you give an account of this transaction? - Three days; I told one of the men two days afterwards, that works with my master, his name is

            .</p>
               <p>Did you say, on your examination, that he put it into your pocket, or only that he insisted on your taking it? - He insisted on my taking it.</p>
               <p>How many times was you examined? - Twice, first I told him, in the morning, when he went to work, he said there was a pigeon; I asked him what he meant; and he shewed me a great piece of lead on the side of the house, and said that was a pigeon, and he went up and cut several pieces; then he wanted another man and me, and we would not; and when I came back, he had it all down; he threw a tile at me, it did not hit me.</p>
               <p>Did you never mention this before three days after? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did you not go and give information of the whole transaction immediately? - I did not know where to go; I knew Mr. Hollis, but did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with this prisoner previous to his going up the ladder? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Williams? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>None at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You say, upon your oath, that Williams did not singly insist on your taking the money? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>And you never swore that they both insisted upon your taking it? - No.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Hollis? - A twelvemonth; he employs me still, I told my master of it; I have had conversation with Griffith and Lamb; I told him the same as now, how it happened, and he asked me, and I told Mr.

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

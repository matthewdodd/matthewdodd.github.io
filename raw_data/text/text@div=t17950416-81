               <p>Q. Then he said that before you spoke to him? - Yes, he did. He said, he had seen a man go up St. Michael's-alley, and he followed him up into Gracechurch-street, and there he stopped him, and took him to the Poultry Compter.</p>

               <p>I am a hatter. On the 8th of April, I was with my brother; I see the prisoner in Cornhill with a coat on his arm, Parrott was rather before me; I called to Parrott and said, I thought this man has got a coat that is not his own. Accordingly I followed him to St. Michael's-alley; I told Mr. Parrott that he had not got that coat honestly, he looked round so often; I and Parrott followed him into Gracechurch-street, and he went as far as the Spread Eagle Inn; he turned round and see me after him, and he dropped the coat, and ran away, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give the coat to after? - I kept it in my arm, and gave it at my Lord Mayor's Court.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you carried it to Green? - Yes, to Cornhill, I carried it to Green.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave it to Green? - I did not give it to Green, I shewed it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Green. Will you swear that you have kept that coat from that time to this? - From the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say that the man delivered you the coat in the street? - No, he did not deliver it to me in the street; it was delivered to me at the Mansion House, before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. To Bankrow. Should you know the coat again? - I put my mark to it; there is my mark to it; I know it to be the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man? - I never lost sight of him till he dropped the coat, and then I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you see him again? - About a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - Mr. Parrott, and I brought him to the Sprcad Eagle Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in custody when you see him again? - Yes, he was. Mr. Parrott and others had him in custody when I see him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the coat no further than picking it up.</p>

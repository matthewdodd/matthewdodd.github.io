             sworn. On Friday the 9th of May, as I was coming through Baldwyn's Gardens, the prisoner at the bar said to me, I should like to split your scull, I said why, she said because you are like my husband, I said I should be very sorry if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210029"></xptr>I was, because I should not like to have such a drunken wife, she reeled very much, and was sometimes off the pavement into the road, I paid very little at tention to the conversation, she said she had been into the fields to keep herself sober, and there she found a child in the morning, the child had nothing on, she said, but a flannel bed gown and a pair of earrings; she said the child turned to her and called to her, and called her aunty, she asked the child where she lived, the child said Mutton Hill; she had, she said, been all the day and could not find the parents of the child, she had left it at Clerkenwell workhouse; I thought it was a strange story, when we went almost to the bottom of Holborn she asked me if I would drink, I told her by no means, she says I would wish you to drink with me; I thought I might have an opportunity of getting the whole of the transaction out of her; I went into the wine vaults, I looked at the woman, her right eye was black, she had a glass of gin, and when she came out of the wine vaults a woman that sold gingerbread accosted her, and says what have you done with the child you took down Holborn; I went back, asked her what she said about the child, she said this woman led a child away, she said it was Coleman's child in Field-lane; I went to Coleman and found he was out with the beadle having the child cried.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, if I am right, you afterwards found the child in Clerkenwell workhouse. - A. We both went there and found the baby, we brought her back; I told Coleman if he would go with me up to this wine vaults, probably they might know something of this woman; I said I am positive I should know her; we went into several houses about Saffron Hill, we could see nothing of her, when I was with her she said she was going to meet her husband at the Cow, in Cow-lane; we went there and the first object that I saw when we were at the door was this woman, we took her up, she was searched, and a great many duplicates were found upon her.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's parish. When I was calling the hour of three o'clock in the morning, I picked up this duplicate off the pavement; the next day at Guildhall, it occurred to me when the name of Brown was mentioned, that I had a duplicate I picked up in that name; I went up to sir Watkin, and informed him that I had something that would bring the matter to light, here is the duplicate. (The frock and petticoat identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in Cold Bath Fields, I met this poor baby, about the hour of half past eight, or near nine o'clock, I could not hear who it belonged to one way or other; I went up and down Mutton Hill for half an hour, I could not hear any thing; there was a poor woman that persuaded me to take her to the workhouse, I took the child to Clerkenwell workhouse, there I left word my name was Brown, and my father lived in Shoe-lane; I told this good man that I was going to meet my husband at the Cow, in Cow-lane, is it likely that I should have told that if I had robbed the child; I have had seven children of my own, I never touched the child's clothes, I have too much feeling for a baby.</p>

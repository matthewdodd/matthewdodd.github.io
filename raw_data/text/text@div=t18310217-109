            . I am a constable of Lambeth. I went with Myers and Rose; I gave Rose seven shillings to purchase twelve counterfeit half-crowns of the prisoner- he went out while we sat in a box in the tap-room; I had before searched Rose, and he had no money but what we gave him - I saw him meet the prisoner at the corner of Eagle-court; they went down, and stood about two minutes together - I saw the prisoner give Rose a paper, and Rose gave him something; Rose held the parcel in his hand, and it appeared to contain something - Myers has the money.</p>

            .

            . These half-crowns are all bad, and of the same description as the others; this appears like metal, which, in a state of fusion, had fallen through the grate - it is the same metal as the coin is made of - these appear parts of a mould, in which such coin is cast - I can discover on them, with a glass, the faint remains of one or two letters which the coins bear.</p>

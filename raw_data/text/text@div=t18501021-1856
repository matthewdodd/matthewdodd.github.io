                  </hi>. I have one partner; we are auctioneers, in Saville<lb></lb>row, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. None of the persons in our employ sleep on the premises—we occupy the lower part of the house: our auction-rooms are behind—the prisoner was in our employ in June, 1849—be had been so constantly about a year and a half, and occasionally before—he was one of our porters—it was part of his duty to make fast the counting-house and rooms in the evening, and take away the key—on Saturday, 30th June, 1849, we expected a parcel of plate from Thomas, of Bond-street, to be introduced into a sale on the following Tuesday—I left about half-past five o'clock—the plate had not then arrived, to my knowledge—we have an iron chest there; I have one key of it, and my partner has another—I took away my key—the persons there had no opportunity to open that chest—I left the clerks and the porters there—the gentleman who has the charge of the auction-rooms, would leave at six o'clock—the prisoner would remain last, till seven, then lock up and take the keys with him—on the Monday following I went to the premises—I found the clerks and porter outside the house—I sent for a smith, and had the door opened—I went also over the premises, but found no marks of breaking in—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him in custody this month.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Thomas and Son, silver-smiths, in Bond-street. On Saturday, 30th June, 1849, I took a parcel of plate to Messrs. Rushworth's, between six and seven o'clock—there was a silver coffee-pot, forks, spoons, ladles, and other things—I delivered the parcel to the prisoner—he and Cordwell were the only persons I saw there belonging to Mr. Rushworth—the prisoner unpacked the articles out of the baize, and took an account by my list—he put it, while I was there, into a drawer of the sideboard, on the right-hand side going in at the door—while I took the articles out, he asked me which were silver and which were not, because he wanted to put the silver away—the plated articles he did not want to know about—I answered those questions—they were worth about 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for old silver—they would have been worth upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the trade.</p>

                  </hi>. In June, 1849, I was in the service of Mr. Squibb, who occupied the upper part of the prosecutor's premises—they have two windows looking down Saville-row—the entrance is by the side of the windows—on Sunday, 1st July, 1849, the prisoner came there about one o'clock—I knew him to be the person entrusted with the keys by Messrs. Rushworth and Jarvis—he asked me if either of his governors had been; I said I would inquire—I inquired, and my fellow-servants said they had not—the door I opened led from the passage to the street—a person coming in at that door would require a key to get into Messrs. Rushworth's premises—the prisoner took a key, unlocked that door, and went into the office—he was in there about twenty minutes—he brought this basket with him when he came—I did not let him out—I saw him go, and he had a parcel tied up in green baize, with a cord round it—the parcel was larger than this basket—I suspected nothing wrong.</p>

            . On the 10th of July, at ten minutes past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the Hampshire Hog-yard, St. Giles's, with something under his apron. I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said a piece of lead, and was going to make a trifle of it; and said he found it by the cow-house, which is a long way from the path. I took him to the watch-house, went to the cow-house, and in the footpath was another piece of lead. We found the prosecutrix had been robbed two nights before; we took the lead to her house in the Hampshire Hog-yard, and the piece found on him exactly corresponded with a piece found by Mealey on the scaffold, and the other piece corresponded with a piece of the gutter which was not moved.</p>

            . I was working at Mrs. Fitzgerald's house, repairing it; we put the lead on in the afternoon, and in the morning I found it cut in three pieces, and two stolen; it had been fixed; one piece was left on the scaffold; I gave it to Riley, who compared it with another piece; it corresponded, and was the same load.</p>

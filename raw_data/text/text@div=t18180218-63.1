            ; we live in Skinner-street, Snowhill. I know Mr. Giles - He is the keeper of the Abercorn Arms, Stanmore. On the 24th of January, I received a letter, purporting to come from him (reads it)</p>
               <p>"To Messrs Abbotts, and Co. wine-merchants, Skinner-street.</p>
               <p>"Abercorn Arms, Stanmore, January 24th, 1818.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Giles will thank Messrs Abbotts and Co. to send this day, four dozen of Sherry and Two of Maderia, to be left at the Paviour's Arms, Swallow-street. Mr. Fitch's cart will bring it."</p>
               <p>I believed this note to come from Mr. Giles; in consequence of it, I ordered the seventy-two bottles of wine, which was about fourteen gallons, to be packed, and sent to the Paviour's Arms. The prisoner dealt with me for wine two years ago, and owes me 100l. now.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LLOYD. On the 24th of January, I packed seventy-two bottles of wine, by Mr. Abbotts' direction, and delivered them to the cart.</p>

            . I keep the Paviour's Arms, Swallow-street. On the 24th of January, about ten o'clock, in the morning, the prisoner came to my house, and asked me to do him a favour, to permit two hampers to be pitched on my premises, untill the afternoon, for Mr. Fitch's cart to call for, as it returned from market, to be taken then to Stanmore. I told him I did not know Fitch; he said, he was an old established hay-salesman, in the market; and said, Fitch made use of my name, and knew me. I consented to it. Trevillian brought it about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. About a quarter of an hour after, the prisoner came, and said, "Is it come." I said, "Yes; it is in the yard,"-where it laid. It was directed to Mr. Giles, Abercorn Arms, Stanmore. He came into the house, and had something to drink, and said he was waiting for Fitch's cart; it did not come. He said, he would go down the Hay-market, to look for it; he went out, and returned, saying, he did not know what he should do, as he was disappointed in his cart. He said he had seen Mr. Fitch, and that the cart was gone. I told him, he must move the wine, as the permit would expire; he said, "By all means; I must have it home to night, for we have a party on Monday." I asked him who kept the Abercorn Arms; he said, Giles, who was his brother. He got a hackney-coach, and took the wine away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I told him, it should not stay on my premises; the carter gave me no orders to keeps it; he said he must get it home.</p>

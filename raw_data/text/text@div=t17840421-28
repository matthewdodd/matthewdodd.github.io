               <p>Court. How much money had been in your till the night before? - Eight shillings in halfpence, and some of them marked; there were four of them that were marked which I can swear to, they are here; we took him to the watch-house, and there we searched him, we found four shillings in halfpence and two farthings, three shillings and eightpence halfpenny I missed out of the till.</p>
               <p>Were any of these halfpence that you found in his pocket, so marked that you could know them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they the same halfpence you had of him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have they been in your possession ever since? - Yes, they were never out of this bag till this moment. (The halfpence shewn to the Court.) The crooked halfpence I know without the mark, two of these halfpence had marks on them, and I wrote down the marks in the paper before.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not set down these marks since you lost them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I watched with the last witness, I set up with him; I heard the prisoner come down stairs and go into the tap-room, and come out of the tap-room and go into the bar, and unlocked the till and took out the half-pence, and locked the till again; I did not distinguish more than once, I heard the halfpence chink, I went in with the last witness and secured him, there were found in his pockets four shillings and three-pence halfpenny.</p>

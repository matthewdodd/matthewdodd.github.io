               <p>I am fellow-workman with the prisoner: On the 5th of December, I went, about seven o'clock in the morning, my master told me he had been robbed; at five in the afternoon, my master ordered me to watch the prisoner out of the shop, I stood opposite my master's house; about five he came out, and instead of turning towards his own habitation, he went down Golden-lane, into the shop of Mr. Rogers, he stopped about a minute; he had understood, by some notice, that there was a search-warrant, and turned round short upon me to come out; I laid hold of him, and told him my master wanted him at home, he gave me no answer at all; I followed him very close, and he shifted the metal out of one pocket into another; I saw it in his hands several times.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told him what you came for? - A. No, I did not; he came back into the shop, and I told him what he was charged with; I sent for a constable, and before the constable came in, he pulled it out of his pocket, and laid it on the counter; my master asked him how long he had robbed him? he said, it was the first time, and he hoped he would forgive him. The constable came in, my master gave him in charge, and he was sent to prison. (The metal produced in Court.) That is my master's property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Can you swear that it is your master's property? - A. Yes; it is metal that I cut up the night before.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you never cut any like it before? - A. Yes, many thousands; in the course of the Saturday, I saw this metal in the cellar two or three times; I took particular notice of the metal, for I had marked in the morning a great quantity of it; and between nine and ten o'clock, in the day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130059"></xptr>I went down into the cellar and examined the metal, whether any of it was gone; a great part of it was gone that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You did not put any particular marks upon it? - A. No, not as I did upon the other. About four o'clock I went down again, and it was all gone but about two ounces. I look upon it I might have marked eight or nine pounds; and I went down at four o'clock, I took particular notice of this metal lying then in my master's cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to it all? - A. No, not to it all; I can swear to these three pieces; they have gone through my hands a great many times. I can take upon myself, positively, to swear that they were my master's property, I had it in my hand before I doubled it, and after it was doubled. About four o'clock was the last time that I saw it before I found it upon the prisoner; I have had as much practice in metal, I believe, as most men in London; I have lived with my master above thirty years.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What is your mark? - A. There is the mark of a hammer upon one, and a double in another; I had it in my hand about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Which end of the hammer did you strike it with? - A. The blow came with the ball of the hammer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You don't use claw hammers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to cutting it up, my Lord, he did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you know whether Mr. Warner ordered this prosecution?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is a question that we have nothing to do with, Gentlemen.(

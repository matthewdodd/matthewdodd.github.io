On the night of the 26th of January I locked the door of my shop at about a quarter past seven o'clock, and took the key with me—my attention was called to my shop a little before eight o'clock, when I was in the up-stairs room—I went down, found the shop door wide open, and missed my coat off a shelf at the further end of the shop—I looked out, and saw the policeman bringing the prisoner along with my coat—the street door had been left open, but my shop door was locked.</p>

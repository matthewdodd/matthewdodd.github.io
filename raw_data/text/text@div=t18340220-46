               <p>JAMES ROSE. I live at No. 184, Hoxton Old Town - I am servant to Mr. Perrian, a coal-dealer - I was going out with some coal up the town, on a Tuesday, and saw the two prisoners looking into the coffee-shop window by the side of Mr. Carter's - then I saw Smith cut the putty of Mr. Carter's window - Pickett was standing by the side of him - Smith cut the putty - I did not see what he did it with - I was across the road opposite - I heard the glass crack - they pushed in the glass; and Smith took out a shawl, and put it under Pickett's apron - they then walked away quite fast down Bacchus'-walk - I put down my coals off my back, and went over to Mr. Carter's, and told what I had seen - Carter went after the prisoners with me- we met them running down Bacchus'-walk - they went into a house, the door of which was open - they were secured - I did not see the shawl found.</p>

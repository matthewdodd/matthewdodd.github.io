                  </hi>. I am an in-door pensioner of Greenwich hospital, and am sixty-five years of age. On Wednesday, the 28th of June, I left the Cricketers with this girl, and went to the house No. 6, Church-court—I believe we had a quartern of gin there—we went up stairs together to a bedroom—I underssed myself and went to bed—she never went to bed with me—I soon fell asleep with my watch in my pocket, my ring on my finger, and five shillings in my pocket—I put my trowsers and cloths down by the side of the bed with my watch in my fob, with a seal and key and two foreign bits of silver to it—after I had been in bed some time, I was aroused by Jane Phillips, it was a little after ten o'clock—she told me I had better go home—I asked her where <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi> was, and she said she was gone—I said I had lost my watch and ring, and what money I had in my pocket—she said she did not know any thing about that, she was gone a good while ago—I dressed myself and went home to my own bed—the following night I went in search of <hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, and saw her coming out of the Magazine public-house, between ten and eleven o'clock—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, you have robbed me"—Me robbed you," she says, "I did not see you after you left the Cricketers"—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, you have robbed me of my watch, ring and money,"—I am sure I mentioned the ring—I gave her in charge after she denied it.</p>

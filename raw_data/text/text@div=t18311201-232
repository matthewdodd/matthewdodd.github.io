            . I am a Policeman. On the 28th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Gray's Inn-lane, carrying a heavy basket - I asked what he had there; he said some furniture to put in a house in Blackfriars-road, and that his father was a master builder; I said I did not believe him - he said I might see what he had got; I examined it, and said I should take him to the watch-house - he took up the basket, walked a few steps, then threw it on me, and ran away; I sprang my rattle, and Haines stopped him in three minutes - I am sure of his person.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Bell-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and heard a rattle spring - the prisoner passed me almost immediately; I pursued, and never lost sight of him till I brought him back - he refused to go; there was a struggling between us, and he took hold of the lamp-post, but I brought him back.</p>

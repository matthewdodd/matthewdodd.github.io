               <p>Q.When did you see the chest again? - A. About an hour after I awoke; there was a card with a direction nailed on the side, that was torn off; it was directed, John Smith, to be left till called for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You came to town on the 24th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The chest was marked that you could know it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about the prisoner, he was a stranger to you? - A. Yes; he was very officious.</p>
               <p>Q.Because he assisted you, you call him officious? - A. He was very officious.</p>
               <p>Q. All the things that were in the box when it was brought to the Queen's Head, Darkhouse-lane, are in it now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your box is safe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the master of the Dark-house here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not up I suppose? - A. No, I believe not; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say you wanted to go to Deptford? - A. No; I said I wanted to go to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say he had a boat, and could carry you across the River? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the chest taken to a Custom-house officer? - A.Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you see a watch-box at the bottom of the stairs? - A. I heard there was a box left in the care of the watchman at Temple-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.You don't know that the box was left with the watchman to be examined? - A. Only what I heard.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WRIGHT sworn. - I am in the Company's service; I am employed occasionally as a porter to carry any thing at Mr. Hoddy's, the Queen's Head, in Darkhouse-lane; I was there between three and four in the morning of the 25th of January; I saw Climer there; he employed me to carry a chest to a boat; when I had got the chest he ordered me to carry the chest to Temple-stairs; he told me it was his own property, and that he was going to Deptford; he went with me to Temple-stairs; when we came there, there was no boat; there was a King's watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is Temple-stairs? - A. The next plying-place below Billingsgate, between the Custom-house and Billingsgate; I set down the chest on some casks standing on end; we left it in the charge of the watchman till called for; he said a Captain was coming down with some more things in a boat, and then I should be paid for it; he told me not to make any charge to the gentleman, but leave it to his generosity, and he supposed it would be 2 or 3s. or more, in my way; Climer and I returned to the Queen's Head; Carter came down, and enquired who had taken the chest; I told him I had; he said, I think you have taken a wrong chest; he said, go down with the man, and see whether he has got a key that fits the chest; Climer went down with me to Temple-stairs, and pulled out something he pretended was the key, and applied it to the keyhole; being satisfied I came back with Climer; I had no suspicion of him; the chest was lashed as it is now; coming back he parted with me before we got to the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go? - A. No, I missed him suddenly coming towards Billingsgate; I went to the Queen's Head, and Carter told me to go with another man, and bring back the chest, which I did; between six and seven I saw the prisoner at the Dark-house, (that is another house) in the custody of

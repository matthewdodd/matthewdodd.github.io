On the 17th of April, about seven o'clock in the morning, when I got up, and went into the back parlour, I found the drawers taken out, they were locked the night before, and every thing was safe. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; the bolt of the back door was broken; the persons must have got over the wall of the yard to get to that door; the prisoner had lodged with us, and left about three weeks before the robbery.</p>

They may, but nobody came on that night; my servant is not here; persons sleep at the house sometimes whom I do not see; but I swear that none but my own family were there on that night; the back door was forced.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has lost the use of one arm - A. It is crooked, but I have seen her wash and work with it.</p>

            , I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th, dancing at the Golden Lion public-house, Leman-street, Whitechapel, about nine o'clock at night; there were about 200 persons in the room; she was sitting down, and was pointed out to me. I went to Dock-street, and searched a room, which was pointed out to me as her's. I stated before her next morning, that I had searched her room; described where it was, and said I had found a napkin, a piece of ribbon, and three duplicates there. She sent for her landlady, who was the person who shewed me the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you notice the prisoner's door - A. I did; it had been wrenched with the violence, but clum-sily; not as thieves generally do. The yard wall is about four feet and a half high; it was a very wet night, and in the soft dirt in the yard, there were prints of a man's feet and a woman's pattens near the wall</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the door open into a garden - A. Into a paved yard, my Lord. It appeared that persons making the foot and patten marks had got over the wall which leads to a court.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

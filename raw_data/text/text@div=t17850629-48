               <p>On Wednesday last but one, I was going on some business to Bloomsbury, when I was past the end of Fleet-market, about twenty or thirty yards above Fleet-market, I saw the boy which since proves to be Mr. Hunt's boy, coming down the flag pavement with a parcel on his head, I saw the prisoner in the horse-way, the first I saw of him was about three yards distance from the boy with the parcel, he was running, he came to the boy and put his hand to the parcel, I thought he was going to wrong the boy of the parcel, because I have heard of many such instances, the boy stood on the flag pavement, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner had one foot on the kirb stone, and the other on the horse-way, I stepped between them, the prisoner had his head rather stooping down, I saw him with a shilling in his hand, and I saw him put the shilling in the boy's hand, and heard him say to him make haste, he then had the parcel under his arm, the prisoner said Mr. Wilson sent him, I asked the boy who that Mr. Wilson was, the prisoner answered, he lives in Castle-yard, Holborn; and the boy in the mean time laid hold of the parcel he had under his arm, and he let him have it, the prisoner agreed to go to Mr. Wilson, the boy put a question, did Mr. Wilson send you? the prisoner said, yes, the boy said that could not be for he was not at home, he said Mrs. Wilson sent him, that was the same thing, or words to that purport, the prisoner made many excuses not to go to Mr. Wilson's; one of us knocked at the door, the prisoner began, I spoke and the boy spoke, so there was such a confusion, that I believe Mrs. Wilson did not understand it at first, she said, the parcel was safe, and thought it better to let the man go; I took the prisoner to Mr. Hunt's, and related the affair there; the parcel was left in the care of Mrs. Wilson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I desire to stop in the street to speak to anybody on the other side of the way? - I cannot positively answer that question, he did mention something about a friend.</p>

               <p>With submission, I trust the situation I stand in at present will plead my excuse for troubling the Court with a defence; permit me to inform you, that on the day this unfortunate affair happened (I am by profession a clerk, and out of employment) I met with a gentleman I personally knew, and he said how do you do Mr. Smith, how does the world go with you; he said will you give that boy a shilling, and desire him to go to Mr. Wilson's, I did so, and the boy gave me the shilling again and thanked me for the shilling; in consequence of this that man came up and asked the boy if he knew me, the boy said, no, I said, are you an officer, he said no, but he would go with me; I said, I see I have been led into an error, and going to St. Andrew's church, I stopped and asked to go across the way to speak to the gentleman that I saw , who employed me, but they would not stop, and I went to Mr. Wilson's, and I went to Mr. Hunt's, Mr. Hunt would have been very glad to have cleared me that night, I know the gentleman personally.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect any one person that ever saw you in company with this man? - I cannot; I have very good friends, but I did not communicate this circumstances to them, I have a wife and child, and they depend entirely on my support and in h y .</p>

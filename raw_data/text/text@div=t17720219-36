They came down to my house in a coach, three or four together; Jennings, who went by the name of Gordon, was one; they staid about five or ten minutes, or half an hour; it is about three weeks or a month ago. Gordon and the two lads were saying in the tap-room, that these two girls had got away with the notes; they asked me to stop the girls. A little after that they were leaning their heads down, I saw two lottery tickets that were 20 l. prizes. I said, what is that? Gordon immediately went and thrust them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you distinguish that they were prizes?</p>
               <p>Rooke. There was an L, a figure of 2, and an o, wrote in ink. After they had desired me to stop this girl, they wanted me to let them out. I said, No; having stopt her, I will stop you all; I will send for Mr. Noakes to take charge of you. The two women frequented the house before I kept it; they sold fish about, and paid their way very well; one of the sisters owes me a score now. I never heard any thing bad of them till this affair.</p>
               <p>Court. Nor of Gordon, nor the boys, I dare say?</p>
               <p>Rooke. No farther than frequenting my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your house frequented by a great deal of such company as that?</p>
               <p>Rooke. It was frequented by such company as that before I kept it.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope the Justices have taken away your licence.</p>
               <p>Rooke. It is already taken away. I can't help my house being bad.</p>
               <p>Court. No; it is not the house that is bad; it is the keeper of it that is bad.</p>

I raked among the ashes, and found some bits of a pocket-book, (producing them.) The prosecutor said, part appeared like a rivet to the pocket-book, and part of an opera ticket.

             was standing by; we were all together under the piazza's at Govent-Garden, it was about ten at night. Smith went to pick the gentleman's pocket; he came back, and said there was nothing but a pocket-book. We sent him back again, and he brought the pocket-book. I believe the gentleman had come from the play-house; it was just at the corner, coming out across the way. He brought it behind his coat; we took it from him, and went into Govent-garden market with it; we opened it; we saw some notes in it, and a locket fell out, that Mr. Noakes has; there is a true-lover's knot to it; I took it up, and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many went into the market to examine it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. All of us. Gordon said, give it me; I said, I will keep it myself; I put it in my pocket. He said, let's go to Westminster. We went to the Oak in Thieving-lane. Gordon saw Graham at the Hope, and we all went with her; she opened the pocket-book, and saw some silver instruments in it, and she pulled out two lottery tickets. Upon searching farther, she said to Gordon, here is a 50 l. bank note; come and kiss me, my dear. The gentleman said there was a 25 l. note; I did not see that.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190014"></xptr> She searched the book over, and said there were notes. We tore the book, and burnt it and the other papers; Gordon had the lottery tickets, and brought them to the Hope afterwards. Graham asked Gordon if he would have any beef for supper; she said, she had got a shilling. She went out with pretence to get some, but did not return again; and I saw her no more till she was taken; she took Miller with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this way?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Not long; I was a porter before, and worked very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Michener to do in it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. She only fetched a candle, and was in the room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body lodge with Graham?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes, Michener.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jennings. Where was I when the pocket-book was taken?</p>
               <p>Kenney. About ten yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Birch any thing to do with it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. No; he was under the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. And went afterwards to the Hope with you?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. He went out of pure love then; had nothing to do with it?</p>
               <p>Kenney. Yes; out of pure love.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you usually let those into your secrets to see what prizes you have, that have not been concerned in the business?</p>
               <p>Kenney. I have not been long used to this way.</p>

             and her sister there; I heard a disturbance about this note. I asked Graham several times, if she knew any thing of it; and she said, she did not. I believe if she had known any thing of it, she would have told me, that is all I know of it.</p>

               <p>Miller. No.</p>
               <p>Court. I fancy they expected you was able to tell us more of it than you have done.</p>
               <p>Miller. I said the same at first as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood from Kenney, that you was at Graham's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Kenney. It was her sister Michener.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in custody about it?</p>
               <p>Miller. I was taken up about it at first; but the evidence cleared me.</p>

               <p>Miller. All the prisoners at the bar were there.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Are you able to identify these notes?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I received them at the Bank the day I lost them. I had an account of the numbers the day after I lost them, of a clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that clerk here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

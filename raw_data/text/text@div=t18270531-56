Wood lodged with me; the prisoner did not lodge at my house - he had come to town from Manchester on the Wednesday before this happened. On the 24th of April he came into my parlour, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and had a glass of beer - I saw him come down stairs and go into the privy - he remained there about five minutes, then came out, and was going away - I met him in the passage, and said I believed he had been upstairs - he had no business there; he said Yes, he had been to look for Bennet, the guard, who lodged with me, but he had been out four hours - I asked how he knew where Bennet lodged - he said he was in his room three days ago, and that he wanted to send a parcel to his wife by him; I searched him, and found two shirts in his hat, and the coat and trowsers in the privy - he told me they were there, and said he was in distress - he had got 18d.</p>

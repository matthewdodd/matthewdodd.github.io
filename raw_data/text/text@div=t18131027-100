            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 16th of October, a little after eight in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Union-street, Swallow-street, the prisoner passed me with something under his coat; I ran after him, and stopped him; I took the glass from under his coat; I asked him where he got it from; he said, he did not know, he had it from a man. I took him into a public-house, and searched him. He begged hard for me to let him go, he had done it, he said, through distress, if I would let him go, he would take the glass to where he stole it from; going along to the office he said, he had it out of Bull-yard, Swallow-street. This is the glass.</p>

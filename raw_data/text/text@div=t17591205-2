            . I am a constable, and was sent for by Mr. Nugent, at the Nag's head in Cheapside, when I was told that the woman they had got there had been attempting to rob the larder where they keep the victuals. I laid hold of her (the prisoner at the bar) and found she had got a parcel of things in a handkerchief, amongst which was this parcel of ivory combs mark'd with a shopkeeper's mark; some of them were loose down her bosom. In the handkerchief also was this parcel of thread. She said she bought the combs of a comb-maker on Snow-hill. I sent a person thither with some of them, who return'd and said they were not made there, but was directed to Mr. Bowers, near Aldgate. I asked the prisoner where she had the thread, who said she bought it in the street. Then I secured her, advertised the goods, and went to Mr. Bowers; he sent me to Mr. Griffice, who said the combs were of his make, and sent to the prosecutor's.</p>

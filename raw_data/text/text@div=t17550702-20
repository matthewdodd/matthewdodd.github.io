            . On the 27th of May I was in the fields going to Stepney, with the prisoner. We lay upon a hay-cock together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with her before?</p>
               <p>Walker. I have known her 16 or 18 years; we were neighbours children.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together that night?</p>
               <p>Walker. From 11 over night to 3 the next morning. I had turn'd the chain of my watch within-side my breeches, when I lay down. When I awaked about 3 o'clock I was all alone, and found my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person with you?</p>
               <p>Walker. No; we were by our two selves. I took her up in the Minories about 5 o'clock that night. She would not confess she had it.</p>
               <p>Jos. Collet. I am constable; I was sent for to a publick-house; the prosecutor there charged me with the prisoner, for stealing his watch. I went out and got a watchman; and going along she said she wanted to ease herself. I bid the watchman be modest, and let her sit down. After that she said she wanted again; and after that again; and made a halt each time. Then I suspected she had the watch about her, and wanted to shift it. As we were bringing her through Aldgate she gave her cloaths a shug up; the watchman then put his hand into her bosom, and took out a watch. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Lee, the watchman, confirmed the constable's evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I'll take my affidavit I never saw a watch upon the prosecutor; I found that watch lawfully; and when he challenged me with it, I did not think it was his watch; for he could neither read or write.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>
               <p>Elis. Studd. The prisoner is a poor honest child, and gets her living by buying old cloaths.</p>

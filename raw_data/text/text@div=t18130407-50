He came back, and said that he had brought one snuff-box back that he had at our house in the morning, and that Mr. Butt kept the other three; that Mr. Butt had sold two to a customer, and the others he kept for the shop. I made out a bill of parcel in Mr. Butt's name, and gave the bill of parcels to the prisoner. There was a conversation took place between me and the prisoner, respecting his coming back so soon. I said, he had made good haste; I hardly supposed he could come back in the time. He said, that he had run all the way from our house to Bond-street, for the gentleman was waiting to see the articles. I asked if he lived at Mr. Butt's at the present time, for I had not recollected seeing him from Mr. Butt's house for a considerable time; some other person had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070037"></xptr>the habit of coming from Mr. Butt lately. He said, that person had gone away, and had gone to reside at Mr. Marling's, a goldsmith, in the Strand; and that now he lived with Mr. Butt, and had done so for two years. He took the bill of parcels and went away.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know him. On the 15th of February did he live with you - A. No, he has not lived with me for these last three years. On the 15th of February last, I did not send him to Mr. Phipps, nor did he bring any things to my house for the last three years. He has no concerns with me in business. He was not authorised by me on the 15th of February to get any snuff-boxes from Messrs. Phipps and Robinson.</p>

On the 25th of last month I was returning home, I turned up a court between twelve and one, for the purpose of making water; as soon as I got into the court I saw the prisoner coming up the court, I thought it indecent of me standing there making water, the woman could not pass me without rubbing against me, I went higher up the court where it is wide, the prisoner ran after me, she got me round my waist and wished me to go along with her, I told her I would not; she still kept on wishing me to go with her, I resisted; she at last said, give me two or three halfpence. I gave her a few halfpence, she then left me and went down the court again. The watchman met me in the court and asked me if I had lost any thing? I clapped my hand to my fob and found my watch was gone. I gave charge of the prisoner to the watchman, he took her to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was going round at half past twelve, I was going up Half Moon-passage, Aldersgate-street, I met the prisoner; knowing of her before I stopped her in the passage, I asked her what she had been after? she said she had been after something. I stopped her till I saw the gentleman, I asked him if he had lost any thing? he clapped his hand to his fob, and said he had lost his watch. I took her to the watch-house. The constable has got the watch.</p>

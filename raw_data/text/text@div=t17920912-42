I called the prisoner, and asked him how he came to put the turnings in the melting-pot with the dollars; had he ever done so before: he said at first that I had ordered him to do so, and afterwards that his mind was so disordered, that he did not know what he did; I did not suffer him to go out; I was then called to dinner, and not suspecting the man, I sent up his dinner from my own table. I returned to him in about ten minutes, to melt the other two quantities; it might require an hour and an half; I staid with him till the whole was melted. We have three garrets all in one passage; he went to the extremity; I directed him, after pouring off the last, to bring them to the scale to be weighed; he brought it forward; I weighed, and found a deficiency; he was then below stairs; on his return I told him of the deficiency; the prisoner said he could not give any account of it. I sent two of my men below stairs to search. I went down and found under some tiles, four and twenty new dollars. I brought them up stairs; I asked the prisoner how he came to be such a rascal: he said it was the first time; he had never done so before. I believe the dollars were mine; and the turnings were put in to supply their deficiency. There is no particular mark to them. When before the alderman, he said he hoped the gentleman would be merciful. When we first put the coin into the melting-pot, it will not hold so much as when it is in the state of fusion. The turnings might, when the pot was in a state of fusion, have been thrust down. I had sent the prisoner to Mr. Binns that day; he had lived with me three months; he brought from thence 350 oz. of dollars.</p>

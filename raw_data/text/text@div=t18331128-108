            , Jun. Defence (written). I left my situation through the cook's beating me, and turning me out of the house; I went home to my mother, who returned with me, and insisted on my staying until my mistress came home, when it was agreed I should leave as soon as my week was expired, which I did. My mother came for me on Saturday evening, November the 2nd. The cook and my mistress were both in the kitchen. I fetched my box, and my mother emptied it before them, and they said there was nothing there belonging to them. My mistress asked the cook if the spoons were all right, she said they were. My mistress paid me, and I went home. On the following Tuesday, November the 5th, a policeman came and said Mrs. Mc Lellan wished to speak with me. I went with him immediately; when she charged me with stealing a table-spoon, which I knew nothing about. I was then taken to Hatton-garden, and remanded until Friday, the 8th instant, when I was re-examined and discharged. The next night the policeman came to my mother's lodgings and asked her to let him see her duplicates, which he had seen before, when he kept two of them. They were two pocket handkerchiefs which Mrs. Mc Lellan said I had stolen, and my mother received, which I deny. One of them I pledged in the afternoon of the day that I went to Mrs. Mc Lellan's, after ten o'clock at night, on Saturday, July the 20th; nor did I see my mother for a week afterwards. After I had been at Mrs. McLellan's some little time, my mistress sent me on several occasions both to pledge and to redeem pledges for her. The servant who turned me out of doors sometimes gets tipsey, and there is a man also sleeps in the kitchen where the spoons were kept. My mother never came to see me except when my mistress was made acquainted with it.</p>

               <p>MRS. McLELLAN. I once sent her to pawn a pair of spoons in October; I lost a great many things while she was in the house.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 13th of May I went out about ten at night, and returned in half an hour; I found the window up one-pair-of-stairs broke, and I heard somebody run up the other stairs; I ran out, called in some of my neighbours, searched the house, and missed the breeches and buckles out of a drawer. The prisoner is a soldier; I suspected him because he had robbed me before. I went to the king's guard at St. James's, and charged him with the robbery; he denied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180030"></xptr> it; a woman who heard me, came up, aid he had offered a pair of buckles just before; then I again charged him with it, and he delivered me the buckles.</p>

I was by when the prisoner was charged with the robbery; I did not see him give the prosecutrix the buckles, but as soon as she had them she gave them to me; the prisoner desired me to go to his mother, and tell her to bring the breeches next day to the Halfway house, that the prosecutrix might have them.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of police. - A. Yes; on Saturday the 19th of December I was going up Noble-street, near Wood-street in the city, about ten minutes after nine; I met the prisoner and two others with him, he had this bundle on his shoulder I crossed over, followed him, and catched hold of his collar, I asked him what he had got there; he instantly threw it off his shoulder; I laid hold of him, he attempted to run; in struggling to get away he tore his shirt. I secured him with my right hand, a scuffle ensued, I pulled of one side and he of the other; he tried to put his hand in his pocket, and when I found that I struck him once or twice with my fist; I afterwards examined his pocket, I found this knife; the other two escaped. I took him to the Bell public house and secured him; he told me he came honestly by it. This is the bill of parcels, and this is the carman's note.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what account did you take him. - A. I knew the persons that were with him; I never saw the prisoner before that morning.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down the street a man came up to me and asked me if I would carry the parcel for him; he gave me half a crown. I carry things for any body.</p>

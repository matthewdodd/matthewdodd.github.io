On the 11th of January I drew my pension, and went to the Coach and Horses, at the corner of King David-lane; the prisoner came in there - I went home with her, and asked her what I should give her; she said 3s., which I gave her out of my pocket - I had then a sovereign and two sixpences left in my pocket-book in my jacket pocket - I had seen them about twenty minutes before; when I had been with her about fifteen minutes, she said she had a gown in pawn, and she would go and get it while she had the money - she went out, and did not return for two hours; I had then missed my money - I gave charge of her; my sovereign was a bright one.</p>

I have got 10s. left, and I will give you half of it;" I went to a house she described, but could not find the 10s. - my brother officer said he had seen four half-crowns in her hand.</p>

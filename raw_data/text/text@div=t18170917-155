            . I belong to the Custom-house. I went to the fire and brought several of the things out of the three pair of stairs, and took them to Mr. North's, just by; I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Plumpton's door(I did not see him within the door), with a bundle under his arm, I watched him past Mr. North's door - He went into the crowd - I went after him and laid hold of him and took it from him; I asked him where he was going with the things, he either said he was going to take care of them, or going to take them home; I brought him back, with the officer's assistance, and took him to Mr. North's. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRANSCOMB. I am an officer. I was at the fire between eight and nine o'clock, keeping the crowd back; I saw the last witness and the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, he endeavoured to get among the crowd; I laid hold of him - He said he was not going to keep them, but was going to take them to some place, I do not exactly recollect; there was an open space for the things to go through the market, where every thing that was saved was taken; the prisoner was passing among the thickest of the crowd, quite away from the place mentioned, to convey the property away. I took him to the Compter, with great difficulty, he made a great resistance. I took him about fifteen yards from the fire - He said he lived on Saffron-hill, but would not say where there.</p>

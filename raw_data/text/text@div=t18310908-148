            . I am a scale-maker, and live in Smithfield. On the 28th of August, about five o'clock, I saw the prosecutor asleep in the pens; he then had his hat and shoes on - I saw both the prisoners there about five minutes after; they came up to him, from West-street, and took off his shoes and hat: then one of their companions who is not in custody, took the hat and shoes down West-street - they went away, came back again in about five minutes to try his pockets; I saw them take a white parcel, which appeared a shirt, from his coat pocket - they then went away; I went next door to my brother-in-law to inform him - and soon after they returned a third time; one of the prisoners laid down by the prosecutor's side, and rifled his pockets - I pointed them out to my brother-in-law; he went and they were secured - the third person was only with them the first time.</p>

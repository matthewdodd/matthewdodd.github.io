On the 8th of May I came down stairs at half-past six o'clock in the morning—I did not open my back-door till seven o'clock—I then found a ladder, which I knew must have been taken from the yard of my next-door neighbour—it was against the wall on the left-hand side, on turning round to the right, I saw a heavy iron grating, two feet square, had been turned over, and on it was lying the bottom of my cruet-stand—I went up stairs, and found my cruet-stand was taken from the cheffionier, in a parlour up one pair of stairs—they must have torn up the iron grating, passed through the cellar, up the kitchen-stairs, and up the half-flight of stairs into the parlour—it must have required a strong pull to get the grating out—I immediately proceeded to the station-house, desiring the people at home not to disturb any thing—the policeman afterwards came—I missed a pair</p>

                  </hi>I am an inspector of police. I apprehended the prisoner at the White Horse public-house, Saffron-hill, at half-past eight o'clock, on the evening of the 13th of May—I had heard of this robbery, and seeing him with a hat on his head answering the description, I took him to the station-house, I found two magnifying-glasses on him, and this tin<lb></lb>der-box with the matches in it—I asked him how he came by the hat—he said it was his own, and he had bought it at a pawnbroker's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was tipsy at the time. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was not tipsy—I asked where he bought it, he said in Long-lane, and afterwards of a tall man in a blue-coat—I asked him where he got the glasses from—he said from a person named Webb, a thief, who was transported last Sessions—I found this box on his person—he did not say how he got that—Mr. Jones, in his presence at Hatton-garden, described that he knew the hat by a loop he had tied in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I bought the hat of a Jew; I was very tipsy on the 1st of May, going out dancing with the chimney-sweeps, and bought the hat; the magnifying-glasses I have had two or three months; Webb was transported the Sessions before last.</p>

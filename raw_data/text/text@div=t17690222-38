I got a porter and sent him for it, and waited for his coming back; before he came back the prisoner took two of my silk handkerchiefs, and more things, and went out at the back door. The porter came back and said the prisoner had no trunk there; and then I went and searched at the pawnbrokers, and found them at

            . These handkerchiefs were pawned to me on the 12th of January, 1768.</p>
               <p>Risk. I thought it was the 10th; but they were taken from me the very day they were pledged, for Mr. Popard said the man had not been gone above ten minutes. I described the prisoner and his dress, and Mr. Popard said it must be the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Popard. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Popard. I live in Queen-street, Tower-hill. It is so long ago that I cannot positively swear to the prisoner, but I believe he is the man: he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220025"></xptr> much better dressed then than now. He was a tall man, about the size of the prisoner. He came in the name of

               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner and I were together at the Scotch-Arms, between ten and eleven o'clock, and I searched several pawnbrokers before I came to Mr. Popard's; when I came to Mr. Popard's, it might be about half an hour after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoner and you alone at the Scotch-Arms?</p>

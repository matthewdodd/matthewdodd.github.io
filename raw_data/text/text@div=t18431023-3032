                  </hi>. I live with my father, Gabriel Hards, a fruit-salesman in Covent-garden market, and live in Basing-place, Lambeth. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of Oct. I was attending to my father's stall—Slaymaker was employed in the next stall—there was a sieve of damsons partly on my father's stall, and partly on the next—Slay<lb></lb>maker came and took up the sieve—Green was at our stall at the time, and I was at the stand outside the shop—Slaymaker put the sieve on his head, went towards Bow-street, and told Green if any one wanted him he should he back in ten minutes—I told Green I did not believe that sieve of damsons belonged to Bedell, which is the name Slaymaker goes by in the market—Green said, "O yes, it does, we have no damsons on that side"—I know we had damsons on that side—my father had permission to place his on that side—I have seen Green emptying them from there, by my father's desire—in a quarter of an hour Slaymaker returned—I asked him if he had not made a mistake in taking that sieve of damsons, as I had noticed that German sieve standing there for some time, and thought it was my father's—he said, "No, they were not, and as for German sieves, I can show you half a score down in the cellar"—the damsons are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—Weaver's stall was shut up at the time, and no business going on—the shutters were closed.</p>

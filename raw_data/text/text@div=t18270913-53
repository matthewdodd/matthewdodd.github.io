               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Hodges to induce him to say anything? A. No; on taking him from the watch-house to the office, he said the hair found in his breast he had taken from his master's kitchen.</p>

I saw Lumbley and Wheatley do it at the kitchen stairs - they took 1lb. or 11/2lb. I saw Todd and Hodges take some about a week before.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you now in the prosecutor's employ? A. I left once because I got more wages.

               <p>Q. Do you know whether his lodgings were broke open at any time? - I do not; the things lost were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What day were these things missing? - The 19th of July last; they were in a box; I missed them about half after four o'clock in the morning; it was light. I went to lodge at Mr. Simmon's the 17th, that man came to sleep with me the same night, and he helped me to carry my box up stairs that same night, and we went to bed together that same night. On Sunday morning I got up and cleaned myself; the 17th was on a Saturday; on Sunday morning the man was very desirous to look into my box, as I sat up in my bed; I had a pair of buckles in my shoes, and he asked me if they were not silver? I told him they were not, they were a pair of my own making; he said, if I had not told him he should have thought they were silver. I came home that night and found he had been to bed from about eight o'clock; when I awaked the next morning at half after four, I turned about and found he was gone, and I looked under my pillow to see what o'clock it was, and I missed my watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170130"></xptr>from under my head; it had a chain and seal to it; and I looked at my box, and I found all my things were gone out; I lost all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your things again? - Yes, the coat I found on him, and the watch he owned to; I found a pair of gloves in the pocket of the coat, and them I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dowers. Had you known the prisoner before this time? - I never see him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Leary? - Yes, Leary was a lodger in old Round-court, in the Strand, at one Mr. Goodwin's.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour coat was it you lost? - A brown striped, elastic cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. It was near four months before you see it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with it? - I asked him if that was not my coat that he had on his back? - He said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. And he then went with you very voluntarily to Bow-street? - No; one of the officers took him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived before the magistrate, you was not so clear about the articles in the indictment as you appear to be now? - Yes; I swore to the coat.</p>

            Did not he say that he bought the coat? - Yes, he said he bought the coat in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you get an officer? - About half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go with you to the officer? - No, I brought the officer to him, and he was conveyed down to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he owned to having stolen the watch? - Yes, he did, in the presence of the officer of Bow-street, and my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, I ask you this question, did the officer or you tell him if he would confess it would be better for him, and they would endeavour to interest the magistrate to send him to sea? - I never spoke a word about it to him; he never denied the watch, only the coat. After that, going to the office, he consessed that he had pawned the watch; and in the coach, going down to Clerkenwell Prison, he confessed that he pawned it at Mr. Bechum's, in Holborn.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in the presence of the prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there? - The boy's master came down to me, and told me that he had got the person that stole his apprentice's things.</p>
               <p>Q. On his way to Bow-street, or in any conversation at Bow-street, was he told that if he confessed to taking the watch and coat, that you would endeavour to prevail on the magistrate to let him got to sea? - Mr. Steward put that question, and after he said he had pawned the watch and lost the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Page. This is my coat, I know it by a particular mark, one of the skirts has two slits in the slap; I put it in my box the over night, before I lost it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170131"></xptr>Mr. Dowers. The coat has been lost near four months; how long have you had it before that? - About six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat is worn since, I suppose? - Yes, very much; I can swear positively to the coat, it is a very remarkable coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the box left open or locked? - I had left it locked, I found it unlocked; it is a box that the lid falls down on the top, and when I awaked in the morning, I found the lid had fallen in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who said, he was a shoe-maker, and gave him a character.</p>

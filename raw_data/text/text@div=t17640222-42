I asked him where he would land? He said, Any where over the water. This was in the evening, about five o'clock, about five weeks ago. As I was rowing him over the water,

The day before last sessions began, there were sixty-three casks, and a cake of bees-wax; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220028"></xptr> had landed them all, and carried them all up into the cart but nine. After I came back from carrying the bees-wax, I saw but eight casks of butter.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distance was the cart to where the butter was landed.</p>
               <p>Taylor. It might be about 200 yards. When I came to the wharf, I saw a cask of butter lying in this waterman's boat, and the prisoner sitting by it: I called to the waterman, and said, that butter belongs to me, and ordered him to bring it back, which he did. The prisoner said, it is not yours, Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He had worked with me several times, but he had not worked for me that day. I got in a boat and met him, and saw S. B. marked on the firkin when we came on shore. While I was taking care of the prisoner, the firkin was thrown to the other eight; then I found nine again; so I can't swear which firkin it was; but I am sure it was one of them.</p>

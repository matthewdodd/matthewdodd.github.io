I am a watchman in Marybone parish; after I had called one o'clock on Wednesday morning, I got into my box the corner of Cavendish-square; I heard some talk, I sat still; as soon as the prisoner and another came to my box, I pushed out, and asked him what he had in his sack; he said he had been at his mother's, and had got his own things; (he is a <rs id="t17670909-78-deflabel468" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

He said to the woman several times,</p>
               <p>"You d - d h - h, give me the knife;" but I think he tore it off. I had 10 s. in that pocket at first, but a soldier put his hand into my pocket before that, and took some money out - I felt and found I had some money left. I felt, a half-crown there after the soldier robbed me. I fell asleep in the public-house, and they were in my company all the time. I had been at work with the man, at Lewis, near Maidstone. I counted my money before them, when I awoke; there was then three half-crowns, and 2 s. 6 d. in silver. They went away when they robbed me, leaving me crying Murder. The watchman brought them back.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming up Eceleston-street, at twelve o'clock, at the corner by the Five-fields, and heard a terrible scream of Murder - I went towards the sound, and met the prisoners coming along, stopped them, and asked what was the matter - the man said there was nothing the matter with him; I insisted upon his stopping, and going to the man who was knocked down; he ran away, but I caught him, and took them to the prosecutor, who gave them in charge. The man was rather in liquor - I found the prosecutor's pocket on him, with a half-crown and 4 s. 10 d.; he said he had taken nothing more than that.</p>

            'S Defence. I knew the prosecutor by working with him - we agreed to come to town, and in the road he fell down and fainted. I fell in with him a few days after, and we were drinking all day; he was locked out, and was going home with us, and fell down at different times, and pressed me to take his money, to take care of; we were both drunk. The last time he fell down, I put my hand to his pocket, which hung by two or three threads, and it came off. The watchman came up - I said I had not the money, not wishing to give it to him, and at the watch-house I said I took it, but not with intent to rob.</p>

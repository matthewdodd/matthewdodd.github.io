               <p>Q.(To Mr. Clarke.) Were these coats your sole property? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Hunter. On Monday the 21st of September, about half past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Clarke's house; in a very short time she came out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160075"></xptr>again, apparently in very great haste, with a large bundle under her left arm; as I was going out at the door, I thought I saw the colour of one of Mr. Clarke's great-coats, accordingly I followed her out of the gateway, and overtook her at the corner of New London-street; I said to her, you have got some of Mr. Clarke's coats there; her answer was, I do not know Mr. Clarke, they are not his coats; I said, you shall go back again, and I will see whether they are Mr. Clarke's coats or no; I then took her back; Mr. Clarke met us in the yard, and then she dropped the coats; there were four of them; she then begged Mr. Clarke to forgive her, for they were his property; I immediately got a constable, and Mr. Clarke gave charge of her. (The constable produced the property, which was identified by Mr. Clarke).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Crutched-sriars, and a man asked me, if I knew of a porter that would carry that parcel for him to Smithfield; I told him, I did not, I was a poor widow woman, and should be glad to earn a shilling myself if it was not too large, he gave me these coats to carry, he said he would be there as soon as me.</p>

On the 2d of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I fell in with a strange man coming over Blackfriar's-bridge into Bridge-street; he came up, and asked if I was going far; I said I lived at Hoxton - he said he was going that way, and walked with me as far as Fleet-market - and just by a soup shop there, he met the prisoners and shook hands with them both. Greenwood proposed that we should go in and have some soup; we all went in and had some; they were all strangers to me. Greenwood proposed to toss for two basons - we tossed and I lost: I had been drinking, but was sober; I took half a crown out of my purse and paid for the soup - Greenwood took the half-crown, and gave me the change; he then said he lived at Hoxton New-town, and would walk with me - we went on together arm-in-arm; Dunkley followed behind. When we got to Smithfield, Greenwood asked me if I thought my money was safe; I said I thought it was - Dunkley was close behind us. We went on as far as Beech-street, and Greenwood pressed me very much again to look at my money; he said the other prisoner was going Finsbury-square way, and that we were both going to Hoxton New-town - he said he lived there: he wished me very much to look at my money in <placeName id="t18280410-66-crimeloc375">Beech-street</placeName>

Greenwood snatched the purse out of my hand; Dunkley stood right before me on the left; Greenwood snatched the purse, and took the half-sovereign out - I said, "You have got the half-sovereign?" - he said, "Oh! it is all right; let me look if the silver is right" - I then gave him the silver into his hand; Dunkley said something to him, and Greenwood directly ran up Golden-lane with my money - I followed him, crying Stop thief! I do not know what became of Dunkley; I followed Greenwood; the watchman sprang his rattle; he turned and came into Beech-street; two gentlemen knocked him down on the pavement - I held him until the watchman took him; I do not know whether Dunkley ran away, or whether he had any of the money. He took Greenwood to Gripplegate watch-house; he said a friend outside would tell how every thing happened. Dunkley then came in, and I said he was the man who was with him - I gave him in charge; I was quite sober - I am a Welchman.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 2d of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I proceeded to the spot, and saw Greenwood with others running towards Golden-lane; I sprang my rattle, pursued and overtook him about a hundred yards off; I found Greenwood and Jones on the ground and took charge of him: Dunkley might be in the crowd; I saw Greenwood running - Jones appeared perfectly to know what he was about.</p>

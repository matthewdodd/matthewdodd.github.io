               <p>Candy. I was going home between One and Two in the Morning, in the Month of May, the 9th Day of the Month. - I live in a Habitation in <placeName id="t17390607-9-crimeloc43">Flying-Horse Court</placeName>

When I came up to him, he said, - I'faith I have name of your Hat No, says I, - but, I will carry you to the Place where you dropp'd it. That's the Man at the Bar, - for I never saw the Face of him till the Chairman took hold of his Wrist, and turn'd him about; then we carry'd him to the Watch-house, and asked him where he lodged? He told us in Rosemary-Lane. I asked him where he was going at that Time o'Night? He said, - to see a Friend at St. James's: I reply'd, - He was likely to have more Halberds than Links to attend him. - All the whole Thing was done in three Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask him, whether he had any Debate with any other Person, before he came out of the Alley?</p>
               <p>Candy. I was not in the Court, - but in the Passage; and I saw no one Soul living, till finding my Hat go off, I struck at him by Guess, and if I had hit him, he would not have been here, for I should have pay'd him heartily, and so have dismis'd him.</p>

            . I was standing at the Temple Exchange Coffeehouse with my Chair, and hearing Candy cry, - Stop Thief, and seeing the Prisoner run, I clapp'd hold of his Wrist, and Candy said, - Let's lead him back, for he has dropp'd my Hat; I carry'd him five, six or seven Yards back, and found the Hat in the Kennel: Then I carry'd the Prisoner and the Hat to the Watch-house, and deliver'd the Hat to the Constable, or the Watchman, I don't know which, I am sure the Prisoner is the Man I took; for I had the Watchman's Lanthorn, and my own, to see him by, - and I was with him at the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask him, whether the Prosecutor was drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Couster. I can't say for that I was at Charing-Cross a little while before, and saw him ( Candy ) at the Fountain Tavern, and he was talking about having a Chair, and my Partner said, - Candy don't want a Chair, and in about half an Hour afterwards he came homewards. He said no more that Night, than he said in the Morning, nor was he so disorder'd, as to be incaple of knowing what he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not the Deputy-Constable tell him he was a drunken, troublesome Fellow?</p>
               <p>Causter. There was a Dispute in the Watch-house, and a great many People crowded about, so that I could not tell positively what the Constable said.</p>

            , Constable. The Prisoner was brought to the Watch-house, and Candy charg'd him with taking his Hat. I was not there when he was first brought in, but Candy (I found)<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070009"></xptr> charged him with taking his Hat, so I sent him to Bridewell, and afterward carry'd him before a Justice. This is the Hat; I have had it ever since in my Custody. Candy had been drinking, but was not so fuddled as not to know a Man. He told me, he had been serving Copies of Writs; he walk'd as well as at other Times, but he is but a lame Walker at best.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who is your Deputy-Constable?</p>

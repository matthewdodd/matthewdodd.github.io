            . My Lord, on the 24th of October I sent my Man out with Bread, one Half-Peck, 11 Quarterns, five Thee-Penny and two Two-Penny Loaves. About One o'Clock my Man comes Home, and told me that he had lost his Basket and Bread, but, says he, I have found the Thief; and I went into Duke's-Place, where the Prisoner was, and he said that he had bought the Basket and Bread for 18 d. and that he bought them of one in the Street; but after that he said, if I would not prosecute, he would give me what Money he had sold them for.</p>

            . I met with a Friend and went to drink a Pot of Beer, and left my Basket of Bread upon a Bulk in the Street, and I miss'd it in a very little Time; and as I knew Duke's-Place is a Place where they often sell Bread, I went down into Duke's-Place, and I found it upon him there, and I took him up, and charged a Constable with him; and then I came home for my Master.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Duke's Place is a common Market for Bread; and I saw him there, and said to him, what shall I give you for this Bread? There were four Quarterns, Three-penny and Two-penny Loaves. He said 20 d. but afterwards he took 18 d. for Basket and Bread, and I sold the Quarterns for Three-pence a Piece, and the Three-penny Loaves for five Farthings a Piece.</p>

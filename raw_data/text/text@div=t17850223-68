               <p>What quantity of wine had you lost? - I cannot tell exactly, I believe I can swear to twenty dozen, and if I was to double that number, I should not exceed the truth, they have acknowledged to twenty dozen; I kept the other servant in the house, thinking I should get something from her the next day; on the day before the Twelfth day, between the time of her being discharged, I lost a gold ring, and the things mentioned in the indictment; they were found at the father's of the prisoner, in Flying Horse-yard, Hackney; I never searched till three or four days, or five or six days.</p>

I found this glove, that I cannot swear to, I believe it is mine, it was a silk glove, in a closet; and in a box up stairs I found about twenty or thirty pounds weight of the same kind of candles hid in a closet; I went up stairs with the officer, and in the closet, I found several bottles with my mark upon them with wine; the only thing I can swear to.</p>
               <p>(The bottles produced.)</p>
               <p>Is that your mark? - No, it was in my cellar, it was a present, and I can swear to this bottle, it has he mark of Mrs. King.</p>

               <p>Did you ever hear from the prisoner that that was her father's house? - No.</p>

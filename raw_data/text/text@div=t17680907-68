On the 24th of July about three in the afternoon, I heard a rattle of the carriage; I looked out at my window and saw Gouge unhook the fore chain; he went away and came again; Cox was in the carriage; they began to beat the other chain with a stone or a bone, they broke two or three stones at it; then one said to the other, here, d - n you, pull; they both pulled hard at it, it broke off, and they both fell in the kennel; then they put it to again, and said it will do till dark, then it was half an hour past six; they went away, and came again about half an hour past seven, and began to unhook the chain from the carriage; Gouge wound up one chain round his arm; then I called to Mr. Hunsdon, he got up upon the wall; the boy dropped the chain and they both ran away; Hunsdon jumped off the wall and ran and brought them back.</p>

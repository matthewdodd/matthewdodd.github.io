On the twenty-ninth Mr. Seddon's man came with a hand bill; I saw the chests described; I sent the boy up stairs and brought them down to the man; he looked at them, and said, they were his master's; one of the clerks came and owned the chest; I described the man; Mr. Seddon desired me to go among his men on the next morning, and see if I saw the man; I went, but did not see him there; I heard no more of it till he was taken up.

I have known him five or six years; I have bought goods of him; having bought this glass. Mr. Seddon's man came one day, and afted if we had bought any tea chests of one Edwards; my partner said not; I thought the glasses might he stole; I went to Mr. Seddon's, and shewed him the glass, one of the clerks went up in the shop, and the man acknowledged the work to be theirs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seddon. I know this to be mine.</p>
               <p>- Hitchcock.

I am a workman under Mr. Seddon, Mr. Russell came into the shop and brought a looking glass, and the clerk accompanied him, and asked me if I had got the back of it; there were particular marks in it that I knew it to be my own workmanship; and several afterwards were so done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I shall leave my defence to my council, but please to hear me a word or two in my defence upon this point. The goods which are now attempted to be proved to be the property of Mr. Seddon, are my own manufacturing. I lived six years ago in Baldwin's Gardens, Gray's Inn Lane. I went to an auction at Crayden, in Surry, and bought the glasses, and other goods to the value of 25 l. odd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177101160026"></xptr> money. I sent a horse and cart for the goods the ensuing day, In coming home, about half a mile on the other side of Kingston Common, the Croydon stage and the cart met together, and a discard ensued between the people that drove the carriages. The glasses were all broke. and some of the goods injured before they came home. I made the best I could of them. I got new glasses for the frames. Some time after that, I moved into George-street, Southwark; there I continued some years in business. While I was there, Mr. Broker, a sugar-baker in Hog-lane, St. Giles's, informed me that he had got some sugar-chests to sell, that brought sugar from the Havannah, which is the wood these glass are made of. After that I went to live in Peter's-street, Soho, and there the bargain was made for this Havannah chest wood, commonly called Havannah sugarwood, Some were large, some small. In order to make these frames come cheap, I worked some time at it, till I could go no farther on account of want of necessaries. I wrote to a friend that supplied me with money (I shall call him.) I did not finish these frames; I went on with them; now and then; sometimes I made a table, or two or three; I went on, in order to support my family, at other times at nights, when my work was done. It was about November last was twelve months that I came into this Peter's-street, Soho. It was in August; I worked there some time, and made tables, and such things, which I sold to these gentlemen in Moorfields. A little time after that, I think about the month of August, it was one day of August last, I thought I would go and work journey-work. I went to Mr. Lewis in Baldwin's Gardens, to ask for work. He told me, if I could make such and such tables, which brother of mine did that is deceased; if I could make some of that kind of new tables, he would employ me. I went, and was them five weeks. I was inclined to go to table-working entirely. I went to Mr. Seddon's, being a gentleman that does a great deal of business. He told me he would employ me in table-making. I worked there three months successively. About two months ago, I had the ague. I acquainted my master with it. I had not been at work four or five days. He came to my bench, and spoke to me; he asked me the matter; I said, I have the ague. He said, You must get d - d drunk for it. One day I could work, another I could not. I thought I would sell these glasses I had so long by me, and finish these frances, which I did, made out of this Havannah wood, and sold them one by one, two was the most I sold together: If these glasses had been feloniously stolen, I should not have publickly sold them as I did, I employed myself with making up these glasses in this interval of time: the knife case I have been three years and nine months about: the furniture upon it I had from Birmingham, because, when in trade for myself, I had all my brass cabinet furniture from Birmingham: as to the wood in these mahogany frames, I hope the gentlemen of the jury will be acquainted with the nature of the wood; a baker might as well swear, with as much propriety, to a loaf cut one from the other, as a man swear that is his property: it is all straight grain. A carpenter might as well swear to a deal board, as there is no variety in it, as swear to that.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Seddon. Did you not say this was your own writing upon the cover?</p>
               <p>Seddon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fall. There was the same mark upon the case as there is upon the cover. I put my mark over it.</p>

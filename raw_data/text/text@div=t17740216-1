(They are produced and deposed to by the prosecutor). There is one thing very particular; there were three remnants of different colours, two blues I think, but different in point of shade, and there was likewise a pink coloured remnant; they were that day all three on one block; I am very sure they were in the shop; I had seen them just before in the window.

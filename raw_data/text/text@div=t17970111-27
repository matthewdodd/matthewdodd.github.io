            , and a shilling by another person; when I came home, there were only seven shillings and sixpence in the till; I got a constable, and the person that marked the money, Mr. Garner, and took him into the counting-house; I told him I wanted to see what silver he had in his pocket; he pulled out fifty-three shillings in silver from his waistcoat pocket; upon examining that silver, I found a half-crown and three shillings marked with Mr. Garner's mark upon them; we asked him how he came by that silver; he said, it was all his own; Mr. Garner said, he would swear to the marks on the three shillings and half-crown; in consequence of that I sent him to the Compter; the half-crown and three shillings are in the possession of the constable, Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Mr. Garner marked this money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him mark it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a mark was it? - A. A kind of a half moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such a kind of mark as you could swear to? - A. Yes; I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You left four sixpences in the till? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And found seven shillings and sixpence only? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you suppose was gone? - A. Five or six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you suppose five of six shillings? - A. There was one shilling laid out by a person we saw come out.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I asked Mrs. Tilt; there might be more laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you missed five or six shillings? - A. There were thirteen, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You found in his pocket half-a-crown and three shillings? - A. Yes, of marked money, out of fifty-three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for the shopman to give change in the shop? - A. It is not usual; he has sometimes done it.</p>
               <p>Q. He has lent money to the till, and taken money from it? - A. I don't remember more than half-a dozen times in the three years he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He takes money when you are out? - A. I am generally at home, except when I am on a journey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever occasion to apply to you to advance money for him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever left money in you hands? - A. Yes, his wages; if he had been with me to the end of the year, I should have owed him twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this man when he came to you? - A. He had been a bankrupt, and was very strongly recommended to me, he had been a jeweller, I wondered how he could live on my service as he did; I asked him if he had any other resources; he said he did not know that he had; he spent, I suppose, an hundred pounds a year more than I allowed him, that led me to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he took change from the till, did he ask your leave? - A. He had no business with the till.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You found no gold in the till in lieu of the silver? - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. Amongst that were there any pieces of money that Mr. Tilt claimed? - A. There were three shillings and three half-crowns, which were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them? - A. Yes, and five guineas in gold besides; he said, that none of the money that he laid on the table was Mr. Tilt's.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A. About nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Now produce that marked money that was taken out by Mr. Tilt. (Produces it).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did Mr. Tilt come to you upon the 7th of January? - A. Yes; and I marked some money for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you mark for him? - A. Two half-crowns, some shillings, and some sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Look over that money, and see if you can find any pieces of money that you marked for him at that time? - A. Here are three shillings, and half-a-crown, that I marked for Mr. Tilt on the 7th of January, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark is it? - A. A sort of a half circle, marked with a punch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Tilt.) Q. Look at this, and tell us if this is the money Mr. Garner marked for you? - A. They are all the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Mr. Garner.) Q. You speak of the mark, there are two half-crowns besides in that packet, you know nothing of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the marks that were put on, they were put on by a common tool? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is hardly a question one can ask you, whether it is a common thing to have a piece of coin so marked? - A. I never saw any so marked; this is a punch of my own making, and I don't think there is another like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the use of that particular punch? - A. It is used in watch work, and part of it is broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there nobody else in that line of business that used such a punch? - A. I don't know that they ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not likely that other persons may have used the same sort of tool? - A. They may certainly. (Produces the punch).</p>

               <p>Q. What passed between him and you at the Compter? - A. He told me that he and his master had some mistake in reckoning of about four or five shillings, and he wished me to say that he had given it to me as a part of my wages; I told him that I could not think of doing any such thing; I told him, I thought I might be brought upon my oath upon it, and I might forswear myself an hundred times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I shall leave it to my Counsel; except observing, that I had free egress and regress to the till; and that I used to lend money occasionally out of my pocket to the till.</p>

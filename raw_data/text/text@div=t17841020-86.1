               <p>I am a shoe-maker, the prisoner came to me, I made him thoes when he lived at Mr. Whateley's, who is a silk mercer in St. Martin's-court; he called on me about a fortnight ago, and after giving some necessary orders for shoes, he had a bundle under his arm, tied in a handkerchief, which was this petticoat; he told me he had sold a petticoat to an acquaintance of his at Mr. Bennett's, for sixteen-shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How came that conversation? - He said, his master had sold it to a customer, who said it was damaged, and his mistress would not take the petticoat back from the customer, but stopped it out of his wages; and he said, he would lose two shillings by it, if he could get a customer for it, if not he would send it down in the country to his mother; then I called my wife down, and she said fourteen shillings was more than it was worth, but if I had a mind to have it I might, and I agreed for fourteen shillings; the prisoner came a few days after, and had a pair of shoes, and I ballanced accounts with him, and there were four shillings coming to me, allowing fourteen shillings for the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure that is the petticoat? - Yes, I never had it out of my possession, I wrote my name upon it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any ticket upon it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Then you understood from the prisoner, that there was a considerable bickering him and a part of his master's family? - I understand he disliked his mistress, for he told me, she was a devil to live with.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. Is the taylor here? - No.</p>

               <p>Court. Then we cannot hear what passed between you and the taylor? - I shewed the pattern to my master, and he thought it was his sattin.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing about the things? - No, he asked me on Sunday if I wanted a petticoat, he owed me some money for washing, I told him it would be of no service to me, as I was a hard working woman.</p>

               <p>I am a workwoman to the prosecutor, I produce this mode, and one russel petticoat; the prisoner brought the mode to me on Thursday or Friday se'night last, about nine at night; I do not live in the house, he asked me to be kind enough to put that mode by for him, till he called again, he said, he had bought it at a particular shop, I do not remember what shop he mentioned; he brought the russel petticoat to me on the Sunday following, which was last Sunday was se'nnight; he desired me to lay that by the mode.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. At this time he knew you worked for Mr. Bennet; I suppose you are frequently intrusted with Mr. Bennets's property? - Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Of course you observed his shop marks? I never observed any shop marks, I work for a great many shops.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did he ever bring any parcels to you? - Never, he never was in my room before he brought the mode.</p>
               <p>Court. What may be the value of this russel petticoat? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of the mode? - I do not know what it measures, nor nothing; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Look at these different things, begin with the russel petticoat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know them by any marks, describe the marks? - It is marked S. I. B.</p>
               <p>Is that mark in your hand writing? - My apprentice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the other marked? - No.</p>
               <p>Is there any appearance of a mark being pulled off from the other? - I do not see any.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. Look if that mark S. I. B. is your writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200134"></xptr>Can you say that that is your master's petticoat? - I cannot positively swear to the petticoat, but I can swear it is my mark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. How long ago is that? - I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>It may be a year? - No, not above three months.</p>
               <p>Have you ever lived in any other shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When you sell them, do you sell them with the marks on? - We always pull the marks off.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other petticoat? - I cannot swear to it, there is no other mark than the mark of one of the witnesses names.</p>
               <p>Is there any appearance of a mark being picked out? - I do not see any.</p>
               <p>You say you always take out the marks before you sell them? - We generally do.</p>
               <p>You can only speak to your own practice? - I have seen my master and mistress take it off.</p>
               <p>But you cannot swear that they always do? - No, I cannot, but it is a common practice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has served customers with goods of this kind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot take upon you to say, that he always took off the marks from those goods, that he delivered to those customers? - No, I have seen it frequently done.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. The petticoat which has no mark upon it, can you ascertain that? - Yes, I believe it is my own property, we generally know our own manufactories.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you make the stuff, or that you made up the petticoat? - We generally know the work of our people.</p>
               <p>Are all your petticoats quilted in the same diamond? - Yes, of the black sort.</p>
               <p>Does not the same workwoman work for other shops? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Do you employ this workwoman all the year round? - I employ a great many all the year round.</p>
               <p>Had you sold any petticoats of that sort? - Many.</p>
               <p>Lately? - We are selling them every day.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the woollen cloak? - I will swear this is my cloak.</p>
               <p>How do you know it? - It is my own cutting out.</p>
               <p>I there any mark upon it? - There is none on it now, I have got the fellow piece of it at home.</p>
               <p>Jury. But have not you sold many of your cutting out? - Yes, to be sure, a great many.</p>
               <p>And how do you know that that is one stole, or one you have sold?</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the stuff petticoat? - There is no mark upon this, but I believe it to be my property; because there is only one man that makes stuffs in this manner which I buy them of.</p>
               <p>Why that man deals with other people besides you? - No doubt of it, a great many.</p>
               <p>Then how can you venture to swear that that is your petticoat? - Because it is sold by one man, we generally know our own work, this is made by my people.</p>
               <p>Look at the silk mode? - Here are ten ells and a half.</p>
               <p>Did you measure it before you lost it? - No, it is done up in half ells.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark on that? - No mark at all.</p>
               <p>Is all the mode in your shop done up in that quantity? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot swear that to be your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what? - I have the fellow piece, and the folds and notches are all the same.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the notches? - The scissars.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of that mode? - Fifty shillings.</p>
               <p>Is that the very lowest? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you examined the folding and the notches very accurately? - I did, before I swore to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. I suppose you look upon yourself as a pretty qualified witness, you can swear to things without marks as well as with; you undertake to swear to that russel petticoat, that the mark was picked out? - No, I supposed it had been picked out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200135"></xptr>Then you chuse to suppose upon your oath where a man's life is in question, that will be in the observation of the Jury; do you call this russel petticoat extraordinary, such as are not commonly seen? - We generally know our own manufacturing.</p>
               <p>Are they uncommon? - No.</p>
               <p>How many exactly tallying with that pattern, have you now in shop? - Many.</p>
               <p>Very many? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And how many had you in before you suspected this man? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>And yet you chuse to swear to that petticoat? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>You observe that your conduct does not escape the notice of those that are much more more impartial than the advocates for the prisoner; Why will you undertake to swear that petticoat is your property? Do you undertake to swear that from any other motive than a desire to convict that man? - No, Sir, I do not wish to convict him.</p>
               <p>Then your conduct is extremely extraordinary; however you tell me that petticoat is extremely like many that you have now, and had before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If any other petticoat of your shop, of a similar pattern to that were produced to you now, could you distinguish that from the other? - Not of the same pattern.</p>
               <p>And you have many of that pattern still in the shop? - I do not know that I have just at present.</p>
               <p>Why, you swore just this moment, that you believed you had? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now as to this cloak, there is no mark upon that? - It is my own cutting out.</p>
               <p>Do not other people cut out cloaks of that size and length for sale? - There is a difference in cutting out, every one does not cut out cloaks alike.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that more persons do not? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What can be your reason for knowing it independant of its being your own cutting out? - It is cut off the same piece of cloth I have at home.</p>
               <p>Is not that very kind of cloth made up into such cloaks? - I do not know that it is.</p>
               <p>Why do not you see of a rainy or cold morning, hundreds of women walking about in cloaks of that sort of cloth? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Since that cloak has been taken, have you measured it with the other piece of which you say it is part? - I have not.</p>
               <p>But yet you swear that comes from that very piece? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Without measuring, and without a mark, you are sure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. We are of opinion it is a common cloth for cloaks, that as he has cut out many cloaks, that may be his cutting out, and his cloth, and yet he cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Now this silk mode you chuse to swear to, that without a mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does that differ from many hundred yards of silk mode which are manufactured every year in this city? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>During the time this prisoner lived with you, what was the nature of your harmony together, were there not some bickering between him and part of your family? - Not the least in the world, I always behaved to him like a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>The nature of your behaviour here, does not shew that, my friend? - That I must leave to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master said, if I would tell him where the property was, he would freely forgive me, and not take me before a Justice.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner about five years.</p>
               <p>During that time what has been his general character for honesty? - He was my servant for about eight months, during that time, I chiefly employed him in carrying out bills of Exchange for acceptance, and receiving those bills when due.</p>
               <p>And those bills frequently of large value I suppose? - Sometimes sixty or seventy pounds, his conduct was very good indeed, I never had the least doubt of his honesty in any respect whatever.</p>
               <p>He had frequent opportunities of defrauding you, if he had the inclination? - No doubt; I likewise frequently employed him in carrying money to my bankers, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200136"></xptr> the amount of four or five hundred pounds at a time.</p>

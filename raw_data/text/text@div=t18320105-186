            . On Christmas morning I was drunk, and the Policeman put me into the watch-house; I then had seven half-crowns and four shillings - I am sure of that; I was sober enough to remember that when I was put in the cell I had the money - I fell asleep, and when I awoke I found the two prisoners by me; I believe I was put in there about half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night - I staid till about nine on Sunday morning, and when I went up I missed all my money.</p>

            , I am a Policeman. I had taken the two prisoners at eight o'clock on the Saturday night, for attempting to pick pockets - I put them into the cell, but before that I searched them minutely, and on Thomas I found two handkerchiefs, a sixpence, and 1 1/2d., and on Williams, a sixpence, a halfpenny, a farthing, and one handkerchief - this was before Gadsby was brought in there, as I understood, but I did not see him that night.</p>

I saw the prisoners brought in - they were searched, and what has been stated was found on them in my presence; I put them into the cell, and when the prosecutor was brought in, I put him into the cell - when he came out he complained of having been robbed - I called the prisoners, and searched them; I found on Thomas four half-crowns, three shillings, and this box, and on Williams three half-crowns and one shilling - I had seen the money in the prosecutor's tobacco-box the night before, but I did not count it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you not seen this box on the prisoners the night before? A. Yes - I do not know whether any of the prisoners' friends had been there; the prosecutor was not so drunk but that he knew what he was doing, or he could not have taken his money out and shown it to me.</p>
               <p>JAMES GADSBY. I believe this to be my money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you receive it? A. I had taken it; there were twelve or fourteen persons in the cell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpet-planner, living in Luke-street, Paul-street. A little before nine o'clock in the morning of the 27th of July I was standing in Aldermanbury, nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw a young man, who appeared to be a companion of the prisoner, bring out a paper parcel from Mr. Abbott's—I gave information—the pri<lb></lb>soner, who was there, and his companion, ran across Aldermanbury, up Love-lane—I and a young man that came out of the warehouse pursued them, and before we got to them, the prisoner had got the parcel underhis arm—they were walking—the other man started off when he saw us—the prisoner did not run—he had an opportunity of running as well as the other—if he had run very likely he would have escaped, but he would have dropped the goods—the other witness took the prisoner—I returned from going after the other, who escaped, and the prisoner said, "What it the matter? I will go quietly with you."</p>

I ran out on receiving information—I saw the prisoner with a parcel under his arm—I took hold of him, and took this parcel of shawls from his arm, and took him back—I believe he said it was a mistake—I said, "You must answer that before the Lord Mayor"—these are my masters' shawls.</p>

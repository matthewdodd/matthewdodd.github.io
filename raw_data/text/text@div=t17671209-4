On the 26th of October an acquaintance of mine that lives near the Tower, had some business in our parish: he called upon me, and staid till half an hour after ten at night; he said he did not know that part of the town, but if he could find his way to St. Paul's Church-yard, he could find his way home: I went with him thither, and parted with him in the Church-yard. When I came by the end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176712090004"></xptr> Chandois-street, by Covent-garden, the clock struck twelve; then I wound my watch up, it was one I had to mend; I went to my lodgings; as I was so late they would not let me in, so I walked about.

On the Wednesday following I had word of it; I was taken to Mr. Clements's, a public-house in the Hay-market, to one Couch who had bought the watch; then we went and found the prisoner at the White Bear; we took him before Sir

After that I went out, and went to get some water out of a tub to wash my face; I saw the watch hang up by the side of the tub, by a little steel hook; I took it and went away, thinking it would be advertised.</p>

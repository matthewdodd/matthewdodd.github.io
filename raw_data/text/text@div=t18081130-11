If you look back, you must see my behaviour to you at sometimes was somewhat odd, but it was not without a reason, and my reason was this - I have another wife, and have had three years and a half past, and by her I have had two children living and one dead; I left her in an hour I supposed my affairs were in a precarious state, which obliged me to leave my country and friends; but at this time I understand things are reconciled between them and me, and I am determined at this time to live no longer in adultery; and I am sure you can have no desire, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300009"></xptr>what I have heard you say respecting a married man - I now have explained the matter as far as I dare say you can wish; as any more can be of no consequence to you. I leave you to act as you think proper, when I will bid an everlasting adieu to London and you. Hoping that you will meet with a person that is more worthy your affections, and to end your days in unity and love (which could never have been the case with me), I remain your well wisher, but equally injured</p>

Adieu for ever and ever."</p>

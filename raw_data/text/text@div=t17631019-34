He pretended he had no acquaintance in London, but since I have taken him up, I find he has two people acquainted with him; he said there were 14 or 15 guineas in the parcel; he would lend me money to carry me down to my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Have any of the things been found again?</p>
               <p>West. No, only the hat cut to pieces and the lace gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>West. He was taken up about eight weeks afterwards that was done, the 25th of July; when he was charged with the thing, he said he would give me half a guinea to let him go, and he would never do the like again; this he said before the constable; he said he had sold the things in Cheapside, but did not say to whom.</p>

I am an officer, I had the prisoner in charge, and brought him before the bench of Justices, I asked him to let the young man know where the things were; he confessed to me he cut the lace from the hat, and sold it in Cheapside, for I think 6 s. and he sold the sheets to some Jew. He confessed before the Bridewell keeper that he was guilty of the fact.</p>

On 8th July, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty at Limehouse, and saw the prisoner with four or five persons sitting on the sill of the Sir John Barleycorn beer-shop, with his legs across the pavement, so that no one could pass, and talking very loud—I asked him to get up and go away—he said he should not, he should stop as long as he liked, and go when he liked—I took hold of him, lifted him into the road, and turned him towards the church—I turned to go the other way, he came behind me, knocked my hat off, and struck me a very violent blow with a ship's scraper—it cut me down, and I was laid up nine days.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 21). I found Pearson in Salmon's-lane, without his hat, and bleeding—the prisoner was being held on the ground by three or four constables—he was very violent, a stretcher was brought, but we could not put him on it, and were obliged to take him by force—hes side he wished he had a knife, he would <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it into the b----r----two others tried to excite the mob to rescue him—I took them in charge.</p>

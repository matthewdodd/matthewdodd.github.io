            . I keep the Golden Lion, in St. John-street. The prisoner was waiter at my house. I had occasion to search his box on the 21st of September last-Read found the snuff-box in his trunk. He came to live with me from the Grotto public-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I am an officer of Hatton-Garden Office. I searched the prisoner's box, and found the snuffbox in it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not intend to appropriate it to my own use. I found the box, and put it into my pocket, thinking I should receive a present from the gentleman who owned it. I have had things for three or four months before they were owned. Having changed my clothes to go into morning, I did not remember having it until after I left; It certainly would have been better if I had given it to the prosecutor, but I did not.</p>

T. A. on it—it was an old spoon—I have seen a shawl and two gowns at a pawnbroker's, which are my property—I am quite sure this brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—when I found the property was gone, I told a fellow clerk of it, and shortly after I found the prisoner had absconded—I gave information to the police, and went on 19th, Saturday, with Jarvis and Finnis to 3, Compass-court, Ratcliffe, and saw the prisoner Wiggins and some Irish people there—we examined the house, and on turning out a tin baking-dish I found these four ornaments of a sword-belt, which are mine—Martin told me that the house was his—I believe Wiggins does not live there, but he was asleep there then—I went again, and found Martin Mahony, Wiggins, and a girl named Ann Nash—I had not spoken to Mary Bowling before she left about the box being broken, but she saw me inspecting it—I did not threaten to send for a policeman, or anything of the kind—I never gave her permission to introduce any one else into the house—I have seen a key produced by Jarvis which fits three of my drawers—Bowling did not give me any notice before she left—she did not ask for her half-crown—I did not see her again till she was in custody.</p>

A. I." on it—the prisoners were taken to the police-court next day, remanded to the next day, and then discharged—Mr. Ingham said there was no proof they were not their own property—I gave the spoon back to the man, and he gave it to Mary Bowling—she directly said, "There were two spoons"—he said there was only one.</p>

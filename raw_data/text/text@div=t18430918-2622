                  </hi>. I live in Trinity-row, Islington. The prisoner was two months in my service—on the 26th of August, about nine o'clock, I went out, leaving the prisoner at home—I returned about eleven, and found her out—she did not return—about twelve o'clock that night a policeman came and gave me information—I went into one of my bedrooms, and missed a green box containing silver spoons and money, and a cash-box in which there were three farthings—I had seen that green box, about four o'clock that morning, locked—on the following Monday I saw the property at the station—there were nine silver spoons, one punch-ladle, one pair of sugar-tongs, the green box, and papers, to the value of about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my property.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of February I was on duty in John-street, Mile-end, New-town; at half-past one o'clock, before daybreak, I heard the bell of Davey's side-gate ring, and saw the prisoners together coming in a direction from the gate—Isaac had a milk-pail on his arm—I ran towards them, and Isaac threw the pail down, about thirty paces from the prosecutor's gate, on the opposite side and ran away—William ran away in a different direction—I pursued Isaac, and took him, without losing sight of him—he appeared to be very drank indeed, but he was not so—another policeman came up, and I went to a house in John's-court, John-street, in consequence of information, and found the prisoner William—I told him I wanted him, for stealing a milk<lb></lb>pail from Davey's—he said he wished he might go for life, and he took a baby up, three weeks old, and laid he had a good mind to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it on the fire.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity? - A. As a <rs id="t18050710-11-deflabel73" type="occupation">general servant, a porter, and he worked in the frame in making of stockings</rs>

               <p>Q. Is he a soldier? - A. Yes, I knew he was a soldier; on the 20th of June he was employed in cleaning windows and taking down the beds; in the evening, about eight o'clock, Mrs. Ireland took up his hat, which was lying on a secretary in the first floor, and found it was very heavy; she asked me whose hat it was; I said it was the prisoner's; the lining was drawn close up; I opened the lining, and found three pair of stockings contained in it. I then went out, and fetched a constable on purpose to search him, he was then cleaning the outside of the first floor windows; I took the constable up stairs, and called the prisoner, Voss, in; the first question I asked him was to inform me how the stockings came in his hat; he replied he did not know; I observed to him, they could not walk in, they must be put in by somebody or other; I called the constable to come forward, who was then standing on the stairs, to search him; I asked him if he had any thing else about him; he said, no; I saw the constable take the other stockings from him.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, and found three pair of stockings concealed in his hat crown; eight pair I took from him between his shirt and his skin, on the right side of him, and one pair I took from the waistband of his breeches; these are the dozen pair of stockings; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looking at the stockings.) They are ladies' stockings, they are my property, they have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you, my Lord - My mistress was one that liked a little liquor, and she sent me out several times of the day to get it; she wished me to treat; I told her it did not lay in my power to stand treat, I had a wife and child to support, I could not afford it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. To treat your mistress? - A. Yes, I went out several times in the day to get liquor for her; she told me if I liked to take some stockings to pledge I might; she told me to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bid you to put them in your hat? - A. No, I was to take them unknown to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness to prove that - have you any witnesses of any kind? - A. I can get witnesses where I fetched the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you ever pledge any stockings before for her for liquor? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Turner. On searching him, I found two shillings in halfpence in his pocket, which he said his mistress gave him; his mistress had paid him that, it was his day's wages, he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What had he to say for himself? - A. He never made that defence at the time, nor did he call his mistress; in taking him to the Compter, he attempted to make his escape from me in Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>JAMES PILGRIM. Between twelve and one o'clock in the day, of the 13th of November, this money was in a purse in my waistcoat pocket; I was in my stable in <placeName id="t18280110-138-crimeloc726">Whitechapel</placeName>

I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100083"></xptr>after the prisoner, but did not see him again till I met him on the 22d, and took him to Lambeth-street; I said I had been waiting for him some time; he said, "I heard you wanted to see me;" he said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more about the money than you do; there were two more boys in the stable - he asked me to go into the loft - I would not, and he turned me out of the stable; he went up, and was asleep there for two hours; I waited for him in the yard all that time.</p>

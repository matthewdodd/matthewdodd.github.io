               <p>Who was last up in your house? - I was last up; I went to bed about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you leave your house doors and windows secure? - Perfectly so; I always make it a rule to see every night; and I did that night; and saw, that the whole house was secure; I found in the morning the back kitchen window open.</p>
               <p>There was no alarm in the night that you heard of? - No; I found the back kitchen window open; the bolt of the window was bent double like a bit of lead; it was perfectly secure when I went to bed; the yard door was open, but there was no appearance of violence there; they had opened that to go out; the parlour door from the stair-case into the parlour was open; the door from the parlour into the shop was open; there was no violence there, because the keys were both left in; there was a mark of tallow upon the counter, about the circle of an inch, like the mark of a bottom of a lanthorn; upon the counter there were foot marks with mud; there were two or three other spots of tallow too; upon examining the shelves, we found almost every shelf stripped.</p>
               <p>To what amount? - Upwards of 80 l.; in the garden I found foot marks; they had come along the mould in the garden, to prevent the noise of the gravel walks; there were two foot marks, one an inch longer than the other; there were some matches and a small file left behind (producing them) which I took out of the garden myself; the file I apprehend they struck a light with.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. When you came to the shop in the morning the shutters were all up? - Yes; the shop shutters were fast; they were all up when I got up; there is a fan light over the door, which gives a very great light.</p>
               <p>There is no shutter to that? - No.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Holford; I was first down in the morning; I found the back kitchen window and shutters open about seven o'clock.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's lodgings on the 5th of June, a little after four in the morning; he was on the bed; he had his clothes on all but his shoes; I told him we had an information against him for a robbery; and I looked round the room; this dark lanthorn was standing on a box by the bed side; and this iron crow and chisel; and close to the side of it a tinder box and matches; I searched his box that they stood upon.</p>
               <p>There was no steel in the tinder-box? - No, but there was a file; there was no other steel.</p>
               <p>And flint? - Yes. (Producing it.) I searched the cellar, and found this large chisel, and this auger or borer. (Producing them.) I asked him how he came by the lanthorn and iron crow; and he said he had that morning found them; and I apprehended him; I examined the box and found a piece of cotton, a handkerchief and a pair of stockings; I asked him if they were his; he said they were; that he had them some time by him; I had seen a hand bill of Mr. Halford's; I thought it might be his property, and I secured the property. (Produces the things.) I went with the crow to Mr. Halford's house, and compared the places in the presence of Mr. Halford, and desired him to do the same; I found three large impression in the wood in the back kitchen window; I compared them with the large end of the crow, and they exactly tallied; there were two other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110116"></xptr>smaller, which the small end of the crow exactly fitted.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You are an officer belonging to an office? - No; constable of the parish.</p>
               <p>You have for several years attended at this place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have frequently in the course of that practice produced crows here; are they not in general much of the same size? - No; they are of very different sizes; there is a little piece out of the large end of this crow; and there was that part deficient in Mr. Halford's window.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Halford. You saw this crow compared with your shutters? - Yes; that little notch is wanting on the shutters; both ends exactly tallied.</p>
               <p>Look at those things; are they your property? - This piece of callico I know to be mine by this yellow stain in it; my wife cut it off for her own use; it being damaged we could not sell it; the stockings are exactly the same pattern as those I lost; the mark is cut away; the handkerchief is exactly the same pattern; I believe it to be ours; it is not marked; they were all in one piece.</p>
               <p>Does it not frequently happen that pieces are so damaged? - No; not often.</p>
               <p>It does sometimes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HALFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the prosecutor's wife; this piece of cotton I can swear to by this yellow stain; it is a remnant I cut off for my own use; I believe all the things to be our property.</p>

            . I drive the Bristol Mail - on the night of the 29th of January I was stopped by a person at Salt-hill, about five miles from Hatcherley-park - he gave a bag to the guard, and said he must take care of it, as there were a couple of live pheasants in it; and I understood him to say they were going to the Post-office; but the direction is near the Post-office - when we came a little nearer town, another man gave me a basket, which he said contained pork, and it was to go near the New Post-office - when I came to Lad-lane I looked at the two directions, and they were both alike, "For Mr. Brown; to be left at the Nottingham Castle, near the New Post-office, London"- the bag was opened, and it contained two live pheasants, and the basket nineteen fowls, which were not picked; and some of them were warm - I packed them up again, and sent them by a porter as directed; and I and an officer went and watched them - the prisoner came, and had them, and was taken.</p>

            . I am an officer - on the morning of the 30th of January I was sent for to the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane - I saw the bag and basket - I told the porter to deliver them as they were directed - I went with the coachman and waited - I saw the prisoner go by- he knew me; and I kept at a distance, and went into a house - I saw the prisoner go into the public-house, and come out with a basket - I stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said, "Two birds" - I looked in and saw these two pheasants - he said he was to take them to the Ship, in Ivy-lane, Newgate-street, and he was to meet a person there - I took him back to the Nottingham Castle, where I found the basket of fowls - I found the tickets of the carriage, and the direction which had been on the pheasants, in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."About three weeks ago a man came to me about six o'clock on a Thursday morning, who had the appearance of a salesman, and whom I had often seen waiting near the Post-office, and who was sometimes attended with a market-porter till the mail-coaches came in, when he takes some baskets from the coaches, and proceeds up Newgate-street with them - he said he might give me a job now and then; for he said he had a horse and cart standing in Newgate-street, and that he had business in the market which prevented him from always waiting till the coaches came in - he then told me that whenever any of his baskets should come, and he not be there, there would be a direction on them for Mr. Brown, to be left at the Nottingham Castle till called for; but that I was to take them to the Ship public-house, where I should see him, and if there should be any live birds at any time, I was to get a flat and put them in, so that they should not be hurt - he told me that he had sent an order into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200049"></xptr>country, and he expected some five birds on the abovenamed day, that I was to bring them to him, and he would give me sixpence for my trouble - accordingly, there was a basket and a bag came by the Bristol coach about nine o'clock, directed as above - the bag contained two live birds, which I took from the bag and put into a basket, as I had been directed; but I did not know what was in the basket - I left the basket at the public-house, and was taking the live birds to the Ship, when I was stopped in Butcher-hall-lane by the officer and two more men, who asked me if I had not another basket - I told him yes; but I had left it at the public-house, as I could not bring them both at once, being so heavy - they then took me back to the public-house, when I told them, if they would go with me to the Ship they would see the man, which they refused.</p>

               <p>On Saturday between two and three in the afternoon, I saw the two prisoners at the bar in Basinghall-street, opposite the White Bear, I thought they were not doing the thing they ought to do, looking in at the window, and I watched them about 20 minutes, and I went and rung at a gentleman's door, and desired them to let me into the house for a few minutes, for a thought there were two thieves in the street; and the clerk let me in, the prisoners walked up and down the street several times, and I saw one point to the other to go into the house, he staid there about four minutes, and the other waited at the door, I desired the clerk all the time to keep the door open, that I might have a run; I expected a run, and just as I came to the door the two prisoners came up with this coat, and hat under one of their arms, and the other offered to take it from him, but I said, I will take care of it and you too; I did so, and the clerk took the other prisoner, I took him to Guildhall, and I sent for a Mr. Hippy, I think the gentleman's name is, and he said, it was his servant's property.</p>

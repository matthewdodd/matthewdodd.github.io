            . I am a workman to these gentlemen. On Saturday week I was coming from dinner, between the hours of one and two, I observed the prisoner standing in the shop; he had a pair of pole-pieces in his hand; he went out of the back way from the premises. I saw him take the pole-pieces off the steps of the carriage. There was a pair of pole-pieces missing a few minutes afterwards. I saw him on the Monday again. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . On the 17th, between one and two, I was in the shop at work, the prisoner came into the shop; he said, he wanted a man of the name of Trimming, a smith, he was putting on stays to the springs of a carriage. I went up into the shop and enquired; my master said, there was no such person. I returned to the lower shop, the prisoner was standing there; I told him, there was no such person; he seemed to be in great agitation, and wished to go the back way. I spoke sharp to him, you cannot go that way; he said, this way will do for me the same. In a few minutes afterwards the report came, that the pole-pieces were gone, and a man had been seen to go out of the shop with them. I am certain it is the same man. I knew him when a boy; he is a smith by trade.</p>

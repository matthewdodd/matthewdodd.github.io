            . I live at 34, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I am in the service of Mr. Dawson, ship broker, Tower Hill. On the 1st of June, about half past eleven at night, I was going to Mr. Dawson's, to see if a box of linen had come there that afternoon. I was three parts down the Minories, between George-street and the Crescent.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you had this money about you in the <placeName id="t18090626-64-crimeloc376">Minories</placeName>

I was at that moment putting the half crown out of my right hand pocket into my left pocket; I felt the money in my pocket. The prisoner accosted me at the time I was putting the money in my pocket; she met me right in the face, she was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that she is the woman - A. I am quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she a child in her arms at that time - A. No, she asked me where I was going, I told her I was going straight home, she said I had better go home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her - A. No; she met me, turned back, and went in the direction I was going; she laid hold of my arm, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to shove her off - A. No, she was not five minutes with me, I did not stop with her at all; she suddenly started from me. I was then close by the Crescent when she started the other side of the way; no familiarity passed between us. By her suddenly starting from me, I thought she had taken my pocket handkerchief; I found the left hand pocket of my pantaloons, turned inside out. She was at my left side when she started from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your notes and silver all there - A. Yes, in my purse; I pursued her, and called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When she asked you to go home, did she tell you where her home was - A. No; I was very near her when I followed her, and the watchman stopped her; she was searched in the watchhouse, and the money was found in her mouth; the notes on one side of her mouth, and the silver in the other. The constable has kept it ever since.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is at Sparrow-corner, at the end of the Minories. On the 1st of June, about half past eleven at night, I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was running, and the prosecutor after her. I stopped the prisoner, the prosecutor came up directly; he charged the prisoner with having robbed him of his purse, containing cash and notes. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, there I searched her; I found upon her two one pound notes, and four shillings in silver in her mouth. I never found the purse. I delivered over the notes and the money to Kinnersley.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the woman - A. No, I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Kinnersley. The money and the notes were delivered over to me; they were taken out before I came.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. I suppose you had no marks about your notes or money - A. I know the numbers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not rob this gentleman of his money; I went to look after my husband, he stopped out later than usual; coming back I met with this gentleman, he asked me to have something to drink; he intruded upon me to take six-pence to get something to drink, I told him I dare not go to any house with him, for fear my husband should come home; I happened to stoop down to tie my pocket up, I saw something white, I picked it up; the notes and money were wrapped up in paper. The gentleman came to me in Rosemary-lane, he struck me; I did not know the gentleman again; he did not say he had lost any thing, he called out stop thief, I called out murder. The money was found upon me. When I was in the Compter, he said he would not hurt me if I would make up the money; he had lost two guineas, and a guinea for his loss of time; I told him my husband was out of work, I could not raise above two guineas; he told me I should pay for Kinnersley's loss of time, and the watchman's loss of time. Mr. Kinnersley told Mr. Elder that he should not take the money, without paying for his time.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is there any truth in what she has said - A. I begged the lord mayor not to prosecute this woman, upon account of the child; the husband wanted my address, I gave it him; I never went to the Compter to take any money of her. I never made any proposal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260056"></xptr>that she should pay the watchman and Kinnersley.</p>
               <p>Jury Q. to Maberley. Did the prosecutor describe to you the number of the notes - A. He said he had lost two notes, he said they were both running numbers; he did not make out the number of the notes; before he saw them he described the quantity of silver, he mentioned one foreign piece, or pocket piece, which there was amongst it.</p>
               <p>COURT. to Kinnersley. Do you know the person of the woman - A. Yes.</p>

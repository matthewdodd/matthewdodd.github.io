            . How long have you lived in the house? - I have lived in the house a twelve-month, I took it from week to week.</p>
               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the bundle in a narrow lane, about a hundred yards from the house, I picked it up, and walked along with it thinking no harm in the world, these men pursued me, I did not know what they were running after, I heard them cry out, stop thief! and as I picked up the bundle, I thought whether or no it might not be on that account, and I made my escape and dropt the bundle, and went away about my business thinking no harm, and they took me to a public house and brought me to the justice. As for the fire-arms, five weeks ago last Sunday, I was coming along about a mile and a hall beyond Edgware, in a very heavy thunder shower, and there was a barn unlocked, I went in for shelter, and there was a little straw and hay on the floor, I tumbled it about to lay down, and out-tumbled these arms, which I knew nothing about; I was surprized to see them, I put them in my pocket without thinking any harm in the world; I have no witness to prove these things, I expect people to my character every minute, one's name is Alsop, and the other Reave.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had the prisoner been in your service? A. I believe between eight and nine months - he has, by chance, had a pair or two of shoes made to measure - he told me had some kid skins, at a time when I wanted some, and I had a few of them of him; I paid him 3s. more for them than I was giving at the warehouse for them - I had some satin uppers of him - I have pawned my own things in my own name, but never in the name of Brown - when the prisoner was taken, he gave up his bunch of keys, and offered every facility for searching his place - he said, he lived at No. 13, Phoenix-street, and he has asked me to come there; if I had gone there, I might have seen anything that might have been there, but I had no suspicion.</p>

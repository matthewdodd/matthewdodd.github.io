               <p>CHARLES WALLER. I am an inspector of police. On the 24th of March, I was at the station in Tower-street, and remember the prisoner coming there with Mrs. Lewis—he charged her with having two pint pots and some pewter in her possession, and not giving a satisfactory account of it, and she said she knew nothing about it, she never saw them in her shop till the prisoner showed them to her—there was no prosecutor to substantiate the charge—I took bail for her appearance, and she was discharged—she returned to the station in about three hours, or three and a half, with Mr. Cox, her bail—nobody else that I know of—a complaint was made of her having been robbed—in consequence of what was communicated to me, I sent for the prisoner, and stated to him that the prisoner he had brought to the station came and complained she had been robbed, and I asked if he knew any thing about it—he said, "No"—I told the prisoner she had been robbed of a time-piece, a cloak, and several other little articles, but she could not say what she had lost, that her drawers were all ransacked, and the place covered with property—I asked the prisoner if he went to that house to search it—he said,"No"—I then sent for White, being the constable on the beat, and asked him in the prisoner's presence if he had seen the prisoner there—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what time he saw him there—he said, "About half-past ten o'clock—the prisoner said, "No, you did not see me there"—White said, "Yes, I-did, I gave you a light"—the prisoner strongly denied taking a light from White—I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the time-piece and cloak, or the robbery—he said no, he knew nothing about it—White repeated his state<lb></lb>ment in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner said, "No, you must be mistaken, I had no light from you, and I was not there"—in the morn<lb></lb>ing he was in conversation with one of the sergeants—I asked him if I could assist him in any way, as there was another person with him, whether he knew him or not, if he could tell me his name, or where he lived—(meaning his informant)—he said, "No, I thought I had the name and address in my pocket, but I cannot find it"—about seven that morning I asked him to tell me the truth, and if I could assist in ap<lb></lb>prehending his informant I would do it—he then said his informant took the cloak out of the room, and brought it down stairs, and stated to him that he knew a person the cloak belonged to, that he would bring the Party to the station to identify it by nine that morning—he said both he and his informant went into the house together, and went up stairs—he did not say how they got in—I asked what was his reason for leaving Mrs. Lewis at the station in Moor-lane, as the charge did not come to my station before twelve, and Mrs. Lewis was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody about ten—he told me he was going to find the thief—on the Satur<lb></lb>day I attended before the Magistrate, and Mrs. Lewis was discharged.</p>

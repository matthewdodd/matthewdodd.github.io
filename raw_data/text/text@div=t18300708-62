            . On the 27th of June I left the house between seven and eight o'clock, with my cousin Smith, and left nobody in it - I pulled the door too, and the spring of the lock fastened itself; I did not mean to lock it - I took the key with me; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, unlocked the door, went in, shut it, and heard a scuffle up stairs - I went up, and passed the prisoner on the top of the stairs; the stair case window is immediately opposite - I looked at him, and he started me full in the face; I am certain of him - I passed him, and he ran down stairs; I looked into the back room - there was a trunk broken open, and clothes on the floor, and a blue coat on the floor of the front room - I immediately ran down, found the street door open, went out, and saw the prisoner fifteen or twenty yards off; Robinson, who lives opposite, ran out, calling Stop thief! I followed the prisoner about a hundred yards, then lost sight of him for half a minute while he turned a corner, and saw him in Bowyer's custody soon after - he brought him round the corner, where I had lost him; I directly said, "That is the man;" he said he could not be the man, and Bowyer let him go, as a man came into the crowd and said he could not be the man, for he had walked down behind him - I said he was the man; he walked down the street- Matthewson said he would follow him; Robinson came up, and took him - I had then gone back to the shop; I saw him in custody in about a quarter of an hour - I went up stairs with two Policemen; there were two trunks in the back room broken open, stockings, sheets, and a blue coat on the floor; two pocket-books laid open on the bed - an old brown coat was found in the back room; it belonged to nobody in the house; I did not notice the room windows when I went out, but when I returned they were both open - they were closed when I left, as far as I can recollect; they both belong to one room; they were not broken - the men must have entered at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You do not know whether the windows were open or not? A. They might be open when I left - it was rather dusk when I returned; I stood on one side of the prisoner on the stairs - his face was towards me, looking towards the window, when I got on the last stair - he might have knocked me down if I had stopped him; when he was stopped a man said, the man who was running had gone down the street, but I was sure he was the man - he walked very quick when Bowyer let him go.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . On the 27th of June I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner walking at a quick pace; I took him - several people said he was the man, and others said he was not; I am sure he is the person I took - there was a crowd; I do not recollect seeing Matthewson or Robinson - he was about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not several of the neighbours say he was not the man who ran from the house? A.I cannot say they were neighbours - one person said he was not the man, for he had been walking before him- some said he was not the man that jumped out of the window; others said he had run out of the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBINSON. I live opposite Hutton. I was in my front room and my wife at the window; in consequence of what she said, I looked out of window, and saw a man getting out of the first floor window - I hallooed Stop thief! my window was open; I was hanging half out, and saw a man directly afterwards come out at the street door; that was the prisoner, I am sure - I called Stop thief! another man came out of the door; I put on my coat and hat, which took about three minutes, went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080038"></xptr>out, and overtook him in Rose-street - he was walking not particularly fast; I followed him till I saw a Policeman, and gave him in charge - I did not know him before, but I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You believe him to be the man? A. I am certain of him - I continued at the window from the time the other dropped from the window; he did not run - the corner of the street is six or seven doors off; I saw his face perfectly, and his dress; he was taken the first time in about three minutes - he was walking at a moderate pace.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. One of the Prisoners lifted up the sash , and the other took the wig out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had no hand in taking out the wig?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I was as far off as I am to you. - I cannot say who lifted up the sash , because they had both their hands together.</p>

             put something into his apron and run down the Haymarket, the barber run after him, and cried out, stop thief! and he run against me and pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to stop him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I stopped him with a design to prevent his running after the Prisoners, and then I went home directly. - I went first to their lodging over against the Black-Horse in Church-lane, St. Giles's, I live just by.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the wig?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. We carried it to a barber's in Dyot-street, and sold it for a crown. - I carried the wig. - I sold the wig. - I don't know the barber's name.</p>
               <p>Q. to Penny. Did you go to that barber's?</p>
               <p>Penny. I got a search warrant, but he got away and has kept out of the way ever since , the evidence told me the barber's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the wig in Talbot's possession?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Both of them had the wig on, and I had it on; none of us had it on above 4 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you sold it to a barber.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. We did not sell it to the barber, we carried it to him and he sold it for us for 5 s. and we gave him a shilling for selling it, and divided the 4 s. between us.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by a hoop?</p>
               <p>Talbot. That is a brass ring such as they sell for gold ones. - I cannot say but I had the wig on my head, and I said it was a great deal too big, and I believed would not fetch much; was you ever in my company before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I have several times. - I am a baker by trade, I have been a master baker and lived within 5 miles of Bath but have had misfortunes in the world.</p>
               <p>Talbot. I believe his brother and he get their living by gaming and selling brass rings for gold ones. <rs id="t17440113-3-verdict15" type="verdictDescription">

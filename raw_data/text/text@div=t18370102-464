Between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 10th of December I was watching (I had loaded the cart the night before with twenty-five trusses) I saw Green come and take four trusses—he gave Warwick the four trusses upon the cart—three from the stacks, and one from the shed—I did nothing then, because my master was in London—I told him the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Long-lane, Smith field. I had bought hay before of Mr. Gibson, and Warwick brought it—on the 2nd of December a bad of hay was brought to me by the prisoner, and I rather disputed, because it was brought at night—that led to his calling on me on the fol<lb></lb>lowing Thursday—1 said I wanted no more—he said he had got some at Woodford-bridge, and was going to London to a person—I said I did not want it—he said he should bring a sample up—I said I did not want it—he called on the Saturday I said I did not want any—he said he had got, I think, a quarter of a load, and I said he might throw it down—it was four trusses—he said he was going to Mr. Cooper's—he was to call on his return—he never returned, but Green called in a quarter of an hour, and said he was going to Mr. Johnson's, in Old-street-road, and pulled out his ticket to show me—I said, "Where is the person who left the hay?"—he said he was gone round to receive some money—I then paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the four trusses of hay that Warwick had left with me as a sample.</p>

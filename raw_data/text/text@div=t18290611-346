               <p>JOHN PEACOCK. The prisoner was given into my charge. I received the two half-crowns and the penny; I found on the prisoner 1s. 6d. - she claimed 6d. of it, and it was returned; the shilling the prosecutor claimed - the prisoner then sat down in a chair; it was said there was no doubt she had another half-crown - I went to search her, when we heard a half-crown drop close to her chair.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me 6d., and wanted to force me down the alley - I said I would spend it in drink, - he followed me, and wanted his money back; I would not give it - he then threw down his money in the road, and I was taken to the watch-house.</p>

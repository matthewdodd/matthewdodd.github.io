On the 17th of December I came from Greenwich, and fell in with the prisoner between six and seven o'clock at night, near Cock-hill.

She went for a pot beer. I fell asleep before she returned. I had put my money under the pillow, rolled up in my trowsers-pocket. I awoke about twelve o'clock, and missed the trowsers and money. I found the trowsers by the bed-side, but the money gone. I came out, gave an alarm, told the watchman, and she was taken in a few minutes. I am positive that she is the girl. I had drank very little.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I went to the house, waited there, and the prisoner came out very drunk - I asked if she lived there; she said Yes, and that nobody had slept with her that night; we detained her. The prosecutor immediately fixed upon her as the woman. As we went before the Magistrate; she told me that she had robbed him, and she did not mind going to the mill, for she had been there before. A publican gave me two sovereigns, and fifteen shillings and sixpence.</p>

We left him at the watch-house while we went to the house, and took the prisoner - he immediately said she was the woman; she asked me to get her some liquor; I said I could not without money - she said,</p>

            . I am a publican. The prisoner came to me about nine o'clock, for a pint and a half of ale, saying she had a captain to sup with her, and in ten minutes she gave me two sovereigns and two half crowns, to take care of, saying that he had given them to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I met him, he was struggling with a woman, who would not take him home; he then turned to me, and asked if I would, and followed me up to my place, and while I was getting a light he was talking to two other women. He was very drunk; I went to get him a quartern of gin, and when I returned he was asleep, and undressed. I awoke him, and said he could not be there till he had satisfied me; he pulled his trowsers out, and gave me this money - I took it to Marks to take care of, and when I returned, the officers, were waiting for me. I do not know what I might have said, as I was drunk.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I gave her four sixpences when I first went into the room, but no sovereigns. I knew what I was about.</p>

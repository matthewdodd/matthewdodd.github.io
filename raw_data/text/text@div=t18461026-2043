                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there anything remarkable about the character of his writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I consider there is no disguise about it at all—he is a relative of mine—I corresponded with him about a year ago, and have done so five or six years—it is only till very lately that I have had correspondence with him—it ii two or three years ago, I cannot distinctly recollect how long, hot not within a year I have seen him write—I have a memorandum here, signed by him on the 7th, 17th, and 25th of Aug., 1843—I saw him write on all those days—these are the documents he wrote be name to—I do not recollect seeing him write anything but his name.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">BELL</hi>. I am a reporter, and live in Southwark Bridge-road. I am acquainted with Pearce and his writing, and believe this check to be his writing—three years ago he was an occasional contributor to various newspapers—I had attended public inquiries for five or seven years previously, and have had occasion to see him write 150 times—the last time was about four years ago—previous to that I was in the habit of seeing him write pretty constantly—to the best of my belief this letter (<hi rend="italic">marked A.</hi>) is his writing—I believe these also to be his writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some others.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you and the prisoner any difference at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—it is four or five years since I saw him write or act as a re<lb></lb>porter—I believe he has not been reporting since that—we were occasionally in the habit of reading each others reports.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You seem to express a doubt about the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I discover a difference in it, which creates a doubt—it is a broader writing—he did not generally write so broad a hand—I recollect his writing perfectly well—the check is in his ordinary writing, but the letter is broader—the let<lb></lb>ters are wider altogether—his handwriting is generally close—the words are stretched out—they are larger than his general writing—(<hi rend="italic">letter </hi>A.<hi rend="italic"> read</hi>—"Coton-house, 25th of Aug., 1846: Mrs. Wallace, I received your letter, and now send you a check on Messrs.

On the 9th of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house at Camberwell to search for some other property—I went to the back of the premises—I saw the ware—house door open—I went in and saw this coat in the warehouse—I came out, and went into the shop—the prisoner, George Fisher, was there—my sergeant told me to look after him—he then went out into the yard—I went with him—he went into the stable, seemed very much agitated, and said, "For God's sake, let me get one thing out of the next door, or else I shall be transported—(his warehouse is next door)—I said I should not do any thing of the kind—his wife then went by, and he threw some keys to her—she then opened the door of the warehouse, and slammed it after her—I called out for assistance, and we went into the next house, and saw Eli<lb></lb>zabeth Fisher coming down stairs—she said we might search her, she had nothing about her—I went up stairs to search the premises, and saw this coat (which I had seen in the prisoner's warehouse) hanging on the door—I asked George Fisher if he knew any thing about that coat—he said he knew nothing about it, and his wife said the same—it was in Mr. Skin<lb></lb>ner's house I found the coat.</p>

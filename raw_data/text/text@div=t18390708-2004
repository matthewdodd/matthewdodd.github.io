                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Thomas Ashby, Jun., and others, bankers at Staines. The prisoner is a hay-dealer, and lives at Upper Halliford, near Sunbury—on the 22nd of March, about three o'clock, he brought this bill of exchange, and wished to know if we would discount it for him—we bad discounted several for him before with the same mark on them, which were taken up by the prisoner—John Cole keeps an account with us—he had at that time a floating balance with us, and we discounted the bill—I knew that Cole only put his mark to the cheques he drew, and I paid the money to the prisoner.</p>

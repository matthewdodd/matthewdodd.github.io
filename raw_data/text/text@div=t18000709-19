               <p>Q.How do you know it was his lodgings? - A.Only from the information of others: I found there a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pocket-book of mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He left your house on the Friday? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he left your house voluntarily? - A. No, he was taken from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not leave your house till he was compelled by law to leave it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you right that his boxes were at your house? - A. No; I meant to say, at his lodgings, there was one left behind.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What do you mean by one being left behind? - A.The other was taken away while I was endeavouring to get a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you yourself ever see two boxes in that room? - A. No, I only know of one.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you talk of two - there is something that strikes me a little extraordinary: you now charge him with stealing two shirts, a handkerchief, a pocket-book, and a pair of stockings; he was committed last Friday, was he not? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p> Upon your oath, even on last Saturday did you ever charge him with stealing more than one shirt? - A. I did not at that time, because the box was not searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the box was not searched on Saturday, when Sir

             you had only found one shirt and a neckcloth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing that handkerchief which you had found before he was committed? - A. A handkerchief and shirt were in his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you charge him with stealing a handkerchief? - A. He was charged with stealing a handkerchief and a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. My question to you is this, and you cannot mistake it - did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing a handkerchief which was then found? - A. I certainly charged him with stealing a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the Alderman only committed him for stealing a shirt; I will read you the commitment: Mr. Kirby produces the commitment; Mr. Knowlys reads it)? - A. That is one linen shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you or not charge him before the Alderman with stealing a handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief was in his lodgings certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer to a direct ques--; my question is - as you had found the handkerchief before he was committed, did you or not charge him with stealing that handkerchief? - A.I certainly known the shirt to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will try you for the fourth time-upon the solemn oath under which you now stand to give evidence, did you before the Alderman charge him with stealing the handkerchief, aye or no? - A. The witness that is with me spoke to the handkerchief; I did not charge the handkerchief because that handkerchief I had not seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as have recourse back again to your memory; did you not tell me that you had, before the Alderman committed him, found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief I have a witness to prove was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, but a little while ago, upon your oath, that you had, before the Alderman committed him, found both a shirt and a handkerchief? - There certainly was only a shirt produced before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, but a little while ago, tell the gentleman of the Jury that you had found a shirt and a handkerchief, before the Alderman committed him? - A. The prisoner was committed under two witnesses, one that was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Hear the question again - did you not, a little while ago, tell the gentlemen of the Jury that you had found the shirt and the handkerchief before the Alderman committed him? - A. I can only speak to the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Jury that you had found a shirt and a handkerchief before he was committed? - A. I did, in consequence of the witness that is with me; the Alderman certainly committed him for a shirt and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Jury that before the Alderman committed this man, you had found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I certainly found the shirt; the witness can speak to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. If you will not answer me I shall certainly apply for a very serious proceeding against you, and have you committed - I ask you again, did you not say to the Jury -</p>
               <p>Court. It does not at all follow that a Magistrate may not make a mistake; I have the deposition in my hand, in which he says exactly as he does now, and that the witness spoke to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If your Lordship looks back to your notes, you will find that he has said that he found the handkerchief and shirt before the man was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to that Jury that you had found, before the Alderman committed him, a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I certainly swore to a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. I will state the question again, and see if you understand it - have you not already sworn here, that before the Alderman committed this man, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090014"></xptr>had found a shirt and a handkerchief? - A. I cannot swear to that which is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Is what you said before then not true? - A.I swore to the shirt, and the witness to the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not say to this Jury, that before the Alderman committed the prisoner, you had found the shirt and the handkerchief; and I will have an answer if I am here till twelve o'clock at night? - </p>
               <p>One of the Jury. We heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Q.As that is the case, how came you to give my Lord the last answer, that you had not seen it? - There were two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to put but one in the indictment? - A. I did not wish to put more in.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You found this shirt in the box that was left behind? - A. No; it was in the lodgings, but not in the box at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the handkerchief? - A. The handkerchief was in the lodgings; the shirt, silk stockings, and pocket-book were all found after he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of two boxes - at first every body supposed they were at your house, and then at the lodgings, and then you knew only of one box; did you find any thing in that box that you charge the prisoner with? - A.Nothing.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Farringdon ward within: Mr. Macklin sent for me on Friday evening last, to his house in Cheapside; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and the next day he was committed; I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How do you know they were his lodgings? - A.The woman of the house told me so, Mrs. Colton; I found there two pair of silk stockings, a shirt, and this pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You left the prisoner in gaol, and did not take him to this house to hear what he might say to any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Who took away the shirt that was produced before the commitment? - A. I did; the constable was with me.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH COLTON sworn. - My husband is a bricklayer; I live in Crane-court, Foster-lane; the prisoner has lodged with me about a month or six weeks; he lodged in the garret with another young man; my husband has worked for Mr. Macklin once or twice; I saw the shirt in the room; with J M upon it, Mr. Macklin's initials; he told me his master had given it him; he was taken up on the Friday evening; in the course of the afternoon he had been at our house; he had two boxes at our house; he came to our house to dine, and brought a knot with him to take away one of his boxes, which he did, loaded; the other remained at our house; Mr. Macklin came in the evening, after he was taken up; the shirt was hanging upon my line, which Mr. Macklin looked at, and there was a cambric pocket handkerchief which I had not hung up; Mr. Macklin came in again, and asked if I had one, and he claimed that; the handkerchief was in my own room; I had been washing, and had not hung it up; I had been washing a shirt also for him; I delivered the shirt to Mr. Macklin, and the handkerchief; but I cannot exactly say when I gave him the handkerchief; I went before Sir

             the next day; Mr. Macklin produced a shirt, and a handkerchief was spoke of, but I believe not produced; but I was very much flurried, and cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.You have washed these things for him some considerable time? - A. Yes; and he said his master had made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man took one box away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not make the shirt away, but left it with you to wash? - A. Yes; I had given him notice to quit our lodgings, and he was going away.(The property was deposed to by Mr. Macklin.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Was that handkerchief produced before the Alderman, or not? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time received it from the witness? - A. I cannot say whether I had or not; there were two handkerchiefs, one of them a muslin one, one that was spoke of before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Calton.) Do you know any thing of two handkerchiefs? - A. Yes; there was a beautiful worked muslin handkerchief which Mr. Macklin said was his.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Macklin.) Was the cambric handkerchief your's? - A. No, I had borrowed it of a young lady; the mark has been taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long had this man lived with you? - A.Nearly two years.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time it is not uncommon for masters to give servants clothes? - A. I never gave him any in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

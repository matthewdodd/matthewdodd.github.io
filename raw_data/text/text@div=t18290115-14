            . I received some silk from Mr. Hulland on the 30th of September, and on the 1st of October the prisoner came and asked me for Mr. Hulland's silk; I gave him thirty-five bobbins, which I had wound - he asked me to lend him a handkerchief, and he would leave it at the warehouse for me; I gave him one - I have not seen the silk or the handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time in the morning was it? A.Between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>JOHN HULLAND. I live in Goldsmith-street - Gee worked for me. I sent her some silk in September; I did not send the prisoner for any part of it - he had been in my employ, but left about this time last year, and had no direction from me to do any thing after that; I had not seen him; I have not found the silk - there were fourteen yards, worth 38s.</p>

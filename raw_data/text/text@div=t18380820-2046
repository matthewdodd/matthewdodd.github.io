On Sunday evening, the 5th of August, I was going home from London, and between IIford and Chadwell the prisoner came up to me from the side of the road—he was sitting in the road—there were four or five of them-a man named Smith was with me—he was seven or eight rods he fore me—I had a handkerchief in my hand—the prisoner came up to me—the other four were close alongside of him—the prisoner snatched the handkerchief out of my hand—he did not say any thing—I tried to keep the handkerchief, but he got it by force from me—I asked him to give me my handkerchief, and he immediately knocked me down, kicked me twice in the side, and swore he would knock my b-y guts he got up—he then took my hat off my head—I asked him for it, and he got over a gate into a field, and went away—I lost sight of him—I did not know him he fore—he was quite a stranger—I am quite sure he is the man—my hat and handkerchief were shown to me next morning by Wes<lb></lb>ton—they were the same I lost that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer. On Sunday evening the 5th of August, I was going back with Coker from London to South Ockenden-when we came to Britten-pond I was eight or ten rods he fore him—there were four or five young men sitting in the road-presently I turned round and heard my mate ask for his handkerchief—the prisoner had got it in his hand—I am sure he is the man—I had seen him once he fore, but not to know any thing about him—I made answer to my mate, "Come—on Charles, never mind your handkerchief"—the prisoner then came up to me and said, "You b—I have seen you he fore—he up with his fist and knocked me down, and he fore I could well get up," he knocked me down again—I had not quite got up—he then went right back to my partner and searched him the same—I was going up the road to find assistance, and while I was gone I saw him go across the field with two more, with a hat in his hand—I had not seen him take it from my mate—I went to Chadwell and waited till Weston the officer came about nine o'clock—I then made a complaint to him, and went with him to look for the prisoner—I found him at Mrs. Kemp's beer-shop, between nine and ten o'clock—I was the first that went into the shop-Weston followed close to me—I saw the prisoner there and pointed him out—he was sitting without a hat-as soon as he saw me he hung his head down like a dying sheep—I told Weston, "That is the man"—he went up to him and told him he wanted him—he got up and said, "What do you want me for?"—he said, "Come along, I will tell you-where is your hat?"—and while he was picking his hat up, the Inspector came in—he picked his hat up from under the seat—it was turned upwards, and my mate's handkerchief dropped out of it—Weston took possession of it—it dropped out of the very hat the prisoner put on his head—I after<lb></lb>wards saw that handkerchief produced to Coker and he claimed it—while Weston was gone with the prisoner, I stopped he hind at the door of the beer-shop with a young man who went with me, and while there a woman named Amy Cordell asked if I should know the hat if I saw it, and she produced it on the table—I did not see her take it from under the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol on the Essex-road. On the 20th of August a complaint was made to me by Smith—I went to Kemp's beer shop with him, a little after nine o'clock—we both went in together—he pointed out the prisoner to me, and I said, "You must go with me, where is your hat?"—he said, "My hat is under the form"—I said, "Put it on, and go with me"—he went to pick it up—I kept my eye upon him, and saw this handkerchief drop from his hat—I picked it up, and Smith said, "That is my partner's handkerchief"—I kept it, and afterwards showed it to Coker, who claimed it—Richardson, the inspector, was with me—he has another hat.</p>

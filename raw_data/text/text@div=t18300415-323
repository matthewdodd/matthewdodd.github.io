            . I was going to my work at half-past one o'clock in the morning, on the 13th of March, and met the prisoner - the prosecutor was following her, crying Stop thief! and she ran towards me; I went to stop her, she turned back; I ran and took her - she fell down, and threw a watch from her; I held her down till the prosecutor came up, and took her - I saw the constable take up the watch, and I took up the case; the prosecutor charged her with stealing it, in my presence - she said it was not her, it was another girl with her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard Stop thief! called, but did not see the prisoner taken; on going down Gold's-hill I saw the prosecutor, who said she had got his watch from him; she said she had not taken it, but another girl had - she ran, and was stopped; I asked where the other girl threw the watch - she pointed out the place; I took it up, and the witness took the case - the prosecutor gave his name as Thomas Walker - he is master of a vessel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I was not the person? A. Yes; I saw the prosecutor and her stand at the end of Gold's-hill. as I was going on my beat, five minutes before the alarm; there was another girl at the other corner - the prosecutor said it was his watch; he is gone to sea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man, who asked me to go home with him; I said I would not - I saw him talking to another woman; I went down Three Cups-alley - he came and took hold of me, and I said, "Let me go - I will walk with you;" we went on to Gold's-hill, and this witness came, and took me.</p>

On the 13th of March, at a quarter before seven o'clock, I was at the corner of King-street—I felt something at my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side, putting his foot on the curb-stone—I went and accused him of it—he said he was innocent—I said he should go to the station-house—</p>

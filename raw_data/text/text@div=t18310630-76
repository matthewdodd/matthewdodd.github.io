               <p>WILLIAM MITCHELL. I live in Harp-lane, and am clerk to Mr. Prosser, a wine-merchant. I was up at my desk, and saw the prisoner and another in the lane - Mr. Ramsay and a gentleman were walking before them; I saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Ramsay's pocket, lift it up, put his hand in, and take out the handkerchief, which he put into his right-hand pocket; I immediately ran out, and told Mr. Ramsay in Tower-street; I pointed the prisoner out, and directly he saw me point, I saw him take the handkerchief from his pocket, and throw it down - I pursued, and caught him at the corner of Mark-lane, without losing sight of him; he struck me a blow in the chin - I had done nothing but endeavour to apprehend him; I do not know what became of his companion - he was behind him at the time of the theft, but I could see what he was doing; the prisoner was secured opposite the new Corn -exchange, by a gentleman.</p>

               <p>THOMAS DEVY. I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The young lad came up and collared me - he shook me, and knocked me down; I struck him for it, and then he said I stole the gentleman's handkerchief.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MITCHELL. I did not knock him down - I collared him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my father and mother in Portpool-lane. On the night of 9th May, I went into Mr. Cooper's shop, on Eyre-street-hill, with Reynolds and Green—I bought a halfpenny loaf, and a halfpennyworth of treacle—after we got out, Reynolds beckoned to me, and said, "Will you come with me and sell a bar of soap?"—he showed it me, and said he got it from Mr. Cooper's—I did not see him take it—I went with him down Field-lane to a lodging-house—he went in, and I stopped outside with Green—after a time, Reynolds came out with fivepence, and gave me a penny, and Green a penny, and kept twopence-halfpenny himself—there was a bigger boy there—I did not see how much he gave him.</p>

One night last month I went into Mr. Cooper's shop with Gristy and Green—I took a bar of soap from the top of a pile—Gristy did not see me take it—I went over the way, and Gristy, Green, me, and a bigger boy than me who joined us went down Field-lane—I went into a house there that has "Three-pence a night for single men"—I saw the prisoner there, and said, "Please, Sir, will you buy a bar of soap?"—he took it, looked at it, put it into his side pocket, and went out, and when he came back he said he had got sixpence</p>

About the middle of last month, I went to Mr. Cooper's shop with Gristy—when we came out, Reynolds was on the other side of the way—he had come out first—he called as over, and showed us a bar of soap—I went with them down Fleet-row, and Reynolds went into a bed-house—he came out with sixpence I think—I think it was silver—he bought a halfpenny hot roll, a halfpennyworth of treacle, and some chestnuts—he gave me a penny, and Gristy a penny.</p>

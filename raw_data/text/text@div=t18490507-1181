On 10th April, I was on duty at Greenwich fair, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner go behind a gentleman, and stand very close to him with his hands in front of him—I could see from behind him that his elbows were moving, but I could not get to see what his hands were doing—he went from that gentleman to another, and stood in the same position—I could see his elbows moving as before—he then went to a third gentleman, and then to a fourth—I then saw him go to a fifth gentleman, and he took this handkerchief from his hind coat-pocket, and put it in his coat and came out from amongst the people—I told the gentleman he had been robbed, and if he would come with me I could find the handkerchief; but he went one way and the prisoner another—I followed him—he went out of the fair and into a passage leading from the market, and I saw him undo the</p>

I assisted Carpenter in apprehending the prisoner—I saw four handkerchiefs beside this white one taken from his breast—he made great resistance—I found two handkerchiefs on him in addition to the nine found by the other officer, and one pair of gloves, and one odd glove—he appeared sober when we first took him, but be afterwards appeared very drunk—it was only sham.</p>

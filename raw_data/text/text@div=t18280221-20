            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of February, about two o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Macclesfield-street, and heard Dyson cry, Watch! I ran towards the sound - heard the cry repeated, and as I approached near the window, I saw two men coming along, and saw something drop from them; but what I could not exactly perceive - I thought it looked like papers - the wind blew some of them towards the curb. I took the prisoners. Dyson called out that thieves had broken into his house, and that one had a light coat on. I said I had got them - I took them back to his house; he was leaning out of his window, and said, "Those are the men - I can swear to them." They heard that - some Islington watchmen came to my assistance, and I left them in their charge, while I returned to where I stopped them, and picked up some papers. We took the prisoners to the watch-house. I returned to my beat. Sheldrake called me; we went and searched the spot where I had taken them. I looked about with my lantern, and picked up a small book; and on the threshold of a door, No. 24, Macclesfield-street, I found a file; this was about one hundred yards from the house, and on the window-cill I found part of another file; I gave them to the officer. When I first saw the prisoners, they were walking; but when I got nearer to them, they stopped, and the papers dropped from them - they said they had done nothing - there is a gas-light nearly opposite to where I took them, and one within a few yards of the prosecutor's house; there are three between the spot and the prosecutor's house, which would enable him to see any body who jumped out of window. I could not see which of them dropped the papers; but it was one of them, I am certain.</p>

            . I am headboro' of St. Luke. On the 14th of February, a little after two o'clock in the morning, the prisoners were brought to the watch-house, charged with breaking into Dyson's house. I found a knife on Wilson. I went out - the watchman shewed me the spot where he had taken them, and opposite No. 24, Macclesfield-street I found a small account-book; there was a file on the cill of the door, and another on the windowcill - I produce them.</p>

            . I lost nothing of my own. I examined the closet after Craven left, and saw a book similar to this, and the large file. I think that was on the 12th; there was nothing else in the parlour - the watch-house is nearly half a mile from where the papers were found.</p>
               <p>The prisoners put in a written Defence, as follows: - "On the 14th of February we went to visit a relative in Ball's-pond-road, and on returning to our residence in the neighbourhood of Old-street, when we came through City gardens, the watchman took hold of us, and charged us with robbing the prosecutor's premises; feling ourselves innocent we surrendered willingly - at our examination the prosecutor said he saw us both come out of the parlour window, which he thought must have been left open, the shutters having only been closed the night before. We boldly denying his assertion, and being taken some distance from the spot, we trust will prove our innocence.</p>

I had given some instructions to Clements and Ballard, and on the 31st of July they came and brought four silk handkerchiefs and two silk handkerchiefs, four of which I could positively swear to, from a mark which was then on them, but which is now gone: this one I had had in my hand the evening before, and I bad missed them; I know the patterns of the others - we got a search-warrant and went to the house of Staples; she was present, and we found two gown pieces, this cambric handkerchief, three gloves and a variety of other articles; I can swear to the gown prints and to this muslin, which has a private mark on it; I believe them all to be Mr. Verey's; she said they had been given to her by Wilks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She told you that, on their being found? A. Yes; she gave up a purse, which she said belonged to Wilks - I did not see how much was in it: I heard Wilks and she were going to be married - she lives with some persons who I understood were her parents; she said Wilks had given her all the things - many of them are small remnants, and are not of much value; some of the gloves were in the possession of her father - I believe he is a bell-hanger.</p>

Oxford-street, where we found the female prisoner: I said to her, "Henry is in custody - we have a search-warrant, and are in possession of a good many facts to prove that you have received some things; you may do as you please about what you say to me:" she said, "I shall not deny it;" she then opened the drawers, and gave me these things - she said she had lived in the same family, and expected to be married to Henry - that they had bought those drawers and some other things; she gave me this purse of money, which she said he gave her to save for him. Wilks said at the office that he gave these things to her, and she knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She at once told you of it? A. She gave me the money; I believe I first said, "Whose money is this?" there was no hesitation about her - she behaved very well: I believe it was not her father and mother who lived in the house with her.</p>

            . I live at Harlesdon-green, on the Harrow-road; I work for Mr. Pipe, a farmer. About nine o'clock, on the 13th of April, I was making a hedge- I went to work after breakfast, and saw the two prisoners on the dung-hill; I did not know them before, but they are the men; I went nearly close to them, and saw each of them take a basket on his shoulder, and go away; I had left my tools there, and I thought they had taken them - but they had taken the harness out of a hole there; my master came across the field, and told me to go after them; I did not, but they came back soon after, and with the same two baskets; my master then told me to follow them, and he would come on a horse; I went after them- I lost sight of Smith, basket and all, but I took Johnson, and found in his basket two pairs and a half of hames, a collar, and two pairs of traces; my master asked where he got it; he said the other man gave him half-a-crown to help him; we took him to the Plough public-house at Kensall-green, and there the harness was owned by Mr. Broughton.</p>

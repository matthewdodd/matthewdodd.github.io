               <p>Q. Look at that, and see if that is part of the cloth that you sent? - A. I cannot say, I am not the dresser.</p>
               <p>- GARDINER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cloth-dresser, employed by Messrs. Yarbury and Horier.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that piece of cloth, and tell me if you know it? - A. I can swear to this cloth by the number and the mark, here is the mark in the list, that I cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Look and see if the manufacturing mark has been cut off? - A. Yes, it has; there was one place where there was the wool rubbed off, and my employer ordered me to take a bit from another part, and apply it to the rubbed part, which I did, and by that I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Grobety). Q. Did you receive a letter, containing an account of the numbers of the different pieces? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew it to the last witness, Mr. Velvin? - A. Here is the invoice which I received with the goods.</p>
               <p>Veloin. Q. This letter is my writing, but it only says, one piece and four ends, the number is not in the invoice.</p>

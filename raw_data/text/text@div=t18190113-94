Martin went into the shop, she fell on her knees, and begged for mercy, saying it was her first offence. I got an officer, and took him to the shop, where the property was found - they were ordered to appear on the thursday, and were committed.</p>

I asked him for some laperne-dishes; he said he had some, but he got them out of the house immemediately, for he sold them to some Jews; he told me who the Jews were, and I went to them, and found eleven laperne-dishes.

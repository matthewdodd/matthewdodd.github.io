About 10 o'clock, on Easter Sunday, I heard some people at my door; I unbolted it directly, and three or four men forced me down; I do not recollect who; when they knocked at the door first, they threw something over my head; I was afraid to look up or open my eyes, as they swore they would blow my brains out; they asked me what money I had in my pocket; I said about two guineas, or two and a half; they took my shoe and knee buckles; they asked me what money I had in the house; I told them I had three or four guineas in my bureau. I lost nine gowns, they were my deceased wife's, two pair of gold wire earrings, and several silk handkerchiefs; the silver watch and gold rings were mine; they took three or four guineas; they staid in the house between four and five hours.

On Easter Sunday, at night, I was sitting in the bar, about 10 o'clock, some body came to the door, and my brother went to see who it was, and they said they wanted something to drink; two men came into the bar, one with a pistol, the other with a cutlass; the man with the cutlass desired me to lie down, or he would cut my head off; I laid down and he tied my head with a child's frock; after that they wrapped my head up in a blanket, and rifled my pockets; as soon as that was done, they began plundering the bar; I could hear but not see. I lost seven gowns, three black cloaks, and a red one, nine silk handkerchiefs, two tuckers, and some black lace, I don't know how much; a half guinea in gold, and a Spanish dollar; I suppose the whole together about 15 l.</p>

               <p>I am a widow. This woman came to me on Easter Wednesday, and brought a cloak, and begged that I would go and pawn it; I said no, but the child might go; which she did, and brought 10 s. she gave me the duplicate; she said that she knew of a good speak, and she would row in it; my Lord, she knows I am alone woman, and that this girl was the eldest of seven children that I had to work for; she said she had plenty of plants; and she knows there were a cutlass and an iron crow found up her chimney. I hope your Lordship will consider my case.</p>

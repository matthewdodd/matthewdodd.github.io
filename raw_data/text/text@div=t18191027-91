On Sunday morning, the 11th of October, I went round the cottage, every thing was then safe. On Tuesday, the 12th of October, I went with some men to measure the work, and found the lead taken from the cottage and building attached to it - it was torn from the nails; next day it was produced by Davis. I compared it with the roof, it corresponded exactly, every hole fitted the nails - about two hundred weight was taken. Bullard has been in Mr. Coutt's service two years.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was near Fitzroy-square, and saw Bullard going along Clipstone-street, very heavily laden; I followed him round to Chalton-street, into an old iron-shop. Immediately he went in he put down this basket, with the lead in a bag; I went up to him and found it was lead - I handcuffed him. The woman of the shop exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Why do you bring your lead here, to get me into trouble?" - this was before it was opened. While I was handcuffing him, Turner came by with another quantity of lead. Seeing me there, he made the best of his way down the street as fast as he could - he knew me. I left a man in charge with Bullard in the shop, followed, and came up with him. I said,</p>
               <p>"What. Turner! are you in it again? you know my handcuffs will fit you." He said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Davis, I found this." I called a coach, and took them both to the office with the lead. It was afterwards compared, and fitted nail by nail to the building. I found a pair of silver spoons on Turner; he said he brought them from sea with him - they have been claimed.</p>

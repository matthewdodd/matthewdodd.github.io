                  </hi>. I am clerk to Charles John Moakes, who has a warehouse in Great Dover-street, in the parish of Newington. On Saturday night, 26th March, about 11 o'clock, I secured the warehouse with a padlock and two bolts—the counting house leads to the warehouse—it is under the tame roof, next to it—you can go out of one into the other—there is a door between them—I locked the counting house as well—it opens into the passage leading to the back door of the warehouse—I fastened that door with a spring latch, but there is no bolt—that door goes into the passage which leads to the dwelling house, and there is also a door into the street—I fastened two doors with a latch, and the outside door I shut and barred—next morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock I was called up—I examined the premises between 9 and 10 o'clock—I observed the gate of the warehouse which opens into Napier-street—the hasp was forced off, and the padlock was left on the hasp; they could then draw the bolts and get in—the bolts were drawn—I went into the counting house, and missed a cloak, and from the passage a copper coalscuttle, and two bares which were hanging up—the door between the warehouse and the passage was open—I know the prisoner—I saw him on Saturday night, the 26th, from 10 to 11 o'clock, about the premises of the coal shed—Mr. Moakes had got tickets of a charitable institution for Easter; coals are delivered to people, and those who are not able to fetch them pay persons to do so—I believe the prisoner came to take away some coals—I expect he got over the wall, and broke into the counting house first—I found the counting house door open in the morning—it opens with a spring lock, which must have been opened with a latch key—there was a mark as of force on the lock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Sunday morning, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I was on duty in Napier-street, and saw the prisoner put his head out of the door of Mr. Moakes's coal warehouse, which was open—when be saw me he drew his head in again—I went to the door, and tried it, but it was then fast by some means—I did not know the prisoner before—I said, "Who is there?"—the prisoner said, "Halloo!"—I asked him to open the door, and beard him walk through the counting house, which goes towards the yard—I then sprang my rattle, got assistance, tried the door again where I had seen the prisoner, and it came open—in the coal warehouse I found a copper coalscuttle in a coal sack, and on the sack lay two hares—soon afterwards I went over the walls of four or five houses by a ladder, and found the prisoner in a water-closet four doors off—he said, "Could not you do without a ladder?"</p>

             sworn. - I live at Willsden, I am the parish-clerk: On Sunday, the 26th of May, I locked up the church, and left it as I usually do; I left a bible and a prayer-book on the Minister's desk, and a prayer-book on my own desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they left there when you locked the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100051"></xptr>church up? - A. Yes, I locked the church up at one o'clock at noon on Sunday; on Tuesday morning I was called up at five o'clock, and when I got to the church, I found the door was open, it was unbolted, and the window was broke by the side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the door that you locked? - A. It was not; that door was at the chancel, at the north end of the church, and the door that unlocked was the south door.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window was this by the side of the chancel-door? - A. A casement, with two upright and two cross iron bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this door bolted when you left the church? - A. Yes, I bolted it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window whole or broken when you left the church? - A. The window was whole, and the bars were all in their places; when I saw it on Tuesday morning, one of the upright bars was drawn out of its place, and one of the cross bars was bent to the bottom, so as to admit any person in, and the glass of the window was pushed into the church; I went into the church, and missed the Minister's bible and prayer-book, and my prayer-book; I did not miss the keys then; I missed several other prayer-books.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time in May last see the prisoner at the bar in that neighbourhood? - A. Yes, on Monday, the 27th of May, about half past five o'clock in the afternoon, he was walking by the side of Willsden church, in the church-yard, against the window under the wall; I saw him, and a woman at a distance from him under the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing afterwards? - A. I saw him turn back; he turned back to the north door, and he peeped into the window under his hat, which he held to keep the fun from his eyes; he came to me while I was putting some hay in a cart, and asked me the way to Harrow, after he had looked into the church; I told him I did not rightly know; I shewed him the church at a distance. Then he asked me if there was any public-house near; I told him there was; I directed him to the Six Bells at Willsden; he had a bundle under his arm in a green curtain, or something that was green.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time buy any prayer-books or bible of him? - A. On Tuesday, the 28th of May last, about twelve o'clock, he came to my lodgings at No. 12, Broad-street, Bloomsbury; he asked me if I would purchase some books; I asked him where they were; he told me at his lodgings. I accordingly went with him to a court in Chick-lane (Wright's-alley, I think it is,) and there he shewed me two folio prayer-books, and one folio bible; I agreed to give him one pound seven shillings for them; I took some books with me at the time; he asked me to purchase them; I told him I had not money enough to spare, and he said he would take some books in exchange; I took with me as many books as came to thirteen shillings and sixpence, and I gave him three shillings in silver, and I promised to give him the half-guinea more in the afternoon, if he called on me for it. He called, and I told him to call in the evening again, as it did not suit me to pay him at that time; I had suspicion that these books had not been come honestly by; I had dealt with him six months before; he said he would call again; in the mean time I went to the Magistrate, and enquired; he came to me in the evening, I was not at home, I was at Bow-street; and the Magistrate ordered two officers to go with me to his lodgings; I left the books at Bow-street; I went with the officers to his lodgings about half past ten o'clock on Tuesday evening.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Bow-street; I produce a bible and two prayer-books, I received them at Bow-street: On the 28th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went with the last witness to the prisoner's lodgings; in searching his lodgings, I found this bunch of keys lying under his wife, between the mattress and the bed, he was in bed with her; his lodging is in some court in Chick-lane, I believe the name of it is not Wright's-buildings; I went by the order of Mr. Bond to Willsden, to try the different locks in the church, and they all fitted the locks on the different pews; there was a particular lock on one pew, and this key opens it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rich.) Are these the books that you took of the prisoner, and took to Bow-street? - A. They are the books that I agreed to give twenty-seven shillings for; I left them at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please you my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - I am a stranger here, I am a Yorkshire man born, and a cloth-worker by trade; our trade, by the war and the blockade of Hamburgh, grew very slack; we were about eighteen hundred of us employed in Leeds, in Yorkshire. I, having a little money before hand, came up to London to see if the trade was any better here; finding it not so, I laid my money out in publications, and for the last two years I made a practice of travelling from fair to fair, coming to London in order to buy publications that would suit the country. Coming up this time, I lit of a man in High Holborn as I was going to see my mother-in-law in Oxford-market, his name was

            's, near Smithfield; I had been there about six weeks; I paid him two pounds in notes, and ten shillings in money for them; I went out to get a pot of beer, and in the mean time I was out, my wife said he gave her these keys to take care of them till he returned; I never saw them, this is the truth, and nothing else but the truth. Accordingly, when we parted, I went to Mr. Rich, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he was not at home; his good wife had been lying in; she told me that he would be in in about half an hour, and when he came in, said I to Mr. Rich, you were speaking to me about a bible, I have purchased one of a man that lives near Uxbridge; he told me he was short of money, but he would go down with me to my apartment; I said he should have the bible at one pound four shillings, the new prayer-book at eighteen shillings, and the other at eight shillings, provided he would let me have publications for return of money; he said he could not do that; as we were in a friendly habit of buying I should let him have it at about a pound or so, a guinea or so on, and he would let me have books to make a return: I told him I could not afford them at all at that price; he then stated to me, he would give me books worth 13 s. 6 d. they were new just as they came from the press, and 3 s. 6 d. he paid me in money; some of the books were twelve shillings which he let me have at two; accordingly, he said, if I would go to his house he would give me the remainder; I went to his house about four o'clock, he asked me to come again at six; I went about seven to his house, his wife and the good lady who had taken care of her in her lying in, said, he was not at home, I must call on the day following and they would pay me the money, accordingly I went home and went to bed with my wife, and between ten and eleven o'clock, up comes Mr. Rich; he said, Midgeley, I said, what do you come so late for; I want you, he said; I said, is it necessary to get up; no, he said, it will do in the morning; there were four men laying in the room; one of the officers went to another bed; Mr. Rich said, this is the man that sold me the books; the officer tied my hands; I came along with them to Bow-street with the greatest pleasure; Mr. Rich said, you have brought me into a hobble; I did not know what they took me for; I had no suspicion at all about these books: they put me in a place all night; in the morning they took me to Fulham, and these books along with them; there was a church broken open there; they did not know me or these books to be their property. I came back to Bow-street, then they heard another church was broken open at Willsden; and they sent the books there; I knew nothing of the robbery; I asked them to let me go along with them, they would not give me the opportunity; I have no one to speak in vindication of my cause but myself.</p>

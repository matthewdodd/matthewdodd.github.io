            . I live at Bethnal-green. In March last I delivered some sheets. blankets, tablecloths, and napkins, to the prisoner, to take to his cousin's apartments; I did not count them: I cannot say whether there were any pillow-cases - they were Mr. Watson's property.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. I missed this property from my apartments - he never gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give my sister leave to take any thing that was there, and to make use of it? A. The keys were in her possession; she might use the things, but I did not give them to her - that was at Bethnal-green; the property at Beaumont-street I had confided to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday. the 13th of December, on another charge; I searched Mr. Watson's apartment - there was scarcely any thing there; no sheets on the bed, and the drawers empty.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON re-examined. Q. Up to what period did the prisoner continue in the lodging? A. From the time I took them till he was apprehended; the officer took the key of my apartment from him: this property ought to have been there - I believe I have been there but twice since I had the lodgings; I think they were taken in May, but cannot tell when - I never had any other apartments; I have paid two or three quarters' rent, and there is one to pay.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor gave my sister, Mrs. Shaw, charge of these things, and she made use of them before he took her to France; they were never taken to Beaumont-street.</p>

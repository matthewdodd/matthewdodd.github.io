I lost three loaves of sugar on Whitsun-Monday; the prisoner Hussey and a boy, the evidence, came for a halfpenny worth of small beer; I saw them looking at the sugar loaves, but had no suspicion of them; I locked my door and went out between seven and eight o'clock to see a gentlewoman; I returned in about half an hour and found my door broke open; the hinges were wrenched off and the lock broke; some of the neighbours told me Hussey and Hogg had been in and out several times; I went next morning and searched their lodgings, and found my sugar; they lodge three doors higher up the lane; I found two loaves of sugar in Hussey's room, and the paper of the other loaf in Hogg's room; it was marked D, as all mine are marked; the two loaves were marked No. 4 and 11; I am sure they are my property.</p>

            . I lodged at Mr. Spencer's when the fact was done. On the 31st of May, in the evening, I came down for some vinegar and saw the prisoners at the shop door; I told them Mrs. Spencer was not at home; about ten minutes after I came down again and saw them at the door; I thought being holiday time they might be in liquor; the next thing I heard was that the door was broke open.</p>

I am a lapidary: I was standing at my own door; Mrs. Hussey asked me to go and have some beer with her; I said I did not care if I did; we went to the prosecutor's and had a pint of small beer; while the woman turned to draw it, she beckoned to me to take one of the sugar loaves; I did not take it then; we drank the beer and went away; Mrs. Hussey went home and fetched Mrs. Hogg; I stood at my own door; they watched about the shop till the woman went out; we saw her go out and lock the door; Hussey bid me go and fetch a chissel down; I work at Hussey's house; I brought the chissel down, and Mr. Hussey desired me to wrench the hinges off the door; I was not agreeable; she said I should or else her sister should not give me any work; so I did it; Hussey shoved the lock back with a piece of thin iron; then we got in; I put two sugar loaves in Hussey's apron, and one in Mrs. Hogg's: we carried them up to Mrs. Hoskins's; Mrs. Hogg took one home and the rest were left there: Mrs. Hoskins is Hussey's sister.</p>

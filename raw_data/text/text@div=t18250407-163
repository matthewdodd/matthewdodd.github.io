            . I keep a shoe shop on Holborn-bridge, and am constable of Holborn. On the 7th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was on <placeName id="t18250407-163-crimeloc877">Holborn-bridge</placeName>

At the Compter I found two handkerchiefs in the thigh of Lewis's trowsers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEWIS. Q. What distance was you from me? A. Close to you. I had enough to do to lay hold of you; they behaved most desperately.</p>

               <p>"This will do for you," and at Guildhall he had to choose which handkerchief he would swear to.</p>

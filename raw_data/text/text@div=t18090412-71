            . I am a constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse; I took the purse from her pocket, it contained a seven shilling piece, a shilling, and a few halfpence; the prosecutor claimed the purse.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man asked me in Whitechapel to take a walk with me in an indecent manner, and behaved very indecent; he said take the purse if you will go up any turning; I did not choose; he gave me the purse and a seven shilling piece, and because I would not be indecent in the street, he asked me for it again; when I came to the watchhouse it was found in my pocket - then I said if you are wicked enough to have me locked up after giving it me, you shall be locked up too - I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Partridge. The prosecutor had no charge given of him; he living at Poplar, staid with me to go before the magistrate the next morning to substantiate the charge.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he remain in the lodging with her all this time? - A. Yes; I never knew him sleep out of the house, not be out of the house after ten o'clock; I did not miss any thing till the officers of Bow-street gave me information, and then I missed a cotton counterpane off the bed, worth about eleven shillings, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was the woman prisoner that you let the lodging to? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the quilt that was upon the bed at the time they hired the lodging, that was stolen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, what became of the quilt upon the bed? - A. It had got dirty, was put out to be washed, and a clean one put on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the lodging was let? - A. I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the best quilt; was the quilt you lent last such as you generally let with your lodgings? - A. The first quilt was; and this I put on occasionally, while the other is washed.</p>
               <p>Q. The quilt you lent them was too good to let with the lodgings? - A. No it was not, because the other was better than that; when the first gets dirty we put on the other.</p>

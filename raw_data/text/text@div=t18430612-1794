                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 3rd of June, I went with two females into Union-court, and into a house there—I had some gin given me, I and became stupified after taking it—I was beaten by the two women, and turned out of the house—I received wounds which I cannot account for how they came—I received wounds on my head, one in front and two behind—I they are such wounds as might have been inflicted by a poker or crowbar—I have not been able to do any business since—the wound on my forehead was a large cut—it was about the width of my thumb nail, rough, such as a poker I would make, not a sharp cut—it was a bruise, and I had another over the I eye which was not cut at all—I do not remember being struck with a poker.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, the 3rd of June, 1 pot my bead out I of the window in consequence of a row that was going on, and saw some vio-lence offered to the prosecutor—after he got out of the house I saw the prisoner with a poker in her hand—she came out of No. 12, next door to roe, I with a poker in her band—I heard a man's voice say, Hit him <hi rend="italic">Louey</hi>"—she said she had hit him—as the crowd stood there she had the poker held up—his face was turned towards her at the time, and bis back towards me—she held the poker up in such a direction as if it came down would hate struck hit forehead, and she made a blow which, I suppose, struck bis forehead, but I did not see it go on his forehead—I afterwards taw him, and he was bleed-ing at the back of the head.</p>

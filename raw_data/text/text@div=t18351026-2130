                  </hi>. I am a turner, and lodge in West-street, Albany-street, Regent's Park—on the night of the 6th of October, between nine and ten o'clock, I met the prisoner by accident—she said, "Where are you going?" or "How do you do?"—we continued on till we came to Wit<lb></lb>tlebury-street, going from Gordon-square, through Euston-square, into Wittlebury-street—I was going on my way home—at parting, I left her some few paces, and then found she had taken the whole of the money in my pocket, which was one sovereign, one half-sovereign, three shillings, and one sixpence—I had felt something meddling about me, but had no idea she was going to rob me—she had hold of my arm—I found my pocket opened and missed my money—I took hold of her and accused her of it—she said she had not got it—I requested her to walk along with me—we met a police-man—she then threw the money into the dirt—it was picked up on the spot.</p>

At a little before ten o'clock, on the night of the 6th of October, I was at the end of Wittlebury-street—I heard the prosecutor say to the prisoner, "Give me my money"—I then approached towards them and saw her throw something awny—a little boy took up two shillings—a man took up half a sovereign and gave it to me—I asked her if she had any more money—she said, "No"—I took her left hand and found a sovereign—she said, "That is the shilling he gave me."</p>

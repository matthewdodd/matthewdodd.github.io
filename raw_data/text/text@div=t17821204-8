            ; I lost four sheets and ten pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call pieces? - Coarse cloths, rubbers, or dusters; I brought them into my room; I had fetched them from being dried; I brought them in as near as I can guess about seven at night, the 22d of November; I had just brought them in, and went up stairs and came down, and somebody knocked at the door, and I locked my parlour door and went over to the coal-shed to serve a peck and a half of coals, and somebody got in at the window while I was gone; I saw the things in the parlour when I went over the way; I was there some time; I could not find my measure, and a gentleman called out, and said I was robbed; I came back,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040012"></xptr> and my cloaths lay in the street; I called out for assistance, and picked them up.</p>
               <p>C ourt. Did you see any body drop them? - No, I laid hold of the prisoner, a man had hold of him; at that time the things lay in the coach-way.</p>
               <p>Was the window fastened? - The window was not fastened, only pulled down.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What occasioned you to seize the prisoner? - I saw him convey the basket out of the window; I was coming down the street between seven and eight; I actually saw him convey the basket out of the ground-floor window, and laid hold of him while the basket was in his hand, that was the reason of the clothes being thrown about the highway; there were three men with the prisoner, they all escaped.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to by Mrs. Streight.)</p>
               <p>Court. I see you suppose them altogether to be worth about 50 s.? - My Lord, we were told to value them, and I did not know; I never was upon any such thing before; I leave that to the Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was I when Crane laid hold of me? - Off of the pavement, with the basket in his hand.</p>

               <p>I was coming a quite contrary way; I heard a cry out, I stopped and asked what was the matter; I had nothing on me; he came to me on the flag stones, and laid hold of me, and said, says he, you are one of them.</p>

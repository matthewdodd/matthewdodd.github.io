               <p>COURT. Q. Can you go from your landlord's room to yours up the common stairs? A. No; it is a coffee-shop; there is one door leads into the coffee-shop, but we enter at the second door at the left of the stairs - there are other lodgers - the landlord's room is on the ground floor - there is only one staircase to the house, and only one door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Had you a young lad, in the service of Mr. Moore, who has lately been discharged? A. No; not in Mr. Moore's service - there was a young man living with us for about three months, but he left three months before - I never said I knew who it was that cut away the silk - we had the young man up on suspicion - I said I suspected he would do so - we had a witness at Worship-street to prove that he had threatened it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear him threaten any thing? A. No; I said I had reason to suspect him, because I was told what he had said - the boy's name is Lyons - he is not here - the magistrate discharged him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Lyons? A. I never saw him, to my knowledge - I know Morris and Hyman - I never heard them say they knew who cut away the silk.</p>

            . I am the brother of Catherine Lazarus.

            . I lives in Mansel-street, Goodman's-fields, and am in the general way. On the 13th of March, I bought twenty yards of green silk, and thirty-three-yards of black, of Joseph Lazarus, and gave him 2s. 9d. a yard - it came to 7l. 5s. 9d. - I have his invoice in my pocket - I paid the whole of the 7l. 5s. 9d. exactly - on the very same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030092"></xptr>day I sold fourteen yards of it to a casual customer, at 3s. a yard, for a dress - Lazarus came to my house in consequence of something, and I packed up the rest of the silk in a parcel, put my seal to it, and delivered it to Mr. Hart at his private residence - I am certain it was the silk I bought of Lazarus.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many Sessions ago had I the pleasure of seeing you? A. About seventeen months ago it is since I was imposed upon by the very man at the bar, through his son - and I believe you were counsel in the case - it was tried before his Lordship - I admit it - I have no reason to be ashamed of it - I was tried in the New Court - it was an unfortunate event, which I am not ashamed of, being an innocent man - I was not acquitted - Mr. Bodkin defended me - I was sentenced to six months in the House of Correction, but, in consequence of my previous character, I was liberated after five-weeks - previous to that, I was secretary and founder of a charitable institution, and have retained it since - my friends are convinced I am innocent, and was most unjustly convicted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a charge of stealing, some handkerchiefs, where the patterns were not complete? A. Yes, it was - they were sold with the maker's name on them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not you think it unfortunate that you should purchase stolen silks in so short a time afterwards? A. Undoubtedly; but there are events in a man's life over which he has no control - I used every caution, and bought them of a respectable man - the goods came to 7l. 5s. 9d., and I paid Lazarus the full amount - I have some of the satin here - I should think 2s. 9d. a yard is a fair price for it - it is not worth 4s. or 5s. in the job trade - the job trade is goods which come into hands from the decline of the season, and various modes - I do not exactly recollect how I paid the silver to Lazarus - it the 9d. was paid at all, it was in pence - I paid the whole of it- on my solemn oath I paid Lazarus 7l. 5s. 9d. - I did not keep back any portion of it, to my recollection - not a penny- I will not swear positively as to the pence - I paid the pence, to the best of my recollection - I believe 2s. 9d. to be a fair price - I have dealt in silks some years - Lazarus said it came out of pledge - that was in consequence of my remarking to him, that the silk was out of condition - it was rather tumbled, which is not uncommon in job goods - I certainly will swear it is not worth 4s. a yard - I sold it for 3s. - the person is not here who bought it of me - I sold it to a casual customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep an open silk mercer's shop? A. Yes; it is a shop consisting of two front windows - it was a parlour originally, but is converted into a shop - there is no shop window - goods are in the window - there is no name over the door - the door which leads to the shop is open by day - the street door is not shut, it many be occasionally - I swear there are goods in the window, and have been for years - there is a counter - the things in the window can be seen outside - I place sometimes ribbons, sometimes handkerchiefs and flannel in the windows - the door is not open at night, to my knowledge - if it is, it is not with my permission - the outer door is left open during the day for customers to come into the shop - I have got no light in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold fourteen yards of the silk - what became of the rest? A. It was packed up and taken to Mr. Hart - I make no entry of what I sell - I keep an invoice book for all goods which I buy - I do not keep an account of sales - Mrs. Samuels was by when I sold it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether you keep an entry or not, are you sure the silk you got from Lazarus was the same silk you gave up to Mr. Hart? A. It was.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LAZARUS re-examined. Q. Did you represent to Samuel that the silks came out of pledge? A. I told him the party who sold it to me told me it came out of pledge, which the prisoner did.</p>

            . I superintend Mr. Moore's silk manufactory - I produce the silk which I got from Vann - it is worth 4s. 6d. a yard - when taken from the loom it would be in a rough state, but the value of the material by the weight and quality is 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at the green silk, if that was in a state for sale, what would it be sold at per yard to the public? A. 5s.</p>


               <p>Q. Is 2s. 9d. any thing like a fair price? A. It depends on the condition it is in - I should not like to send it out of our establishment in that state - any dealer that understands his business, would see that is not fit for sale.</p>
               <p>ELKAN HYMAN re-examined. This black silk is mine - I know it by the general appearance of the work, and I have a particular mark to the selvidge - it is the same quality of silk as that taken out of our loom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do not you have that particular mark on all the silk you work on? A. No- it was through a mistake made in the entering.</p>
               <p>LEVIEN MORRIS re-examined. This green silk is the same quality as that taken from my loom - I know the work by the general appearance - I can tell my own work- it corresponds with what was left behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it the same silk as you went before the magistrate about, and charged the boy with stealing? A. Of course.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WESTMACOTT re-examined. I believe this to be my master's silk - there is a general appearance about the silk the witnesses manufacture.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Regent-place, Globe-road, Mile-end. I have known the prisoner between three and four years - on Monday, the 2nd or 3rd of March I went with him to Hitchin, in Hertfordshire - we slept there on Monday evening, attended the market on Tuesday, and left Hitchin on Tuesday evening - we went to Dunstable, slept there on Tuesday, attended the market on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030093"></xptr>Wednesday, slept there Wednesday and Thursday nights, and left on Friday morning for St. Alban's - slept there Saturday and Sunday, and returned to town on Monday - I swear we were not out of each other's company six hours during the whole time, taking, one half-hour and another half-hour together - Hitchin is thirty-three or thirty-four miles from London.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You came home on the 9th? A. We came home on Monday, the 9th of 10th - yes, I can tell, for my birth-day was on the 7th - that was on Friday- I remember now from that particular circumstance - I have known Mr. Nathan, having seen him at his brother's often - I am not particularly intimate with him - we did not sleep in the same room together - we had never gone journeys together before, nor since - there was no companion with us; but we met an individual whom we both knew, both at Hitchin and Dunstable - I gave my testimony to the solicitor in this case - I did not give him the name of any individual who I met - I believe I saw Nathan again on Wednesday, the 12th, at his house, No. 6, Greenfield-street, Whitechapel-road - I went to him on business - he sells handkerchiefs - I never saw him sell silks - we took silk handkerchiefs, ribbons, and lace down with us - he did not deal in silk - he was a general dealer - he has not shop- there is a room you may call a shop, but it is a private house - things hang up in the window - I never saw silks there - I never saw him since this Wednesday that I know of- I may have seen him, but have forgotten it - I have been at his brother's many times - I cannot tell whether on any of those times I have seen him - I may have seen him - I cannot swear whether I have seen him at his brother's since or not - I saw him on the 12th at his own house - I cannot swear that he has been out of the way, but I have heard that he has been in the country - I had been at his house I think about a week before I took the journey with him - I never went to his house before that once - it was at his brother's that we made up our journey together - his brother is here - I had seen him at his brother's about a month before we made up the journey, or it might have been a week - I cannot tell whether his brother was present- some individuals were present - I cannot tell who - if I recollect correctly, one of Henry Nathan's sons was present - I know somebody was present, and one of the sons, but which I cannot swear - some of the sons are invariably in the shop - it was in the shop we made up the journey - there was not half a dozen people present - there might have been customers in the shop - we intended to be out in the country for a month, but the prisoner, at the time he was staying at St. Alban's, was rather queer in the head - I persuaded him to return home - I cannot swear whether his brother was present when I agreed to travel with him- it was between nine and two o'clock that we made the agreement - I have been in the habit of going to his house four or five times a week, and cannot speak to the hour more correctly - we slept at the Red Lion at St. Alban's - I think the landlord's name is Dalton or Salton - we slept up stairs in the first pair - the Red Lion is at the corner of the road leading to Dunstable - I think we slept at the Black Horse at Dunstable - the landlord's name is Holmes- I did not give his name to the solicitor, for I was not asked - I never knew of this till last Saturday - I do not know but somebody may be here who saw us in the country.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. A. Are you quite sure that from Monday the 3d to the 10th, he was travelling with you to Hitchin and other places? A. Yes.</p>

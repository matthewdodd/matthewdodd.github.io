               <p>Q. Was he searched any where else? - A.Not that I know of; he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your seven shilling piece again? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive he took the seven shilling piece from you? - A.Quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the moment that he took your seven seven shilling piece and the time he was taken hold of? - A. Only while he was running across into Princes-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I take it, it you had seen your seven shilling piece you would not have been able to have sworn to it? - A.Mine was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. But there are a great many good ones, you know? - A. Yes, mine was not bent.</p>
               <p>Q. He was stopped immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched in your presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before the Justice, you swore, that the seven shilling piece you found in his mouth, was the one that he had taken from you? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know where you got that seven shilling piece that you lost? - A. Yes; I received it from a person of the name of Friend.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you are careful when you receive money, that it is good? - A. Yes; the one that I received from Friend was a good one.</p>

             sworn. In the month of June, the particular day I cannot recollect, I was walking with a friend in Bedford-row, I heard a cry of stop him, stop him, he has robbed me, or words to that effect; I looked up and saw the prisoner running from the person, who just now gave his evidence; the prisoner had a small basket in his hand; Mr. Campbell was pursuing him, I assisted in the pursuit, and as he turned into Princes-street, I found he was seized; in an instant several people collected round; some person said, he has got the money in his mouth; in consequence of that, he immediately uttered the money from his mouth; there was a guinea, and I think, two half-guineas, and a seven shilling piece a little crooked; I advised him to take him to Bow-street, and I attended the Magistrate the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge alledged against me; I have a very large family and always worked very hard; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Campbell.) What became of the oranges. - A. I do not know, they were left in the street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

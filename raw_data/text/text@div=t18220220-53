            . I am a watchman, and was in Rosemary-lane about half-past nine o'clock at night; a person said a black man had been robbed. I found the prisoner at the White Hart and Fountain, Rosemary-lane, about half-past ten o'clock that night; the prosecutor had described him, and said he could swear to him among a thousand. I took him into the White Hart, public-house, he ran towards the prisoner, and smacked his face, and said,</p>
               <p>"You d - d thief, give me my money." He denied the charge, and said he never saw him before.</p>

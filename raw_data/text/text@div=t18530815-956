Elliott, the brewers, and took twenty-six sovereigns with him for that purpose—I know that, because he brought them down, put them on the bar table, and counted them—I knew before that that he was in the habit of keeping money in his bedroom, in a bag, which I had seen before, and I know he had money by him at the time—he had to pay Elliott 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Hawkes, of Wal<lb></lb>ham-green, another brewer—he returned again about half past 12 or a quarter to 1 o'clock, and told me he had not been to the brewers—I saw that he had been drinking, and asked him to step in; he stayed a quarter of an hour, and then went out—I expected him back in a few minutes, but he did not come, and I saw no more of him till he was at the station—I know the persons by sight who left the parcel, but not by name; they bad been in the house before, and I should know them again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a warder, in the Penitentiary, at Millbank; my husband has been a warder there four years. On Wednesday morning, 20th July, I went out to take some money to Mrs. Rix, a fishwoman, who lives in Duck-lane; I owed her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left home at a little after 7 o'clock, but did not find her at home—I knew she was in the habit of going to the prisoner's house, and went there to inquire for her—the prisoner was behind the bar, and his sister was in the bar parlour, cleaning—I waited five or six minutes to see Mrs. Rix—there were two men and a woman there when I went in—I saw the tallest of the men give Mr. Roles a parcel over the bar, and ask him if be would take care of it; he nodded his head, stooped, and put it down, but I could not see where he put it—I did not see Mrs. Rix—I left the place—I was not there ten minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was said, when the man pulled out the parcel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked Mr. Roles if he would take care of it till it was called for, without saying when it would be called for—the other man who was with him said, "Be careful with it"—I was not before the Magistrate—I heard of this a week ago last Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Wontner, the attorney for the defence. I received instructions when I first saw the prisoner, in reference to his defence—I heard that the Magistrate intended to commit the prisoner, and I told him I had a defence to offer—he said, "I have made up my mind to commit the prisoner for trial"—to which I said, "I will reserve his defence"—this same defence was given me by the prisoner at the House of Detention, the first time I saw him—Mr. Wonter himself attended on the first examination, and I concluded that he himself had made this statement.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On the 1st of August I went into the service of Mr. Walrond, in <placeName id="t18010916-69-crimeloc353">Grosvenor-place</placeName>

On Friday, the 7th, I missed several things, but had no suspicion of the prisoner till the Monday after she was gone away; I saw her in Grosvenor-place, and I went after her to tell her of a letter that was left at our house for her; and, when I came up to her, I observed a shawl handkerchief upon her neck of mine; I acquainted my master with it, and he got a search-warrant; I was not present when the prisoner was searched.</p>
               <p>JOHN CREEDLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the officers of Queen-square, Westminster; I went with a search-warrant on the 2d of September to Graston-Mews, Fitzroy-square, to a room over some stables, belonging to a Mrs. Smith, where the prisoner slept; we took her when she came home at night to Bed; I found a number of things there which are the subject of another indictment.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOBBS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. On Thursday, the 3d of September, I went with a search-warrant to Mr. Walrond's house; I found two boxes, the keys of which I had from the prisoner the night before; in the boxes I found the articles mentioned in this indictment. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Brain. I know these things to be mine; the thread is my own making.</p>

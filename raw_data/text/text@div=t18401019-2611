                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. My birth-day was Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 14th of October—I had taken liquor on Tuesday night, and was overcome, but it was more through fatigue and excitement during the day—the last thing I remember, was going to my wine-merchant to order some wine for a party, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—next morning I found myself in bed in a brothel kept by the prisoner Cramer—I had the night before twenty-three sovereigns, to the best of my recollection—I am sure there was more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the morning my money and watch were both missing—I dressed, and went down stairs, and saw a female standing by the fire—Cramer came in shortly after—I asked her name—she said "Mary Cramer"—I asked her what place I was in, where it was, and what was the situation—I did not know the street I was in—I do not remember what she said—I said I should step out for a few minutes, and be back again—I did so, and returned with a policeman, and saw her still there—the policeman told her I had been robbed, and wanted to know what had become of my money and watch, and who the girl was who had brought me there—I believe she denied all knowledge of it—she said she did not know who the girl was—to the best of my belief, she was asked who the girl was that brought me there, but I was in a good deal of confusion at the time—the policeman knows what passed.</p>

            . On the 26th of March I lost a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of sheepskin breeches. (The indictment is wrong, I did not lose velvet breeches.) I found my things again at Mr. Master's, a pawnbroker, about three hours after they were taken. My apprentice had seen the prisoner go in there with a bundle; he came and told me. I am a <rs id="t17670429-31-viclabel181" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

               <p>Mr. Masters. The prisoner brought a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of leather breeches, and pledged them to me the 26th of March; the prosecutor came and owned them, and desired me to stop him if he came again. He came again in about three hours after for more money, and I stopt him. I asked him how he came to take his master's things; he said he did it in order to keep it up; that is, I suppose, to keep up his frolick. He was very drunk.</p>

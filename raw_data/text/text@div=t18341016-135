Yes; and the counterparts were pinned on the boots and shoes - this pair of boots has been worn - it is customary for persons to dispose of duplicates - these are pledged in the name of Ann Beattie and

O." - I undertake to swear I had not sold this pair - I had been offered money for them, but did not take it - they are unlike what I generally purchase - I purchased a lot of them for Mr. Cole, a pawnbroker - I sent them, and several pairs were returned - this is one of them- they were returned as too narrow for the country trade - this pair was soiled when I bought them, but they had not been worn - I cannot say when I missed them; it was in the middle of the summer - I swear that no person in my employ ever sold these boots.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I keep a little shop, like my master. A respectable woman came there with this pair of boots on her feet - she had a pair of me, and I took these in exchange.</p>

On Tuesday, the 22nd of February, I left home at one o'clock in the day, leaving no one in the house—I locked the door—I am sure, for I tried the latch of the door, and put the key into my pocket—I came back about six in the evening, and found the door had been burst open—the latch that the lock goes into was broken off—I went into the house and missed a handkerchief from a bundle which was at one corner of my bed-room, and contained other things—I missed a jacket, trowsers, and shirt from the dirty linen—I gave an alarm, and went out into the yard—my husband fetched a policeman—I then missed a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers, three hand kerchiefs, and a petticoat' from a box in the bed-room—they were there when I went out—they were my husband's property—I saw part of them at a clothes-shop in Kent-street, on the Saturday, as I missed them on the Tuesday—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—this shirt belongs to a young man named George Harvey, whom I wash for—these trowsers and jacket are also his—this handkerchief be<lb></lb>longs to my husband.</p>

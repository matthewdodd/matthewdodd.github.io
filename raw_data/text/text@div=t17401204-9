            's in George-Alley, by the Ditch-side; we got a Tinder-Box, and staid there till about one o'Clock, Laxton, Matthews, and Walker, were all there, we were contriving how to get into the House; about one o'Clock we went to the House, and lifted up the Plank of the Window, Coates and Nash took up the Plank, and put me down the Cellar with my Tinder-Box, and they stood at the Top to watch. When I was down I burnt all the Tinder out, and could not get a Light, so I came up Stairs in a Hurry, because I was not willing to stay by myself in the Dark; when Coates found that I had not got a Candle, he gave me a Knock, so I got a Light of a Watchman at the End of the Street, and he and I went down into the Cellar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174012040006"></xptr> and Nash stood on the outside; we went up a pair of Stairs which goes into the House, and wrenched a Door open with Coates's Chissel; after that we open'd the Street Door, and let the Prisoner Nash in, I went to pull the Lock Spring back, but I made a Noise with it, so Coates opened it himself; when Nash came in we went into the Bar, and broke a Locker open, but found nothing in it; we then took down all the Pewter, a large Brass Pottage Pot, and another Copper Pot, a Warming Pot, a Tea Kettle, a Box of Knives and Forks, a Pewter Gallon Pot, a Box Iron and Heater, and a Box of Tobacco. After we had taken them, I wrap'd up the Pewter in my Apron, and Nash put them on his Head, the least Pottage Pot we put into a Bag, which we took out of the Cellar, and carried them and the rest of the Things to Laxton's Lodgings. When we came there, Laxton was a Bed, and the Landlord would not let us in; so Bess Matthews came down and open'd the Door with a Poker, we went up Stairs into Laxton's Room, and found Laxton asleep on the Bed; Walker was there at the same Time, the Prisoner Coates and I lay there all Night, and we desir'd Matthews to put the Goods up safe, so she took the Keys out of Laxton's Pocket, and lock'd the Pewter up in the Drawers, the Dishes we put between the Sacking and the Bed, while Laxton was asleep, and the other Things we put under the Drawers. The next Morning Nash came to us, the three Women Prisoners deliver'd the Goods to us, and we mov'd them by Degrees into Fleet-Lane, to one Wilson's , and Coates was to sell them, he got 4 s. earnest for the Pewter, and then he took the Tea Kettle and the Copper Pot, up higher in the Lane, where we used to sell, but they were stopp'd ; the largest Brass Pot, and the Warming Pot, Laxton and Walker sold for us, and they knew very well how we came by them; they brought us 6 s. for the large Pot, and 1 s. for the Warming Pot, and Coates brought us 2 s. for the Tobacco, all which we three equally divided.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Coates. Ask him how much was divided?</p>
               <p>Lilliston I think it was 4 s. a Piece, they gave me no more,</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walker. Ask him whether we had any of the Money?</p>
               <p>Lilliston. They sold the Pot as I understand, for 7 s. 6 d and the Warming Pot for 1 s 6 d. and they brought us but 6 s. for the Pot, and 1 s. for the other.</p>

             . I am Constable of the Fleet Market, and hearing that a * Shop in the Market had been robb'd a I went to the Prisoner Laxton's Lodgings, to search for suspected Persons, I found a great many Goods in the Room, belonging to the Shop in the Market, and these Plates, Knives and Forks; the Evidence, Coates, Laxton, and Matthews were then there. I took Coates away, and he said he knew nothing of the Matter; I went back and took the Evidence, who was then a-bed, he told me of this House of Mr. Dixey's, and his Account of the Fact to me exactly agrees with what he has said now. I found a Pottage Pot, according to his Directions, in Water Lane, and the Prisoner Walker told me, where she had pawn'd the Funnel, the Box Iron and Heater, and said, they were brought in by the Prisoners. When Coates found that Lilliston was admitted an Evidence, he sent for me, and told me that he could make the most Discoveries, and would do it if he could be made an Evidence. This Chissel was brought to me by the Prisoner Laxton, before I carry'd Coates to the Lord-Mayor, and she said it was the same Chissel with which Coates broke the House.</p>

On the 22nd of December, by direction, I watched at the synagogue; I had seen the prisoner there very often before; there are seats appropriated to subscribers, and there are lockers, in which they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060030"></xptr>keep their books of service - they have locks and keys to them; the prisoner was not a subscriber - I saw him there between three and four o'clock, at the evening service, while the service was going on; I observed him particularly, as he was moving about from one part to the other during service - I had before that missed property from the synagogue; I moved away from one place, and stood at the bar, where I could observe him and be screened from his observation - having observed him shifting about I went up and asked what he had been about; he answered, Nothing - I said, "You have been doing something;" he said he had not - I felt in his bosom, and thought I felt a book; I opened his waistcoat, and found this prayer-book in his bosom - I could not have seen it without opening his waistcoat: I caught hold of him, and brought him out - he began to squall out: it was during the service - I took him out, kept him till the service was over, and while I was holding him, he said, "I hope you will forgive me;" I told him I could not forgive him, for the property did not belong to me - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him: I asked if he could show me the seat he took the book from - he said he could; he went with me, and showed me a seat belonging to Samuel Joseph - the locker was open; I am certain he asked forgiveness; I knew him attending there as a Jew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This book is one volume of several? A. It is one of two volumes; I cannot say whether 5s. is a high price for it - the synagogue is open to all Jews - we never refuse a respectable person a seat if they are not subscribers; I cannot say how often the prisoner has been there - I have seen him several times; I am not always there - we do not usually carry these prayer-books in the bosom, but on our arms; it is not usual to put them under our coats - the prisoner is a foreigner, and has been six years in this country; I am sure he did not say he had taken the book by mistake for his own.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it after he asked forgiveness that he pointed out where he took it from? A. Yes - strangers are admitted to the seats by permission of the subscribers.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you buy the books yourself? A. I bought two of them three years ago; I gave 25s. for the two volumes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you such a prayer-book in your father's seat? A.

               <p>Q. It says, "Informant saith this said book of prayers is his property, and of the, value of 5s." A. That was written before I attended the Lord Mayor - I recollect it being read over to me; I swore I believed it was my book, and might have said it was worth 5s., I forget - I cannot read, and cannot do any writing but my name; I swore before the Lord Mayor that I believed it to be mine - I did not swear positively to it; I told the Lord Mayor my mark was not in it, and I would not take it upon me - I said I would not swear further than my belief; I have a doubt so far as that there are many thousands like it - I have another like it: it is bound the same way as mine - I could produce more like it out of my seat now; there were only two of this sort in the seat on the 22nd of December - I was not there that day; I was sent for the same night, and saw it - the beadle, at the time, said, "Perhaps he took it out of another seat, you had better go round and ask the gentlemen if they miss one;" one was missing from my father's box, and when it was shown to me I said I believed it to be mine - I told the attorney for the elders I believed it to be mine; I swear I did not say it was mine, without saying any thing of my belief.</p>

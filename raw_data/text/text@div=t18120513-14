               <p>Q. When did you lose the ribbons - A. On the 18th of April, about eight o'clock in the afternoon. Having suspected the prisoner we watched her for some time, I thought I saw her take something and put it into her pocket; on her leaving the shop I went after her, the young person said she had taken a piece of ribbon, I followed her and brought her back, she dropped the ribbon; a witness is here that saw her drop it, I sent for Sapwell, he searched her; he has the property.</p>

             I am shop woman to Mr. Bluck. The prisoner came in the shop and asked to look at some made up bows, which she objected to and thought she could make one cheaper by buying the ribbon herself, I then shewed her some ribbons and while I was measuring it I saw her put the piece of ribbon into her apron and from there into her pocket, and as she was going out I told Mr

             - A. I am not, my son lives in my house and has the shop. The prisoner had been there four times before, suspicion arose of her having stolen ribbons, she came in then, I was sitting in a back room in the shop, I came forward; when my son brought her in the shop she dropped the ribbon, I took the ribbon up and kept it till the officer came, saying that I saw it drop from her; she said might it not drop from the counter, I said no it was at the bottom part of the shop were no ribbons are kept. It had my son's private mark on it.</p>

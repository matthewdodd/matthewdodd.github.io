                  </hi>. On the 19th of October I was in my carriage in Sloane-street, about two o'clock in the afternoon—one of my horses became restive, and threw himself down—I descended, with a view of assisting my servants and the by-standers in extricating the horse—when we had done that, a person asked if I had been robbed—I searched, and found my purse had been extracted from my coat-pocket—it contained the money stated—I saw it in the hand of a person immediately after the robbery—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing, and saw Mr. Lewis's carriage stopped, and the horse being restive—I saw Mr. Lewis get out of bis car<lb></lb>riage, and in a moment afterwards I saw the prisoner go behind him, and very deliberately put his left hand into Mr. Lewis's right-hand coat-pocket, and take his purse out—thinking he was a relation of the prosecutor, and merely taking care of the purse, I did not say any thing till he was about to go away—I then asked him about it—he said, "Come along"—as much as to say "Come, I want to speak to you"—I said "No, you have robbed that gentleman, and you shall speak to him"—I collared him, and in a few minutes I had the assistance of a policeman, who took the purse out of his left hand.</p>

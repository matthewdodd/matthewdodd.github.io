               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Neal. My Lord, I never saw him before he was taken. I missed the Watch the 20th of September, pretty early in the Morning: I had lost the outside Case two Days before. It was a Watch that I had to repair; after I had repaired the Watch, in the Intrim, on Saturday Morning, the Watch that belonged to the same Case, I missed; looking at the Window, I saw a Corner of the Glass cut out, where there was about Room to take the Watch out, with which I concluded the Watch was gone by the same Hand that stole the Case. I thought it was not prudent to advertise it directly. I have often observed, when Watches are lost and advertised, without no Questions asked, they are seldom heard of, and I thought it would look like hiding Theft; for that Reason I determined to wait a-while. I waited ten or twelve Days, when one Mr King, Constable in Bartholomew-lane, called upon me, to know if I had not lost a Watch. He said, if you can go over the Way with me, and drink a Glass, I can tell you something about it. He then told me he had taken up a little Boy, one Mr Lane, and he would make no Scruple to tell the whole Affair. When I came, the little Boy told me he was sorry he had said so much, but he would not say any more. He told me what he had said to Mr King, I might make what Use I would of it, he had said one

Then I applied to Mr Gardner (from whom they had taken the Gold Watch) first for his right Name, and whether he could give me any Information about it. In a few Days afterwards, Mr Gardner saw the Prisoner go by, and took him: and I do not remember that he pretended, from first to last, to deny it. The next Day we went to the Lord-Mayor, and his Lordship remembered him as soon as he saw him, that it was the same Boy as was before him for Mr Gardner's Gold Watch, and that was tried the Sessions before last. The Boy turns to me and says, he need not be surprized, I have been tried since that at Kingston Assizes. Upon this my Lord granted a Warrant for

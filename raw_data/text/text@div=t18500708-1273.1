                  </hi>. I live at Tottenham. On 29th Jan., about a quarter to twelve o'clock in the day, I was going towards my own house by a footpath which leads from Silver-street to Church-rood, and the prisoner and a man named Burgess stopped me—they were standing on the footpath before me—I understand there were three, but one I could not swear to, because he was the watcher—I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them—I had seen him before—he lives in Water-lane—the prisoner clasped me round the arms, and pushed me up against the wall, and Burgess came and unbuttoned my pocket, and pulled out my purse, which contained eight shillings and one sixpence, and they both ran away—Burgess was taken and tried two sessions ago.

               <p>- CROCKER sworn. - I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street: On Wednesday afternoon last, about three o'clock, I was going up Broad St. Giles's, I observed the three prisoners at the bar; I followed them up Oxford-road; when I came to Rathbone-place, I saw Mr. Pickering; I called after him, he stopped, and I told him there were three people gone up that side of the road; we followed them as far as Holland's print-shop; they stopped there, Pickering and I staid on the opposite side of the way, we staid for the space of about five minutes; I observed Mary Miller walk away with Sharpless, with one hand under her apron, and I saw her looking at something in the other; I immediately ran over with Pickering, and laid hold of her; she had this bit of paper in her hand, looking at it; I took her into a milliner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190010"></xptr>shop; Mansell was following her behind; I told Pickering to take hold of him; he did so, and brought him into the shop; I searched him, it was about three o'clock on Wednesday, the 12th of this month; as I told Pickering to lay hold of Mansell, I observed the pocket-book under the prisoner Miller's feet, under her petticoats; this bit of paper she had looking at in her hand, which came out of the pocket-book; that is all I can say, Pickering can say no more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Miller. Q. Whether you can say that pocket-book was under my feet? - A. On my oath it was.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor.) Q. Which way did you go from Drury-lane? - A. Up Drury-lane, up St. Giles's, up Oxford-street; I stopped a few minutes at Holland's; that is my pocket-book, it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Miller's defence. My mother in the afternoon gave me leave to go out; I am out of place; I took a walk up Oxford-road, and this young man used a public-house where my mother deals for beer, and by seeing him he spoke to me; I saw the piece of paper and picked it up, when Mr. Crocker and another man came and laid hold of me, and said, we had been picking pockets.</p>
               <p>Hyne. That paper was in the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Miller. The gentleman at Bow-street declined saying that he said he could not swear to the paper, or tell whether it was in the book or his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutor). Q. Did you say so at Bow-street? - A. I could not say whether it was in the pocket-book or not, but the paper is mine, it might have got out of the pocket-book, I had put it in some time before; when I first had it I put it in, it was given me by a little girl; I cannot swear whether it was in the pocket-book at that time; it was a jacket I had on, and it was on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Sharpless's defence. I worked at Mr. Kelly's, in the Strand, a coach-harness-maker, I had left there about a fortnight before, and I saw this young woman; we got into a conversation together, and were coming down home, when we were stopped.</p>
               <p>Mansell's defence. I drive a hackney-coach, night-work; I was going up to Newman-street, as I had some money owing me there; I did not know these people before; I saw them before me forty yards, and seeing a row, I goes down, and Crocker lays hold of me.</p>

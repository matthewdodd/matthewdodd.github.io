            . I live in Charles-street, New-road, Chelsea. I was with Mrs. Lea for about a week - when the lead was missed I went to look for it, but could not find it - I afterwards saw it accidentally, about eight o'clock in the evening, under some green baize, in the grain hole - I told Mrs. Lea of it, and she desired me to leave it as I found it. Shortly after I heard a bell ring in the back kitchen - I went to answer the bell, and saw the prisoner with six other men - I was ordered to fetch a pot of half-and-half - when I took that in I saw the prisoner take up an empty basket, and go out - his companions asked him why he did not stay - he said he would be back presently - he afterwards came to me at the bar for some paper, which he said Mrs. Lea sent him for - I afterwards saw him near the skittle-ground, with the basket in his hand.</p>

            . I am a whitesmith. I was desired by Mrs. Lea to keep watch in the grain-hole - while I was there the prisoner came with a basket under his arm - he had covered something, and put it in the basket - he was going up the steps, when I touched him on the shoulder and said, I believed he was the person I wanted - he then dropped the basket - I took him to the door - an officer was sent for - I picked up the basket, but no one had done any thing to it till the officer received it.</p>

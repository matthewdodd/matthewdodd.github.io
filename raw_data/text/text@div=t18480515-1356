                  </hi> I am a solicitor. On 9th May, about nine o'clock is the evening, I was in Tottenham-court-road—the prisoner jostled me and took my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—it had no guard, only this short chain—he ran away—I pursued, calling, "Stop thief!"—he darted under a horse's head on a coach-stand—I followed—he ran a little distance, went under another horse's head, came on to the side he started from, ran into a crowd, and was seized—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time elapsed between taking the watch and the prisoner's apprehension? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two or three minutes—there were several people about—I did not see him previous in his snatching the watch—I think he was by my side—I saw his face—there were no other persons running—I lost sight of him for an instant, whom under the horse's head—he wore a dark dress—when he was taken, he said, "You have got the wrong man"—he shook in every limb—I spoke to Shipecott, pointed to the prisoner, and said, "You are the man," or "That is the man;" it might be, "Is this the man|"—the prisoner was taken into a pawnbroker's shop, and the watch was found in that area—a crowd was sound the shop—I have no doubt he is the man—there was gas in all the shops.</p>

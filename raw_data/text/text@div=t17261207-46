             thus depos'd. The Prisoner came to my House and call'd for a Mug of Beer, desired me to cast my Eye and see that the Hertford Wagon did not pass by. I went out, but could not see it; then I went out a second Time, and brought him Word it was coming, and the Prisoner came out and stopt the Wagon, order'd the Ropes to be unty'd, and several Boxes to be taken out, and carry'd into my House, then agreed with me for a Cart and Horse to carry the said Goods to the Blue Boar in Whitechappel, but refused to go by Bishopsgate Street, so I went up Brick Lane. When we came to the Inn, the Prisoner took the 4 Boxes down, which he said contained hard Ware and Plate.</p>
               <p>Another Evidence depos'd. I keep a Victualling-house, the Royal-Oak at Rotherhith, and on the fourth or fifth of November the Prisoner and a Waterman came together to my House, and brought the Goods with them, and the Prisoner wanted to know how soon he could have an Opportunity to send them to Holland. The next Morning about 7 or 8 o'Clock the Waterman came again and they staid at my House till after Dinner, and then took the Goods away, and went through-bridge with them, where he discharg'd that Waterman, because he might not know where he lodg'd the Goods, and got another Waterman to carry them to Sevenstep Alley, where he had taken a Room for that Purpose: But soon after seeing an Advertisement in one of the News-Papers to apprehend the Prisoner, who had told me his Name, I went and found out the Waterman which he last employ'd, got a Constable and went to the House where the Prisoner was, and secured both him and the Goods.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner made a poor trifling Defence. The Jury found him <rs id="t17261207-46-verdict183" type="verdictDescription">

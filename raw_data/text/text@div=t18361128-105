                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Parry, a boot and shoe<lb></lb>maker, in Rupert-street, Haymarket. The prisoner came into our service on the 11th of November, at night—on the morning of the 16th, she came to my bed-room and asked for the key of the kitchen—on getting up, I found her gone, and missed the articles stated—about three days after, she</p>

I was on duty in Tower-street, Westminster, on the 19th of November, and met the prisoner walking the street—she asked me for the Westminster-road—I said she was going away from it, and asked where she was going?—she said she did not know; that she had been brought over there, and seduced by a gentleman, and had no place to go to—I took her to the station-house—she said her father lived in Holles-street, Cavendish-square—I found seventeen dupli<lb></lb>cates on her—the name of "Thorpe, No. 4, Phoenix-street" was on some of them—I went to a place and found the prisoner's mother, who gave me information of this robbery—I told the prisoner of it when I returned—in consequence of what the prisoner told me, I went and got some articles from Mrs. Ferry, at the Leg Coffee-house, Leg-alley—she was not bound over—she gave me two children's pinafores, three children's shifts, a man's shirt, a pillow, and other things—when I brought them, the prisoner said these were the things she had left there.</p>

            . I am a Policeman.

I said, "For those two gowns, a pair of stockings, shoes, and a piece of print, from a young woman, in a coffee-shop;" he said, "Oh, I'll soon settle that" - I took him to the office; the girl identified him the moment she saw him - my brother officers had been looking for him night and day, but he changed his lodging.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The morning I sold the gown to the witness I had occasion to go down a court, and saw that old gown on a dunghill, and inside it was the ticket of another gown; two or three people said, "It will suit Jones;" they called her, and asked what she would give for it - she gave me 8d.; I can prove I was never away from home - the witness has been and slept in the same place as I was since.</p>

            .

               <p>COURT. Q. You knew the Police were after your brother? A. Yes, and so did he; I cannot account for his keeping away - I blame him very much; I do not live at home with my mother, but he slept at home - he says so, but I do not know where he was in the day time; I have not spoken to the prosecutrix but once - I heard something about a dunghill about a week after.</p>

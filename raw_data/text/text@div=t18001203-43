               <p>Q. The other two bags you know nothing of? - A. I should not chuse to swear to them, but I have no doubt they came out of our house; the one that I can swear to, contained hemp-seed; the others were different forts of seeds, and different size bags; we had not missed them; it is impossible to miss them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The prisoner told you that the hemp-seed he had bought, and that he had borrowed a bag to convey it? - A. Before the Lord-Mayor, he said he had bought the seed, but I do not recollect his saying he had borrowed the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had bought seed, you would not, perhaps, have refused him the use of the bag, to convey it from one place to another? - A. Probably not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know the day he was taken before the Lord Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went before the Lord Mayor, and told this story? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable,(produces the property); I was desired to follow the cart, upon suspicion that something had been stolen; I followed the cart to Piccadilly; when the prisoner had unloaded his cart there, he turned back towards the City; in going along Piccadilly, he pulled a bag out of the fore part of the cart, and put it into the body of the cart; he drove from thence to a public-house in Rupert-street, and there he stopped; then we got a search-warrant, went back, searched the house, and found these three bags; one of them has a mark of W upon it; I have had them ever since.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 13th of November, I went to execute a search-warrant, at the White-horse, in Rupert-street; I found a bag containing hemp-seed up in the landlord's bed-room, with a W. upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How it came there, you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wrench. I marked the bag in the cart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not see who conveyed that bag into the cart? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you swear, that the bag you marked in your cart, was your bag? - A.No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag quite new? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any orders, or authority, to take a bag that day? - A. No.</p>

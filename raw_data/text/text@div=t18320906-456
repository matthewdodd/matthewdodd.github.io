               <p>WILLIAM TOCKNELL. I live in Blenheim-street, Oxford-street, and am an <rs id="t18320906-456-viclabel2571" type="occupation">engraver</rs>

               <p>Q. Have you not before said that you saw a female, and you really believed she was the person who robbed you? A. I have said so, but I am certain she is the person - she was taken and one half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and some halfpence were found on her; I had felt it safe ten minutes before I lost it - in my way home a young man followed me from the station as far as Finsbury-square, and he offered to lay down his life if I would take the money of him, and offered me double and treble the amount - he spoke so feelingly, that I took 3s. 6d. from him, and he wanted me to take more - I went to the Police-office after that, but I thought it would be all settled; I did not mean to go any more, but I was sent for on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you meet the prisoner? A. On Saturday, about eleven o'clock; I did not say I would not be sure she was the woman - I expressed some doubt of her identity; I went by her dress as much as any thing at the time, but I know quite well she is the person - she had another dress on, but I can be positive as to her features,</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the gentleman who came up to you say it was not the prisoner who took the money? A. No, he said he was not present at the transaction; I took the 3s. 6d. of him, and I might have had a larger sum.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your doubt respecting her dress? A. Yes, I had no doubt about her person - I saw her under the wall, and again at the public-house.</p>

             (Police-constable N 82.) I was applied to on the night of the 1st of September to take the prisoner - I had before heard a cry of Stop thief! and ran, and the prisoner ran by me; I knew her well- the prosecutor was following two or three yards behind; he said that was the person, and I pursued and took her to the station, after great resistance - I searched her, and took her pocket from her; I found a half-crown piece, a shilling, a sixpence, and some copper in it.</p>

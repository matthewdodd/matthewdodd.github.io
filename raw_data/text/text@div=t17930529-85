On Sunday the 5th of May, a young man came to me after dinner, and asked for the name of Elizabeth, and asked if she had lived with me? I told him yes; I had then discharged her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290157"></xptr>and she was at a grocer's, another place, she had left my place about six weeks to the best of my knowledge, I told him that such a person had lived with me; he pulled out some tea spoons and asked me if any one of them were mine? I owned one; I went afterwards to her place, looked at her box with the constable, and found this property in her box; I went to one Mr. Barnes's a grocer in Princes-street, Piccadilly, on Sunday the 5th of May, and in her box was found three pocket handkerchiefs, a napkin, and a tea spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she present? - She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box locked? - It was, and was opened by Price the constable; she was taken up by the master, Mr. Barnes; I did not appear against her the Monday, because he came to me the Monday morning, and begged I would not, and that he would not go; so by that she was discharged; when she went to the constable to demand my property, and likewise her own spoons, the constable would not give them up. I was sent for to Bow-street about a month ago last Saturday, by an order from the magistrate to go there and prove my own property; when I came to Bow-street I saw my property, and was very much against swearing to it, but I did at last.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took her up at that time? - Nobody; she went to the magistrate to demand the property of the constable as I did not appear against her.</p>
               <p>Q. She behaved well in your service? - Exceedingly rude several times which made me part with her at a day's notice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This unfortunate woman at the bar lived with you five months, during that time she deserved a very good character? - Yes, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You say in consequence of some information you went, and in her box the spoons were found? - No, the gentleman brought the spoons to me; there were more than one spoon, six or seven in the whole, and one of mine.</p>
               <p>Q You did not mean to prosecute her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire her to go to Bow-street to claim her property? - No, I told her to get the property and I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she did go to Bow-street to claim the property of her own accord? - She certainly did go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how often she might have gone to the constable's before she went to Bow-street? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that she went to the constable's two or three times? - Yes, at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. A week had elapsed before you got to the justice's? - I don't know whether it was a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q At last she was charged on your complaint, now she is committed and on your charge? - I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much against swearing to the property? - I did not wish to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the property after you searched her box, was she discharged from Mr. Barnes's service? - The matter is, she was employed by Mr. Barnes as a charewoman, I fancy he did discharge her in two or three days, he did not immediately, I never went to the house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go back to Mr. Barnes's? - Never there only Sunday the 5th of May, and that day the prisoner was not there, she was at the Round house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was not by when the box was searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether it was her box or not you don't know? - I make no doubt 
it was her box, I know it was her clothes.</p>


               <p>Q You told the prisoner to go to the constable for the property, where did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290158"></xptr>see her? - At her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have lost your husband? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she attended him to the time of his death? - I beg your pardon, I attended him myself.</p>
               <p>Court. When you came to this Mr. Barnes's you examined the box? - I cannot speak to the box.</p>
               <p>Q Who was present? - The constable, Mr. Barnes and myself.</p>
               <p>Q You desired her to get the property? - I told her if she would get the property I would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. It was by your request she applied to the constable? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The prisoner went by the appointment of the constable to the magistrate? - I don't know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear that she had been before to the magistrate, and the constable was not there, and she attended another day? - I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of St. James's parish; I was present when these handkerchiefs and this napkin was found in her box, she gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Q Have you got the key here? - No, I gave it her back again, it was a paper box, a ban box; that was not locked where these things were, I am sure of it, the spoons were in a box that was locked but not the napkin and handkerchiefs, the spoons were in a trunk lined with leather, it was a common key she gave; I asked her which was her box? and told her it would be better for her to tell; when I took these things the prisoner was in custody at the watch-house, then she was examined the next morning for another robbery, I was constable of the night on Saturday night; I did not attend before the magistrate because the watch-house keeper had took her up till I came; I was attending on Mr. Hastings's trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an hired constable? - Yes. Because you ought to know that when a person is trying for one offence you have no right to give evidence of any other.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you should have known your business better than to give evidence in this kind of way. When did you see her after she called at your house? - Two or three times after, she came for the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you deliver it to her? - The magistrate advised me not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prosecutor with it? - No, I did not, I did not think it was proper, I did not know who to deliver it to; I went to Mr. Addington's and he desired that the maid might come forward and swear to the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her if she came before the justice that she would have it? - I did, I told her so, I fixed the time.</p>

(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in his lodgings? - A. All these things. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the tray to be your's? - A. This tray I can swear to; we convicted a man last sessions for stealing this very tray.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. These things in the basket, and the two tea-trays, have been sworn to by my prosecutor; I married on the 1st of April; Mr. Burn gave me leave to go out, and the wife that I married, her former husband was a tea-tray maker; he made these trays now in question; he has said he found these things about me; he only found three wine-glasses; he took the milk-pot off the desk, and then he put a private mark on them, and said he could swear to them, after he had put a private mark on them; they were on the desk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burn. Mr. Clark is in Court, and never lost sight of him from the time they were taken out of his breeches to the time the constable came.</p>
               <p>- CLARK sworn. - I took this man into custody, and had these things delivered to me at Mr. Burn's, and these things were found at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has said he found these things at my lodgings; they were not my property before I married this woman; her husband made them; he was sent on board a ship, and they were left in my wife's possession.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you account for those found in your breeches? - A. I acknowledge the three wine-glasses, but the others I do not; I had only sixteen shillings a week, and I was obliged -</p>

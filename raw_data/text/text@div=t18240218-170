I had two half-crowns, and some other money loose in my pocket; and a bundle of linen in my apron - the prisoner came and asked me the way into Holborn; I directed him straight on; and all at once, missed him from my left side; and found him on my right. I thought he was after my bundle, as it was eleven o'clock at night. I caught up my apron in both hands to hold it; my pocket hole was rather open and I caught his hand coming out of my pocket; I said</p>
               <p>"Master, you have robbed me;" he ran down a court - I missed my money, and called Stop thief! I ran as hard as I could - saw a man coming along and said,</p>

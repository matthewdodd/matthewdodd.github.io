            . On the 22d of August I followed the prisoner and two more from Newgate-street into Fenchurch-street - I there saw them close on Mr. Duff; I saw the prisoner tucking something under his coat - I crossed over and took this handkerchief from his hand and secured him - he endeavoured to throw it down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up and put it into my pocket, and when the gentleman came up I took it out and gave it to him; when he took me he said he would do his best to transport me.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>MR. DUFF. I did not hear the officer say anything of the kind - the prisoner called to me and said, "Oh! forgive me."</p>

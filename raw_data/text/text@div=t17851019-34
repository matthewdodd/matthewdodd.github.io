               <p>"it did not signify, money they wanted, and money they must have.</p>
               <p>"They took hold of me by the lappels, they said no more to me; I thought of laying hold of them, and calling out watch, but upon a second reflection, I threw my arms against one, and extended them, and drove the other against the wall, and called out watch, with that one of them recovered himself and gave me a stroke under the eye, which gave me a black eye, they ran, and I after them, and by Nephine-street, one of them turned down, and two or three watchmen were gathered together, and they took Rook, and I went after Jordan.</p>

               <p>Can you undertake to swear positively that he is? - I certainly can now or I would not have sworn at first, he was not out of my sight five minutes before he was brought to the watch-house, it was a moonlight night.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. My Lord, I beg leave to trouble the Court with a few observations on the indictment; I have forbore to ask a single question of any of the witnesses, because it seems to me to be the shortest way to take your Lordship's opinion at this stage of the business: this offence, or rather the offence intending to be described in the indictment, arises on an act of parliament made in the 17th and 18th years of the late King: and from the preamble of that act coupled with the enacting clause of it, it seems to me to be clearly decisive that this indictment cannot be sustained; it recites, that many of the King's subjects have been put in great fear and danger, and that the punishment of such offenders, (that is, of offenders who assaulted the King's subjects with intent to rob, and put them in fear and danger of their lives) was not sufficient. My Lord, I am perfectly conscious that I am addressing myself to a Court that know perfectly well what is meant by assaulting and putting in fear, and that it constitutes a highway robbery; now this preamble says, this is with intention to rob; those acts of parliament therefore were not intended to protect persons from bare larcenies from the person, but were intended to meet a new species of offence, where persons with arms, or by violent menaces, or by force, which might on persons of a firm and found mind produce such terror as to cause them to part with their property, did assault the King's subjects with intent to rob; and the legislature thought that this was an offence fit to be punished in some severer sort; therefore they inflicted the sentence of transportation: then the entering clause goes on to say, that this penalty should apply to persons who should either with offensive weapons, or by menaces demand any money or goods, with felonious intent to rob, or commit robbery upon such person or persons to whom such menaces should be applied. My Lord, my objection is first, that there is no menace of the sort described by this act of parliament in this indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190066"></xptr>Court. You have dropped one part of the act of parliament, which adds</p>
               <p>"or shall by any forcible or violent manner demand" these are the words upon which the present indictment is framed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then, my Lord, in the first place I take the liberty of saving, upon this evidence it is entirely impossible for the Jury to find that there has been an assault in a forcible or violent manner; the evidence of the prosecutor was this, that he was either met or overtaken, or found himself in the way of the prisoners, and one of them made use of this expression,</p>
               <p>"money</p>
               <p>"we want, money we must have." Now I need not state to the Jury that that expression is perfectly equivocal, it is the language of threat, of menace, or the language of supplication, of indigence in the mouth of a beggar; there is no sort of pretence that this was accompanied by any force, or by any indication on the part of the person asking, that he intended to distinguish his application from that of a beggar; a man earnest for a bit of bread, might address the person of whom he fought relief by laying his hand on any part of the body, and most naturally on the shoulder of such person; But still, my Lord, I have a clear and palpable objection, because the indictment states this, and this only, because it states that it was with a felonious intent his monies from his person and against his will feloniously to steal, take and carry away; that is the description of a simple larceny. I take the liberty of observing that it was not to protect persons from simple larceny, but from that higher offence, and in order to the constitution of which, there must be a threat applied to the person from whom the money is demanded: this indictment does not state in the words of the act of parliament, that this was with intent to rob or to commit robbery; and it seems not to have been enough for the legislature to have contented itself with one expression; but left any man of less sense than all those who constitute this Court are blessed with, should mistake; the legislature seems to have been anxious to have pinned down the sense, and to have marked its meaning so, that no man could possibly mistake it, for it goes on to say,</p>
               <p>"with intent to rob, or with intent to commit robbery," marking it as contra-distinguished from an attempt to commit simple larceny. My Lord, I contend on the part of the prisoners, that it is incumbent on the prosecutor to pursue this act of parliament in its very letter; he has not done so, he has not charged that they did it with a felonious intent to commit a robbery, or that he meant to take his goods forcibly or violently: I do not mean that the indictment should necessarily have found in it, the words with a felonious intent to rob him, or to commit robbery; but this I contend, it is clearly and indispensably necessary, that upon the indictment there should be a clear and unequivocal description of an intent to commit an highway robbery: now here is a clear description of an intent to commit larceny, but I defy any man with legal notions about him to say, here is the description of a highway robbery: your Lordship knows there must be fear, or at least there should be such a personal attack upon a man that a firm man might be put in fear, and part with his property, or have it taken from him; and this indictment describes it to be with a felonious intent, feloniously to steal, take and carry away his goods; that is a clear description of larceny. My Lord, I am ashamed to have taken up the time of the Court so long, I conclude with submitting to the Court, there must be a clear designation of an intent to commit a robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. I will first leave it to the Jury, and if any doubt is entertained, I will mention it to the learned Judges, and if they entertain any doubt, the case shall be reserved. I think it would be more correct if the words by force or violence were added: as to the other point, if the Jury are of opinion the prisoners meant to beg and not to rob, I shall direct an acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I have no objection to your Lordship's purpose, and I am sure, that after what I have experienced so often of indulgence, I shall be forgiven if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190067"></xptr> I make this observation: I observe that the mode in which it might be attempted to reconcile the indictment to the statute is this, by taking in the whole description that might be collected out of the indictment; but I shall take the liberty of submitting to this Court, that you cannot look further back than beyond the word intent, I take it that the other is a distinct part of the offence, that is, the assault, in a forcible and violent manner, of demanding money: the other part the Jury are bound to find, namely, that it was with a felonious intent t o rob, that feloniously, and against his will, and by force, they took the goods: therefore, it seems to me as if it was impossible to couple the two parts of the indictment, so as to make up one perfect whole to satisfy the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Rooke called two witnesses, who gave him a very good character, and said he was a midshipman on board the Bellamont East Indiaman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jordan called one witness, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>I had no intent to steal the spoons at all, nor did I steal the spoons, I never offered them for fate at all, I have been waiter ever since I was fourteen years old, and I never lived in a place, nor never waited on a company, but I had spoons in my pocket in the course of the hurry of business of the day; I went down stairs for clean plates, and clean spoons, I brought up fourteen or fifteen, and these three were left in my pocket, which I did not recollect; I have had spoons in my pocket many times, I have even travelled for miles with spoons in my pocket, and have not known it till the next day, nor did I know of these till I awoke in the morning, for after drinking a little drop together we went away; I was coming along to bring them to the London tavern, and I saw this man, and I was joking with him, and pulled out one of the spoons, he immediately tapped me over the shoulders, and called for a glass of peppermint, I said to the person that was with me, we will see what he has to say; I told him, I did not mean to sell them, and he immediately laid hold of me, I was coming from Tooley-street, the house where I lived, in order to go to the London tavern, but I had occasion to go to the Minories, I was in company with a relation of my own, who is not here to speak for me, I have no body at all for my character.</p>
               <p>What place did you call at in the Minories, in your way from Tooley-street? - I was waiting for a person that I called on, who keeps a shop the corner of the street.</p>

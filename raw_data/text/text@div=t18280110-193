I missed my handkerchief, and said to a person who sat next to me, "Some one has taken my handkerchief; I rested very quietly, but in a few minutes the officer came, and asked if I had lost any thing; I said a handkerchief; he said, "This party has got it." I know nothing of the prisoners.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in the gallery, and saw the prisoners; I watched them for above an hour, and saw Cockrane shoving something into his pocket, and Phipps extending his arms to keep the people back - one of his arms was on Cockrane's shoulder at the time; I heard of the prosecutor's loss, and took the prisoners; I found this handkerchief, which Cockrane was concealing, and another handkerchief on his person.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Tabernacle-square, and am a brick-maker. I do not know either of the prisoners; I was at Drury-lane last Friday night - I was the second behind Cockrane, and saw him stoop and pick up the handkerchief from between his legs, on the stairs, going up; he called out several times "Who has lost a handkerchief?" and waved it over his head; he then went into the place - I saw no more of it; this was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in? A. No? the house was full, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to notice the prisoner? A. From the circumstance of his picking up the handkerchief; I was not present when he was charged with stealing it - he was intoxicated.</p>

            . I am a cork-cutter, and live in Adam and Eve-court. I was in a cook-shop, in Middlerow, St. Giles', that evening; Cockrane came in, and had a basin of soup - he was much intoxicated; there was another young man in the box, having soup; he asked Cockrane to buy some duplicates, and said one was for a coat.</p>
               <p>ISAAC FRANCIS STONE. Cockrane did not appear drunk; I had a bad cold, and used my handkerchief several times in the gallery.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CURRANT. I think he had been drinking; he was rather saucy.</p>

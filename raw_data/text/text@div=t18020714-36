               <p>Q. When was it? - A. On a Tuesday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I selt somebody touching the slap of my trowsers; I put my hand down directly, and missed my watch; I went back about a couple of yards, and said, I had lost my watch; a Mr. Parker then pointed out the prisoner to me, and a little while after I picked up the outside case of the watch, and then the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near together? - A. I suppose they might be about half a yard from one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them? - A. I gave them to the constable, when I gave the man in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man about you before? - A. No; I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing else? - A. Yes; I lost my handkerchief from my jacket pocket; my handkerchief was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your handkerchief worth? - A. One shilling.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - I am a butcher in Newport-market; I was at Stepney-fair, and saw the prisoner there; I heard the sailor say he had lost his watch; I looked round, and saw the prisoner with the slap of his breeches down; I saw him deliver the watch to a boy, and the case dropped from him; I brought the boy back to where the sailor was, and he dropped the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the person of the prisoner? - A. Yes; I pointed him out to the sailor, and he had him apprehended.</p>

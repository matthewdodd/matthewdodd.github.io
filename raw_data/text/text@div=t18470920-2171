                  </hi> I live Inverness-shire—I am a stranger in London. On Friday night, the 10th of Sept., about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in Drury-lane—I went into the White Lion public-house—I remained below a few minutes, and took something to drink—I heard some singing up stairs—I asked the man if it was a public room—he said it was—I went up, and asked what was to pay—the prisoner Dyke, who was the chairman of the meeting, said, "A shilling"—I paid him the shilling—he invited me to take a seat on his left hand—I sat a little while, not many minutes—there seemed to be a little disorder amongst some of the company—I wished to go away—I called for some drink, and paid for it—I think it was two glasses of rum-and-water—I did not drink any myself up stairs, I had down stairs—I was quite sober—I retired after I had paid for what I ordered—Dyke said he wished to speak to me particularly at the bar of the house—Brennan got up with him—I was going down, the two prisoners followed me, and Dyke pushed me against the balustrade, or the wall of the stairs, put his hand into my right waistcoat-pocket, and took my watch out, and Brennan took my purse from my right-hand trowsers-pocket, and my handkerchief from my coat-pocket—I took the purse from her with great violence, and she returned to the room—my watch was fastened to the chain—I cannot say how Dyke took it—most likely he unscrewed the swivel—the watch was gone, and the chain remained—I called out I was robbed, and ordered the landlord of the house to shut the door, which he did very reluctantly I thought, and I noticed three or four persons went out—I cannot tell whether Dyke was one—I am not sure how much was in the purse, but when it was counted in the office at Bow-street there were five half-crowns, fifteen shillings, and eight sixpences—Brennan had got it almost out of my pocket when I took it from her—I went up stairs afterwards, and found her—I said I was robbed—she threw my hand-kerchief to me, and said, "There is your handkerchief, and be d—d"—police-man No. 47 came—I gave her in charge—Dyke was then gone, but I saw him afterwards—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

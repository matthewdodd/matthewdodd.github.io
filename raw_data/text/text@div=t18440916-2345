                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in St. John-street-road. On the 14th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I had a moleskin table<lb></lb>covering safe inside my shop—on Monday, the 16th, it was brought back by the officer—this is it—it is mine.</p>

About ten o'clock, on the 14th of Sept., I was on duty, and saw the prisoners in Middle-row—Gill had this table-cover, wrapped up, partly in a bag and partly out—I followed them—they ran away—I ran about 200 yards, and Gill dropped this.</p>

I received information, and went to Gill's lodging, in Bunhill-court—I told him I wanted him, that he an<lb></lb>swered the description of a person who had effected his escape on Saturday night—he said, "Don't say anything here, for God's sake"—I said, "I suppose Brown was with you"—he said, "No, he was not, it is quite useless to deny it"—he told me another name, and I went after Dansey—I told him he must consider himself in custody for stealing a piece of oil-cloth with Gill on the Saturday night—he said he had not seen him, and after that, he said he had been playing at skittles with him at the City of Chester public-house—a the station, Gill said, "I suppose we shall get off with seven years at the ship, or the Isle of Wight?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Wood, a tailor, in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square. On Saturday, the 18th of August, I met the pri<lb></lb>soner in Holborn, and spoke to him—I had been acquainted with him some years—he said he was going to Jamaica, and asked if I was in business for myself—I said no, but I was in a situation, and if he wanted anything, I had no doubt my employer, Mr. Wood, would be happy to wait on him—he said he was in want of things, and should be happy if I could make them, but he was afraid the West-end prices would be too high—I said we would charge him as a regular outfit—he said he would let me know—I received a letter that same evening, and went to the Saracen's Head, snow-hill, at ten o'clock next morning, with Mr. Wood, who showed the prisoner some patterns—he ordered several pairs of trowsers, waistcoats, and coats to be brought to the Saracen's Head on the Saturday following at ten o'clock, and every thing would be paid for—we stated to him it would be a ready money order—that is the only way we do take orders for out<lb></lb>fits—he called at our house on the Wednesday to try some of them on—on the following Friday Mr. Wood told me something, and I took one suit of clothes to the Saracen's Head, and asked the prisoner to let us have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he was in bed at the time—he said he had been out the over-night, but he would get up about twelve o'clock, and send me a cheque up—I left him and left the clothes—I went the next morning with Mr. wood with the rest of the clothes—we found him at the Saracen's Head—I told him he had not kept his word, as we had received no cheque—he said he had quite forgotten it, but it did not matter, he would give a cheque for the a whole amount—Mr. Wood asked him on what bank it would be—he said on a bank at Liverpool—Mr. Wood said that would be no payment at all, and objected to appeared much offended that his word should be doubted—I had some conversation with Mr. Wood, and the result was, that on the prisoner giving his word as a gentleman that he had effects there, either 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Mr. Wood took the cheque—he gave his word that he had either 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Northern and Central Bank at Liver<lb></lb>pool—on</p>

I went with him to the Saracen's Head to see the prisoner, on the 13th of August, in conse<lb></lb>quence of receiving a letter—he said he wanted an outfit, as he was very shortly proceeding to the West Indies—he chose his patterns, and ordered a quantity of clothes of each sort—on the following Thursday evening he came to my house, and said he wanted one suit of clothes, to go down Gravesend to a party of friends, and I sent them next morning—on satur<lb></lb>day, by appointment, I took the goods in a box to the Saracen's head—he asked me for the bill, I gave it him—he asked me if there was any dis<lb></lb>count—I said "No, it was contract price, and no discount"—he said he would pay me a cheque—he drew a cheque—I saw it was on a Liverpool bank, and I said a cheque on a Liverpool bank was no payment to me, un<lb></lb>less I was perfectly satisfied he had effects there—he said he never had his</p>

               <p>I live in Cartwright-square, East Smithfield, a woolcomber; I know one of the prisoners perfectly well, Larter, these seven years. Larter called at my house the 2d of October, and he asked me if I would go to his house with him; I went, and when I came there I saw Matthews, and they shewed me a piece of printed callico; and I asked Larter, in the presence of Matthews, who it belonged to? Larter said, it belonged to that person. I asked who Matthews was, and whether I could purchase it safe? Larter told me, I could; and that he was a very honest man. I gave Matthews the money myself, 40 s. for twenty yards in one piece; I paid to Matthews 40 s. and took it away with me. I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179201130047"></xptr>Larter in the course of the week; he called with the fellow-piece to that I purchased; he left it on the Sunday morning following, they both came to my house together, that was twenty-one yards; they called to be paid for the piece left in the week; I paid them two guineas for it; I believe Matthews took the money. In the course of five or six weeks, from the 2d of October, I purchased nineteen fine pieces of printed callico, containing twenty-one yards each, and three coarse ones, containing about twenty-eight yards; they laid by me for a month. I also in the course of the same time purchased twenty pieces of nankeen, all brought in the course of that time; Larter, on the week I bought the twenty pieces of nankeen, brought eighteen of them on a week day, and on the next Sunday Matthews himself called at my house, and he asked me if I had had any nankeens brought me by Larter? I told him, I had eighteen; and he took two out of his pocket, for which I paid 7 s. for the two pieces. I paid for the eighteen after the same manner, and he told me I might call at Larter's house, and pay him for the eighteen; I called on the same Sunday in the afternoon, and paid at the same rate, 3 s. 6 d. a piece; likewise for a handkerchief Larter left at our house, containing a piece of bed tick, a bit of plain callico, and two striped pieces of cotton, red and white small stripe. I did not settle for them four little articles. I had all the nankeens by me that I bought, except two pieces, that were pawned; the nankeens ran about six yards a piece; the twenty pieces were all separate pieces; part were pledged to Mr.

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoners Counsel. Mr. Sims, while I ask you a few questions, instead of looking down at your hat, look at the Jury. You are a wool-comber? - I am.</p>
               <p>A master or journeyman? - A journeyman.</p>
               <p>You wanted to sit up a journeyman's room elegantly? - It was not like that.</p>
               <p>You had very good goods to fit it up with? - They are good.</p>
               <p>The first thing you knew of this was on the 2d of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was a large parcel, Mr. Sims, was not it? - It was not such a great quantity.</p>
               <p>Not such a great quantity for a poor journeyman woolcomber to lay hold of! Had you been much in the habit of purchasing these sort of goods? - Not in the bed furniture; nevertheless I have bought several articles belonging to women's furniture; and my wife goes into the country every Spring to sell them.</p>
               <p>You hold with doing this of a Sunday? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not you a little surprized that you should have so good a bargain on Sunday? the better day, perhaps, the better deed! Don't you know that you are liable to be tried for having these goods in your possession? - It is very possible it may be so.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that you might have stood in the very same situation as those two prisoners do now? - I do not understand that; I was never taken out of my house.</p>
               <p>You do not know that you might have stood there, it was a trying time, it was necessary to squeak, so you continued buying on; you knew that the people were not in trade? - I did.</p>
               <p>That is another secret? - If I had chose to have bought, I might of the same person.</p>
               <p>When did you stop your hand? - I forbid Matthews the last time he came to my house; and I met Larter in the street, and told him never to come to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was any thing found on you? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Any thing found in your house? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Any prosecution instituted against you? - No, Sir.</p>

Both the prisoners came frequently backwards and forwards to my house, and my husband bought goods of them. He bought printed callicoes, and he bought some nankeens.</p>
               <p>What became of those two pieces of nankeens which were bought in the manner you have described? - They are sold.</p>
               <p>Did you carry any to Arthur's? - I pledged two pieces, and after that they were got back again; then all the callicoes were sold to

               <p>You knew you was liable to answer it, if you was found out; now, by giving your evidence, you are sheltered and protected? You know no harm will be done to you now, now you have given your evidence? - We only speak the truth.</p>

               <p>I am in the dry saltering line; I am acquainted with the witness Sims. About three months ago Mr. Sims came to me one morning for some money that was due to him, and told me that he had some pieces of printed furniture, that he had sold.</p>
               <p>What did you receive from Sims? - I received two double pieces, and after that four or five, and a piece of blue damask, and some inferior printed callicoes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners at the bar, or either of them? - I believe I have seen Larter at Sims's house. I sold the articles I bought.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known Mr. Sims and his wife? - About four years.</p>


               <p>Four years you have had dealing with them? - No, not above two years.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - I am a dry salter.</p>
               <p>What articles in the dry saltering are these printed cottons? - None at all; but if you will give me leave I will explain myself. Sims came and told me, he had some very excellent bed furniture, that he could pawn for six guineas, and I gave him six guineas for them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if any body had brought you a little silver, you would have bought it, perhaps a few diamonds, you would have considered it all in the dry saltering business? - Quite out of my line.</p>
               <p>A little gold plate, that would have been in the dry saltering line? - If I had understood them, I should. I think a man of dealing has a right to buy any thing he can get any thing by.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to East-Smithfield: on the 17th of December, I, in company with Mr. Oakley, apprehended Matthews; on Monday I went to the house of Sims; I found nothing there; I secured Sims; I was coming away after we had made the compleat search, and he desired me to step up stairs with him; Mr. Sims lives close by me, and I have known him for some years; the first question he asked me was, if that was the gentleman that had been robbed; I told him yes; he told me that he thought it some of the property he had imprudently purchased, and that what he could recover back, he would do; I advised him so to do; and then his wife came up stairs: afterwards we went that evening to the house of Larter, with Mr. Oakley; we searched his house, but found nothing there, nor him; at length we took Larter in Fenchurch-street, and secured him, and took him in a coach; and he said, what is all this about? if I tell all I know of this, when they get hold of Matthews, they will hang me with him.</p>
               <p>Did he tell him it would be better for him so to do? - He did not: I then told him, that, as he had mentioned the name of Matthews, Matthews was already in custody; he seemed to disbelieve that, and said, that if he could be convinced of that, and be secured, that then he would give evidence; I told him it did not become me to make any promises of that sort, Mr. Oakley had better talk about that; by this time we came to the bottom of the court, where Mr. Oakley was waiting for us; then, when we came to the end of the court, we took Mr. Oakley up, and a friend of his, and went to the King's-arms, in East-Smithfield; when we arrived there, the magistrate was gone, and the prisoner Matthews was committed for re-examination on Thursday: I put Larter into the parlour; Mr. Oakley, Mr. Rooke, and myself, with him; and there the prisoner Larter (Sims was not with us then) said to Mr. Oakley, if he would give him a general release, he could give sufficient evidence against Matthews, which would convict him: I put Larter in the watch-house that night, and the next day I had him before the magistrate, and he was remanded for re-examination with Matthews: on Thursday, Matthews and Larter were examined again at the office; the things were produced from Sims, the nankeens, and one piece, when it was shewn to Mr. Oakley; then the prisoner Matthews said, yes, but they are not Mr. Oakley's nankeens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have been acquainted with Mr. Sims for some time? - I don't know that ever I spoke to the man in my life, except How do you do? when I pass.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Sims's house before you saw Mr. Oakley? - I did not; and, in fact, I went with some degree of reluctance; for I had that opinion of Sims, that he would not receive such an article; I know Mr. Rooke very well, and, having seen them together, I thought he was a very creditable man; and I understood of Rooke, that this man Sims worked for him.</p>

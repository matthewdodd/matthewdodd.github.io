             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you apprentice to Bloomfield? - Yes. On the 16th of July this woman came into our shop, in company with a man, about eleven o'clock, or it might be near twelve, on Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Bloomfield at home, or gone out? - Gone out; the man said he wanted a pair of shoes, while he was being sitted I see the prisoner at the bar go to the further end of the shop, and take a pair of women's slippers, she took them off a shelf on a bureau bedstead; I could perfectly see what part; my mistress tried on the shoes on the man, and I was standing, and see the prisoner go and take the shoes, I see her put them into her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she said any thing about slippers, or wanting to look at them? - No, only the man about shoes. I stopped about two minutes, expecting my master would come home, in order to detect her, because I was afraid, on account of the man; just before he came home I accused her of stealing the slippers; the man had not bought any shoes; I immediately bolted the door, the man was in the shop at that time, she denied having stole any, she said she had not got any, she was sure she had not, and she struggled very hard to get away; directly as I accused her my mistress laid hold of her, my mistress, by the assistance of a lodger secured her, and my mistress put her hand into her pocket, and took the shoes out, I see her; while I was gone for a constable the man burst open the shop door, and got open the private door, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the slippers? - My master has had them in his possession, we have got them now. He came home while I was gone for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the slippers taken out of her pocket were delivered to your master? - Yes, they were.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160085"></xptr>Prisoner. I and the man went in to buy a a pair of man's shoes, and a pair of women's slippers for myself, and I had two half crowns in my hand to pay for them, and I had no pockets on at all.</p>
               <p>Clarke. She had pockets on, and had another pair of shoes in her pocket that did not belong to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The woman of the shop asked me three shillings and sixpence for the slippers, and I paid her three shillings and three-pence for them; the constable knows that I had no pockets on; the woman herself ripped my petticoat out of the binding; and there was another woman in the shop that see I had no pockets on.</p>
               <p>Witness. She said not a word respecting any thing for herself, but only the man. (The slippers produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I see her pockets on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the constable came, the boy put on his boots, and said, now you shall go to Botany Bay, and I shall get something by you, and when I was searched at Bow-street, I had no pockets on.</p>

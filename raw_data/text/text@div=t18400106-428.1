                  </hi>I am married, and live opposite the prosecutor's, who keeps an umbrella shop. About eight o'clock at night, on Friday, the 20th of December, I was looking through my window—I saw two men, and a young man in a butcher's frock, who had an umbrella, looking at it, un<lb></lb>der the gas, about two doors from the prosecutor's shop—the two men went back to Mr. Green's shop, and the butcher went on to White lion-street, with the umbrella up—a man came out of Mr. Green's shop, who disturbed the two men, who were lurking about the door—I went out and told Mrs. Green—on Sunday the prosecutor sent for me, and said he had lost an umbrella—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person I saw with, the umbrella.</p>

                  </hi>I keep an umbrella shop in Mon mouth-street. Pap<lb></lb>worth came and told me about two men being about my door—I did not miss an umbrella then, but three minutes after I missed it—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the policeman, and heard no more till half-past nine o'clock on Saturday night, when the policeman came and told me something, and I saw my umbrella—the prisoner was in custody, but I did not see him till the Tuesday, and then he had a butcher's frock on under his coat—I saw the umbrella at Hatton-garden, and swore to it.</p>

"—he said, "Yes"—I took him to the station-house, and then he said he knew nothing about it—at the office he said he bought it of a man, in Sloane-street, Chelsea, for half-a-crown—he had a but<lb></lb>cher's frock on under his coat, as he has now.</p>

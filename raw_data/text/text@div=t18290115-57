On the 17th of December I lost three shawls, but I was not at home; I had seen one of them the day before and the other two about a week: I went to Lambeth-street Office, and saw three, which I knew to be mine - they have my private-mark on them.</p>

            . On the 17th of December I was looking out of my window, opposite the prosecutor's shop- I saw the prisoner, in company with a young man, walking backwards and forwards, looking into the shop; it took my attention: I then saw the prisoner go into the shop - he had an apron on; I saw him take something from the shop counter; when he came out he had something in his apron: I ran down stairs, and informed the officer - when the prisoner came out he began to walk very fast; I saw the officer go and take him - I am sure he is the boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where were you? A. Up stairs; our window is much lower than Mr. Hodge's - his shop goes up three or four steps; I only lost sight of him while I came down stairs - it was not five minutes from the time he went into the shop till he was taken back; the officer lives nearly opposite: I did not lose sight of him while I called the officer, as he stood at his door - when he was taken he was untying his apron; it was dropping from him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was the property on me? A. Yes - you had the apron in your hands; the string was untied from behind: I took them from your person.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old, and live in New Pye-street. I saw the prisoner (whom I knew before), take the pelisse from Mrs. Wardle's arm, run across the street, and give it to another man. I ran across the road, and caught the other man by the collar. He knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What were you about - A. Shutting up my father's shop. As soon as he gave it to the other, he stopped, and called out Stop thief! he seized a man, and said he was the thief - I said he was not. He fell into a puddle, struck me on the side of the ear, and knocked me down.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was informed of this about seven o'clock. I went to a public-house, the prisoner stood by the fire, drying his clothes - he was very wet down one side. I said I wanted him for a robbery that evening. He immediately said,</p>
               <p>"If it is about Young Blundell's business, he is mistaken in my person." We secured him. He abused us very much.</p>
               <p>SARAH BOND. I was with the prosecutrix, and saw the prisoner's side face and his dress. He went across the road with it, and gave it, I think, to another man. I verily believe him to be the man. I saw him again in Pye-street. When the prosecutrix recovered, he said it was not us. She said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man that robbed me." He said nothing then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were walking together - A. I was rather before her, and turned round immediately as she cried out. We ran and followed him - a man came and struck her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the night I heard the cry, three men knocked me down in the kennel. A man said that Blundell said it was me.</p>
               <p>MRS. WARDLE re-examined. I went up, and said he was the man - he did not answer. I have no doubt of him.</p>

On the 5th of March, the prisoner took a small room of me furnished, at 7 s. a week. He said he was a gentleman, and would always pay before-hand. He mentioned the names of Lord Castlereagh and other respectable persons. I let him the room - the articles stated in the indictment were let with it. On the 15th of April he came down, I asked him to pay what he owed me, and he said he would leave the house directly. I got a constable and went into his room - he was sitting at the table writing. I told him I was come up to see that all my property was safe. I pulled the press-bedstead down and missed this property. I asked him where they were. He said he did not know, but that they were stolen, and, if I would let the constable go away, he would buy more. The constable took him - this was on Monday night, the blankets were brought home the same evening. I saw the bed next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not object to Mr. Hunter's coming into my room - A. No; he had a deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember my saying,</p>
               <p>"If anything was lost I would pay for it" - A. He never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not show you a 50 l. bill - A. He showed me a twopenny-stamp and said it was a 50 l. bill; and said it came in a letter from Lord Castlereagh, and that he had money at Drummonds', the bankers.</p>
               <p>HENRY CROCKER. I am an officer. On the 15th of May, the prosecutrix sent for me, and I searched the room. The prisoner was sitting at breakfast and writting a letter when she missed the property. I asked what had become of it - he hesitated, and said he would make it good. I found the bed at Davis's, tied up in the quilt.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Windmill-street. I received the bed, bolster, and quilt from Harrison, the pawnbroker, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 9th of May, I redeemed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the duplicate - A. The prisoner applied to my father. I was present, and heard him say he wished to sell the duplicate, and asked one guinea and a half for it. I said I would take the bed out of pledge, and if it was worth the money, I would give it him, which I did. They were pledged for 2 l. and were scarcely worth that. I told him I would not give more than they were pledged for, but would keep them a week for him, and, in the mean time, they were claimed. He said, if I liked, I might pledge them again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say the bed was not my own - A. He did not.</p>

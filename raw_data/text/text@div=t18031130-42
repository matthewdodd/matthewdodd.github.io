I had in my right-hand pocket some money in a leather purse, and in my left-hand pocket a note for 20 l. two two-pound Bank notes, and two one-pound Bank notes; I found my watch and money safe, but the notes gone; I immediately went down Gray's-Inn-lane after them, and found them standing together; the tall woman (Cheese) had in her muff a piece of white paper, which I snatched out of her hand, I looked at it, and found it was the twenty-pound note; I said you have robbed me, and I called out watch immediately; a watchman came up, and I gave charge of those two women, I never recovered the Bank notes; I shewed the watchman the note, and the little one attempted to snatch it out of my hand, but she could not get it from me; they were then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did you get away from the theatre? - A. I think, half after twelve; I had been with some friends, I left the theatre between eleven and twelve o'clock; I then went with some friends to the Ship, at the corner of the theatre, and had some bread and cheese and some porter; about a quarter after twelve, Mr. Godwin, who belongs to the theatre, went with me to King-street, he lives at Somers-town.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you drank? - A. Very little, I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoners not more than two hundred yards from the place where you left them? - A. Thereabouts.</p>

The prisoner came into my shop to buy some bread and cheese; he did not take any thing the first time. He came into the shop a second time to buy a twopenny loaf. I did not see him take the mustard at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the mustard - A. It stood on the end of my counter where the tradesman laid it down that brought it in, and in two hours afterwards a person brought the mustard to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mustard directly after he was gone - A. No, I did not. A person sent to me to ask if I had lost any mustard; if I had I was to come up to Mr. Salmon's public-house. I went there, I saw the prisoner sitting in the parlour in custody; the officer took the mustard out of the bundle and shewed it me. I knew my own name and the hand-writing that was on it. This is the mustard, it was in this paper in my shop, and my name on it as it is now. I am sure it was on my counter when he was there, and I knew it the moment I saw it. I saw it on my counter at twelve o'clock when the prisoner first came there, and after he was gone; it was not a quarter of an hour before he came in again and asked for another twopenny loaf; this paper of mustard cost me five shillings.</p>

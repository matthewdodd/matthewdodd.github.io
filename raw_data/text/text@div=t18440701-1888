                  </hi>, jun. I live with my father, at Bass's Wharf, Deptford—I am a bricklayer. On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I fastened up all the doors of my father's house about ten minutes before eleven o'clock—I was called up about ten minutes before six in the morning, and saw the prisoner within three steps of the top of the stairs—he had no business there whatever—he appeared to have got in through the jap room window, where there was a tub in the back-yard—he said he had come to alarm us, and we let him go—my tools had been in the back bed-room—I missed them, and the other articles stated, about an hour after he was gone—on the following Sunday morning we found this box, one old gown, the four brushes, and a boy's cap—the cap was on the prisoner's head, and the brush was in his pocket—this cap is my brother's, who is fifteen years old, and this brush is my father's—this box is my father's, and it was found where the prisoner was lodging.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at Mr. Darling's, where I lodge, on the 15th of June—he had this box there—I saw him go to it conti<lb></lb>nually, and take the brushes out, and put them in again—he said he would buy a lock and key, that the other lodgers should not make use of these things.</p>

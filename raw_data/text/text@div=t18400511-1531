                  </hi>. I am in the service of Richard Hughes And Fred<lb></lb>erick Guy, proprietors of Vauxhall gardens. I had seen this lead on the engine-house and stables before the 18th of March—I went to the premises after the 18th, and it was gone—there were footsteps on the premises, and the lead had been jagged and taken away by violence—on the 21st a shoe was sent over by a policeman, which I examined with the footsteps, and it corresponded exactly with the nails in number and in the site of the shoe—the lead was supposed to be taken on the 16th or 17th—some lead had been produced which I think was the lead—it was the same quality of lead and had the same marks as regards the flushing—I hare compared it with the rest on the roof, and it corresponds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Between tight and nine o'clock at night on the 18th of March, I was in Vauxhall-street, near Vauxhall-gardens, and saw the prisoner running along with something on his shoul<lb></lb>der—when he saw me coming close on him he got on faster—I followed and came up to him—he turned round Prince's-row, put this lead down in a garden-fence, and ran away—I followed and secured him—next day I took off his shoe, took it to Vauxhall-gardens, and found it corresponded with the marks in the mould, and also in the number of nails, which was nine—I produce the lead.</p>

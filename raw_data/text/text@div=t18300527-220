               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it dark? A. It was dusky; I was on one side of the bridge and they on the other; I could distinctly see Dean take it - the handkerchief was light, and the gentleman was dressed in black.</p>
               <p>Deacon. I am sure he could not see us; he has been a witness here a dozen times. Witness. I have been a street-keeper, and have had a number of cases here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you keep your eyes upon them? A. Yes; they were not out of my sight, except when I turned my head to speak to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Were you not in the old Police? A. No. I was in the new Police, but have been discharged three weeks for being asleep on my beat - it was not for being drunk.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. I was on duty on the 5th instant; Murray pointed out the prisoners to me, and with his assistance I took them both - as we were going to the station-house, I told Murray to walk behind to see that they did not put their hands to their pockets - and in Pell-street, Deacon was in the act of pulling out this handkerchief, and this other with it - he threw them down; one of the men took them up, and took them to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time elapsed between Murray coming to you, and your taking them? A. Not more than five minutes; he must have lost sight of them; I dare say they did not expect to be taken - I dare not search a man till I take him to the inspector.</p>

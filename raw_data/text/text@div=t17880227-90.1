               <p>There had been alarms of robberies there before? - Yes; I had seen people several times before; he was taken the next day, about twelve o'clock at noon; there was found his jacket and shoes upon the top of the house adjoining.</p>
               <p>What sort of noise was it you first heard? - I apprehend it was his getting under the bed.</p>
               <p>You had hardly time when you looked under the bed to see what clothes he had on? - Yes, his jacket was off, and his shoes.</p>
               <p>To Wimburn. You heard him say something about the smock-frock and the other things in the cock-loft? - Yes; he said, he had slept in my cock-loft, the night prior to his being taken; he said, he never saw the books; that he took the frock to make him a bed to lie on.</p>
               <p>Was the garret door locked when you went up? - No; my wife locked it the night before.</p>
               <p>The cock-loft is above the garret? - Yes, and the trap-door goes into the garret.</p>
               <p>Then why should he open the garret door? - The trap-door comes to the landing-place, not in the garret, but the outside of the garret.</p>

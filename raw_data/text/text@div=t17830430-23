               <p>Court.

               <p>On the 17th of March, between seven and eight, I was informed by a publican opposite, that two men were attempting to rob the coach house, and I went and saw the prisoner Dunnage standing two yards from the coach house door, accordingly I took hold of him; I was my while I looked in the coach house, I went to the coach house door, hearing a noise among he carriages I got a light, and Brown was behind a one horse chaise of mine, at the further part of the coach house; both the doors of this chaise of the prosecutor's were standing open, and the glass lay on the ground; I went into the back part of the coach house.</p>
               <p>Court. I it all open withinside? - There is room for six carriages; the prosecutor has half of it, there is a post in the middle that is a guide, his part is not separated from mine; there are two doors; I suppose these people got in, by violently putting at the bottom of the door.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you know the two men? - Not then, I saw them afterwards, they are the same two men.</p>
               <p>Did they both go in, or only one? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300048"></xptr> Only one, that was Brown, Dunnage staid without side.</p>

               <p>I know the coachman, and I went to see for him to help me to something, I was much disguised in liquor, and I fell fast a sleep.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life have you been in? - A post boy; Dunnage is a sailor.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you under stand that stealing privately these sort of articles, which are properly deposited in particular places, if above the value of 5 s. is offence. Now if any man removes from the place where it food, and where it ought to be, any sort of personal property belonging to another, with a design to steal it, he has then com pleated the felonious purpose, and whether he his the good fortune to take it of or no, makes no sort of difference. In the present case, as to whose coach house this was, for it seems to be held in common by two persons; and it is charged in the indictment, to be the coach house of Smalley the prosecutor; and it seems that though not actually divided, yet it was in point of enjoyment divided for occupation; it is a very nice point to be sure, where a man's life is at sta Another thing is, this is a charge of stealing privately, in this coach house; now privately stealing is as opposed to entering by force, burglary, or breaking a house; wheresoever there has been actual force used to get into a place, in which the charge is, that the party has stolen privately, the force used removes that part of the charge; now here, there are circumstances of force, and therefore what was stolen, could not be considered after that, to be stealing privately.</p>

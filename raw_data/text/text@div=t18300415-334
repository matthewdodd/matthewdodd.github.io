            . On the Sunday in question between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw some men come up Old'Change, arm-in-arm one was dressed in a light drab coat, he was a stiff upright man: the other was dressed in a blue coat - I saw the one in a light drab coat take a key out of his right hand pocket, and saw them open the door of No. 49, Old 'Change; they both walked in together into the house - I was called by the servant at a stationer's shop opposite, and might be there twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; and when I came out, I saw a backney-coach standing at the door of No. 49, the coach was No. 44; I cannot read, but know figures very well - there were two 4's on the coach, the coachman held the door open; I saw the man in a blue coat that went in come out, and jump into the coach - then the man in the light coat, brought out a large blue bag as full as it could hold, it was more than he could lift; they put it into the coach; the coachman was at the door all the time - the man who brought out the bag locked the door; put the key into the same pocket as he took it out of, and then got into the coach, the coachman shut the door; they came right up Old 'Change, and turned round by St. Paul's; I saw the coachman as plain as possible - and swear positively that the prisoner is that man - he drove towards me, and no other coaches were coming by; the place was quite clear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A poor woman - I sweep the street; I mentioned this the day after the robbery, and gave the number of the coach; I do not make a practice of looking at the numbers of coaches - it was a wet day; I do not remember the number of any other coach I saw that day - I was standing on the opposite side - the coach came right facing me and turned round; I saw the prisoner holding the coach door - I saw the number when the coach turned round; it did not go very quick till it turned the corner - the middle part of the number shone like glass - it was a coach; (looking at two figures) that was not the number - that is 27; it did not rain very hard - I saw nobody else near the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There are not many coaches about on Sundays in that part of the town? A. The stand is just by - there is hardly any traffic on Sundays.</p>

            . I was horse-keeper to Mr. Welch, a hackney-coach master in Horseferry-road - he has seven pairs of plates; No. 44 is one pair. On Sunday, the 21st of February, the prisoner drove No. 44 - I remember his going out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning with the coach, but I cannot say whether he drove it; he took it out, and had driven it for three or four days - he ought to have returned at five o'clock in the morning with the coach, but I cannot say whether he drove it; he took it out, and had driven it for three or four days - he ought to have returned at five o'clock in the evening; I cannot say at what time he came, as I was not in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He would come home at all hours - just as his fare required? A. Yes; I have known him five or six months - he is honest as far as I know; he wore a shiney hat - it was not oil skin, but looked like it.</p>

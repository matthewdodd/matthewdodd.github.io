Mr. Clarke came to me at the Compter, and said, he would shew me all the lenity that he could, if I confessed every transaction, which I did; Mr. Dawson has been a great deal more to blame than me; he has asked me many times for patterns of things, and he has influenced me very much. <rs id="t18001029-51-verdict287" type="verdictDescription">

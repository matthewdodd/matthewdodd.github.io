I called Stop thief! he was stopped at the end of the court, within a hundred yards of where I lost it; my handkerchief was produced.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Paul's-alley, Cripplegate. I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Savery following him, he was the only person running from the cry. I joined in pursuit up Jacob's Well-passage - He was stopped; I came up and secured him; in a moment a person brought the handkerchief, and said he picked it up.</p>

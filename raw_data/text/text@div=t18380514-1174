                  </hi>. I live at Monkton Hadley, Middlesex, and have a small farm.

On the 2nd of May I put the fowls into the hen-roost and locked the door, which is in the yard—I went there again about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and found the door broken open, and missed eight fowls—the policeman showed me three afterwards, which I know to be master's—the rest are lost—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I was walking with Mr. Dutton, and, towards the end of Harp-lane, I observed the prisoner exceedingly near him, and on turning to see what he was at, I saw the handkerchief drop to the ground - it could not have dropped from any body but the prisoner; nobody else was near enough - I collared him, and took up the handkerchief at the same time; he denied having taken it - there were two boys, evidently his associates, who dispersed immediately he was collared; I saw the handkerchief in the act of falling, before it reached the ground.</p>

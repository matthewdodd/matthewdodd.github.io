We missed the prisoner about seven o'clock, and my shirt, and coat, and things in the pockets ; I met with the prisoner again accidently in the street on Saturday in the afternoon, I took him into Custody and found the comb and buttons upon him. (produced in court and deposed to) I asked him where my coat was, he said, it was not to be had again, but he would send down to his friends in the country and make me satisfaction ; I took him before the Alderman and he was committed.</p>

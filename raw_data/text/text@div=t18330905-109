The prisoner was in my employ to block the caps; on the 25th of January I packed up these twenty dozen of caps in a basket, to go to Messrs. Harris and Warner, Winchester-place, over the water - I left word with my wife to send them by the porter as soon as he came in - the prisoner was not to take them - I left him there blocking when I went out - when I returned I inquired where these goods were - the prisoner stood next to me, and said, he had taken them to Harris and Warner, and I was to go the next morning, and they would give me a larger order - the prisoner took breakfast there the next morning, and then went away without notice - I then discovered the property had not been delivered - I have never seen it since- it was worth 20l. - the prisoner was taken on the 5th of August.</p>

            . (police-constable H. 124). I took the prisoner on the 5th of August, he denied stealing the caps; but in a moment or two afterwards. he said, Mr. Wolken knew all about it - on his way, he said, he had made away with the goods, at the suggestion of a man in Cutler-street, Houndsditch, who had waylaid him, and told him, if he could get some goods, he would buy them - that he took the hamper there, and the man bought half of them for 1l., and told him to take the rest to Gravesend, which he did, and sold them, and then he went into the country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master told me to take them- I called at the Blue Anchor and had a pint of beer, and left the basket at the door - when I came out it was gone- I was obliged to go back again - I told my master I had taken it, but the next morning he sent another parcel, and the man came back, and said, they had not received them, and I was obliged to leave.</p>

               <p>- Scurrier. I am a watchman; seven or eight weeks ago I met the prisoner in Portland street, near Seamore-street; he had a bundle under his coat; I thought he was not an honest man; I hid myself under the lamp; I went up to the prisoner and asked what he had got, he said, nothing; I felt on the side of his coat, and he dropt the glue pot and a hammer; I struck him with the staff, and he got the staff from me and struck me with it; I got it from him and struck him again; then he fell, and I took him; then he scattered the tools about; (the tools produced and deposed to by the prosecutor) after the tools were taken up, we went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110039"></xptr> the house in Seamore-street, and the door was open; at ten o'clock I tried it with my staff, and it was safe; the prisoner at the watch house told me he had been in the house two or three hours; but did not know how he came there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>There is a fault in the indictment, the indictment says the second of August, that cannot be; I was in custody on the 23d of July preceding, that shows it was commited before the second of August; on the 20th of July I was obliged to leave a jobb in the city, not being free; prior to that I had been ill and reduced; I could not work without tools; I undertook a jobb in the city, where they find tools, but I could not stay there long; I met with a friend that said he would lend me some tools; I was intoxicated, and went into that building with him; he brought these tools, and said that he would bring more; that they were his own property; on this foundation I took them.</p>

On the 9th of May, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Regent-street, and saw the prisoner following me very closely—I had suspicion—he turned down a street—I felt, and my purse was gone—he then joined another lad—there was no one near me but the prisoner till I lost my purse—I pursued him—before I said any thing to him, he set off, running—one of the two dropped my purse—it contained the property stated—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">examining one</hi>)—the prisoner was taken in a public-house.</p>

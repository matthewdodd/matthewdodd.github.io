            . I live in Stonecutter-alley, Little Queen-street, with my father, a pocket-book maker. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner looking in at Mr. Senior's window - I saw him leave the window, walk straight up to the gig, and take the umbrella from under the apron, under the strap; he walked off sharply towards Burlington-street - I ran after him, calling stop thief! down New Burlington-street, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060070"></xptr>was taken in Vigo-lane, with the umbrella - he never dropped it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you hear any body besides yourself call stop thief? A. Yes, one man; a gentleman offered to let you go if you would give up the umbrella.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking in at the window, turned round, and saw a man behind a gig, attempting to take a cloak; I crossed over - he took the umbrella, and ran away; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! a coach stopped me for a minute, and I did not overtake him - I picked up the umbrella; when I got further I saw a mob, and thought the man had been rescued - they collared me, and said I should not go further; I said I would go into the shop the umbrella was taken from - the two boys came and said I had stolen it; they said I might go if I gave it up - I said I would not till I saw the right owner; I walked on till I met the Policeman, and gave it into his charge.</p>

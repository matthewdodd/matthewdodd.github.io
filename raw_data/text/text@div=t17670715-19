I think Cox said, he worked for somebody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176707150013"></xptr> in Bedford-row; the boy came again on the Thursday in the afternoon, and wanted the ring; I said, I will not part from it, without you bring your master; on the next morning there came a man from Sir John Fielding with the prosecutrix, and asked me about it ( the ring produced in court, and deposed to).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 87.) On the 26th of Jan. I was on duty, in private clothes, in Camden-town, and saw the prisoner, in company with two others, in Camden Villas-road—I saw him go into several gates, up to several houses, and come out again, go down St. Paul's-terrace, and through different streets, till he came to the Albert-road—he went into several houses there, and at last went into the gate of No. 9—he remained in there about five minutes, then came out, and passed his companions, they taking no notice of him, which made me suspect he had something—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand into his pocket, and found these forks.</p>

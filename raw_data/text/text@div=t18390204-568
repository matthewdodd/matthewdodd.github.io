I had a bill against me of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I came to town to take up that bill—I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, tied up, on purpose to take up that bill—there was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and a note for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Romford Bank—I got to town ra<lb></lb>there before eleven o'clock in the morning of the 5th of January—I ex<lb></lb>pected the bill was at Hill and Son's, in Smithfield; but when I got there it was in Lombard-street, and I went back to Lombard-street—I met the prisoner Brown, as I was going to Smithfield, very near to St. Paul's church—he said, "What church is this here?"—I said, "I believe that is St. Paul's"—he asked me to show him round it—I told him I had business to do at Smithfield, I could not stop then—I walked on, and he walked with me as far as Little Britain, and there he asked me if I would take a drop of something to drink—I said, "I don't care if I have a glass of gin"—we went into a public-house, and he said, "Suppose we have a glass of gin and water"—he called for it, and paid for it—while we were there the pri<lb></lb>soner Smith came in, and another man came in just after him—the other man took out of his coat pocket a great bundle of notes of some sort—they ap<lb></lb>peared to me as though they were Hank of England notes—he said he had got them from the bank, that he had received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and be meant to be very liberal to the poor—he asked me where I lived—I told him I had just come from Romford—he said he would treat us, and asked whether there were any poor people at Romford—I said, "Yet, there are a great many poor people round the neighbourhood"—he asked me if I would take a £5 note, and take the trouble to buy 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of coals to give to the poor where I thought they were needy—I said, "Yes, if you think proper to let me have a £5 note I will put my trouble to it, and it shall be done"—he then separated a note out, and said I had better put it away with toy money—I was foolish enough to take my purse out with my money in it, and Smith, the prisoner, snatched it out of my hand—they were all three at that time sitting close together—after my purse was snatched Smith put it between his legs—they then had a large sheet of brown paper and began to rumple it up—I thought I was with sharpers—I caught my own purse and got it again—I could feel by the weight of it that I had got it right—I left the room instantly—Brown came out after me, and walked with me as far as the banker's in Smithfield—I said to him, "They are the sharpers, I think—I thought it was best to be off as quick as I could"—he said very little to me then, but the man who had the notes had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down a half-crown, and Brown said, "We may as well nave a glass of brandy and water"—I said, "No, this will be quite enough for me"—they</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of January, about twelve o'clock, the prosecutor and the two prisoners came to my house—there was another person—they all came in within a few minutes—the prosecutor came in with one of them—I did not take particular notice of their coming in, but I am certain the prosecutor was there, and the prisoners, and another man—they all followed each other along the passage, and went into the par lour—I went in with some ale, gin and water, and brandy and water—when I took the grog in, the money was on the table—after they had been there a little while, they all drew their chairs close round the prosecutor—I spoke to the officer, and he came in just as they were going out, and after they had gone out, I saw one or two of them go to another public-house, not above twenty yards from mine—I do not know whether the prosecutor went in, he was at the door—one of them went out of my house a little before the other—the pro<lb></lb>secutor, and two of them, went out together.</p>

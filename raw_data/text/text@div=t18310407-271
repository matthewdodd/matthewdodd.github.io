On the 22nd of February we were having wine in, between six and seven o'clock in the evening - my master desired me to stand at the street-door, which was open, while it was brought in, and as I went up, I saw a man going out of the passage with a coat and pair of shoes, which were taken out of the hall - I gave an alarm; my master went out, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How far off was he taken? A. About twenty yards - I did not lose sight of him; the boots were not found, but I saw him with them as well as the coat.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PROCTOR. I was coming out of my dining-room, and the servant said, "There is a man run away with your boots;" she pointed out the prisoner, who was running about twenty yards off - I ran, took him into a shop, and said, "Where are my boots?" he said, "I have no boots of your's;" he was very uneasy, and shuffling a coat off his back; I found he had my coat on over his own; it was rather dusky - he kept shaking his arms as he ran, and I suppose he was then putting the coat on - the boots have not been found.</p>

On the 24th of November I lost some red cloth, cut out for two cloaks, and some pieces of cloth besides, from out of the window; I missed them the minute after they were lost; I believe I had seen them not above an hour before, between six and seven o'clock; I have a Chinese hatch to the shop; I saw it open at that time; being dark I did not perceive any hand or any thing of that kind; I missed the cloth; I sent some shop bills round the neighbourhood, and in half an hour after I was sent for to St. Martin's-lane, to Mr. Hall's, a pawnbroker's; the prisoner was stopped there with the cloak. (The cloak produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) I had her before Justice Welch, who granted a search warrant, and in her lodgings we found the other pieces of cloth cut out for the other cloak, and some pieces of cloth besides; the whole remainder of what I had lost (produced and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

On the 4th of July, I was coming from Chelsea, I went into a public-house with two companions; as I came into the tap-room, the prisoner came and sat next to me, and asked if I would buy a shirt. I said I had no objection - he fetched it, it was wrapped up in a linen handkerchief. I gave him 5 s. 6 d. for the shirt, 6 d. for the handkerchief, and 5 s. 6 d. for a pair of shoes. One of my friends went away, we were walking along together, and went into the <placeName id="t18210718-129-crimeloc740">Rose and Crown, public-house, St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

               <p>"You have got my shirt and shoes." I said, I had paid him for them; he said,</p>
               <p>"I will have them or your life;" he knocked me down under the table, twisted my bundle from me, and to save myself from being choked, I let go, and he ran off with it - my friend was also knocked down. Next morning, I went to where I bought the things of him, and found him there in his regimentals, I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who robbed me last night;" he ran off, I followed him to the barracks, and he was secured. My handkerchief and shoes were found in his knapsack. I am positive he is the man.</p>

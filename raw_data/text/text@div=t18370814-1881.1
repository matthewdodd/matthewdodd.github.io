                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant. On the 8th of July I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner was the driver—he put me down at the Peacock, at Islington—a policeman immediately came and spoke to me—I then felt for my handkerchief and it was gone—the policeman after wards produced it to me at the station-house—this is it—I missed it directly I left the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Islington, and saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> arrive—I was about twenty yards off—I saw the prose cutor get out—he made a stagger backwards, and the prisoner took the handkerchief from his pocket, and put it into his own trowsers pocket—he was standing up in his seat at the time—the prosecutor got out on the near side—the prisoner and the prosecutor both went into the house, and I went and took the prisoner into custody—he was drawing the handkerchief from his own pocket as I took hold of his arm.</p>

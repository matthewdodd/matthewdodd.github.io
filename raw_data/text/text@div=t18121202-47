               <p>Q. How long did she stay - A. She was in the room about three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever lay there - A. No. The feather-bed, bolster, a pair of sheets, blankets, and cover-lid, was part of the furniture in the room let to her. She came about the room on the 10th of November, She agreed for the price five shillings a week. She did not stay in the room above three hours, and all the things were gone. I had been out to my mothers, and on returning home I saw the window open. We opened the door, and found the things gone. By enquiry I found her at Bethnal-green poor-house, and she owned that she took the things. She came in about half after four o'clock in the afternoon, and between ten and eleven we entered the room.</p>
               <p>MARIA CRANE. I was in the house at the time that the prisoner took the room. She went up in the room; she liked it exceeding well. She said, she would go, and let her husband know. She came on the Thursday following. She said, her husband was a narrow weaver. She went and fetched an old tea-chest. She said, she brought a small parcel to begin with. Her husband would bring the rest. We gave her clean sheets. When it came dark she came down, and said she was going for a candle. We lent her a brass candlestick. She came down at seven o'clock.</p>

            Which way did the things go - A. Through the window. I was in the house the whole time. The things did not come down stairs; they went out of the window. Nobody could come in without we let them in and out. I am positive no person was in there at all but the prisoner. She left the door fastened when she went out.</p>

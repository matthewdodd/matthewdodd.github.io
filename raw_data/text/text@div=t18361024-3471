                  </hi>. I arrived in London from Hertfordshire, about six o'clock on the evening of the 10th of October, and about one o'clock in the morning of the 11th I found myself benighted, and greatly in want of a lodging—I went with a woman to get one, in Blackfriar's-road—I do not know the woman—having taken a little more than usual, I was rather overcome, and went to bed alone—I had a waistcoat and three handker<lb></lb>chiefs, a watch, three sovereigns, and a £5 Bank-note—when I awoke, about five o'clock in the morning, my property was all gone, and every body also; the room was empty—this is my pocket-book—I had a I £5 Bank-note, and three sovereigns were wrapped in it—I made no mark on the note—the book and the money is all that is produced—there were two woman, one in the house at the time I entered, besides the woman I went with—the woman did not go to bed with me.</p>

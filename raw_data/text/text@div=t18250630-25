            . I am an officer. The prisoner was given into my charge at the Bull and Gate. On the way to the watch-house she pressed my hand to her side, and whispered,</p>
               <p>"I have got the sovereign, will you take it?" I said Yes: I took it, and gave it to the constable of the night - she had some silver in her hand; I should think not more than 2 s. or 3 s., which she said he had given to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. William Tell<lb></lb>kampff Gulliver. On Saturday, the 5th of Aug., Mr. Watson, my master's foreman, gave me a sovereign to get change for him to pay the apprentices—he was to pay them on my master's account—I went to Mr. Harvey's, in New Gravel-lane, and asked him for change, but did not get it—I came out, and met Ann Sullivan, who is Mr. Gulliver's servant, at the door—I had the sovereign in my hand—the prisoner was just by, and asked what I wanted—I said change for a sovereign—he said he could give me change—I said I was much obliged to him—I had never seen him before—a young man crossed the road, and said change was very scarce that night—the prisoner then counted 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my hand—I gave him the sovereign, and he said, "It is a half-sovereign, is it not?"—I said, "No, a sovereign"—he said, "I can't give you change for a sovereign, I thought it was a half-sovereign"—he gave me a penny medal into my hand, and said, "Here-is your sovereign back again"—I thought it was the sovereign, and gave him the silver back—I gave the medal the prisoner gave me to Sullivan, as she said she was going to Mr. Wardle's to get some things, and she would try to get change—I did not know then that it was not the sovereign—I stood at Wardle's door while Sul<lb></lb>livan went in—she came out, and told me it was a penny medal—she and I then went and looked after the prisoner—I showed the medal to a policeman in Ratcliff-highway as we went along—I did not lose sight of it except when I gave it to Sullivan—I then took it home, and gave it to my mother—she went with the medal and me to the foreman, and he returned it to me—I saw my mother put it on the drawers under a shell—the policeman has it now—on the 4th of Nov., three months after the transaction, I went to the Black Bull to get something for my mistress, and saw the prisoner there and the</p>

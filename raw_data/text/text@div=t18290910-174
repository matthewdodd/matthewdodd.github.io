            . I was at the chapel; my attention was called, and I saw a man getting out of the vestry window with a hat in each hand; I immediately went out of the chapel, round into Cursitor-street and Castle-street, and at the end of Norwich-court, leading into Fetter-lane, I saw the prisoner going deliberately along, with two hats in his hand; when I got within arm's length of him, he saw me, threw them down behind him, and ran off as fast as he could - I followed, calling Stop thief! he had a hat on; I followed him across Fetter-lane, as far as New-street-hill, and on turning the corner Pavey had tripped him up; they were both rolling together - I caught hold of him, and we brought him back with difficulty; he pleaded for mercy when I first laid hold of him; but at the top of Dean-street he began to be violent, and vowed he would not go to prison for nothing; he struck me, and tore my neck handkerchief - I lost my pin; we were obliged to carry him to Holborn-hill - he vowed he would not walk, and dropped down; he was very desperate at the watch-house - they were obliged to lay him on his back and handcuff him: and even then he got to the fire-place, seized the poker, and would gave done some violence had he not been prevented; I do not believe he was drunk - I swear he is the man; one hat was brought back to the vestry, and given to Mr. Muston, I believe.</p>

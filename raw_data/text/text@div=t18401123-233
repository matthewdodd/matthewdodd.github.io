On Sunday evening, the 25th of October, I was in my yard about seven o'clock—the windows and doors of both the count<lb></lb>ing-houses were perfectly safe at that time—about one in the morning I was alarmed by Butcher, a private watchman—in consequence of what he told me I examined the counting-houses—I found the window of the small counting-house lowered from the top, and one of the shutters dis<lb></lb>placed, to enable the parties to get in—it must have been opened from the outside—the back window of the large counting-house was also open—it had been put up, but not fastened—the door was forced open from the inside—there is no shutter to the large counting-house window—a desk in the small counting-house was forced open, and something put to keep it up, and likewise my clerk's desk in the large counting-house—the keys of the different warehouses, which hung on the hooks, were thrown about the room—I missed all the articles stated, which had been quite secure on the Sunday night—this brass mortar, steel, and other things, are my pro<lb></lb>perty—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

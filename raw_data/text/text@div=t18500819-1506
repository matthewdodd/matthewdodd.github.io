                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we live at 8, Praed-street, Paddington. On 29th June, my husband was at home with me at half-past six o'clock in the evening—he had been tipsy all the week, and I with him, and for a month before that—he did not use insulting language to me; I did to him—I flung a spoon at him, into the dirty ashes, and almost blinded him, and I hit him, and tore his shirt off; I went into the passage and screamed "Murder!" before anything was done to me—on that, I ran in again, and he was beating the table, and I caught hold of him, and tore the front of his shirt</p>

               <p>off and beat his face—it was all my fault—he was always very kind to me—my arm was never broken, I could comb out my hair two days afterwards—my husband did not hit me a blow—I dragged him off the bed, and called him very bad names, and aggravated him, but he never came home with the intention of ill-using me—it was putting my arms to save two pieces of mahogany, which he was striking, that hurt my arm—he was breaking the mangle, and I got before him to prevent it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THORPE. I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 6th of July, and he immediately dropped this handkerchief out of his breast, and threw it down - he had been running from a cry of Stop thief! a bye<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080101"></xptr>stander took up the handkerchief, and gave it to me; the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing it, and said his name was

            ; the prisoner said he knew nothing of it - we tussled about ten minutes; no one came to my assistance - he was very desperate: it happened about half-past six o'clock in the evening, at the end of <placeName id="t18300708-209-crimeloc1178">Spring-gardens</placeName>

               <p>FRANCES SYMONDS. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket last Tuesday evening; I heard the gentleman's name, but I do not remember it - the prisoner put it into his left breast, and ran; I was close by, and said to the gentleman,</p>
               <p>"Have you lost any thing?" he said, "Yes, my handkerchief;" I said,"This young man has it;" I am sure he is the man that took it - I saw the officer take him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said there were three or four more. -Witness. Yes, there were; I saw you take it out with your right hand, and hold up the flap of the coat with your left - you ran across the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been into the Park, and was coming down Spring-gardens; the gentleman accused me of picking his pocket - I said I had not, and that officer came and took me - he was not in his uniform, and used me very shamefully; I said I would not go till a Policeman came up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THORPE. He was very violent - it took seven of us to take him to the watch-house.</p>

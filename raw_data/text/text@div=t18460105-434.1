I am the mother of this witness—I have a customer named Eliza Taylor—my child has been in the habit of going backwards and forwards to her with linen—he had been very careful hitherto—I never lost anything before this time—I sent him with some linen on the 20th of Dec.—he complained on his return that he had lost his bundle—I went to know what linen it was—I then went to the policeman, and he said, from the description, he had no doubt it was Tapson—some rags have been shown to me by the policeman—I know them quite well—they are the two shifts and the other things mentioned—I could tell, in this state, that they are part of the linen I washed for Taylor—this is part of them.</p>

               <p>J. Smith. On the 28th of May, I went out about three, and returned about nine, and found my door was broke open; it was a garret; I missed two pair of shoes, a muslin apron, two pair of muslin ruffles, intended for double, but they were only single, a cardinal without a lining, trimmed with silk, a lawn apron, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176106250018"></xptr> linnen handkerchief, a gown, and a skirt of a gown. I suspected a woman at the next door, and took her into custody; and she was confined from the Thursday, 'till the Tuesday after, 'till these two prisoners told me they never saw her face.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Callender-yard, Long-alley, Moorfields; the woman at the bar brought these things to me on the 29th of May; I lent her 4 s. upon one pair of shoes and the apron; I lent her a crown on the other things the Wednesday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by them?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. She said they were her own; she looked very creditable, and said she lived in Dyer's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever pawned any thing with you before?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. Never but once before, and that was on the 8th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. That was in the morning about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time she came to you?</p>
               <p>M. Thompson. That was on the 29th of May, four days after she had pledged the cardinal and things; then she brought a pair of shoes, and an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any memorandums at the times you took in the things?</p>

            . My husband's name is William: on Saturday the 23d of May my door was broke open, and the things mentioned in the indictment taken away. I saw the prisoners at justice Cox's, I was told they had several tea-spoons and things in their pockets. When I came there I was shewed two tea-spoons, a tea-strainer, and a pair of tea-tongs; they were my property, I have some of the same mark by me. [Produced in Court, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenal. I am constable, the tongs and one tea-spoon I found in the man at the bar's pocket, the other spoon and strainer were found in the woman's pocket, by another man, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Salter. Where did you lose them from?</p>
               <p>S. Salter. They were taken out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the mark on the spoons?</p>
               <p>S. Salter. They are marked W. S. the tongs are W. S. and the strainer C. K.</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover. Mrs. Thompson, the pawnbroker, sent for me the first of June, to advise with me concerning some things she had in pawn; I went by her desire to this place, they were gone to justice Cox's, I went there, the woman at the bar took a tea-spoon and strainer out of her pocket, and delivered them to me.</p>

               <p>I kept a house in Radcliffe-highway about two years ago. I bought of a man and his wife four tea-spoons, tongs, and strainer, I have the other two here to shew: here they be, they are marked W. S.</p>

            . I knew Mrs. Calyhan six or seven months, I have drank tea in her house twice, I have seen silver spoons there.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they marked?</p>
               <p>M. Tufnel. I do not remember the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon them?</p>
               <p>M. Tufnel. I cannot say whether there were or not. I never knew any thing amiss of them, any farther than being sober people.</p>
               <p>[The two spoons produced by the woman prisoner inspected by the Jury, the engraving does not correspond, and seem'd to be done by different hands.]</p>

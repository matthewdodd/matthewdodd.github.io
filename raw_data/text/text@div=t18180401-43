            . I am a watchman of St. Dunstan's. Soon after half-past one o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Fleur-de-lis court, and saw the prisoner, and another man in company pass me, another man followed them, after that the prosecutor came up. He made a sudden start across the street, and fell into a door-way at the corner of <placeName id="t18180401-43-crimeloc250">Mitre-court</placeName>

The prisoner, and the other two, immediately ran towards him, as if to assist him, but I saw they wanted to rob him. The prisoner was in the middle of the two. He placed himself on one knee, and began rifling the prosecutor's pockets. I saw him take his right hand from the prosecutor's pocket, and put something into his right-hand coat-pocket-his hand was immediately applied a second time. I ran across-the prisoner jumped up and ran away, seeing me near him; I called to Wade to stop him. He then threw several papers of no value out of his hand. Wade tried to stop him, the prisoner struck him in the stomach - He fell. I took the prisoner immediately. Wade recovered himself, and came to my assistance. The prisoner put his hand into his right-hand coat-pocket - I kept it there, to see what he had until I got him to the watch-house. The officer there took the pocket-book out of his pocket. He threw five duplicates out of his pocket, which fell on a bench in the watchhouse. He then said, if he could have taken the life of either of us two b-gg-rs he could have died happily for us. He was sent to the Compter.</p>

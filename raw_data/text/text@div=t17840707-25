               <p>I am a lodger in the prosecutor's house, it is in the broad place; I was at home when the house was broke open, on the 31st of May last, about nine in the evening, I left the house, I left nobody in the house, and I returned about a quarter before ten; when I returned I observed the street door and the kitchen door were both open, and I saw the prisoner in the house.</p>
               <p>What was he doing? - He had a brown linen apron on full of things, the property of the prosecutor, he was looking into the drawers belonging to the chest of drawers which stood in the kitchen, I collared him and he run away, I pursued him he was stopped by Hatchman, I never lost sight of him, I saw him drop the things at the door, the things were all taken up afterwards, when he was brought back and carried to the watch-house; they were taken up by Hatchman.</p>
               <p>Did you secure the door when you went away? - I latched the door, I only latched it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, whether he did not bring a woman before the Justice, that said she knew the man that dropped the things? - I saw the prisoner drop the things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

               <p>Court to Hatchman. When you was called did you see the prisoner? - I stopped him, and the prisoner said do not stop me it is only a sight.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, with respect to the larceny it is very strong evidence, but there is a difficulty about the capital part of the charge, the lodger said it was about nine o'clock, and they do not pretend to any degree of accuracy; therefore it was dark when he returned, yet when he opened the latch, it was sufficiently light to acquit him of the capital part of the charge.</p>

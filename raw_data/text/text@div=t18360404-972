                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Sweet, a private in the 89th Regiment of Foot Guards, I live in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, in the parish of St. Luke-the prisoner came there, about the 25th of March, and took a furnished room—it was on a Friday—she was to pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I required a reference—She told me where I could get one, but I was confined at the time, and did not in<lb></lb>quire after it—I saw her on the Tuesday in the house—she and Sarah</p>

               <p>Smith came out at the street door, about the middle of the day—they had both something in their aprons—I went up to my bed-room, and found it in confusion—I missed from my drawers two shawls, two aprons, one frock, two pinafores, a bundle of caps two shirts, and four petticoat—I went to the station-house, got an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—she had very little to say—she pretended to know nothing at all shout it—she was taken to the office, and there I found on her a flannel petticoat, which was taken from my room—I had locked the bed-room door in the morning, and had not opened it afterwards—it must have been opened by a key for I found it still locked, and I am confident the things were there in the morning—I told the prisoner the petticoat was mine, and insisted on her taking it off—she said Smith had given her the petticoat—Smith had no business in my house at all—the prisoner paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when she came into the house—she was to pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he much in liquor that night? - A. I thought he seemed to pretend to be more in liquor than he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go through the room, where the things were, to-bed? - A. No; he went out backwards, about ten o'clock, through that room; the things were on a dresser; there was no light in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember his going into that room but that once? - A. No, only once.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BLACKALL sworn. - I was sent for by Mrs. Gibson on the 29th of April, between one and two o'clock; I took the prisoner into custody; I was desired to search him, which I did; I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250051"></xptr>a frock and four caps loose in his breeches, in the back part; he said, he was very sorry, he did not know what he was doing, and hoped he should be forgiven - that he was rather in liquor when he did it. (The things were produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Whether I did not ask her whether the suspected me? - A. I did suspect him, but did not say so, because there was nobody at home but myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a plumber; the circumstances of my case demands pity: I was going to sail in a few days, I met two persons at the prosecutor's house, and, in the course of the evening, I drank immoderately of mixed liquors; I knew nothing where I was, till I waked in a strange room; I did not know how the things came into my possession; I found them in the morning, and came down to the sitting room, and intended to find an opportunity of dispossessing myself of them; if you should find me guilty, I hope you will permit me to serve his Majesty by sea, which I will do thankfully and faithfully.</p>

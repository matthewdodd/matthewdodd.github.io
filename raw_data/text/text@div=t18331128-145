            . I am a labourer. I lodge at Mr. Baker's at Kilburn; I was in Bell-street, Paddington, on Sunday morning, the 17th of November, about nine o'clock; there were several persons there and I saw the prisoner Duxberry; he asked me if I had seen William Curall; I said, I had not; he put his hand into his right trowsers pocket, pulled out a watch and said, he had picked a man up who had tumbled out of a cab lumpy, and he had got that and his tile - lumpy means tipsy, and tile means a hat - he then put the watch into his pocket again - it was a silver watch with a chased case; not a plain case; it had two seals, a key, and a steel chain; I am sure of that - while we were in conversation, William Curall came up, and Duxberry told me to stand on one side as he wanted to speak to him - I stood about a couple of yards from them, and saw Duxberry take the watch out of his pocket and shew it to Curall; Curall then took it into his hands, and they were in conversation; Curall then gave Duxberry two half-crowns, and put the watch into his own pocket, and went away; Duxberry then asked me if I would have a glass of rum; I said yes, and he took me to the Green-man, and we had a quartern, and he paid for it out of one of the half-crowns; we walked on as far as the Coach and Horses, and then he asked me to go home and have a bit of breakfast with him, and I went with him to Grace's where he lodged; I had some bread and meat and a cup of tea; I then left him - I went there again at dinner time; I had some bread and meat and then came away; I left him there and did not see him again till Monday evening, about nine o'clock; he was very tipsy and had a cap on - I saw him two or three times, but did not have any conversation with him till the Friday following, when I saw him in the Edgware-road; he said, he wanted to see William Curall as he had promised him 1s.; he said, he had fooled away the watch very foolishly; I told him there was a paper in a window and I took him and shewed it him; he said, "Yes, that was the watch and this is the tile I have on, and I had better do away with it;" I did not give information of this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now as Duxberry told you he had found a man lumpy and he had got that and his tile, how soon was it after that you gave information of this? A. I did not know of anything being lost till I saw the bill; I believe there was one sovereign reward on the bill; I do not know whether I expect to get it - I do not know whether I hope to get it - I came here because the prosecutor is a poor man, and I thought he should not lose his hat - I went before the magistrate and Curall was admitted to bail - I have not seen the watch since - I did not know who had lost these things, till I saw the bill on the Friday following, and then I went and told that a man I had seen in the street, told me he had stolen a watch and a hat - I live at Mr. Baker's opposite the Red Lion, at Kilburn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever known to Mr. Baker till this time? A. The carman knew me, but Mr. Baker did not; I lodge in the buildings where he keeps hay and that, as I was out of employ; I did not lodge in the open air; I lodged in Mr. Baker's hay-loft for three weeks - I never asked his permission; he did not know it - I am not known at the Delaware Arms - I was never lurking about there; I have been in there and had a pint of beer, but I was never lurking about there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I were to produce anybody who had seen you lurking about there you would be surprised? A. No; I should not be surprised at all - I know

               <p>Q. Do you remember saying to him that you were not going to walk about without shoes, and to starve, as you knew where there were some fowls that would do very well? A. No, sir; I never said so nor anything of the kind - I was not without shoes - I knew there were fowls where I lodged - when I told his lordship and the jury that I lodged at Mr. Baker's I did not mean to represent that I lodged in his house - I was never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280112"></xptr>in any trouble myself; I was never acqainted with crime in any way - I never did any man an injury, nor any fowls - I knew that tile meant a hat and that lumpy meant tipsy, because I had heard men say so in the street many times - he did not say he had picked a man up who was lumpy and had got his ticker - I know that ticker means a watch - I have heard that too.</p>

I am a farmer, and live at Kilburn; I am afraid Turner lodged about my place to my inconvenience - I lost a great many fowls; when my hay is put out for my cattle, Turner walks in and takes the hay and covers himself with it; there was a very bad character lodged with him.</p>

            . The prisoner Duxberry lodged with me; on Saturday night, the 16th of November, he came home - I think it was not after twelve o'clock; I was standing at the corner of Lisson-street, and the pork butcher's shop was not shut up; I got the mattress out, and made a bed up for him in the same room I slept in, but he came home after and went to bed - he had been drinking a little.</p>

            . The prosecutor lodged at my house; he came home and knocked twice at my door - I looked out and saw him, and Duxberry was with him, he had a blue cap on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HODGES. Q. What time was this? A. The clock struck two as I was putting the window up - I can swear that Duxberry was the person I saw; he had a blue coat and a blue cap on; I picked him out of the cell at High-street.</p>

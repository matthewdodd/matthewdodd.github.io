I lodge with my sister in White Lion-street, Norton-falgate; I met the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140020"></xptr>prisoner about eleven o'clock on Wednesday night in Bishopsgate-street; I was quite sober; I had these things in a bundle, and had just come from my ship, about ten o'clock; she was with another woman; they asked me to go home with them, I went to a house in <placeName id="t18230514-44-crimeloc243">Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

The prisoner made an excuse to go out, to light the candle - she took the bundle off the table, and went out. I had not then been in the room above five minutes - I went after her but could not overtake her, and returned to the room and stopped there, thinking she would return. I have found none of the property; I saw her next morning between nine and ten o'clock, opposite White Lion-street, Norton-falgate, and charged her with it - she said she had never seen me before. I am certain of her. It was a moon-light night, but there was no candle in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARDING. I am an officer. Larham came to me about one o'clock in the morning, and described the prisoner's person. I took her from his description in Shoreditch; I searched her - I found nothing in the house. He shewed me the house; I know she lived there, with the other woman.</p>

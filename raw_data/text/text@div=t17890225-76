               <p>On the 20th of January this looking-glass was put into the window, marked, in order to find out the thief; we had lost several things; I knew nothing of the robbery till the prisoner was brought to my compting-house.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner open the door, and put his hand into the shop, and take the glass out of the window; I was at the farther end of the shop; I hallooed, stop thief! as loud as I could; and when the prisoner got a few yards from the door I saw him throw the glass in the street, I ran after him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken; I am sure he is the man that took the glass; there was a man that was set there to watch, but he saw nothing of it, I was watching also.</p>
               <p>What state was the door in? - The door of a night is generally on the spring, we have a spring and a catch.</p>
               <p>Then the door was shut to without being catched? - I will not say whether it was catched or not; I believe the spring was not let loose that night; it was shut to.</p>
               <p>Had the door any fastening at all? - There is a catch and a spring, when the spring goes it will not open without somebody comes to open it for them.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge, whether it was catched or no? - I cannot say whether it was catched or not; but I know if anybody goes out of the shop the door will catch.</p>
               <p>How came you to watch in the shop? - Because we had lost so many things, and we set the glass there to catch the thief.</p>
               <p>Then, if the spring had not been let go they could come in to take the glass? - I suppose it was the mistake of the porter not shutting the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you know that the porter had committed that mistake then? - Yes, I knew that the door was left in that manner to see if any body would come in.</p>
               <p>Then it was not the mistake of the porter; now, perhaps, you thought it more likely that somebody would come if the door was shut and not latched? - I believe it was latched, because if any body goes out, it will catch, but I cannot say whether any body had gone out, or whether it was latched.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Seddon; on the complaint of the clerk of repeatedly losing things, this scheme was formed for detection; this evening a person was secreted in the front shop, and I took upon me to watch out of the door on the opposite side of the way; after waiting about three quarters of an hour, this prisoner, in company with others, came and walked to and fro for some time, and then they looked into the shop to see in what state the clerks were; after walking backwards and forwards, I suppose ten minutes, that young man went on the steps, laid on his side again the door, and whether the door was open or not, I will not say; but he went in, he returned with the glass in his hand; I met him at the last step of the door, I endeavoured to stop him, he took to his heels, I pursued him instantly; he dropped the glass, I followed him some time after, but not long enough to lay hold of him, he was never out of my sight.</p>

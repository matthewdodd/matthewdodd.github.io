               <p>Is there any other circumstance by which you can prove this to be your master's silk? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you missed it before you was told? - Yes, I missed several hanks of dark blue</p>
               <p>Did you ever see this silk on the prisoner? - No, I have not.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and have been so two years; on the Sunday afternoon I found this twist on the prisoner in the front of the kitchen; he was in the front kitchen playing with Mr. Da Costa's father; he was laying on his right side, and the twist was in his left pocket in a paper; I took the paper out of his pocket softly, to know what was in it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250034"></xptr> he did not know I took it out; I went into the back kitchen to see what was in the paper, and finding it to be twist, I thought it was my master's property; I told Russel of it about half after ten at night; I took it between two and three, but Russel did not come home before.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that you did not tell your master's father of it? - I was not certain of it; and I thought my master's father could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>What colour was the silk? - There was some dark blue and some mixtures.</p>
               <p>Russel. This apprentice Walters gave me the first information of this silk within five minutes after I came home; I put in the bodkin as usual into the sliding place on Saturday night; I have the key of the cutting room always in my pocket since my master has been abroad; the bag of silk was in the cutting room; none of the apprentices have any business there; nor nobody had been in the cutting room on Saturday to my knowledge; the prisoner and the other apprentice were at home on the Sunday morning till I went out, which was about eleven.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Da Costa. What time did you go out on the Sunday? - Between twelve and one, the apprentices were both at home then; when I returned, Walters was at home, but not the prisoner; he returned between ten and eleven that night.</p>
               <p>Had you charged Walters with taking this silk? - No; he told me that evening.</p>
               <p>What is the character of Walters? - I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Court to Walters. You have taken an oath to tell the whole truth; you did not take this silk out of the bag yourself? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the twist in the same street as I came home.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Da Costa. What did he say? - He said a boy gave it him.</p>
               <p>Russel. It is worth nine shillings</p>

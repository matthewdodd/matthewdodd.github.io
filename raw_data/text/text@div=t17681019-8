            . I know Mr. Steel lost the two cloths from off his carriages; I went to see the prisoner when in prison, there I heard him confess he stole the two hammer-cloths from off Mr. Steel's carriages; he said he should not be tried for them, because he knew he should be transported for another offence, so he very readily confessed it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Steel gave me half a crown, and said he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Steel. I desired he would let me know if he took them, because I would not blame an innocent man; he said he knew he should be transported for what he was put in for, he said he did take them; then I gave him half a crown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was out of work, and it was for want that I did it.</p>

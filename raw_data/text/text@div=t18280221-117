            . On the 23d of January I was in New Compton-street, about six o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner and another following a truck, which went up Wardour-street; one of them put his hand into it, but I did not see them take any thing - they went on to Oxford-street, and went to a cart, but I did not see them take any thing from that; they went on to Regent-street, and went to a truck, but I did not see them take any thing from that - they went into <placeName id="t18280221-117-crimeloc621">Air-street</placeName>

Jem!" and the prisoner came up with the cloak on his arm - they ran on towards Dean-street, where they tied the cloak up, and the other took it; I and Phillips ran on to get a-head of them; I took hold of the other, who had this bundle - he threw it at me, and got away - I saw Phillips had hold of the prisoner, who seemed to be going to strike him; I knocked the prisoner down, and secured him - I found these three keys on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear I was the person who took the cloak? A. Yes; it was dark, and I lost sight of him for about ten minutes.</p>

            . I was with Whittingham; I did not see the prisoner take the cloak, but I saw his companion; I said, "Let us keep to him, and we shall find the other;" he went into a dark street, and whistled, and called, "Jem!" and the prisoner came up, with the cloak on his arm.</p>

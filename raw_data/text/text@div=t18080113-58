               <p>Q. Did you pick up these women in the street. - A. No, I never saw them before; they were never in my company; they came into the house; one laid hold of me, and the other took the watch out of my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you tell, when you were asleep. - A. This man saw them - Dolby Jackson, a black man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again. - A. No; when I awoke I found my watch was gone; there was a woman standing by the side of me, but she was neither of the prisoners. The prisoners went out of the house as soon as they took the watch away. I laid hold of the woman; the black man said if she had not got the watch he would shew me who had. I went and found the prisoners in the street, drinking saloop; they were taken to the watchhouse, and nothing found upon them. The watchhouse keeper told me to go back for the saloop woman; I did, she was gone away; she has not been out for weeks afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sober. - A. No, I was drunk.</p>

I was sitting in the Black Dog; these two men came in and called for a pint of beer, they both drank once; he fell asleep; these two women came in and finished the pint of beer the men called for.

             put his head in her lap, and the other unbuttoned his flap and took out his watch. I called out they were going to rob the man; the landlord said, what is that to you; then I said no more. I waked him soon after, and he went and took them in the street. Hinckes searched him first; she says I can perceive nothing. Brown said, you come and set over him, I will search him; the biggest prisoner drawed the watch out, I halloaed out; the landlord said I had nothing to do with it; as they said so, I said no more. As soon as I came to town I gave twelve shillings for a hat; some of them in that public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130054"></xptr>house stole my hat.</p>

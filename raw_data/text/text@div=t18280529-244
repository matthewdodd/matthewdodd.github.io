I carried a yellow trunk by the prisoner's order, from the vessel to the White Swan public-house, Rosemary-lane; he went there with me - he said it was his own - I was on the wharf waiting for a job; I am sure he said it was his own, and he said he was a passenger in that vessel, the Forfairshire; I was called again at eight o'clock that night, and went with the prosecutor to find it.</p>

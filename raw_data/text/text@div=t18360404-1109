                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Turrell, a gardener—who lives at Blackheath. On the 5th of April I was at Greenwich Fair, looking at the shows—the prisoner cut my gown, my petticoat, and my pocket, and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I caught him by the collar with my left hand, and said, "You naughty boy, you have cut my pocket"—he said, "No, mistress, I have not; my brother is here—my brother is here"—and he swung himself out of my hand, and went under the steps of the show—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, and I lost them—I found my gown, petticoat, and pocket had two holes in them—I had felt my money safe two minutes before, when I had my hand in my pocket, and I suppose he heard the money rattle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was standing by a show, and this woman came and said I had cut her pocket—I was just going up in one of the penny shows—she seemed as if she was in liquor—she bit me with an umbrella. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not hit him at all—I was not in liquor—his hand was through my gown and my pocket at the time I took hold of him—he ran to some other boys under the steps, and was taken by a Greenwich pensioner.</p>

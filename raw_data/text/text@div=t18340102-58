             - some things were taken out of my box that night - a coat, waistcoat, trousers, braces, and handkerchief - there is a back-door to the house, leading into the yard - the front door opens into the street.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE ISHERWOOD. I live exactly opposite Sinfield's house - on the Tuesday evening about six o'clock I was sitting by the fire and heard a knock at Sinfield's door three separate times - I then went to the window of my room up stairs, I had no candle - I saw three young men standing in the street - it is a very narrow street - there was a good light - the moon was shining in the opposite side where they were, and there was a light from the shop below, and a gas light at a small distance. I did not know any of the men - I saw them at the door - I now know them, but I did not know them before - two of the prisoners I know, I can't swear to the third - I can speak to Codey and Hardwick, but not to Lewis - when I first looked I saw them looking to the opposite side - two of them went towards the Curtain-road, and one towards Paul-street - they came back in about five minutes - the two came back, and the other was there directly after - when they came back they stood looking at the opposite side for a minute, and then they were on the step of the door - Codey then turned round, and the door opened - they opened the door - it was fast before I know, because they knocked at it - the moment it opened, Codey took a light from his pocket, and the others followed him into the house - Hardwick went first, and the other one went after him - they shut the door- I stood at the window, and saw them all three come up stairs with a light - the stairs are opposite the window - I saw them come right up into Sinfield's front room, next the street, on the first floor - they walked across the room with a light - I immediately went down stairs and gave an alarm to Mr. Dodge and to Cox the policeman - they went across directly - I just went into Sinfield's house afterwards and looked into the parlour - I was so very agitated at the time I saw Hardwick sitting in a chair; and I mentioned him as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020032"></xptr>Codey - I was much agitated, and I thought it was him, but I was mistaken in that - I said it was Codey, but I was mistaken; it was Hardwick - I had never seen either of them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This rather agitated you? A. Yes: certainly - I did not mistake one man for another at the office.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DODGE. I live in Luke-street, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - Isherwood gave me an alarm- I, and Cox the officer, ran over - I could see a light in the front room - I knocked at the door three times, as hard as I could, and I then saw the light was put out - I gave an alarm of thieves - my brother and others came over, and I saw Hardwick come out of the front door of the house - I stopped him in the doorway and held him - Cox laid hold of him also - we held him a short time - we took him into the house, and he was taken to the station-house without being out of custody - he was searched by Cox - I did not notice what he found - I found, just within the street door of Sinfield's house, a watch, all but the outside case - I found it as soon as he was taken to be searched - it was lying at the entrance - I afterwards went up-stairs, and saw Mrs. Howlet take up a crow-bar, just within the front room door, where I had seen the light - I took it down into the parlour and asked Hardwick if he knew anything of it - he made no answer - I gave it to Cox - my back was towards the door - I did not see anybody else rush out at the door.</p>
               <p>JOHN COX. I am a policeman - I was present with Dodge, and seized Hardwick, and kept him in custody - he was coming out into the street from the front door of Sinfield's house - I have tried the crow-bar to the box upstairs which was broken open - it fits exactly - I am fully persuaded it was used to break it open - I found a key, a knife, and handkerchief, on Hardwick - it is a skeleton key, and will open the front door - he was kept in custody.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER. I am a policeman - I was called on to assist, on the 17th of December - I was at the back part of Sinfield's house, and saw two or three men at the back door - they appeared trying to make their escape - I was on the wall - they saw me, and rushed back into the house again - I followed them; and followed two of them out into the street, and took one, that was Codey - I did not lose sight of him at all - he ran about five or six hundred yards - I took him to the station-house - he was searched, and eleven skeleton keys, a snuff-box, and three halfpence, found on him - I gave up the snuff-box and three halfpence to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Did you search him at the station-house? A. Yes - I felt the keys in his pocket before, but did not take them out.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN DODGE. I was alarmed, and went with the last witness to the back of the house - I returned back through No. 4, and followed Lewis - I was a distance off, and when I got to the front door, he was a few yards from the door, running down Luke-street - I followed him, and hallooed, "Stop thief" - I lost sight of him - I came up afterwards, and found him in the custody of another man - I cannot positively swear to Lewis being the man I followed - he seemed a little agitated, as if he had been running - I took him back, and let him go, as the people round said I was not an officer, and had no business to detain him - I am sure it was 
               <persName id="t18340102-58-person532">Lewis</persName>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 15, Powell-street, west, King-square, Goswell street, in the parish of St. Luke—I reside in the house. On the 2nd of February, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was standing by the fire in the back parlour, and thought I heard somebody in the passage—I am quite sure the pas<lb></lb>sage-door had been shut—I took a candle off the table, and went into the front parlour—as soon as I opened the door I saw the table-cover was gone—I also missed a tea-caddy and a writing-desk belonging to Mr. John Joseph Parker, a lodger—I then went out to see if I could see any body, and met a policeman in Brick-lane—we went to the station, and the officer produced my table-cover and tea-caddy—I then went to a court in Golden-lane, and there found the writing-desk—my door had been fastened with a mock Brahmah latch—they must have got in by a skeleton-key—there was no marks of any breaking.</p>

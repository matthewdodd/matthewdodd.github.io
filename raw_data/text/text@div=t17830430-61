I met two men, and they asked me what was the matter, I saw him very distinct, I have no doubt of his person; the men pursued and took him, they brought him to me to the end of the garden.</p>
               <p>He got out of your sight when he ran? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might he be out of your sight?</p>
               <p>- Ten minutes, I was close by home, it was opening the garden door.</p>
               <p>Then it could not be ten minutes? - The man spoke to me, and ran across, and asked me what had happened, and I told him.</p>
               <p>How long was he out of your sight from the time he ran away, till he was taken? -</p>
               <p>About 10 minutes, it was moon light.</p>
               <p>How long might he be with you? - A very short time, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was the man? - Oh yes! his eyes fixed upon me so close, and by the moon, I saw him so fair, that I know him well, it shocks me when I look at him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed? - No, I think he had brown on, but it was his face I noticed.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any doubt whether it is the same man that was brought back again? - It is the same man I am sure.</p>

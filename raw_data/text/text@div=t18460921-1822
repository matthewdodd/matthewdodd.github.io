                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Pooley who keeps the Iron Arms public-house, Cambridge-heath, in the parish of Bethnal-green. On Monday afternoon, the 24th of Aug., about half-past one, the pwsoner and another man came into the bar—the prisoner asked for a pint of half-and-half, and gave me a sovereign in payment—I took a bag of money out of the till, which is a drawer—I had counted the money in that bag at ten o'clock—there was then 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I afterwards changed a sovereign for a person besides the one I changed for the prisoner, and put both into the bag—I laid the bag on the counter while I took the change out, then put it into the till, which I shut, but did not lock it—the prisoner and his companion then went to a room opposite the parlour, and stopped there about half-an-hour, they then came out, and the prisoner called for a pint of half-and-half, which he paid for, then went outside the house, and sat on a bench in front of the house—I left the bar afterwards, and went out to feed the ducks—they were then sit<lb></lb>ting</p>

               <p>on the seat—the prisoner walked into the house, round to the. bar opposite to the till—I heard him strike a lucifer-match—I then went into the house, and as I went round to the bar I heard the till gently shut—the prisoner was then at the bar counter, opposite the till, not inside the bar—I immediately run into the bar and spoke to the prisoner—he turned very pale—I rushed to the till, and found the bag and money gone—the prisoner directly walked out into the street—I rushed to the tap-room door and called my husband, and told him two men had robbed me—he went in pursuit—I went to the door and saw the prisoner and his companion running—I saw the prisoner throw a bag over the bridge, about 100 yards from the house.</p>

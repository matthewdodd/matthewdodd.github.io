On Monday the thirtieth of March, he was at my master's soap house surveying there; about twelve o'clock I saw him in the cutting room, in the soap house where the men cut the slabs; I left the cutting room and returned there again in about three or four minutes, the prisoner was in the stoke hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the cutting room, did you observe any thing. - A. I observed a pile of bars of soap which had three at the top, and there was one gone; I immediately informed my master. I afterwards saw a green bag, it was pointed out to me by Mr. Nowland; I watched that bag for an hour and a half, and then I saw the prisoner take up the bag and go off the premises with it. I saw him brought back to the accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner went out I suppose he was relieved by another officer. - A. He was.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. What is the name of your partner. - A. James, my father.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of March you received information from your servant. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner go from your premises. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause him to be brought back directly. - A. I did; he was brought into my accompting house, he had in his hand a green bag; I asked him if he had any objection to my searching the bag, he said he had not; this took place in the street. When I first stopped him I asked him what was in the bag, he said it was soap but not mine; this bag contained ten pieces; these are the pieces (the soap produced); that was not the particular quality of soap that we had on the premises, I was satisfied that it was not my property. I asked him where he had got it, he hesitated, and said if I would be kind with him he would inform me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Before he told you any thing in consequence of your questioning him, had not you told him there was an officer waiting ready to take him in custody. - A. I told him there was an officer ready to take him in custody, it was of no use to resist.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do not tell me what the prisoner said to you about accounting for the soap you produce; go on. - A. I told him he could expect nomercy of me as there were printed papers in the manufactory, stating if any person was detected they would be prosecuted; he said he had a large family. I said it was impossiable he could expect any favour of me; I asked where the soap was that he took from my cutting room in the morning; he said he had not got any soap of mine, nor he never robbed me; I told him I had strong reason to think a bar of soap had been gone that morning, and I must insist upon knowing where it was. At that moment I did not expect that he had the property about him, I thought he had hid it in the stoke hole; he still begged for mercy, I told him the officer was waiting for him; he then put his two hands into his pockets, and drew from each pocket a piece of soap, saying, that is the soap I took. (The soap produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Would these two pieces of soap make a complete bar. - A. They form a complete bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare that soap with the soap in the pile. - A. I did, it matched in complexion exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it being your property. - A. From all the circumstances, I can have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. The value is not above eighteen pence. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent for the police officer, he came and took him in custody. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you no other partner than your father. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this is common mottle soap. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other manufacturer could manufacture the same soap as you. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing to distinguish this soap from any other persons. - A. It is very dark, I very seldom have a boil so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark to it. - A. There is no mark at all.</p>

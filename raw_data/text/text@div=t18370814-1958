                  </hi>. I live in Arbour-square, Commercial-road, in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney, or Stebonheath, and am a wharfinger at the West India Dock. On Friday night, the 4th of August, I examined every door, and saw they were fast, at a little before twelve o'clock—I did not fasten the house up myself—I was awoke next morning about half-past five o'clock, and went down stairs about six o'clock—I found the yard door open—I went down stairs, and the back-kitchen door was open—the back kitchen shutters had been forced, and a piece of glass taken from the side of one of the windows—an instrument passed through to remove the latch, and the parties had there made an entry—the front-parlour door was also open, and the kitchen door was forced from within—it had been locked outside—I missed the property stated, which is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not undertake to say positively that it is worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found some phosphorus matches in the parlour—the parlours had been ransacked, and a caddy spoon taken from the tea caddy—I found the top of a lucifer-box in the parlour, and a hat in the yard, with two pieces of candle in it—I lost a hat myself, the crape was taken off it and left there—I found footmarks, but the soil was dry, and they were imperfect—there were also footmarks in Mr. Wright's garden, which is three doors off—I called in two policemen, and gave them the hat—I believe this to be the same.</p>

On Friday night, the 4th of August, the prisoner had a cup of coffee at my stall, between twelve and one o'clock—he turned down Jamaica-street—you may go to Arbour square that way.</p>

On Friday night, the 4th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner standing close by the toll-bar, at the west end of Arbour-square, just at the entrance of the square, about ten or twelve yards from Mr. Wright's, he was dressed in a flannel jacket—I did not notice his hat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 117.) I was employed by the Superintendent, with Clay, to trace this robbery—Clay produced a hat to me, which I recognised as belonging to the prisoner, who I knew perfectly well—I believe it to be his hat—in consequence of that, and receiving information, I went in pursuit, and found him on Tuesday night, the 8th—I said, "There is suspicion of your having committed a burglary in Arbour-square"—he said he had heard something about it, and he had a great mind to go to the office—I took him to the station-house, and found about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, and a new hat on his head—I had never seen him with that on before—the hat that was found on the premises was placed on his head, and he said himself that it fitted him, and it did exactly fit him—we took off his shoes, and went to Mr. Wright's garden, and some adjacent gardens, where marks were left very distinctly in the mould, and in two or three we found one of the shoes particularly corresponded with the marks—there is something particular about the heel of the right shoe—the tip is put on in rather a clumsy way, and leaves the leather projecting beyond the tip, and that made a nook in the mould, exactly fitting that part—the shoe is very wide, and in one footmark the toe touches the leather as well as the sole—there was the print of the sole, and where the upper leather had made an impression in the ground, as the sole was worn—I saw the shoe on his foot, but cannot say it projected then, but it is worn as if it had been on the ground—I have not a doubt this is the shoe which made the impression on the ground—I compared them on Wednesday—I had seen the same marks on the Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 278.) I received a hat from the inspector on duty—I showed it to Perkins, and was in his company when we apprehended the prisoner—we had been three days in search of him—we went to a great many places to find him—I took the two shoes off his feet—I compared the length of his shoe with mine, and found it corresponded according to my idea of the track in the garden—I went next morning to Taylor's garden—one mark had been erased, and it did not correspond—I gave Perkins the shoe to compare in the next garden, and he found marks corresponding—I then examined it myself—the heel, length and breadth, and the substance of the sole formed a sort of shelf—the tip is not put on well on the heel, and that made a sort of shelf in the impression—I could form no other opinion but that it was made by the shoe—it corresponded in all respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you put the shoe on the foot mark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—previous to putting it into the mark I examined it very minutely, and</p>

               <p>compared the shoe with the end, and laid it in very lightly, so that there should be no pressure—we afterwards put a pan over the footmark, so that nothing should interfere with it—on the night of the robbery the ground was rather moist—we met the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway when we took him; he was coming towards the station-house—it was near nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with Mr. Hughes, of Hampton-terrace, Edgeware-road. Between one and two o'clock, on Saturday, the 19th of Nov., I got into one of Cloud's omnibuses, at the Haymarket, to go to the Bank—I had my purse in my right-hand pocket, containing the money stated—I sat on the right-hand side, close to the door—the prisoner got in in the Strand—some ladies got out at St. Clement's Church, and then I changed my seat to the left-hand side, higher up—the prisoner sat next to me—he drew himself up next to me—he had a cloak on his arm—it was thrown a little over my dress, but not sufficient to attract my attention—when we got to Ludgate-bill he got out—the conductor asked if I bad my purse—on feel<lb></lb>ing in my pocket, I found my purse and money was gone—he had sat on the same side as my purse was—I had eroded over in the omnibus, because it was a dirty day, and I did not like sitting next the door—the purse and money were found—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a conductor of Cloud's omnibus. The prosecuntrix got in at the Haymarket, and the prisoner at the Strand—I suspected, and watched him—just before we got to Temple-bar I had two sadist to put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prosecutrix was sitting on the right side—she crossed over, and the prisoner made close up to her—he had a cloak, which he threw partly over her</p>

               <p>dress—I watched him nil down Fleet-street—his left hand was up to his bosom, and I could see by the motion of his shoulder that his right hand was at work—when we got to Fleet-street, be took his hat off, with his left hand—when we got on to Ludgate-hill, he paid his fare, and wanted to get out in a hurry—I asked the prosecutrix to search her pocket, and she missed her purse—the prisoner ran away, down Pilgrim-street, on Ludgate-bill—he came out Into St. Mariin's-court, came round a corner, and ran into the Cock public-house—I caught him by the collar, as he came out, and brought him on to ludgate-hill, till I found a policeman—the landlord came out to know what was the matter—I asked him to go and set if he could find anything, and he found the purse.</p>

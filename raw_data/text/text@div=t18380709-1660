                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and live at Oxford. On the 23rd of June, about three o'clock, I was outside the shop of Rundle and Bridge, on Ludgate-hill—I perceived somebody rub his hand against my pocket—I said, "That fellow has taken my purse out of my pocket"—the prisoner was quite close to me at the time, and I saw my purse drop out of his hand—it contained a £10 note, six sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns—one or two sovereigns dropped out of the purse on the pavement—I picked up the purse and one sovereign—another person picked up the other, and gave it to me—they were returned to the purse, and delivered to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Exeter-street, Strand—I keep a lodging-house. The prisoner was in my service about two yean before last Christmas—she lived with me three months—I had occasion for her, on the 13th of February, as a char-woman, till my servant came from the country, which would be about a week—the next morning I missed two sovereigns and a half out of my purse from under my pillow—I had seen them secure when I went to bed—I think she took them when she made the bed—I missed three bottles of wine from the front room where I slept—I did not miss any more then—I gave the prisoner 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sent her away on the Tuesday morning on suspicion—I knew she had got my money, as there was no one else in the room—I missed the blanket, and two pillows, and a bed valance on the evening after she was gone, and a great deal more, part of which is not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Russell-street, and am a tobacconist. The prisoner came to my shop on the 14th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with a bundle, and requested me to let her leave it there—she said she had just left a place, and it was so heavy she could not carry it further—she said she should call for it in a short time, and said there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—she said, "I will go and fetch my sister"—I asked her to show me the money—she would not—she came back between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—I wished her to look in the bundle before she left, to see that the money was there, but she refused—she went away, and returned in five minutes with a bundle not half the size, and put it down, and accused me of taking the money out.</p>

I have known the prisoner seven years—his grandmother lodges with me, and he came to visit her—he was there on the 14th of November, and had been for several weeks—I locked my watch in a box that day in the back room, and went out about eleven o'clock—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and the box was broken open, and the watch gone—it has not been found—the prisoner slept in the house that night—he confessed that he took it and sold it—it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a silver watch—I had had it about two years—it was given to my husband, and he gave it to me before he went to sea.</p>

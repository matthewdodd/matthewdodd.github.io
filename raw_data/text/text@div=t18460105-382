                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Great Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn<lb></lb>fields, and am a brass-founder. I occupy a front shop and parlour there—there are other lodgers in the house, which belongs to a person named Kelly, but he does not live in it, he lets it out in tenements—no one occupies the shop but myself—I sleep in the back parlour, which communicates with the shop it goes out of the passage—the doors arc opposite one another—you</p>

I was the last person at my shop—I locked it up and took the keys into my bed-room about a quarter before twelve o'clock—next morning I was lying in bed, and saw a light come through the fanlight over the bed-room—I saw it go out, and then I saw the light again—I heard the padlock fall—I got up and got a light—I drew the night-bolt of my bed-room, and saw the prisoner half way in my shop—he went out into the street—I followed him, and cried, "Stop thief"—he made three or four attempts to strike me with a hammer or a crow<lb></lb>bar, and once he struck me on my thumb—I went out in my shirt, and saw the policeman catch the prisoner three doors off—I found my door was all broken open—the policeman has got the padlock, which he took off the ground—I saw it there—I never saw the prisoner, to my knowledge, before—I am sure he is the person.</p>

About twenty minutes past two o'clock in the morning of the 17th Dec., I was on duty in Great Wild-street, I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw the prisoner running fast, and Mr. McDonald just behind him in his shirt, calling "Stop thief!" and the prisoner cried it too—I stopped the prisoner, and took him back to the shop—Mr. McDonald said, "That is the man that broke into my house"—the prisoner said there was no charge against him—he refused to go to the station, became very violent, and struck me on the eye—I got him to the station with diffi<lb></lb>culty—I found a box of matches on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Chapel-street, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. On Tuesday evening, 6th Nov., 1 went down to my tea, between six and seven o'clock—my shop-door was fastened, the outer door into the street, and the door out of the shop into the passage—I left no one in the shop, it was not lighted—I had gone out between four and five o'clock to wait on a customer—I came back and locked the shop-door—no one can open it from the street, there is no key-hole—while I was at tea a knock came to the private door—my servant went to it and brought me down a message—in five or six minutes afterwards I heard a noise over my head in my shop—I sprang up-stairs as fast as I could, and saw John Sleigh leaving the passage—I pursued and caught him, fifteen or twenty yards off—when I got up-stairs, my shop-door, passage door, and private-door were all three open—the persons had entered the private-door, unlocked the door from the passage to the shop, and opened the shop-door—the private-door had one of Bramah's patent locks to it, which cost me two guineas—a key which John Sleigh threw away would open it—when I overtook John Sleigh I told him he had been in my shop—he said he had not, and endea<lb></lb>voured to get away—I told him if he got away I would forgive him—he said he would <hi rend="italic">smash</hi> me—we struggled and fell—I got him up again, and dragged him towards my own door—the struggle continued perhaps three</p>

               <p>or four minutes—I gave him into custody and returned to the shop—I found a strange bag in the shop, and two coats, and the other things of mine were in it—they had all been in the shop before, and were removed into the bag—I had seen them safe when I went to tea; also twenty pieces of cloth, waistcoats, trowsers, linen, cloth, and the other things stated, worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eaton-mews. On 6th Nov. I was going along Chapel-street, and saw John Sleigh running away, and Mr. Kennett after him—he took him by the back of the collar, and said, "Come back, you villain! you have been in my shop"—he said, "No, you are mistaken"—he went back with him a little while, and then tried to get away; but he did not—I saw him have his hand in his coat-pocket—I cannot say whether his other hand was in his waistcoat-pocket, or near it, he threw something away—I looked for it, and found two small keys—I gave them to Mr. Kennett—I did not put them with any other keys, I kept them in my hand.</p>

The prisoner came about ten minutes before one, at noon, and asked my master's car-man if he wanted a job; they did not agree; I ran after him and asked him if he wanted a cart? he said, yes, for three or four small bundles of hemp, and a few more small things: I drive a cart: I asked him where? he said, over the water, to St. George's church; I agreed with him for four shillings; he ordered me to the wharf; he went before me to Miller's wharf; it was about ten minutes after one; he was up in the warehouse of the prosecutor with his coat off, and his hat off; and he looked out and said, hah; and he threw out four bundles of hemp into my cart; he said, no more; he told me to drive to St. George's church; but I was stopped at the gate by one of the men; I took notice of the hemp; this is part of it.</p>

               <p>I am in the wine and brandy trade, in Bishopsgate-street. I was in the passage leading to the Court-yard, last Thursday evening, near half past four; and just before the Duke of Gloucester came to his carriage, I felt a violent motion in the passage; I thought the motion was a made one, and suspected pick-pockets; and immediately the prosecutor bawled out, and gave me to understand he was robbed; and I collared the prisoner; and then he looked on the ground for some of his property; and the prisoner made a struggle to get away from the brother, and fell against me; and some of the money, gold and silver, fell on my foot; I saw both gold and silver, but could not say the quantity; it appeared to me to fall from the prisoner; but I cannot say positively, for I did not see it fall from his hand; the prisoner was close to me; I stood near to him; he was telling the person who had hold of him, that it was not him; he came right against me; and I imagine it was the shock he received by that fall, threw the money out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Was there any person so near as the prisoner? - None; but there was another person that seemed to be interested in the affair, with him; which I suppose by his being so anxious to get up to him; he seemed as if he would rescue him; he pushed with his elbows, and got through a great many people, and got quite up to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it for granted, upon the outcry, that many persons pressed to see who was the offender? - Many persons could not press.</p>
               <p>How big is the passage? - I think I have had the pleasure of seeing you in the Palace-yard.</p>
               <p>I fancy you are mistaken; I am more acquainted with the geography of courts of justice, than with palaces. This person did not attempt any thing like a rescue? - No, he did not; the money fell before.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the jury. The situation I am in, and the troubles of a distressed mind, has rendered me incapable of addressing you in the manner I could wish; but, gentlemen of the jury, you think it a duty incumbent in me to state to you the reason of my being at the place where this unfortunate affair happened. Gentlemen of the jury, on the 10th day of February, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I had a note to go to Brentford, with an order for three hats; I took the note to the White Horse Cellar, in Piccadilly, and gave it to one of the men that drive the Brentford stage, to be taken to Mr. West, hatter, of Brentford; in my return back to my own house I stopped a few minutes to see the Duke of Gloucester get into his carriage: gentlemen of the jury, the prosecutor come down the passage with several people following him, and pushed himself in order among the people, to see who it was that was getting in the carriage. Gentlemen of the jury, I observed a man that I thought was rather too intruding, and pressed much upon the gentlemen, which I took particular notice. The gentleman had not been there above two or three minutes before he cried out, in broken English, my guineas! my guineas! and took hold of me as I stood by him. Gentlemen of the jury, I told him it was not me; but it was that man in the brown coat, and requested that they would lay hold of him; but the gentleman not understanding English, did not know what I said: gentlemen of the jury, I still cried out, lay hold of him, and rushed myself as forward as I could, in order to secure him; when he found that, he dropped the money from his hand, which caused a great consternation amongst the people, for many was down to pick up the money, which gave him an opportunity to make his escape. Gentlemen of the jury, I told him I would give him every satisfaction that he would require. I was asked what money I had in my pockets by the people present; I told them I had five guineas and a half in gold, and a quarter dollar in silver, in my fob pocket, underneath my watch; my watch chain was hanging out at the same time. Gentlemen of the jury, I was taken to Bow-street, and was asked there what money I had about me; I told them the same as I said before, which they found to be right. Gentlemen of the jury, I have a wife much opressed with grief and trouble at this unfortunate affair: I have a son at the age of sixteen, which I have put apprentice to a respectable gentleman in the city of London: it is for their sakes, gentlemen of the jury, that I plead to you for justice. Gentlemen, my circumstances in business has rendered me capable of living happy and comfortable, therefore I could not think of committing an act of this kind, when I was not in distress. Gentlemen of the jury, I am now at the age of forty-seven years, and from my earliest days down to this unhappy time, that my character was never brought into question before; gentlemen of the jury, I have a few friends that will appear to my character; they will tell you that I have transacted business for them with honour, punctuality, and honesty. Gentlemen, before this unfortunate affair happened I was going into business with a gentleman in the country, whose business I have carried on in town for some years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called fifteen witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

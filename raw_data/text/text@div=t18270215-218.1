On the 26th of January, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was in the parlour behind the shop; the prisoner came in - I went in, and he asked if I sold glue - I said, No - he went out, and shut the door very quick - Mr. Bell came in, and asked if I had lost any thing - I looked on the desk, and missed the sugar - I am certain of his person - he was brought back.</p>

            . I was standing in front of my house, opposite this shop; a person said he thought that shop was robbed - I saw the prisoner and another person running down the mews - I crossed to Johnson, who missed the sugar; I pursued the prisoner down Devonshire-street, and stopped him in James-street - I asked if he had not been into that shop; he said, Yes; I said, "You have not paid for what you had - come back;" the other did not go back, but the prisoner did, after being abusive - Miss Johnson said he was the boy who was in the shop.</p>
               <p>BELL JOHNSON. Nobody else could have come into the shop, or I must have seen them; I did not leave the shop after he went out - it was a loaf of sugar.</p>

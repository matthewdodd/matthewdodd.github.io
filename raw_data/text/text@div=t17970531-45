             sworn. - I am a constable; when I went into the watch-house, I saw the prisoner, the prosecutor, and the witness; the prosecutor, I think it was, put down a handkerchief upon the table, which I have, (produces it); the prisoner said, upon my word, sir, it is not your handkerchief, I brought it from Madras with me, I have had it two years, pray do examine it, says he, the gentleman says there is no mark upon it, and he said, the gentleman said his was a whole handkerchief, and that this had got holes in it that were wore with his beard, it is not a whole handkerchief, it has some holes in the middle of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Maclaurin). Do you recollect whether your's had any holes in it or not? - A. No; my handkerchief was whole, the holes, I am persuaded, happened in the scuffle, for he would not part with it till we got to the watch-house; he pulled extremely hard, there was a scuffle all the way to the watch-house; I think it was torn in the scuffle on purpose that I might not know it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman came up to me, and said, I believe you have got my handkerchief, I said, no, sir, I have not; I replied, I had not got but one, and that was in my jacket pocket, and he said, that was his; I would not part with it, nor he would not part with it; he said, his handkerchief was a whole handkerchief, I told him that handkerchief had got holes in it, worn by my beard, it was my own handkerchief.</p>

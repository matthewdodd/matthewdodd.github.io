             sworn. - The prisoner is my cousin: I learned that Mrs. Butlin had missed some property, and I went to the lodgings of the prisoner to make a discovery of it, and she was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were her lodgings? - A.Mrs. Butlin sent her daughter to shew me the house: On Saturday in the Whitsun-week Mrs. Butlin sent a man with me to frighten her, I do not know whether he was a constable or not.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Butlin.) Were you ever at the lodgings of the prisoner? - A. Not where she slept, she used to sleep at a public-house; I went to the house where she sat in the day-time; she had left me about a month.</p>

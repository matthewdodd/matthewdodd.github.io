            . I charge the Prisoner with taking the Lead from the top of the Houses, on Saturday Morning, the 30th, of July. Two of these Houses are empty; they stand at the lower end of <placeName id="t17370907-4-crimeloc19">Foxes lane, near Pelican-stairs, Shadwell</placeName>

               <p>A Witness. I can't say any Thing to the Prisoner's taking the Lead, but hearing the Noise that Thieves were upon the Top of the House, I went up, and saw the Lead ripp'd up, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173709070004"></xptr> and the Prisoner behind the Chimnies. I endeavoured to take him and he dodg'd me round the Chimnies, but at last he said, if I would not hurt him, he would surrender. The Lead was mov'd 16 or 18 Feet from the Place where it was fix'd.</p>
               <p>Another I was on board a Ship hard by, but hearing the People say, a Thief was behind the Chimnies, I came ashore with a Staff 6 Feet long, and a Ladder being raised against the Houses, I went up, and asked the Prisoner what he did there. What's that to you says he? Come along say's I, and immediately I seized him, and brought him down. There was about 2 hundred Weight, roll'd up and carry'd to the Corner of the House, just ready to throw down.</p>
               <p>Q. When did any of you see the Lead fix'd?</p>
               <p>Gillings. We see it almost every Day.</p>
               <p>Defence. I came from Shadwell Market to these Houses, and the Street being all in an Uproar, I asked what was the Matter? The People told me, that somebody was stealing Lead from the Tops of the Houses; so I went up the Ladder to help them take the Thief, and when I was upon the Top of the House, that Man came up with his Staff and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I was the Man that set up the Ladder; I was the first that went up, and there was no Person upon the House but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Gillings. I help'd this Man to raise the Ladder; the Prisoner never went up the Ladder. - I believe he got in at the Cellar-Window of an empty House.</p>

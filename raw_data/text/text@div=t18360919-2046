                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. Between eight and nine o'clock on the 15th of September, I had a pocket-handkerchief in my right-hand skirt pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket, and I grasped it—it was the prisoner's—he was so determined to have it, that when he pulled his hand out he had the handkerchief in it—he drew his hand out, and two men took it of him, and threatened to rescue him—I said, "If any body will hold the boy, I will attack you both."</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the watch. When the pri<lb></lb>soner was brought to our watch-house, the prosecutor said he had a charge against him, for stealing a pocket-handkerchief—I searched him, but found nothing—the prosecutor said, two tall men followed very close, and endea<lb></lb>voured to rescue the boy, I said, "Perhaps, we shall have them come out<lb></lb>side our watch-house door"—I went outside into the yard—there was one person that Mr. Shephard recognised, and I brought him in—I went out again, and another man. who had been with him before, ran down Little Britain—I pursued him, and he gave me a violent blow with a life-pre<lb></lb>server, or something of that sort.</p>

When my husband finished his pint of porter, he put on his hat to return home. and feeling for the violin, he found it was gone. I had put it down by the side of him. I made every enquiry, but could get no intelligence of it whatever. It was gone. On the next day, I found the violin at a pawnbrokers in Whitechapel. There were other persons in the room, but there were none that were in discourse with us. I did not see it taken. Whether it was taken while I went for the pint of beer, or afterwards, I cannot say. I sat my husband down on the box, and put the violin by the side of him.</p>

            . I am shop boy to Mr. Needes, pawnbroker, No. 7, Paternoster-row, Spitalfields. On the 14th of January, the two men prisoners came to our shop; they brought a fiddle with them, and asked me if my master was at home. I said, yes, he was at breakfast. I called him. They said they were sorry to give him so much trouble; they would be glad if he would tell them the worth of the violin. Master looked at it, and said he thought it was worth about a guinea, but he said it was according to people's fancy. They said they were much obliged to him; they had bought it for fifteen shillings. Master said it was cheap. They went out of the shop. That is all I know. I am quite sure they are the same men; I took particular notice of them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, Whitechapel, a pawnbroker. On the 14th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, a young man brought me the violin to pledge. I believe it to be Kemp. He had a blue apron on. I lent him nine shillings on it. On the evening of the same day, Mrs. Nichols came to our shop to know if we had taken in a violin. I told her I had taken one in in the morning. I shewed it her; it was her's. At Worship-street office, the blind man swore to the fiddle by the crack in it, and to the bow.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my bow, and this is my violin. There is a particular edge to it, and it has a particular tone. I have had it two years.</p>

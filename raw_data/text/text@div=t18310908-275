I let the prisoners a furnished room on my first floor, about Christmas, at 5s. a week; they paid regularly till within the last five weeks- the woman said her husband was a cabinet-maker; we had given them warning several times, not liking them, and they left on Tuesday, the 14th of July, without saying a word - I was at home; they had nothing of their own, and walked out of the house - I did not expect they were going for good; I got into their room with the key of another door, which we found would open it, and missed all the articles stated in the indictment; the man returned by the house, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge; they had no right whatever to pawn my property - they owed me five weeks' rent; the lodging was let in the usual way - I had no security for the furniture; we asked for the rent - he sent us down a few duplicates of wearing-apparel, as security for rent, and I found they belonged to another person.</p>

            . Q. How long did you know the goods to be in pawn before I was taken? A. The same afternoon; I did not know before - I had been continually asking them for a pair of sheets, which I had lent them, and as they did not return them, I suspected they might be pawned; we did not find them in linen - my husband, on the Friday before, had threatened to send for an constable to turn him out, because he would not leave; we did not like him in the house, because he came home at all hours - they sent down twelve tickets on the Sunday, and said they would pay the rent on the Tuesday; they were not as security for the property - I did not know it was pawned.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. Last Friday morning I saw Chitty come to our shop to ask about a violin; the prisoner came afterwards, and brought a violin which corresponded with the description he had given me; the prisoner said he had bought it from his brother, who had two or three violins; I stopped him, and sent for Chitty, and an officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I live in Perkin's-rents, and got up about half-past seven to go out to work. I saw this violin apparently thrown in the dust hole, and from what the man said, I thought by placing it in the hands of Mr. Lloyd - I might give the man the money when I saw him; I do not see him very often, and it is not always convenient for me to carry a violin with me.</p>

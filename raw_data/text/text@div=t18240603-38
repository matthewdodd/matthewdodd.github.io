            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, the 24th of May, between one and two o'clock in the morning, in Craven-lane, Bayswater-road; there was another man with him when I first saw him, but I lost sight of the other - I took him, supposing all was not right, and found two bottles of wine, four skeleton keys, and a phosphorus box with matches ready for use upon him. I learned that Mr. Woodward had lost some property. When the prisoner was at Bow-street Mr. Woodward intimated to me that he had lost a coat similar to the one the prisoner had on, and next morning he saw and identified it. The prisoner gave no account whatever of it; this is the coat.</p>

            . I am a patrol. When the prisoner was taken he had that coat on, with wine in the pockets, and this dark lantern, which appeared as if it had lately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182406030016"></xptr>been put out. There were some matches in the phosphorus box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had no work, and a man whom I had known for some months past, asked me on Sunday before the robbery to carry some smuggled spirits for him; I agreed, and met him on Sunday night, near the turnpike in Bayswater-road - he gave me the property; I did not know that it was stolen. I could have destroyed the coat.</p>

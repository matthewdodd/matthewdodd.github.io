                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 217.) I was on duty in Hox<lb></lb>ton-town on Saturday night, the 1st of October. About a quarter before nine o'clock I saw the horse and cart near the Whitmore's Head, Hoxton, Lone was driving it very fast—Hawkins was with him—they got out at the Whitmore's Head—I was within two yards of them, and there was plenty of light for me to notice them—a child passed under the breast of the horse as they pulled up—that attracted my attention to them—I told them to beware of the child—I lost sight of them—I could not see whether they went into the public-house or not—the next morning I received information of the loss of the horse and cart—in consequence of which I described the person of the two prisoners—on the 12th of October I went to Radnor-street, St. Luke's, and there I saw Lone—I recognised him as the person who I had seen before—I took him into custody—I told him it was for having a horse and cart belonging to Messrs. Ford Hale and son—he said, "It is a bad job; allow me to go to my wife"—I did so—I asked him if he knew a young person of the name of Hawkins—he said, "No, I do not; I knew a person of the name of Hawkins, but he was a very elderly man"—I cautioned him—he said, "It is a bad job, I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and ascertained the residence of Hawkins—I then went to Orchard-street, St. Luke's, and there saw Hawkins—I recognized him as the other man I had seen with the cart—his wife was there, she began crying; he said, "Never mind, it is a bad job, I can't help it; he has come for me, and I must go"—I asked him if he knew a person named William Lone—he said, "Yes, I nave known him five or six years"—I then told him that what he might say would be used against him—he then said, "I know nothing about it"—I am confident the prisoners are the two men I saw with the cart—</p>

               <p>Hawkins's dress is the same, but Lone's is different—the difference in the dress does not create any doubt in my mind—I have never seen the horse and cart in the prosecutor's possession.</p>

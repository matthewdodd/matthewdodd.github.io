               <p>Court to Prosecutor, Is there any thing but these callico waistcoats, that you know of? speak to them first? - These callico waistcoats were made of my goods, being outside, I bought the whole piece of this callico, at an wholesale house in the city; and when I used it almost, to a very short length, I applied to get some more exactly of the same pattern, and tried at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080145"></xptr>every shop in the city, and at both ends of the town; but I could not get any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in your shop at the time the prisoner was there? - Yes, and he had it himself in his own care; here is a piece that my clerk brought this morning, the remainder of the piece. The prisoner at the bar, told Mr. Serjeant Kirby (which I am sorry to say) that he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing at that time? - We were then in the office I believe, his examination had been taken down, and then the examination was brought in; I believe the whole is my property, I have strong reason to say so; I bought fifty pieces in an wholesale house in the city, in one lot, in the month of May last, these fifty pieces were of the best match I ever saw, all of one shade or one colour. The place in my cutting shop where I keep them, there were nobody had so much access as myself, the clerk, and the prisoner at the bar; but from this room were lost thirteen pieces; the prisoner at the bar, has sold some in my workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in your presence? - It was not, but I can produce a witness that was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the witness speak to any property in this indictment? - Yes, as to the nankeen; (an apprentice of mine is in the court) but if your Lordship will please to hear me, if the gentlemen of the jury will please to look at the nankeens, which the prisoner has made up into garments, they will see if they are not all of one colour or not. Now here is a piece I have brought from home. Here is a black casimere waistcoat, the front part of it; that I verify believe has been in my shop these five years, the back part is of solicia woolen cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. First of all Mr. Morrison, as to the callico, or cotton waistcoats: Which are they callico, or cotton? - Some people call them cotton, and some callico, but speaking strictly, they are callico.</p>
               <p>Q. They are a very common pattern Mr. Morrison? - They are common.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought a considerable quantity from a considerable warehouse in the city? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There was other pieces, when you bought that of that pattern; When did you go back to that house? - It might be two months, I cannot tell to a week or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months! Perhaps you had not been after this two months? - Yes, I had on an average, every week.</p>
               <p>Q. This is so common a pattern, that many warehouses might have just the same sort of pattern; you do not mean to say, that they might not of course? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the nankeen; Is it English nankeen? - It is India nankeen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are, I presume, in a considerable line of business? - As much, as that I make shift to live by what I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have at this time a considerable quantity of nankeen, as a taylor? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any at this time? - Yes, I have a half-piece, but not of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you bought any nankeen since you bought that? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much nankeen had you in the house when you missed that? - I cannot say how many yards, nor how many pieces exactly; they were in the cutting shop in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken out regularly by the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, and myself as we wanted them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this black casimere waistcoat, there is nothing particular in it? - Only in the back of it, which I had the piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080146"></xptr>in my possession for this five years.</p>
               <p>Court to Lion. Look at the callico? - This callico, is the same piece which Mr. Morrison had in his possession, I am certain that Mr. Morrison had a peice of it in his house, and that a remnant, which no remains, corresponds exactly with it. On his examination in Queen's Square, he acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Court. The examination, I understand was taken in writing, therefore we cannot hear that: Can you say any thing to the nankeens? - Mr. Morrison had a great quantity of it in the house; and to my certain knowledge there were thirteen pieces taken out of his house, I have every reason to believe it is the same nankeen, they correspond with those he had in the house, and as such I believe it to be Mr. Morrison's property, they correspond in colour and quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as for the waistcoat? - The back which is in this waistcoat, has been in Mr. Morrison's house, to my certain knowledge, two or three years; it is Solicia cloth, for pockets: Mr. Morrison, had several pieces of the same in his house, it is a very common cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That Mr. Morrison has lost all the property contained in his indictment, I admit; but of all this property that has been mentioned, do you mean to say, that no other taylor in any other part of the town, of eminence equal to Mr. Morrison, might not have such? - He might have such callico, and such casimere waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Q. And every other article that is here, there is nothing peculiar to any one of the articles that is here produced; that any other taylor might not have? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave every thing to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Morrison has sworn, that he and his servant has been every where enquiring for these goods, and he could not find the pattern at all: Now I ask you, whether you believe that to be true? - I cannot say as to the pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you cannot say as to the pattern it may be uncommon? - It may or may not, I do not know that I ever saw the pattern exactly.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers of the Thames police. - A. I am. On the 4th of April, about half after four in the afternoon, I was passing by Leadenhall street in company with my brother officer; the prisoner was in the act of shutting a gate, No. 98; Dalby and I suspected him; we followed him till he came to Bell lane, Spital fields; when he got there we asked him where he came from, and what he was going to do with this parcel; I said I know where you came from, and I shall make your master acquainted with it; he said he should not give us any account. We found indigo in the bag; we took him custody; he went in the custody of Dalby, and I went to Messrs. Wilsons and acquainted them of the circumstance. I have had the indigo ever since it was in the bag, as it now is.</p>
               <p>- DALBY. Q. I suppose you know no more than the last witness. - A. I saw him come out of the same gateway; I know no more than him.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course I suppose you did not miss this property until you received intelligence about it. - A. I had not; the indigo is of the same quality as the indigo we had then; it is impossible to swear exactly to indigo.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Are there other warehouses in the same gateway. - A. No, not in the same gateway. The indigo at that time was worth about three shillings and sixpence to four shillings per pound.</p>

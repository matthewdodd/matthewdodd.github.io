                  </hi> I am the superintending President of the Inland de<lb></lb>partment of the Post-office—the prisoner Thacker has been for some years in the service of the Post-office, first as a letter-carrier, and afterwards as a sub-sorter—he was a sub-sorter in the Inland-office on the 23rd of June—Ringrose was a letter-carrier in the 10th division, in which Lower Thames-street is in<lb></lb>cluded—the walks are distinguished by numbers—Lower Thames-street is No. 106 or 116, I cannot exactly say which—in the forenoon of the 23rd of June last, an East India mail arrived—according to the practice of the office the letters coming by that mail would be in the course of sorting for the different divisions in the mid-day of the 23rd of June—as the letters arrive in the mass, they are first of all divided into fifteen divisions, numbered from one to fifteen—they are divided by sorting—the letters belonging to each division are sorted to each division—all the letters of the 10th division would be transferred to Thacker, and he would then re-sort those letters at his table into the letter-carries' walks—I cannot say exactly how many walks there are in No. 10—I should say from ten to twelve—it would be the duty of the sub-sorter to divide the letters which he had previously sorted to his division, to the separate letter-carrier's walks of his division—Thacker would stand those letters up on his sorting-table which bears the names of the different walks of which the division consists, printed on the edge or back of the table—he would be on one side of the table, and the general sorters on the other—the letter-carriers did not act as general sorters on this occasion—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to place a docket bearing the number of the letter-carrier, and the name of his walk, in front of each parcel of letters—he puts the letters for each walk separately, and when the letters have accumulated to as many as can con<lb></lb>veniently remain there, he places them upright, with a docket on them—they are then handed to the teller, who sits at another table within a short distance—it is the duty of the sub-sorter to take them, but occasionally in the press of business a messenger is employed, and frequently the President himself does it—the teller would tell up the amount of postage charged on that batch of letters, and enter the amount on the docket—they are then taken away from the teller by a messenger, with the docket, to a box appropriated to the walk to which they belong, in the letter-carriers office, which is the adjoining office; but previous to the letters being placed in the box, the messenger hands the docket to the check-clerk, who enters the amount of postage in his book—the messenger leaves the docket with the check-clerk, and places the letters in the box—at that period the letter-carrier does not see the docket—in the course of sorting the East India mail, it frequently happens that there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050072"></xptr>
               <p>is more than one <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> of letters taken to the box—the letters on which the docket is put are called a <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> of letters—I do not know how many <hi rend="italic">charges</hi> there were that morning of the East India mail for the Lower Thames-street division—supposing there were two, the same ceremony would be gone through in each, the letters being taken away from the table as they accumulate—when the charge is complete in the letter-carrier's office, the duty of the carrier begins—it was then the duty of Ringrose to take the letters from the box, tell up the amount of postage, and report it to the check-clerk—he has no knowledge of the amount till he tells it up—he tells it up on each occasion when there is a charge to his box—if there were two charges, he would have to make two tellings to enable him to know for the first time the amount of the charge—it is the duty of the letter-carrier when he has ascertained the amount of each charge, to report it to the check-clerk, to call it out to him—if the amount is correct as it appears on the docket returned to the check-clerk, the check-clerk would hand the letter-carrier the docket, and he would sign it, and return it—he generally puts his initial—he then places it in a small box close by, in front of the check-clerk, appropriated for that purpose, and that docket is afterwards retained as an official voucher—if the amount does not agree, another clerk is called, who is denominated the re-teller, and he would be a sort of umpire between the telling-clerk and the letter-carrier—he decides the amount, and then the carrier signs it, if it is wrong he alters it—if there were two batches of letters carried in the course of the sorting of the mail to the Lower Thames-street-walk, the letter-carrier would have possession of two dockets, which he would place in the box—after he has arranged his letters he may have some letters mis-sorted to him, which he would hand to the charge-taker and get an allowance for, and other letter-carriers may have had letters mis-sorted to them intended for him, which they would bring to the charge-taker—the charge-taker is the person who ascertains the aggregate amount of the different charges of letters that fall in his department—if there are two charges of letters, they are put together, and the whole amount is remitted to the charge-taker, and then, if a letter-carrier has had any letters mis-sorted to him, he gets credit or debit on them, and having ascertained the amount of the whole, and the balance for which the letter-carrier would be responsible, the carrier then proceeds to his delivery—the postage by the Indian mail is considerably higher than on ordinary letters, and if people were mischievously disposed, that would be the most convenient opportunity—the East India mail postage is very heavy—on this occasion the letters came through France—that makes the amount still larger—the newspapers are charged 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, by way of France, by way of Southampton they are free—the letter-carrier pays to the Treasurer, or his representative, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge whilst the letters were in the course of being sorted from that mail, on the 23rd of June, I placed myself, accompanied by Mr. Kelly, another inspector, and by Mr. Playle, an assistant-inspector of letter-carriers, in a part of the Inland-office from whence I could see what Thacker was sorting—we were about fifteen yards from his sorting-table, and could see it—I saw Ringrose there that noon—he was en<lb></lb>gaged at the newspaper business—he had nothing to do with the letters at that time—he was in the same room—I believe he was dividing the news-papers, all I can say is, that I saw him at work at the newspapers, what he was doing with them I do not know—I should say he was about three yards from Thacker—at about a quarter to one o'clock I saw Ringrose leave his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050073"></xptr>
               <p>newspaper business, and go to Thacker's sorting-table—he leant over, and spoke to Thacker—he then left Thacker, and went into the letter-carriers' office—I afterwards saw him go to Thacker a second time, and saw Thacker pass some letters from the left-hand side of his table to his right, which Ringrose took up, and carried into the letter-carriers' office—the Lower Thames-street-walk is at the extreme left-hand side of the table—Ringrose would have nothing at all to do with letters at that time—I afterwards saw Ringrose leave his newspaper duty again—he had a newspaper in hand—that was the third time I saw him—he took nothing away the first time—I could not see what became of him when he went into the letter-carriers' office the second time—it was impossible, he was out of my sight—I saw him go into the letter-carriers' office—the third time, when I saw him with a newspaper in his hand, he went to Thacker's table again, and just at that moment Mr. Playle called out, "Good God, he has given him them plainly enough"—Mr. Kelly made the same observation, and they put their heads together before me, so that I did not see this transaction so plainly; but I saw Ring-rose's hand rise with pretty well a handful of letters under the newspaper—the exclamation was not made loud enough for the prisoners to hear it—I have no hesitation in saying that they were letters in Ringrose's hand—I saw them—the newspaper was not spread out, it was not larger or so large as the letters, it was a doubled up newspaper—Ringrose took the letters and the newspaper into the letter-carrier's office—I did not see Thacker give the letters to Ringrose in this case as I did in the former—I lost sight of Ringrose for about half a minute, I should say, or it might be a minute—I then saw him come from the letter-carrier's office with apparently the same newspaper and the same letters into the Inland-office—he went to the President on duty, Mr. Partridge, and spoke to him, and afterwards to a clerk named Whiting, who took the news-paper from him and opened it—he gave it back to Ringrose, who doubled it up again, and then went back to the letter-carrier's office with the newspaper and letters—I saw no more of Ringrose till he was in custody—it was in con<lb></lb>sequence of directions that I gave, that both Ringrose and Thacker were taken—it was after their duty closed—that would be after three o'clock, but I cannot exactly say of my own knowledge—it was certainly before four o'clock—Ringrose was brought into Mr. Kelly's room—Thacker was sent into my room—I had not then ascertained the amount of the charges of letters that would have properly come to Ringrose's hands, but I accused Ringrose of having more letters than he had been charged with, and directed his letters to be told up; Mr. Kelly and Mr. Playle were present, and several other par<lb></lb>ties, but I do not remember who they were—I asked Ringrose the amount of postage he had been charged with, and he handed me this pencil memoran<lb></lb>dum—I believe it is in his handwriting—he did not hand the paper to me—I cannot speak as to the gross amount of letters found on him—I can only speak to the letters that he had in his possession more than he was charged with—when I accused Ringrose with having more letters than he had been charged with, he denied it—I had the letters told up, and the postage marked on the letters also told, and I found the amount was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than had been charged against him—I knew what had been charged, by having the book by me, and from his own admission—I am prepared to swear that he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than he was charged with—I know that by the book which was at my side, and which will be produced by another witness—Ring-rose named a certain sum, but what it was I cannot recollect—there was a book before me which contained certain amounts with reference to the prisoner—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050074"></xptr>
               <p>examined that book, and then said, "You have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more then you have been charged with"—he said he could not account for it—I then told him he had been seen to take letters from Thacker's sorting-table in the Inland-office—he afterwards admitted that he had done so, but he did not think ha had taken so much—I told him he had been seen to do so twice—he said he had taken the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with he exception of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which might have been an error—those were his words—he said he did not think he had taken so much by a shilling; that he had taken the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with the exception of about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said he was very sorry for it, and he would never do it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said something about an error? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he confessed to stealing the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with the exception of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which might have been an error—that was not my observation—he used those words.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that apply to the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not—he said that he had taken the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Thacker with the exception of about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which might have been an error in his charge—those were his own words; that is, the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. might have been an error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that all that passed between yourself and Ringrose on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection—I then went into Mt. Kelly's room, and Thacker was brought to me there—Ring<lb></lb>rose was taken away into another room—Thacker was told that he had been seen to hand letters to Ringrose—he denied it, and said if Ringrose had taken letters from his place it was without his knowledge, and he said anybody might have taken them without his knowledge—from my observation, on neither occasion could they have been taken away without Thacker's know<lb></lb>ledge—when the first lot was taken away, their hands must have touched—I saw Thacker give him the first lot.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The letters come from the general sorters to the division sorters, of whom Thacker was one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the letters which Ringrose took, were laid flat in front of Thacker, at the right hand side of his sorting-table, not in the usual way, on end—I should say this was a docket (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—when he sorts the letters, he puts them up, takes the docket out of a little box, and puts in front—that is a signal that they are ready for the telling-clerk—the docket being placed before them is the signal, if you call it so, not without—it is the sorter's duty to take them to the telling-clerk, although when pressed, a messenger will do it, or the Pre<lb></lb>sident himself—the sorter goes on with his work, and the proper person or anybody that may have to take them to the telling-clerk comes by and takes them—if we are pressed, myself or any of the Presidents, or anybody would take them to the telling-clerk—I do not mean "anybody"—if there is a press of business, the messengers, or the President, an inspector, or a clerk may do it—in the press of business, an inspector might even direct a letter-carrier to do it—it might be so, but I question it—they never have done so, to my knowledge—I swear that positively—I have heard of it being done since this transaction—a letter-carrier ought not to be employed to do it—when we have press of business, we are glad of anybody to assist another, undoubtedly, but they should be employed in their respective duties—if one had nothing to do, we should be very glad of him to help another, but not to do this—I was not aware of its being done until since this transaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We want to know whether the fact is so, because it is a very strange thing, if one it to be a check on the other, that you should get rid of the check by ordering the man on whom the check is to be, to do it; what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184707050075"></xptr>
               <p>have you heard about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard that an inspector, having a press of business, occasionally directs a letter-carrier, under his own eye, to take the letters—the inspector standing by would say, "Put over those charges to the tellet"—that is not giving him a general roving commission—the inspector says to the letter-carrier, "You may take it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the press of business, does not a sub-sorter some-times, when he has a number of letter before him and is wanting to get rid of them, tell a letter-carrier, or anybody coming by, to take them to the telling-clerk? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> No—I positively say I am not aware of such a thing—I do not know of it—I might have said that at such times we are glad to get. the assistance of anybody, but I never referred to a letter-carrier, most assuredly—there is a division between each sorter—there may be about thirty inches allowed to each sorter—I have never a known a man, when he has so many letter as to impede his sorting, call anybody that may be passing by, to take some of his letters away, that he may have the table cleared—I never knew anything of that sort occur—the Thames-street walk, on the arrival of an Indian mail, is rather heavy, so that the tenth division would have a heavy morning's work—I really do not know that anything is meant by putting the letters flat—I have not risen from the ranks—I have not been an inspector—the imperfectly directed letters should be placed in a box in front of the sub-sorter—there is a box for that purpose—they are not laid flat, to my know<lb></lb>ledge—he place them in the blind box in front of him—he does not place them flat beside him on his right hand side, to my knowledge—I do not know that his laying them flat on his side is a signal for them to go to the blind sorter—the practice, according to my belief, is, that the sorter on the opposite side of the table takes the blind letters to sort—we call those "blind letter" that are imperfectly directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The blind sorter is the man that has to receive the letters that the sub-sorter cannot make out, or addressed to firms such as "Messrs. Allen and Co., druggists, London?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my impression is, that from Thacker, or from the district sorters, the letter are taken by the general sorter gene<lb></lb>rally—I am not aware of any blind man—I have described the practice according to the best of my belief—I am not aware of any blind sorter in the sorting of the town letters in the first instance—there is not such a man as the blind sorter among the general sorters, that I am aware of there is not a blind sorter in the London delivery—there is, I believe, for the letters passing from London, and I believe there are blind sorters in the letter-carriers' office, but I am describing the Inland-office—what passes in the letters-carriers' office is an after process—I think there is a person of the name of Sims in the Inland-office, but I really do not know him—I have 762 men under my control, and it is impossible for me to know them all—I think there is a man of that name, but whether he is a letter-carrier or a sub-sorter, I really do not know—there was a clerk of that name, but he has left—I cannot say that Sims' duty is to sort imperfectly addressed letters—other witness will give you all this information—my duty is the superintendance of the others—I cannot enter into these minutes points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The letters that come to Thacker's table have been previously sorted by the general sorters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they would detect the blind letters—still occasionally some might slip in, which Thacker would put into a box in front, and the general sorter standing on the other side if the table, would take them out—they are in fact the blind sorters.</p>

               <p>Ringrose's hand, which Ringrose immediately took into the letter-carriers' office, that is perhaps six or eight yards off—he was out of my sight when he got into the letter-carriers' office—it is a compartment of the same office, but is separated by a wall, and you have to pass through large door-ways with arches—he went through the arches quite out of the place—the inland office is a long office, consisting of several divisions, called the sorting office, the inland office, and the letter-carriers' office—the letter-carriers office may be considered part of the inland-office, but we call them distinct office—when I speak of the inland-office I mean the office in which the sorting takes place—Ringrose went into the letter-carriers' office, and went out of my sight—I should say he was absent two or three minutes, three minutes would be the very utmost—I them observed him return, and immediately go up to Thacker, speak to him for a very short time, and then go away to the newspapers again (when he went out, he had the letters in his had which he had received at Thacker's table, when he returned he had nothing); he remained at the news<lb></lb>papers some eight or ten minutes, I did not notice the time particularly—he then went into the letter-carriers' office again, as well as I remember, but my attention was particularly on that spot where Thacker was; and I saw Ringrose then come up to that place; the same place where he had had the other letters, at the right side of Thacker, with a newspaper in his left hand—it was folded up—I then observed Thacker give him several letters, which he immediately put under the newspaper—I cannot say positively that it was a newspaper, but I have no doubt that it was, it had the appearance of one—he then left Thacker and went into the letter-carriers' office—he returned, I may say instantly—on his return, he walked about the inland-office with what appeared to be the same letters and paper—I saw him with them in his hand; he spoke to Mr. Whiting and Mr. Partridge, who was the President on duty—I think both of them took the newspaper out of his hand, I know Mr. Partridge did—he opened it—I cannot say positively whether he gave it him back—after that, he went into the letter-carriers' office with the newspaper and letters—the table at which the sorting took place has a board under the sorter, marked with lines, and inscribed, so as to show where the letters belonging to particular walks should be placed—the Lower Thames-street walk would be on the left hand side of the sorter—the end of the table at which Ringrose was sitting was about three feet, or less than that, from the spot appropriated to the Lower Thames-street walk—I was present when the prisoner Ringrose was brought into my room—that was between half-past two and a quarter to three—I asked him whether the letters then in his possession were those which had arrived by the Indian mail of that day—he said they were—he had them in his hand, tied up in a bundle, what we call <hi rend="italic">set</hi> for delivery, so that the letters would follow at the houses as he would arrive at them—I asked him what his <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> for the day was, and he produced a piece of paper, and read from it the amounts which I at the time took down—he said there had been two amounts charged to him, making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the paper he produced and read from—having the paper in his hand, he read 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him as to the "changes," as they are called—he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been added for letter that had been mis-sorted to other letter-carriers, and which were found to belong to him—he did not explain that at the time, because that was what we understood, that made 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been allowed to him, making his net charge 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him whether the letters in his possession would amount to that, and he said he believed so—the letters were then re-told in my</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a sorter finds letters imperfectly addressed, what does he do with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would put them on his right hand—he usually lays them down flat—they are then passed over to another sorter—it is understood that it is a signal that they are letters for the blind sorter—it is understood that that they mean blind letters, improperly sorted or imperfectly addressed, and to be passed over to be re-sorted—during the press of business consequent upon the arrival of an Indian mail, the sub-sorter is sometimes incommoded by the number of his letters—it is then his duty to put a docket on those letters, and to pass them over to the telling-table—I should say it is the sorter's own duty to hand over his blind letters—the blind sorter is just on the opposite side—I observed Thacker pass some letters over to a man on the opposite side, who, I have no doubt, was the blind sorter, and they were sorted by him—I observed Thacker do something of that sort, ac<lb></lb>cording to the usual practice—the man sat just on the opposite side of the desk—it</p>

               <p>happened so that morning—he is not properly a blind sorter, but he is a man that re-sorted the miss-sorted letters to Thacker, as I understood from his position—the course is this: on side one of the table the letters are sorted into the divisions, one of which was the tenth, on Thacker, and the letters Thacker had miss-sorted to him he would pass over, in the first stage of sorting, that they should be re-sorted, but the man is not in any sense a blind sorter—if a letter had such a direction that he could not tell to what division it belonged, he would pass it to the original sorter, and it would go from him to the book-officer, if he employed a stranger to take those letters to the sorter, he would do wrong—I am not aware of its being com<lb></lb>monly done in the press of business—I have never heard of such a thing—instead of doing that, he should hand them to the person opposite—there is no officer called the blind-sorter—there is a man who would sort them as far as possible—when letters arrive at the sub-sorter's, not properly addressed, he hands them up to the re-sorter to be re-sorted, and if he cannot find out into what division to put them, then he puts them into a charge, called the book-officer's charge, or blind charge, and they search out the right address—a letter directed so badly as not to be read, would not be sorted to Thacker, it would be stopped at an earlier stage—the first sorting is the general sorting—they all come out of sorts, and are thrown down on the table, and placed in rows—the general sorter has to sort them into divisions—a letter so imperfectly addressed would not be sorted into any division—it might happen by accident, in the hurry of business—letters are sorted into different divisions—when the sub-sorter comes to sort those letters in the usual expeditions manner, and cannot find out to whose walk they should go, he would put them down on his right-hand side, and pass them to the sorter on the opposite side, who is sorting the first-stage, to re-sort—he puts them on his right side until he has a convenient opportunity of passing them over to be re-sorted, instead of passing over every letter as he comes to it—if busi<lb></lb>ness is heavy, it is important to him to get off the letters as quickly as possible—he would not say to anybody coming by, "Take these away for me" when he is himself so say near the man that, by just leaning over, and passing his hand over, he could reach him—such letters would go back to the general sorter, who would re-sort them—the sub-sorter puts them over on his right side until there is a sufficient number for a parcel—I should not understand that as a signal to anybody coming by to take the letters up—I should say if a sorter having unpaid letters so placed saw any person take them up, it would be his duty to see what his object was in taking them—they are put there for the purpose of going to the general sorter—no one is authorized to take the letters away to be blind-sorted, except the President on duty or one of the inspectors—I have seen it done except by one of those officers—I never saw a letter-carrier do it—a sub-sorter would not question a superior officer if he saw his letters taken away—it is <hi rend="italic">prima-facie</hi> wrong, but if he saw it was his superior officer on duty that did it, he would then suppose all to be right—I have seen the inspector take letters in that way from the sub-sorter—if a sub-sorter finds he has got a dozen or twenty letters for one firm, I should say that they are stood up on the right hand—a docket would be put to them by the sub-sorter before they were taken from him, and they would be told as a separate charge—I believe there are very few such cases—I doubt whether there are half-a-dozen—their being put on the right or left hand would depend on whether the sorter was right-handed or not—if we had a left-handed sorter, the probability is he would put them on the other side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There have been, and are, a number of charges pending against you, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of any charges pending against me—som<lb></lb>charges have been preferred, partly examined into, and, as I believe, aban<lb></lb>doned, because I heard myself the man who made these charges decline to go on with them—I am the proprietor of the Post-office Directory—I be<lb></lb>lieve the grave charge was, that I made a false return to Parliament of the profits of the Directory, which, on my oath, was a false charge, and I now state that my return was entirely true—the Directory is not carried on in the Post<lb></lb>office now—I am forbidden by Government to do it—the Directory is a list of the names of the merchants and traders of London, arranged alphabeti<lb></lb>cally, and in divisions—it was not supposed to be inconsistent with my public duties that I should be engaged in a trade—it is now my private property—I consider the removal of the Directory from the Post-office to be greatly for my individual benefit—I kept it in the Post-office because I did not like to sacrifice the interests of others—one of the charges was, that the Directory was said to have impeded the public service—I did not have a copy of notes of all the evidence that was taken by the short<lb></lb>hand writer—I got from Mr. Peacock copies of the notes of the evi<lb></lb>dence given on the investigation—I did not get all the evidence—I got that part of it which the authorities expected me to answer, and therefore sent to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not some time after that put up lists of names in the office, one in red ink and another in black ink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I know what you allude to—about two years since there were various attacks in Parliament and in same newspapers, and in various ways, stating that the men considered it a griev<lb></lb>ance; and I said, if the letter-carriers considered their connection with the Directory a grievance, I was quite willing to absolve them from it—I wished every one to say whether he did or did not, and I would forward the names of all who wished to recede from it to the Postmaster-General, and request they might be allowed to do so—many of the letters I received were hardly intelligible, and I could hardly understand whether they wished to recede or not—I therefore put up a notice, saying that I could hardly understand their views, and I gave two lists, those who wished to continue, to be put in black ink, and those who wished to recede in red—I had the list made up, and I for<lb></lb>warded it to the Postmaster-General, and obtained his Lordship's sanction to allow them to recede—all the names in red ink were the names of those who wished to recede from the Directory—after I had got the notes of a portion of the evidence, I saw all the inspectors—I could not have called them all into my room at once, for that would have impeded the public duty, but I saw them all—I showed them that part of the evidence which I had, and the names of all the parties who had been called, whether against me or not—I am not sure, but my impression decidedly is that Thacker's name was not among them—that must be a year, or nine or ten months ago—I did not point out the evidence to the inspectors—I showed it them, and asked them to read it all—I never told them that I had called them in order that they might know the men who had opposed the Directory, and had given evi<lb></lb>dence against me—I swear that—I know Hodge and Robert Grapes, two letter-carriers—Grapes never complained to me of any error about three weeks back—I know that he had endeavoured to obtain a reduction in his charges—I am not aware that it was referred to Mr. Bokenham—if a carrier finds an error in the calculation, and wishes to rectify it, and comes to ma, I should take official knowledge of it; but in this case he did not—Grapes</p>

               <p>never made any application on the subject—I never heard of such a thing—I never heard that he made an effort to get a pound allowed to him, beyond telling the President that there was a mistake—I know a letter-carrier named Campbell—I have not heard that he made up his account on the Indian mail 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than was charged to the revenue—I have no recollection of telling Hodge to pay in the pound when he said he had a pound over—it is a pure fancy on your part, or your informant's—it is the first time I have ever heard of it.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant inspector of letter-carriers in the Post-office. On the 23rd of June I was on duty, and with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Bokenham set to watch what was doing at Thacker's table about twelve o'clock—we were so placed as to command a view of Thacker, and the proceeding at his table—I had seen Ringrose, but not when I first began to watch—I saw him afterwards—when I first saw him he was at his duty conveying newspapers, about three yards in front of Thacker—I saw him leave his place and go to Thacker's table—I had then been watching about a quarter of an hour—when</p>

               <p>he got to the table he leaned over, and appeared to converse with Thacker—I could not hear what was said—he was on Thacker's right hand—Thacker was sorting letters, and had some letters occasionally in his left hand, and as he disposed of them of course his left hand become empty—I can hardly recollect what become of Ringrose after he spoke to Thacker—I think he remained there, but I am not quite clear whether it was the first or second time—he came a second time to Thacker—he was still sorting his letters with his right hand—with his left he was holding a small quantity of letters which supplied the right hand—he appeared to pass them to the various divi<lb></lb>sions or compartments that he was sorting to—I saw him put some on his right hand side and lay them down, which was contrary to the usual practice of sorting, the usual practice being to stand them up—the Lower Thames-street letters should be on his left hand—I saw Ringrose take away a small handful of letters which Thacker had put on his right hand,—he took the first handful into the Letter-carrier's office—Thacker was standing sorting all the while—I am quite positive Thacker could see it done—when Ringrose came back I think he went and spoke to Thacker, and then went and resumed his sorting at the papers—he had nothing in his hand when he came back the second time—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after, I saw him with what appeared to be a newspaper—I observed as he came to Thacker that he showed Thacker this paper, and immediately after Thacker made a sing, as it were, with his right hand to some letters which were lying, and Ringrose took up those letters, as well as the paper, which he was showing to Thacker—the letters were lying on his right hand—he took them up, and went apparently to the Letter-carrier's office—I lost sight of him, I should say, for scarcely more than a second—I saw him then returning into the Inland-office, where he had taken the letters from, as if seeking for some one—he spoke to one of the clerks—he had in his hand apparently those identical letters, by the size of the grasp—he eventually went to the Letter-carrier's office with them—in the course of the same day I saw him in Mr. Kelly's room—I was present when the letters on him were told up—I imagine all of them were in his own walk, although many of them are not fully directed—they are directed to Messrs, <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi>, London—I only conjecture that they were in his delivery—when told of having been seen taking the letters, he at first said that he could not account for it—he produced this paper, from which we gathered that his letters should have amounted to a certain sum—it is marked with pencil marks—the amount at that time was gathered by Mr. Kelly from the paper, not by me—it was gathered from Ringrose's own lips—the paper was first produced by Ringrose in answer to a question by Mr. Kelly, as to how much was the amount of his letters, and there being some additions and subtractions, Mr. Kelly reduced it to a given sum—Mr. Kelly knew what figures to put down, from the lips of Ringrose, and from the production of the paper—he held the paper in his hand—I saw Mr. Kelly make a memorandum of his own—I think it began by Ringrose holding this paper in his hand, and saying from it, "So much is my amount," and he put it down, but I was passing in and out of the room and am not so confident about it—I cannot positively say whether. Mr. Kelly collected it from the paper, or whether Ringrose told it him—I told up the postage of the letters found on him—I made a memorandum of the amount at the time, but I think I have destroyed it—I have a copy which I made next day—the total amount of the letters found on Ringrose was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot give the items—they are copied partly by myself, and partly by three of the clerks—I cannot tell what the postage of the different letters</p>

               <p>After he was discovered did you hear any thing material? - I heard a noise in the yard, and perceived the prisoner collared by Mr. Elliot; we took about ten pound of cardamums from him; his pockets could not have contained so much, but he had cut them and filled the linings and all; he begged to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Was he one of the porters in the house? - No, he was occasionally employed when we were very busy, he had been discharged the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of Mr. State, and live at Bow-common. On Sunday, the 8th of March, I was going along Brick-lane, Whitechapel, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home—I saw three persons standing at the corner of a public-house, they seemed to be talking together, and as I came up they separated to make room for me to go between them—one of them tripped me up, and when I was down another came and untied my neck-hand<lb></lb>kerchief and pulled it off—they knocked me down senseless—I fell on my face—when I was getting up they all ran away—I was on my knees getting up when the handkerchief was taken—he pulled it as hard as he</p>

My window was whole over night, and the morning of the 22d of July, about five o'clock, I went to wash myself, but could not find a towel. I looked, and found my window in the kitchen was broke, and the things mentioned in the indictment gone. My wife takes in washing. They were ironed, and hung upon a horse.</p>

            . I am a whipmaker. As I was coming down the street, about six o'clock, or a little after, in the morning, I saw three people stand at a post almost opposite the prosecutor's door. Rowlins and Horton stood there, and another stood at the corner of the stationer's shop. I know the prisoners by sight, by passing by my master's door. My master is named Brown; he lives in Brackley-street. I passed them, and heard one say, Go it. I turned about, and saw Rowlins go down into the area. I was then at the cabinetmaker's door. He chucked up two bundles to Horton; then they all three went away. I came to the door after they were gone, and knocked, and the man stopped me, and took me to a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not pursue?</p>
               <p>Houlston. I was afraid to pursue.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. Here are some of the things. They were brought one morning into the kitchen when I was in bed. Two shirts and four pair of stockings, the things lost, I had to wash. We have got no more of the things again. I was told it was Rowlins's mother that brought these again.</p>
               <p>Rowlins's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming along Princes-street, about half an hour after five, and overtook Horton: he was going into Long-lane, he said, for purl. We saw two bundles in the area: there were two rails out: Horton bid me go down and get them. Just as he spoke these words that Evidence came by, and asked what we were about. I said, there is something in the area, but I do not know what it is: I got down, and gave it up to Horton.</p>

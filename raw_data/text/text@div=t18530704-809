                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mrs. Woodham, a greengrocer, of No. 27, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. On 26th March I was in Keppel-street, Russell-square—Dr. Daley lives at No. 34, there—as I was passing, the prisoner came from the step there, and asked me if I would go on an errand for Dr. Daley—I said, "I will, if it won't take me too long"—he told me it was only to go to Mr. Selth's, in Tottenham-court-road, and take a note, and wait for an answer—he gave me a note, and told me to take it to Mr. Selth, and when I came back I was to ring the bell—all this time he stood on the step of Dr. Daley's door—I believe this is the note he gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it to Mr. Selth—he opened it in my presence, and gave me twelve sovereigns and a half-sovereign—he asked me where it came from—I said, "Mr. Daley"—I took back the money to Keppel-street—I saw the prisoner—he came off the steps at Dr. Daley's—I thought he came out of the house—I am sure he came off the steps—I gave him the money—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for going, and went away.</p>

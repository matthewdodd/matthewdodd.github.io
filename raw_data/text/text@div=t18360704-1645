               <p>The house, No.30, is about four doors down on the other side of the street, nearly opposite to me—on the 17th of June I got up about four o'clock in the morning—I heard a noise of tiles and bricks rattling about five o'clock, and on looking round, saw a person on the top of a house—I saw him get quite out of a hole in the roof, and endeavour to pull up the lead in the front gutter—my daughter was at work in the same room—I called to her to come and look at him—I called out to the person, and he got into the hole as quick as possible, after looking at me for a moment or two—as soon as I thought Mr. Wheeler, the carpenter of the hospital, was up, I went to give him information—I had looked at the house from time to time—the prisoner is the man I saw on the roof. I am certain—I went to Mr. Wheeler about eight o'clock, and he came to the house, No.30, about ten o'clock; but I did not see him go in—I was looking out, about ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner run from No.30 and get on to No. 31, and jump across a court, to No. 32—he was in my sight all the time—when he came to 34, I called to him, as he was directly facing me—I saw him pursued—he got down a trap-door and walked out at the front door of a house—when I saw him at five o'clock he was about thirty yards from me—I could distinctly see him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father—I was at work with him on the 17th of June and about five o'clock in the morning he called me to the window, and I observed the man on the top of the house either cutting or pulling the lead in the gutter—I cannot be certain which—my father called to him, and he directly went in—I saw no more of him till about ten o'clock, when he walked across the houses, but I did not see him jump across, as my father sent me down to look for a policeman—I got one; and when I came into the street again, I saw the prisoner about three doors from the empty house, which he came out of—I pointer him out to the policeman, and knew him to be the man—I am quite certain of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Duke-street and am carpenter to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In consequence of information I went to No.30 on the morning in question, accompanied by a workman—I tried to get in at the front-door, but it was fastened—we got a ladder and got over walls into the back part of the house, and in the attic found a piece of lead about four feet six inches long lying on the floor, and a screw-driver and chisel, a gin-bottle and a bag, put in the cock-loft over the ceiling—I be<lb></lb>lieve the bag was on the landing—there was a trap-door in the ceiling, and when we got out all the tiles were knocked off, the dormer and the lead stripped—I found not less than 5cwt. of lead stripped off the house—three gutters were taken away—I was over the house the day before, show<lb></lb>ing it to the building—that was about the middle of the day—there was none left in the morning except the piece in the attic, which weighed about half a hundred-weight—the house is the property of the governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I compared the lead found, with the gutters—there was a small portion left, and it exactly matched with what was found on the floor of the attic—it would take several hours to remove the lead—the front-door of the house was burst open; but it was bolted inside when we went, so that we could not get in—the value of all the lead taken was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think it would take more than one person to take it in a night.</p>

             came to our inn, he asked for a glass of rum and milk; I took him a glass of rum and milk into the coffee room, he drank it and paid me for it; he gave me a penny for myself; after that he waited about some time in the coffee room; when I went out of the coffee room, he went to the fire place, and when I went in he went into the box writing; the glass stood before him, and the spoon laid under his elbow; he waited there some time. I suspected that he would take either the glass or the spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. He was watching of you, and you watched him. - A. Yes; when he watched me away he came out with the spoon; I met him at the coffee room door, I went into the coffee room to see whether the glass or spoon was there; the glass was, but the spoon was not; I went after him and caught him at the top of the gateway, I brought him back into the coffee room; coming up with him in the gateway he took his handkerchief out with the spoon, and throwed the spoon before me; I pulled him to the spoon and picked the spoon up, and took it to the coffee room. This is the spoon, it is Mr.

            . I am servant to Mr. Wright. As the waiter was bringing the prisoner back I saw him throw the spoon away in the gateway.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into Mr. Wright's coffee room to write a letter; I laid the spoon on the table, took out my handkerchief over the spoon; taking up the handkerchief promiscuosly I put it in my pocket. When I was attacked by the waiter I was confused; I might drop the spoon from my handkerchief; I had no intention of wronging Mr. Wright. It was done by accident.</p>

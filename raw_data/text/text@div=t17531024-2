            . I am a watchman in St. George Hanover-square Parish; last Friday morning, just as I called the hour four, I saw the prisoner go by drest in a linnen night gown; I thought there goes a butterfly, so I went out of my box, she had lost her way amongst some timber and met me. I asked her where she was going; she said she wanted to go to the turnpike to meet a waggon to carry her goods down to Edgar ; she had a box on her head, and an apron full besides. I suspected she had ran away from her service by seeing her tremble, so I said you shall go back along with me; she said, she lived with Mr. Mitchel in North Audley-street, I took her there, and in going along she made an attempt to run away, but I laid down the box, which I had taken from her, at a door, and ran and secured her. After I had secured her in the prisoner's kitchen, I went and fetch'd the box, which was lock'd, and they open'd it in my presence, in which and in her apron they found the goods mentioned by the prosecutor, which he said were his.</p>

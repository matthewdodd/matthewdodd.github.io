             came into my shop about seven in the evening; she asked me if I had not a gown to dispose of that hung up in the middle of the week: I asked her what kind of gown; she told me, and she fitted it, and we agreed for the gown at 16 s.; then she wanted a skirt; I told her I had a black one; I shewed it to her, and we agreed for 6 s. She asked then if I had a shift; I said yes. Then I asked Mrs. Waylen to mind the shop while I went up stairs to fetch one; I came down, and she looked at it, and approved of it, and a double handkerchief: after she had agreed for the things, which came to 27 s. then she said, before I pay for them, I will have a quartern of gin; she did not pay for the gin; Mrs. Whaley went for the gin, and informed Mrs. M'Nally, that the woman then in my shop had robbed me; Mrs. M'Nally came in, and the prisoner wanted to go out, Mrs. M'Nally stopped her; the bed-gown, when I went up, was on a shelf behind the counter; there was only Whaley in the shop with me and the prisoner.</p>

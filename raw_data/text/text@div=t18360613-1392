I had passed the Adelphi theatre—I felt a tug at my coat pocket, turned round, and seized the prisoner, with my handkerchief in his hand—he gave it to me, and begged for money—I collared him, till I found a policeman—I met Palmer on my way to the station-house, and gave him into his custody there.</p>

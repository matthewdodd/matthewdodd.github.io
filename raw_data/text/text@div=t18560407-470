I am a merchant and patentee of sewing machines; I am also the patentee of a gas regulating machine; I carry on my business at No. 98, Fleet-street, and have also a warehouse at Manches<lb></lb>ter. About Feb., 1854, the prisoner came into my service—he left At the end of July, or the 1st of Aug.—his duty ordinarily was to act as book keeper—about the end of July, 1854, there was an exhibition, or fair, of some description, at Plymouth—I sent one of my sewing machines to that exhibition by the prisoner—I instructed him to sell it if he could, and to take orders for others—he was to stay there one week—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his expenses—he returned from Plymouth about 20th July, but I cannot say within a few days—I was in Manchester at the time—a Mr. Dresser</p>

               <p>lane, to Mr. Dresser, and took premises at No. 23, Cannon-street West we were not both carrying on the same business there at the same time—I have sold him machines, and I may have borrowed some back from him, if I was out of them; if I did I always paid for them, or returned them in kind—there have been a good many monetary transactions between me and Mr. Dresser at different times, all the way through, he owed me money at the time I received this bill, and so he has a great deal of the time since he has been in this country—I never pressed him for payment—he has accepted bills for me, not for my accommodation, but to cover the amount he owed me, in payment for the machines—I do not recollect that I was receiving bills with his acceptance about this time, I might and I might not—my circumstances were not very flourishing at that time; they were not bad—I have had the misfortune to become bankrupt about twelve months after the prisoner left me; I wonder I had not sooner—I discharged him for improper conduct, I swear that—there was no difference between us, or any ill feeling that I was aware of when I discharged him—I talked to him as I would to a brother, I was sorry he had kept bad company, and hoped he would try to redeem himself—there was no lady in the case that I know of—I do not know that he ever alluded to a lady to me, except on one or two evenings, when he asked me to let him go earlier, as he wanted to take his wife to the Panopticon, or some place of amusement, which I always allowed him to do—there was never any quarrel between us as to that matter, I swear that—I never spoke to his wife twice before he left me—I have been connected a good deal with bills of exchange—I do not know that I have discounted bills for other parties—I know Mr. Chandler—I never took bills from him to get discounted—<lb></lb>my bankers hold his dis<lb></lb>honoured bilk for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were bills given to me to get discounted by Mr. Paul, he wanted me to take them to my bank, to see if they would discount them, and gave very respectable reference to Mr. Chandler, de<lb></lb>scribing him as a merchant in a large way of business, and a very respectable man—to oblige him I said I would take the reference and forward the bills to the bank, and if they were willing to do them upon the reference, I would get them done—I sent them to my bankers aft Manchester, bat before I had any reply, Mr. Paul wanted to purchase thirty sewing machines from me; I agreed if he took the thirty, fee should have them at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; he had then made an arrangement with Mr. Dresser, to carry on business as A. P. Dresser and Co.—Mr. Chandler was to be partner with them, and was to furnish some money, so Mr. Paul said, and those bills then went as a set<lb></lb>off for ten machines that were then delivered, and that was all the payment I had for the machines—I afterwards delivered machines to that firm to a large amount, and I believe there is a large balance due besides those bills that lie dishonoured—the bills are indorsed by Mr. Paul—I know that the machines were traced into the possession of Mr. Chandler after Dresser and Co. gave up business at Broad-street-buildings—I do not know who finally had the proceeds of them or anything about them—since the prisoner's com<lb></lb>mittal, his wife has called upon me—I have not since the committal made an offer to retire from the prosecution, if the prisoner could pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that, not at any time—I did not know where the prisoner was, until I gave him in charge; but I frequently heard that he was in France—Mr. Dresser informed me that he had met him in the street two, three, or four weeks before—he did not tell me that he had given him his address—I asked him if he thought he could find out where he was, and I have been on the look out for him since, I had no reason to doubt that he was in Paris at</p>

In July, 1854, I bought a sewing machine of the prisoner—I should think it was about the 14th July—it was to be sold for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite sure it was not earlier than the 14th, he had called at my establish<lb></lb>ment before, but had not seen me—I think the day on which he sold me the machine was about the 17th—he told me that the selling price of the machine was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called two or three times, I objected to purchasing at first, but he held out certain inducements—he stated that they wanted an agent for the West of England, and if I took that agency he would allow me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each machine sold—I still refused, having previously been offered a machine of the same make for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said if I would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it he would sell it—I afterwards said if he would sell it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the com<lb></lb>mission off I would give him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and the two first commissions when two were sold in the district—he agreed to those terms—at the same time I bought of him a gas regulator for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. nett—I gave him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment of the machine and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; with a sovereign that I gave him for the gas regulator—these are the receipts he gave me on 17th July—he represented himself as coming from Mr. Judkins, of London; I knew that, by the machine being sent to a public exhibition—(<hi rend="italic">The papers were here read, receipted by the prisoner</hi>)—I saw the prisoner again on 18th October, 1854, at my house at Plymouth—he had not up to that time sent me any gas regulator—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, which made up the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the sewing machine—this is the receipt he gave me—that balanced the transaction—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had paid him for the gas regulator was to go towards the sewing machine—the acceptance to this bill is not in my handwriting, nor the body—I never knew or heard anything of this bill until it was presented to me for payment—it is a forgery—I never authorised any one to draw a bill upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> All you actually gave for this machine was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in cash—I am in a large way of business—I constantly have bill trans<lb></lb>actions—they vary in amount from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not at all an unusual amount—I carry on business as "Cross &amp; Co."—I have no partner—I am not a great deal in the business; for some hours in the day, not wholly; I have a responsible managing man—in my absence he takes a responsible part in the business—I never saw this bill till I saw it at the Mansion House—I always sign my name B. C. Cross, not Cross &amp; Co.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What passed when the prisoner came to you in October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me that he had left Mr. Judkins and taken a certain amount of sewing machines out of the firm for his part of the capital that was put in it—he represented himself as one of the firm; he said he had been one of the firm, and they had dissolved partnership, and he was going on by himself—he did not say why he came to receive this money, I thought he was authorised to come down and settle all the affairs, as is usual—he did not say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother-in-law. I remember his return<lb></lb>ing to town from Plymouth in July, 1854—I saw him the day after his return, it was somewhere about the 20th—I am not positive as to the date—I met him accidentally—I said to him, "You are come back at last, then t"after being away for three weeks, or a month, leaving his wife in a most anxious state—he pulled a bill of exchange out of his pocket, and said, "I received this bill for the sewing machine"—I said to him, "Will you go and have a glass of ale?"—he said, "Yes, T do not mind if I do, but I have no money in my pocket;"and I took him into a public house at the corner of Bath-street, City-road, and gave him a glass of stout.</p>

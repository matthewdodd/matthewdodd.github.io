               <p>My Lord, I had been at work on board a ship last Friday se'night; as I had been many days before at Ratcliffe-cross; I came on shore at six in the evening, along with three or four of our people, sailors, we had three or four tankards of porter together; I quitted their company to go to Gray's Inn; I had seen them the night before; I was going through Rosemary-lane, between seven and eight, I saw a man come running out in a violent haste; I never saw the man before in my life; this woman was in pursuit of him; I was in liquor, and I ran after him; I overtook him, and had a scuffle with him; I perceived he had some property in his hand, and I snatched it out of his hand, and run after him; I was just passing this gentleman's door; the person I was taking up just passed the door as I did; I was thrown down, being suspected of being the person; I will assure you it is true; I am a sea-faring person; I never was in a Court in my life; I was in expectation of a friend coming, a Mr. Townsend; I sent for the gentleman I lodge with, in great Trinity-lane, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Court to Fearne. Did you see any person running before? - No; my house is seven doors from the corner of the Minories; he was running towards the corner of the Minories.</p>

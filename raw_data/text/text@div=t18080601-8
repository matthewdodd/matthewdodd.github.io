            . Q. You are a patrol - A. Yes. On Friday evening the 30th of May, I was coming from Kingsland Road, about a quarter past nine o'clock, it was dark; the prisoner passed by me with a bundle under his arm, gathered up loose, not tied up as they are now. I stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying, he answered some linen that he brought from his wife, to carry to the manglers; he said his wife was a washer woman in Cooper's Gardens; he was coming from Kingsland Road towards Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where you met him between Hoxton and Shoreditch church - A. Yes. I asked him what manglers he was going to take it to, he said to one in Crab Tree row, in Hackney Road; it is about a hundred yards distance from Cooper's Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Near town or further from town - A. Further from town I asked him how he came in Kingsland Road, as he was going to the manglers with it; he told me he had been of an errand for his wife with the bundle; I told him it was an unlikely story, I should go to the mangler's and know the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended him - A. Yes; I took him to the mangler's in Crab Tree row, she said she neither knew him nor his wife. I took him and the bundle to the office. I delivered the bundle to Mr. Armstrong; he has had it ever since.</p>

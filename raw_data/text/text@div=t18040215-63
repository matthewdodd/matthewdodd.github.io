                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150049"></xptr>Q. At what time? - A. Between twelve and one o'clock; I was not two yards from him; I came up to him immediately, took the key out of his hands, and secured him; he seemed to conceal it very much; however I took it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself? - A. He asked for Mr. Paterson; I told him there was no such man as I knew of.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose key was it? - A. My own; when I called the constable, he said he hoped I would forgive him; it was a small fault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before? - A. No; he said he picked up the key from off the mat at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I told you I picked the key up at the edge of the door? - A. Not in my house; he said so before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. With submission, I beg your pardon; I did tell you so? - A. The boy pulled you from behind the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any mat there? - A. No; my master sent me for a constable; he said, pray forgive me, I did not mean any harm; I fetched a constable, and the constable took him up.</p>

On Sunday, the 24th of June, between three and four o'clock, I heard the child cry—I got out of bed, and took the child into my own bed—I fell asleep—being broad day-light I did not lock my room—I was awoke again, between four and five o'clock, and saw the prisoner inside my room—I hallooed, and got out of bed, and awoke my boy—I saw two persons run down stairs—I missed three half-crowns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my pocket, and a watch, which hung over the mantel-piece—I had let my husband out to work at two o'clock in the morning, and locked the door—the money was safe when I went to bed—I did not know the prisoner before—I am quite certain it was him.</p>

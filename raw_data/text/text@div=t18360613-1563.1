On the 24th of May, I went with the officer Cross to No. 8 Union-place, Tabernacle-row, on the information of Mrs. Engley—I saw a box in a bed-room, on the second floor, and in it found a quantity of loose silk and bobbins and a quantity of silk lace, and cotton laces—I went again on the 25th with Mr. De la Rue, and found this ink-power, and other things there, some on the first-floor, and some on the second-floor—his wife came home after I got there—these ink-powders were found in the second-floor, in a cupboard which was locked—this vice was found locked in the drawers, on the first-floor—the key was given me by prisoner's wife—these other tools were found on the second-floor, in the cupboard, and this one was found in the back yard—Mr. De la Rue pointed out these things as his.</p>

                  </hi>. I have two partners, and live in Bunhill-row. The prisoner was in my employ better than two years—these ink-powders have our name on them—they were not put on sale, as we altered our minds afterwards, and did not sell them—the prisoner had access to our factory—he had to come early in the morning, to set the engine to work—I think these powders were in the engine-house—here are seven packets of them—they weigh, I suppose, about 1lb—they are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this pot I can swear to, and this extract of indigo I think is mine—we have lost this kind of property constantly.</p>

On the 17th of October, the prisoner came to my shop, for a bit of meat, which came to 6 1/2d. he said, "I am a poor man, let me have it for 6d." - I said, he might take it; and he threw me down half-a-crown, which was a bad one - I asked him where he got it - he said, from his boy, who went out sweeping - I asked where he lived, but he would not tell me - he said, he had seven more of them on the Saturday before - I told him they must be bad ones - he said, they were not - I gave him in charge - I gave him back the half-crown- but I took it from him again; the policeman had it last.</p>

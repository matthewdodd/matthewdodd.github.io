                  </hi>. I am in the service of Francis Weaver, who keeps a tobacconist's shop, in the Lower-road, Islington. On Saturday afternoon, the 27th of Dec, about a quarter past four o'clock, the prisoner Porter came into the shop—I had seen him in the shop before—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco—I served him, and be paid for it—the other two prisoners came together to the shop-door just as I was serving Porter—(I had seen them before)—Probert asked for a Christmas-box—I said I would not give him one—while I was speaking to him I saw Porter put his hand across, and take some cigars from a case on the counter opposite the door—I told him he had taken the cigars, and I would give him in charge if I saw a policeman—he dropped one cigar on the floor—I went round and picked it up—I was about to look for a policeman when two customers came in, and prevented my leav<lb></lb>ing the shop—while I was serving them I saw the three prisoners stand at the window and divide the cigars amongst them—they then went up the road together—I told Cooper of it—I gave the cigar which I picked up to Mrs. Weaver, and I saw her give it the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Porter</hi>. I wish to know how many cigars she saw me take. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> A handful—I should say twelve—I had just filled the case up—it holds three dozen—there were no partitions in the case he took them from—there are other cases there—I saw him give Probert two cigars—they were all three together at the window.</p>

He shewed it to me. I was certain it was my property. He told me he had stopped the person that brought it, and she was then in the Gatehouse. I went there, and saw her; it was the prisoner at the bar. She acknowledged before Sir

I stopped her and the spoon, and took her before the justice. Then she said she found it in Leicester Fields. The justice committed her; then she said her name was Duckson, and that she lived in Hedge lane. Last Wednesday she was re-examined; then she owned she took it out of the prosecutor's kitchen, and had scratched the name in part out with a file.</p>

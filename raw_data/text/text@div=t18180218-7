On Sunday, the 1st of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I took my wife and family to dine with my father; I locked both the front and back doors, and fastened the windows. I returned a little after four in the afternoon, and found the dairy window open, and the iron bar of the casement broken in - A man could then get in-the dairy door was shut; they had broken a hole in the lath and plaster wall, and got through into the back of the house, gone up stairs, broken another hole through a lath and plaster wall, and crept into my childrens' room, and then into mine; I found the drawers open, and the things in great disorder; I missed my coat, my watch, seal, and key, which hung over the bed. I said nothing about it until I had done my work the next day, I then got Weedon to go with me, and look for the prisoner, Bishop, whom I suspected; we found him at Ryeslip, which is about a mile from my house, I collared him, and told him he must come with me, and took him to a public-house-Weeden went and took Gregory, and brought him to us. We took them both to lckenham. I told Bishop I thought he had better confess it, when he said my great coat was up in about the third tree in a hedge of one of my father's fields, which is about a mile from my house; he took us there, to the third tree, and found it himself - He said he gave my watch to Gregory. I asked him if my dog did not bark at him, when he was at my house - He said, yes.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at lckenham. I went with the prosecutor, and found Gregory at a public-house, as soon as I went in he walked out - I took him at the door. As soon as he got to the other public-house he put his hand into his pocket, took out the watch, and dropped it; I told him not to throw it away, and I picked it up - He got from me and ran off, but I overtook him; he said he would not go back with me, and that the property was given to him. I dragged him back to the public-house where Byles was, I pulled the watch out, and asked Byles if it was his, he said it was, Bishop said, "D-n" that watch, I thought it was gone" Gregory said Bishop gave it to him, and he knew Bishop stole it from Byles's house.</p>

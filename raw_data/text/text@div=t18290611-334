On the 12th of June, I detected the prisoner in my barn taking this wheat; he had taken it from a heap and put in another place - I had seen him before, but not employed him - I was called up by Hawtree, and saw a light in the barn - we went to put in a key to unlock the door, the light was then put out; we went in and found about three sacks of wheat, which were dressed, and laid separate from the heap which was not dressed.</p>

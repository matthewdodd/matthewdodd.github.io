                  </hi>. I live at 165, St. George's-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On Saturday night, 12th Feb., at near 12 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, asked for a cigar, and took a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one—he offered me half a crown in payment—I took my purse from my pocket, and was in the act of giving him change, when he snatched the purse from me, knocked down the shutters, and ran out—my brother, who had passed him while he stood in the shop, heard me call out, and ran out after him—I ran first, but ran back to take care of my shop—there was about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—I had seen him once before (it may have been the same evening)—I recognized him directly he came into the shop.</p>

On the evening of the 12th I saw my sister serving the prisoner in the shop—I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the man—I passed through the shop, while he was there, into the parlour, and as soon as I got into the parlour I heard my sister call "Thief!"—my sister left the shop and turned to the left, and I followed her, and saw the prisoner running—I pursued him through Bett-street and Cable-street, and did not lose sight of him—I came up to him when he was in the custody of Mr. James, about 300 yards off—I said, "Pray hold him, hold him"—I laid hold of his other side, and he took a knife and drew it across my nose (<hi rend="italic">showing a wound</hi>), and slipped from me.</p>

On the night of 12th Feb., as I was closing my shop door, I heard a shout of "Stop thief!"—I placed myself in the middle of the road, and the first person who came was the prisoner, who was calling, "Stop thief!"—I stopped him and said, "<hi rend="italic">Hold hard, governor</hi>; it strikes me you are the man;" he said, "No, I am not; pray, let me go"—the last witness then came up, said, "Don't let him go," and caught him by the</p>

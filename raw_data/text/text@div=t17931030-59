               <p>I was at the outside of the door when it was broke open; it was about half after seven or a few minutes more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light then that you could distinguish the features of a man's countenance? - Not without a candle; we had a great many lights at the door, but we could not without those lights distinguish the features of any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there had been no light or candle whatever, and you could only have seen before you by the light in the air, could you distinguish the features of a man's countenance? - I think I could. At my entering the house I opened the door, and I heard a noise, and I heard them come down stairs step by step; when I said three times, who is there? They did not answer but kept coming forward; there were three, but one made his escape, the other two we took; I gave the alarm to the next door, and I had assistance immediately; Mr. Austin, of No. 3, and Mr. Goodyear of No. 8, came out, and they brought back the two prisoners, they were not out of my sight; the first man that came out knocked me down. The things are here which they had about them; there are eleven keys also, three found on them, and the others hid in the house; I took hold of the man by the coat, and had them brought into the house to be searched.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was before the Lord Mayor, was not you? - No, before Mr. Alderman Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any charge of any thing being stole? - No, sir, only of the things being moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I observed in Alderman Gill's commitment, the charge was with an intent to steal? - They were only removed from one end of the room to the other.</p>
               <p>Court. That will do.</p>
               <p>- AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I was called to pursue the prisoners; I pursued them; I took Gibson before ever he was out of my sight; I believe there was nothing found on him, the constable searched; there were some keys found on one of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Where did you apprehend Gibson? - On Snow-hill, just at the bottom of the court where Mr. Brownless lives.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Brownless live? - In Clarke's-buildings, on Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember in what situation these things were before the prisoner entered your house? - I left them on a chair on the further end of the parlour, and I found them on a table adjoining to the parlour door, scattered about.</p>

On Tuesday the 6th Instant, I was going to carry home a pair of pumps to a gentleman, and in the afternoon I missed them; I had seen them in the morning; on the Saturday following, when I went down into my shop, about seven in the morning, my servant informed me another pair of shoes were stolen; they were all bespoke shoes, and had names in them; I supposed they were taken while my servant was sweeping the shop; accordingly on the Monday morning following I went down with him, and while he swept the shop I went on the stairs to watch; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take a pair of shoes from the window, and put them under his great coat; he turned and went out of the shop; I followed him and took him about 25 yards from my shop, with these shoes on him. I took him before the Justice; he confessed taking the pumps on the Saturday and the shoes on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the shoes worth 5 s?</p>
               <p>Randal. I would not swear to a nicety.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge what the prosecutor says is true. I leave myself to the mercy of the court.</p>

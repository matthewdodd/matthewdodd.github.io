In consequence of information I went to the house of Thomas Rider, on the borders of the parish of Heston—I found Mrs. Rider—we searched the house by her liberty, and found the barrack sheet on her bed, which she said she had bought two years ago from one of the 3rd Light Dragoons—we then found one of the flannel jackets, which she said her husband had bought—we asked where she thought we could find her husband—she said she could not tell, but she was willing to go and look for him—we went in the direction of his father's house, and went to James Rider's house and found him—we told him we were looking for his son—he told us his son had been there a quarter of an hour before—we looked round the house, and observed on his back one of the hospital jackets—he said he had bought it of his son, and paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—Hamilton lives in the neighbour hood, but I know nothing against her—when I found the property at Thomas Rider's, nothing was said about it, only that they had bought it—they called Mr. Flood on one side, and begged he would look over it, and they burst into tears, and said they would acknowledge every thing if he would look over it.</p>

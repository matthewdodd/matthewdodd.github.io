                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Johnson. I am pew<lb></lb> opener in (he district church of Christ Church, in the parish of Camber<lb></lb> well—Divine service is performed there according to the rites of the Church of England—there was divine service there on Holy Thursday, the 28th of May—it was over about two o'clock—I was the last person in the church at that time—I left it at two o'clock—the windows were all shut, and fastened in the usual way—there are four doors to the church—two of them I had under my core, which were the centre door on the south side, and the west door—they were both fastened—the other gallery pew<lb></lb> openers attend to the other doors—the west door was bolted top and bottom, I am certain, and the centre door had half of It bolted top and bottom—the other half was locked—I pulled it to when I went out, and locked it when I was out—I gave the key to William Whitchurch, the clerk—I will not swear to the prisoner, but I believe I have seen him at the church—I only saw his face, and the upper part of his person; but if you were to ask me if I had seen him there, I should say yes—that was on the Tuesday and Wednesday in Passion week—he was sitting in the free seats—on Friday morning, the 29th of May, Maria Monk called me into the church about one o'clock in the day—I missed the blue baize cover from the table in the vestry, and a looking-glass—the vestry is part of the church—you go through a small door from the church to it, but it is under the same roof—there is no other way of getting to it but through the church—I had seen the baize and the looking-glass safe when I left at two o'clock on the Thursday.</p>

"—I said, No, not till Easter Sunday"—he said he was Surprised at that, and then went away—he was meanly dressed.</p>

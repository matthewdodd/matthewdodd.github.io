            , of Tavistock-street, woollen-draper. On the 12th of January I was in master's shop, which is just opposite Mr. Syer's; I heard the crash - I was cleaning our windows inside, when I heard something fall; I ran to the door immediately - I saw Carter leaning over the clock; I saw nobody else in the street - I crossed the road, and saw the clock laying on Mr. Robinson's steps - Mr. Syer came round the corner immediately after I got out of master's shop; I saw the young man belonging to the public-house, and about five minutes after I saw Britain; Mr. Syer came round from the court with him - I saw no other person in the street - I was there when the prisoners were secured; the young man from the public-house remained there till the officers came, and so did I.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look out before the crash? A. No, I was standing on the ground, reaching to clean the windows; I should not think more than a quarter of an hour elapsed before Syer collared the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any attempt to take them before the officers came? A. Yes; Syer took hold of Carter - the prosecutor seemed agitated, and appeared to suspect Carter - I remained there to see where the prisoners went to, but said nothing to Syer; Britain went up Tavistock-court - I cannot say where he went to; I did not notice him further - he walked round the corner, and walked back, when he was called; I was not above four yards from the clock when I went up - I did not hear Syer ask Carter if he had seen any body pass; I did not notice what he said - I was taking notice of the clock; I got to the spot in two minutes; there was plenty of time for a man to get away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does it take you two minutes to cross the street? A. I think so - I saw nobody but Carter in the street when I looked; I afterwards saw Syer and the man from the public-house, and afterwards Britain - I saw nobody in a brown coat.</p>

On the evening of the 11th of January, about a quarter to six o'clock, I saw the prisoners together, going in a direction for Mr. Syer's house; a third person was behind them, whom I knew was a bad character - they went towards Brydges-street; they were going on, and the third man ran up and overtook them - I first saw them fifty or sixty yards from Syer's, on the same side of the way; I was coming along the following morning, and saw them brought along in custody - I knew them again; I stated this at the station-house, voluntarily.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Syer. -On the evening before this clock was taken (the 11th), a little before six o'clock, the prisoner Carter (pointing to Britain) came to our door - I never saw him before; he asked me if Mr. McPherson, a tailor, lived there - I said No; he asked me to inquire - I would not leave the shop; I told him no such person lived there, then shut the door, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate Britain was the person who called, or that you could not swear to him? A. I said it was him; I never said I could not swear to him - I mentioned Carter just now because I forgot their names; I heard somebody say something when I named Carter, but did not hear what it was - I did not hear, "No" said.</p>
               <p>Britain's Defence. I was coming from Covent-garden, and met Mr. Syer - I asked him for Davis, but deny asking for McPherson; when he said he did not know him I went up the court, when he heard the window crash; I walked up with him. I went twenty yards from Tavistock-court, to the person he told me of; he said, "Aye, young man:" I looked round, and it was him; I came back - he said he was not satisfied; I asked what about, and he said about the clock - I staid there about ten minutes; he sent for a constable, and gave me in charge.</p>

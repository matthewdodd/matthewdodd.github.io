                  </hi>. I am a merchant and general ironmonger, and live at Mr. Neal's when I am in town—part of my store-place is in the same warehouse with Neal's. On Friday, the 7th of June, I went to Hunt's house—I afterwards went to Lynch's, and saw her—I asked her if her name was Andrews—she said "Yes," it was—I asked if she belonged to the shop—she said, "Yes"—I said, "You have property here belonging to me and Mr. Neal, how did you come by it?'—she said she could not tell, but if there was anything I might take it—I pointed out a great many screws, castors, and other things—she said I might take them—I said, "I shall not, but I insist on your sending them home"—she sent out a man for a truck, and I sent my clerk with him to see that the things were taken back to Queen-street—these two parcels are part of the goods so brought there—I saw on the premises there a great quantity of things, as much as a man could carry in a truck—I went to Lynch's again the next morning—as we were going in she came out, and we found several other things—this brass thing I found, which is Mr. Neal's—as I was coming out on the Friday, Lynch said she hoped I would not do anything with her, she was a poor widow—I said she was quite old enough to know better, and we were very much inclined to believe that the boy's delin<lb></lb>quencies were owing to her—we went again on the Monday with the officer—I inquired if Mrs. Andrews was at home—they said she was not, but she would be in in a few minutes—we got information that she was up stairs in the next house—I remained in the shop while the policeman and Mr. Neal went up, and in about an hour they brought her down to the shop.</p>

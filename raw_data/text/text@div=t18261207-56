Cooper was sent out on Friday morning, the 1st of December, and did not return till about eight o'clock the next morning; I immediately asked what he had done with fifty-seven portraits, a memorandum of which I had found in the pocket of his livery coat - he denied having taken them at first; but when I produced the memorandum in his own writing, he acknowledged he had taken a few prints and given them to Newland; he said it was of no use to hold out any longer, and they had sold them for their mutual benefit; I sent for a constable, and found Newland in a lane adjoining the house, looking from behind my gateway; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070038"></xptr>brought in and confronted with Cooper - I did not either threaten or promise them any thing - I asked how they had disposed of the property - they said they had sold a large portion to the two prisoners Jenkins, at 6d. each, as I undestood them - I never myself sold any of this size - I have them on larger paper - they said they had sold them at three different times - they were prints in sets of ten each, and some were considerably more in demand than others; several of those I missed were the most popular ones - I found some of them at the office, and knew them - I went with an officer to Jenkins' shop, in Bear-street, Leicester-square, and saw Joseph John Jenkins - I asked if he had any proof prints of the "Literary Souvenir" to dispose of- he said, Yes, and produced a port-folio with thirty or forty of them - I beckoned to the office, who came in - I said they were my property, and gave him in charge - I then inquired of whom they had purchased them - he said he bought them of a lad in livery, and had no reason to believe they were stolen - I understood him to say that he or his brother had given information to some persons belonging to Hurst and Co., who had published the volumes of the work which these prints belonged to - he was asked to produce what other prints they had, and did so after some hesitation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The shop is kept by Jenkins' father? A. I cannot say that; some of the prints were exposed in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said they were stolen, there was some hesitation about producing the rest? A. Yes; both the Jenkins' were bailed and have surrendered here.</p>

Watts, North-bank" - he asked 6s. for the set - I said I had been selling them at 6d. each, and I would give him 5s.; he said very well, and he would bring them in the morning - I intended to secure him if he brought them; but he came and said he had only eight and did not bring them - I said, "I must have the set;" and he said his fellow-servant had two which would make the set, and he would bring them - he called again, and said he exchanged them for other prints, which he produced - I did not secure him.</p>

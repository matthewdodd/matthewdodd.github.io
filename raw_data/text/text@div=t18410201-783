                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner Francis was in my employ—about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, on the 6th of January, I saw him give his father this brass fender—I was in my shop—he was not aware I was looking at him—it was outside the door for sale—he handed it to his father, and, as I thought, something else at the same time—I then immediately had the whole of my goods got into the shop, and the shop shut up directly—I called Francis into the parlour, and said, "I have a question to ask you, Francis; what property have you given your father of mine to-night?"—he stood a little while, and said, "I will tell you, and I hope you will forgive me; I gave him a brass fender to-night"—I</p>

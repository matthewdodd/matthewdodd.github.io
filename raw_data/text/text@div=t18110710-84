I went out and came in a little time afterwards, the prosecutor called for something to drink; the prisoners were gone then; he put his hand into his pocket, he had no money to pay for the beer; I went away home, in about an hour and a half I came up to this place to get a pint of beer for my supper I saw the prosecutor standing by the public-house door, he was crying, saying he lost his money.</p>

               <p>Dix's Defence. I was very much in liquor, Fidler persuaded me to take the money; I said no, she said, if I did not take it I never should enter the door of her house; after I took it she put it behind the water butt, and in the morning she took it from behind the water butt; I asked her what she had got, she said, what she had got she would keep, and she gave me six pounds.</p>
               <p>Fidler's Defence. It is all false what she says; she unfortunately slept in the house that night, in the morning, she asked me to go with her to the Angel, she said she left some money there; I went with her; she said go into the yard with me; I went with her; she then said, I have put a little money here, if we get it safe we will have something that is good; she took the broom and took it from behind the water-butt; I picked them up, I told her I could not read; she said, as I was going to Gravesend, and wanted a little money she would give me two pounds, I said no, lend it me, and I will pay you.</p>

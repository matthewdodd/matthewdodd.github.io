On the 10th of August, between four and five o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, a little girl brought me a bundle of clothes to mangle, saying she would fetch them in a short time—about an hour afterwards the prisoner came and asked if her bundle of clothes was done—I asked her who had brought them—she said her little girl <hi rend="italic">Lizzy</hi>—she said she had two child<lb></lb>ren in the Cripplegate school, and I had some school aprons in that bundle—she said she was very ill, and that she expected to be confined, that she was in labour—I said if she was ill I would send them—she said I should not be long, she would take them—I did them, and delivered the articles stated to her—she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for mangling them—I sent my grandchild to follow her—she sent the girl back for a silk handkerchief, which she said was forgotten, and I then found I was robbed—I hare had to pay 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the things.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 10th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night, and asked me if her mangling was done—I asked who she came from—she said from the second shoe-shop in Milton-street, which I knew to be false; because they had received their bundle—I asked her name—she gave me two names, Jones and Atkins—she had a basket with her, and I accused her of being the person that had been to Mrs. Cosham's, and got a bundle—she said I was mistaken, and not to be too hasty—I took her to Mrs. Cosham, and she recognized her.</p>

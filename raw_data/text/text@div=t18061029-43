About half past three in the morning I heard a noise, I supposed it was the cats in the room, we have two large cats and they were put in the room adjoining on the over night; I had been awake about half an hour when I heard the noise, I did not take any notice, I told my husband I thought it was behind time for us to get up, I thought it was half past six, that is the reason that I knew the hour of the night, we looked at the watch, I found it was only half past three; I heard nothing more of it till about half past six in the morning, my husband came in, and told me that we had been robbed of the linen that I had washed of the overnight.</p>

             sworn. I am a carpenter; in the morning as I came to work at six o'clock, passing by the window of Mr. Thorn, I perceived the shutter and the sash open, I knocked at the door, and the servant girl opened the door to let me have the tools, I told her that the window was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go down and see how they came in. - A. I went in for my tools, they lay in the same room which had been broken open; I work on the premises.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) How was the window opened. - A. It was opened by the man that took the things, I suppose.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290034"></xptr>Q.(to Mrs. Thorn.) Stand up, Mrs. Thorn, you have got more sense than your husband, how was this window opened. - A. I suppose it was opened at the time I heard the noise, and I suppose they had raised the bolt of the shutter and shook the window, and I supposed that was the noise that I heard in the night, it is a ground floor window.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He must have got over some palings to get at the window, it is a trafalgar building, they are all enclosed, and there is no garden at all to it. When he got over the railing he could then very easily get into the house, by opening the shutter.</p>
               <p>- CHAPMAN sworn. I am a farmer. On Sunday the 19th of October, I was walking about my ground, in the middle of my ground I have a wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your ground. - A. In the parish of Greenford.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from this place. - A. Near nine miles. Going through the wood I turned my head round, and saw something white; I immediately made up to it, and when I got within twenty yards of it I saw the prisoner sitting and apparently picking marks out of a sheet; he appeared to be in that position. I went up to him and saw there was a large quantity around him, and he was in the middle of it, I said to him my friend, what do you do here, he said I am drying some clothes, I then laid hold of a part of it and it was wet; I said to him you scoundrel you have stole it; his answer was that he had found it; I then took him by the collar and secured his hands behind him; I told him I thought that if he had found it he had no occasion to come to so secret a place as that to dry it; I took him to a neighbourr's house, a constable, but he was not at home; I then took him to a Mr. Horner's, and he committed him to the cage, being Sunday, he was a new magistrate and almost the first time of acting; I then brought him to Bow-street and took care of the linen; it is here.</p>

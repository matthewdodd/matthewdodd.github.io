             about 3 o'clock on Thursday morning last to go there; I went: when I had unlocked the door it was bolted at the bottom within side: then they got a ladder and got in at the one pair of stairs window, and opened the door, there they had got the prisoner. I went down into the cellar, there I saw five parcels of lead rolled up, there was 162 pounds weight of it, we could not find any Tools. On the Tuesday following we went up to the top of the house and took the lead and compared, which fitted and appeared to be fresh cut.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Cow-lane; after I had beat my rounds on Thursday morning. coming up to my stand about a quarter after 2 o' clock, turning to go into St. John's court, there stood a Man about ten yards from a cellar window: he said, come-up, but he pushed off directly. I saw a head out at the window, and he saw me, and drawed back again. I said I'll have a knock at you. Then we got the key and went to the house. The rest as the other two, with this addition. The prisoner said he and the other Man that ran away came there to sleep, and that a brewer's servant found another piece of lead in the street, which was compared also and fitted as the rest.</p>

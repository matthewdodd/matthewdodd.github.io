                  </hi>. I am a tailor. On 17th Dec. I was in Whitechapel, High-street, going towards Rosemary-lane—it was about half past 1 or 2 o'clock, on the morning of the 18th, Thursday I think—I should say that I had about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or upwards in my pocket, but cannot swear what—I was rather the worse for liquor—I left home with 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at about 10 o'clock, and went to receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a club, but I got none of it, and did not receive it till a week or nine days afterwards—I told the police that I lost about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I thought then, being in liquor, that I had drawn the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was under a mistake, till I inquired afterwards—I gave evidence at the police office on Thursday, the day after—I was to get the money at a temperance society, No. 86, Royal Mint-street—the prisoner laid hold of me in High-street, Whitechapel, and collared me, and <hi rend="italic">bursted</hi> the eyes out of my head—he thrust his knuckles into my collar—I remember that being done, and that is all I recollect, until I was taken to the station—I was not quite drunk, but I was rather the worse for liquor—I got in liquor before I went to the Temperance Society's office—I forget whether I had some rum—I do not think I went into any house—it was Scully that had hold of my throat—I know him by his features—I had never seen him before, but am certain he is the man—I know nothing about the woman—when I recovered my senses the inspector gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot swear that I had more than that—I did not spend 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am quite sure I lost money, and that Scully is the person that thrust his hand into my pocket—he rubbed his knuckles into my neck, and my senses went then.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 12). About half past 2 o'clock on Thursday morning, 18th Dec, I saw the female prisoner and the prosecutor come out of the Bed Lion and Spread Eagle public house, Whitechapel, and walk together towards Whitechapel Church—Scully came out of the same public house and looked after them, he then went in again, and in a minute or a minute and a half came out and walked in the same direction as they had—in five minutes I heard a noise, went and saw Scully on the pavement, holding Goggin down, with his knees upon his chest, and, as well as I could see, his hands in his pockets—Smith was</p>

               <p>standing by his side—when I got within five or six yards of them, Scully ran away—I sent Harler after him, and detained Smith—I assisted Goggin up, he could not speak for some time—he appeared to have suffered very much—Scully was brought back by Harler—Goggin was then just able to speak, and said, "You have throttled me, you have robbed me, you thief."—Scully said, "Me, Sir!" and then fell on the pavement, and pretended to be drunk, but he had not the least appearance of it before—I had seen him five or six times in the half hour previous—he began to swear, and kick, and resisted violently all the way to the station, we were obliged to put handcuffs on him at the station, he was so violent, I saw Goggin's left waistcoat pocket turned inside out, and asked him what money he had lost, he said, "I can hardly tell"—after that he said, "I think I have lost between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—being the worse for liquor, we detained him at the station for the night—Goggin appeared to be suffering very much, and for a week afterwards, when he was before the Magistrate.</p>

"—Scully said, "You cannot prove that"—Goggin said, "You are the man"—Scully threw himself on the pavement as if in fits, and became very violent, he resisted very much.</p>

On Sunday was se'nnight, between four and five in the morning, I heard my curtain-rings to my bed rattle; I cry'd out, Who is in the room? and put my hand to the curtain, and found there was some substance by my bedside. I heard my gold rattle in a little iron box, that I keep in my purse, which I had laid under my head, when I went to bed: I lay still, and it was about half an hour before I could hear anybody stir in the room again; then I heard the door move (I burn a lamp in my room, but that was out; whether the prisoner put it out or not, I know not) at the door opening, the dog barked below: then I rang the bell; my servant called, What is the matter? I said, there is somebody in the house: they came down, and they took the prisoner. When they got a light, I asked him what he had done with my purse? he said, he had not got it; I sent for a constable; then he said the purse was in my room; I was then below. The constable went up, and brought my purse down; there was a guinea, three half guineas, and 15 s. 6 d. in it, my property. The prisoner is a drummer, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220004"></xptr> had been quartered in my house, but not since Christmas.

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. She rang the bell; I came down, and found the prisoner on the stairs: when my mistress charged him with stealing her purse, he at first denied it; but at last, said, he would go and shew us where it was. I and the constable went up with him into my mistress's room; he took up the purse from the floor, and gave it to the constable. He said, when the dog bark'd, he was afraid it was a great mastiff dog, and he was afraid to go down stairs. Upon being asked how he got into the house, he said, he came in at the door, about 9 o'clock, and crept under the bar, and went up stairs, and lay under the bed, where he used to lie, when he was quartered in the house.</p>

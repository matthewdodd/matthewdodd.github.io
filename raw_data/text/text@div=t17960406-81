               <p>Q. How do you know the apartments were his? - A. He had left his address with a young woman, who lives with me, in case of any letters coming for him; I saw the box opened, and know it to be his box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had a very good character with the prisoner? - A. Yes; he lived with me eleven months.</p>

               <p>Q. You discharged him upon suspicion; did you search his boxes before he went away? - A. I did not; he took his boxes away before I knew it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I had a warrant to search the prisoner's box; I searched his apartment; I was told it was his by the people of the house; I found this black veil, a white veil, a piece of laylock ribband, and a piece of garter blue ribband, a piece of black ribband, and a pair of black silk mits, a pocketbook, with running accounts in it, and some shoestrings; I have kept them from that time to this; we waited till he came home at eleven o'clock; I searched him, and found a yellow watch, thirteen guineas, and half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. His mistress had paid him 14 or 15l.? - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. You take the money away from them the first thing, don't you, when you apprehend the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any information of any money being taken? - A. No; I had the Magistrate's orders for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you orders from the Magistrate to take his money before you went to him? - A. No; I told the Magistrate I had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you any authority to seize the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dared you to seize all the money a man has; now we will see how these officers conduct themselves; had you any-complaint that this lady had lost a watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any orders from the Magistrate to take that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not take the man's watch, and have kept it till this hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you a constable? - A. Yes; of Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you seen so? - A. Ever since it was established.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is always your conduct? - A. Yes; if I have done wrong, I beg the Court's pardon; it was not demanded, we did not know what there might be against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has there been any charge against him since that relative to a watch or money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>They all belong to me; but this is the only one I can identify, on account of the marks being taken off; here is a yard and a quarter of black silk lace, I have a corresponding piece, which nothing but of scissars have parted, and they match exactly on each side; the pattern and threads match exactly where I cut them asunder; I had missed it, and likewise some of the other property, which he told me had been sold, it was cut out of the middle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You swear to that, because it corresponds with a piece you have at home? - A. Yes; it was cut through the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncommon pattern? - A. I don't know that it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there is any haberdasher's shop in London in which you could not find that pattern? -

            Therefore, I take it, that would match precisely with any of the same breadth? - A. No; because we cut it in equal lengths, and it depends upon the length of the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was cut in the same place, a piece of a similar length? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other piece, cut in the same way, in the same place, would match just as well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been no scolding, or a little quarrelling between you, had there? - A. It is a very impertinent question.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there or not? - A. No; there had not.</p>

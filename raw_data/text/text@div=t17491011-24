            . I set out on foot from London, in order to go to Wales, Sept. 10. about 7 or 8 miles out of London, the Prisoner was riding the same way; we fell into discourse together, he ask'd me where I was going, and who I was; I said, I was a Welchman from Mongomeryshire; he ask'd me where I had been, I said at London; he said, what have you been doing there? said I, paying a visit to a brother; he ask'd my brother's name, I said,

            ; he ask'd what business, I said, a master taylor; said the prisoner, he is a great friend of mine, he works for me, then I was very fond of his company; he complained that riding had made him very sore, and he rode on one side, as though he was hurt by riding; his horse had sweat very much: we came to a public house, the sign of the Adam and Eve, two Miles beyond Acton; the prisoner said, for the love I bear to your brother, I'll make you drink; he call'd for a pint of beer, ( before we came there, be put me on his horse, and he walk'd by on foot, I lik'd that very well,) I ask'd him how he came to be so very well acquainted with my brother; he, said he, meaning himself, was a master robe-maker. said I, are you the gentleman's brother that died lately, near Brook-street? Yes, said he, and added, your brother is making me a suit of mourning for my brother. Said I, pray Sir, what is my sister's name? How can I tell that? said he, and seem'd to frown upon me; then, said I, do you know my brother's fore-man's name, or any of the journeymen? He said, he did not: this conversation was after we was past the alehouse, and I walking by him on foot. We came to a little town call'd Hays; then he pull'd out 3 gold rings, and said he was a goldsmith, and was going to receive 4000 l. and told me if I had only 1000 l. it would make me a man for ever. So it would, said I; then we was within a furlong or two of the Angel in Hay's parish; and he would have had me buy these rings; I said, I had no knowledge as to the value of them, nor money to pay for them; said he, one is a diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No, my lord, I did not; then he put his horse before me, and said, how much money have you got, saying, I want you to lend me 10.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend him 10 s?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No, my lord, I did not. Said he, I will have 10 s. of your money; I pull'd out my money, which was 14 s. and held it in my hand; he took 9 s. of it. and bid me keep the other 5; he let me go a little farther, then said, I will have the silver buckles you told me about, and do not make words; I pull'd them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174910110007"></xptr> out, and he brought his horse up to me and wretch'd them out of my hand, in spight of my note, they were bought for 18 s. I had, in our conversation, told him of these, which I was carrying down, they were shoe and knee buckles. Then he rode off to the sign of the Angel, and I ran after him as hard as I could; before he got in at the house, I saw the Gentleman take his horse, and put him into the stable: he went into the house, and I after him, thinking to secure him, but my heart failed me; the prisoner bid me sit down, which I did; I eat with him, more for fear than good will.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did your heart fail you?</p>
               <p>Rogers. I was fearful he had more of his gang in the house. The man of the house ask'd him what his name was, he said, his name was Jibson; said I, notwithstanding you have denied your name before, I know your name now: hush, hush, said he, then he pull'd out money, and paid for what he and I had eat and drank; then I went out, and went forward to a heath, there I sat down, considering what to do, whether to go forward or return. In about an hour the prisoner came riding along, I jump'd up and took hold of his bridle, saying, let me have my money and buckles again, that you robb'd me of; he made out of the road, and turned into a long-lane. I still held fast by the reins of the bridle; he pull'd out a cutlass from under his right-side, and cut me cross the head, and also my clothes very much ( he shewed the scar about an inch and a quarter long near his right ear) I believe I kept my hold for about 40 yards, the horse running hard, and trampling on me: he got from me, and left me bleeding on the ground; then I came back to the road; some people said, here is a man that has been fighting; there came a coach, and I told the people what had happened, and beg'd I might ride behind the coach to London, which they granted; then I related the affair to my brother. In the prisoner's and my conversation, he had told me he was going to Uxbridge; I went to the house he had mentioned, where I was told, he had laid there the night the fact was done, and that he pull'd out the silver buckles, and put them in his shoes and knee; there I was informed he died the Oxford-arms in Tyburn-old; I went there on the 18th of the same month, and saw him coming up the street; I step'd into the house, and told a man, who assisted in taking him. We took him before a justice, where he confest the two pair of buckles was mine, saying I gave them him to carry, which I never did, and likewise that I lent him the money: he had the buckles in his shoes and breeches knees, from whence he took them, and gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Questions from the Prisoner. Whether or no it was not the proposal of the prosecutor, to offer to lend me this money, while he was riding my horse, as I had told him I was short of money?</p>
               <p>Rogers. I did not offer to lend him my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he bid me take another shilling, the time he was giving me the 9 shillings?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not offer to pledge a gold-ring for the money ?</p>
               <p>Rogers. No, my lord, he did not; he wanted me to buy the rings, which was before he took the 9 shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether I did not pay 3 s. 3 d. for the prosecutor's beer and victuals at one house, and 15 d before?</p>
               <p>Rogers. My lord, he did pay for me, both before and after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prosecutor appoint to meet me, at the King's-arms at Uxbridge, to have his things again?</p>
               <p>Rogers. The prisoner did not appoint any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. My lord, it is strange the prosecutor should not apprehend me at the public house, and after that, should attempt it alone?</p>
               <p>Rogers. I thought I stood a better chance with the prisoner by myself, fearing he had companions in that house.</p>

He gave me the things in care, saying they were safer with me than with him, the money he lent me; I gave him his dinner, and told him I would give him his money again the same night, or next morning at Uxbridge with the buckles, and we parted good friends.

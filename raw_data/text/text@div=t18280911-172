            . I was in the service of John Orth Waldener, the Rising Sun public-house, on the 29th of July. The prisoner is a <rs id="t18280911-172-deflabel875" type="occupation">dustman</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. She was not the distance of a yard from me the whole time I was there. Witness. I was in the kitchen; he was there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour- the prisoner was below the whole time; there was another with him, who carried up the dust.</p>
               <p>The prisoner here pulled off his shoe, and threw it with great violence at the witness - it struck her on the arm - for which Contempt of Court he was ordered to be Confined Six Months.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner pass me about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's - he had something which appeared heavy under his smockfrock; I followed him, and saw him offer them for sale; I asked him where he had got them - he said he had them given to him by a servant girl; I found the place, and asked the servant if she had given them to him - she said No; her master had desired her to watch them while they were there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave me the pots to get a drop of beer she knows it is true.</p>

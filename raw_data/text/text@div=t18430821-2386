On the 13th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a brothel in Bluegate-fields—I found the prisoners in bed—the prosecutor saw them—he said, "That is the woman that stole my watch, and that is the man that was with her"—Hayward said, "Me, I know nothing about the watch"—Herron said, "Mind what you say, I will make you prove your words; I never was a pot-man in my life."</p>

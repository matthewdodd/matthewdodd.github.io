               <p>"I want to see if you can mend that box up, it has been broken by the sea-faring people, or somebody, and I want it mended up tidy, that it may not be laid to us;" it was very much broken - I know something was in it, because it rattled when I turned it about; it was three parts full; he came to me again in a few minutes, and said, "Can you make any thing of it?" I said, "No, I don't think I can, for the box is broken, and the bag is so rotten;" he said, "Very well, I suppose you can't, I am going to write an order for some bags;" he called me on deck soon after, and went to the ship-keeper; he wrote an order for some bags, and I went and got either two dozen, or one dozen - he said,"Take one of the bags, and take the things out of the box, and put them into the bag," which I did; they were paper parcels, about a foot long, three or four inches thick, and nearly square - I put them into the bag; he said,"Put them aside for the present, I will see about sending them out by and by;" he said, "This broken box, break it up smalier," which I did; there was a tin case inside, which was bent about very much - I broke the box into small pieces, and while so doing, one of the men, who was working near me, came and asked me what I was about - I said, "Breaking this box up; the foreman is there, you can ask him what it is for;" he was near enough to hear that - one of them called the man away to mind his own work; after breaking the box up, Rudolph came to me, took the box up, and threw it about the hold, some on one side and some on the other; the bag was put on one side, with some mats thrown over it - I then went to my work - the next morning Rudolph said to me,"Go up and tell Wilson and Bright to clear away off the fore-hatchway" - I did so, they were the only men at work there: they cleared off, and in the afternoon, Rudolph ordered the hatches off, as he said he wanted light; some time after they were off, he said, "Eager, you hail Wilson" - I said, "Who is Wilson?" he said,"The tall man" - I did so, and he said, "Hand that bag up to Wilson," which I did, and towards the evening, when they were going to shut up the ship, I said something to Bright, and saw the bag forward in the ship in a hole under some ropes, but I saw it through the ropes,</p>
               <p>Q. When you handed the bag up to Wilson, did you say any thing to him? A. I said the foreman ordered me to hand it up to him - I gave him no directions about it; next morning I went down into the hold, and Rudolph came to the hatchway and said, "What has become of the tin-case which was here yesterday?" I said, "I suppose it is forward where the box is;" he said, D - n it, I thought I saw something shine;" he then said,"Take and hand it up between decks" - I said, "Who too?" he said, "To Wilson" - soon after that I had an accident with my foot, and in the afternoon the gang went to work between decks - I said to Wilson, "What has become of that tin thing which was handed up this morning; he said, "I have put it under those coals, where he told me to put it;" in the evening, before I left work I went between decks, and Bright pointed the bag out to me - I examined it, and saw a shawl or scarf which I had put at the bottom of the bag: it was loose in the hold, and the papers in the bag were much broken - I saw some silks with handsome flowers on them in the papers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell how many parcels there were in the bag? A. I did not take any notice; the loose pieces were put into the bag, at the top; the paper parcels were quite in a different state to when I put them in the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you been employed much on board ships which come from the East Indies? A. Yes, for the last two or three summers- I have heard of packages being broken in the voyage; Rudolph was foreman of the gang, and it was his business to superintend the men; the ship was half empty when I went to work: the box was in the hold when I heard Rudolph last give any order about it - I do not know what was in the box of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know Wilson? A. Only by sight - I do not know whether he was an extra man that day - I never saw him before - Rudolph told him and Bright to clear the fore-hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a pulley used to get the things from between decks? A. Yes, afterwards; Wilson had been at work at the pulley.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You found the package broken when you were first called to it? A. Yes - I was to repair the bag, if I could have done it neatly, it would not have been noticed - as I could not, he told me to break it to pieces, and he threw it away himself about the hold.</p>

            . I am one of the East India Dock Company's labourers. On the 4th and 5th of April I was working between the decks of the Eliza with Wilson - Rudolph was generally below; I saw a tin cannister handed up from the hold - I was not near enough to see who handed it up - Wilson received it, and shoved it forward; nobody but me and him were between decks; about five minutes after I asked him what was in the tin-case, as I observed something yellow, which I thought was nankeen; and he said it was; I saw a bag come out of the forehold on Thursday; the ship-keeper called me below, just as the bag was coming up, and I went, Wilson was between decks, and he said to me, "Will you have one?" meaning a silk scarf; he mentioned some scarfs - I said I would not; I never saw the scarf; but he had told me, after he said it was nankeen, that they were silk scarfs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not Rudolph's business to give orders to the men? A. Yes; he was in trust of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310027"></xptr>the goods, and constantly on board, except at meal times; he took twenty minutes for breakfast and dinner. Mr. Lighterness used to overlook Rudolph - I did not see Rudolph on deck when the tin or the bag were handed up - I was between decks, and could not see; he was not there when Wilson asked if I would have a scarf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you an extra man? A. Yes - Wilson and I were both taken on together; there were seven or eight men in the hold; only I and Wilson were between decks: the other men were in the hold, but not within hearing - I acted under Rudolph's direction - I saw the mouth of the bag come up - I did not see the tin-case opened.</p>

            . I am a superintendant at the East India Dock - the ship Eliza lay there: all the property in the ships is under the cave of the Company - James Mahon is the captain - I superintend the delivery of the cargo, and employed the two prisoners amongst others; Rudolph was foreman. On the 6th of April I was directed not to suffer any men to go down to the ship; the constable and dock-master accompanied me on board - I saw the constable find a bag under the rigging in the forehold; it contained crape scarfs - I found the pieces of the wooden case in the hold and was present when the tin case was found among the coals, with some rigging over it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the bag and tin-case in their proper place? A. Certainly not - I produce the pieces of the wooden case, the tin-case, and bag; the port of London was the port of entry and discharge of the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. On what day did you find these things? A. On the Friday - I was on board every day - I do not remember Rudolph being seat to another vessel - I have occasionally sent him on business while I remained on board - I did not send him away on either of these days.</p>
               <p>Q. The very way to discover the robbery, was to leave the tin-case and things on board? A. That I cannot say; they could have been thrown overboard.</p>

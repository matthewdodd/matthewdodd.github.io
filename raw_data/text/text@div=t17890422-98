               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. It is not at all extraordinary for your man to take the loaves from the bake-house, and carry them into the compting-house? - Yes, quite so; there is a thoroughfare at the back part of the bake-house, which goes into the cow-yard; I have one customer there, he may go to the customers that way.</p>

               <p>Whether he was carrying them to the customers or not, you cannot say? - He had no business with that bread.</p>
               <p>This young man is of good family and connections? - I have heard of his friends within a day or two, but I know nothing of them.</p>

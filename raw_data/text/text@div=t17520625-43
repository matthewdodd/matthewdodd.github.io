She was discharged the next morning. The spoon was stopt, and advertised with three letters for the owner of it to come and describe it, &amp;c. I went and told the letters, and saw it; it was my property. (Produced in court and deposed to.) Also another spoon marked as that was which the prosecutor deposed to. They were both marked by his own brother.</p>
               <p>John Alison. I am servant to Mr. Johnson a pawnbroker at the corner of Russel Court. On the 29th of May the prisoner came and offered this spoon to pledge with me, I having took in things before of her at different times; I stopped it; soon after it was advertised the prosecutor came and owned it.</p>

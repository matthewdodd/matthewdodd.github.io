                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert William Spencer, and live in Castle-street, Bloomsbury. On Sunday, the 26th of Feb., I came home from church about ten minutes to eight o'clock in the evening—I found some people at the street door, and a policeman among them—I went into the house, and missed the articles stated—they were my husband's property, and were safe before I went out, at about half-past six—one of the things was in the box, the others in the closet—the coat was on the drawers in the back parlour—I have never seen them again.</p>

On Sunday night, the 26th of Feb., about seven o'clock, I was in Castle-street with William Flana<lb></lb>gan and Thomas Roland—I saw Newland at the top of Castle-street we went into a public-house with her, and had something to drink—when we came out we crossed over, and went to the corner of a street to a public-house near the prosecutor's house—Smith and another came from the prosecutor's house, ran across the road, down a little bye street, and called, "<hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>," meaning Newland—Newland went over, and Smith gave her a bundle—I could not see what things they were—I had seen him coming with it from the house—when she got the bundle, Smith tried on a coat in the street—it was too little for him—he got it from under his arm—he had brought it from the prosecutor's—they all ran away—I did not go after them—I went over to Mr. Spencer's—I found the street door wide open, and a little door inside the passage open too—I saw Mrs. Spencer come home from church—I gave information to a police<lb></lb>man, and went with him to a beer-shop in St. Giles's—the policeman showed Smith to me, and I told him I thought it was him—he said if I did not go out of the house, looking at him, he would punch my b----y head—I was not quite sure of him, not to swear to him—I am sure now, because I looked at his face so when he came out of the house—I can swear he is the man—he had on a white waistcoat and a Taglioni coat—I did not see him do any<lb></lb>thing at the police-office—I have not said that I did—I did not say any<lb></lb>thing about his changing a waistcoat there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehanded Newland on Sunday night, the 26th of Feb., in Church-street, St. Giles's—I told her what it was for—she said three men came to her in Castle-street, at the corner, and gave her the things, that she gave them to them again, and they went away—she said they were strangers to her—I asked her if <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Smith was one of them—she said, "Do you mean the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> that lives with <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> Roundhead?"—I said, "Yes"—she said no, he was not—I took her to the station—after the charge was entered, she said, "Why don't you go and ap<lb></lb>prehend the men?"—I said, "I would if I knew them—I do not know them" the male prisoner was not there then—the two prisoners both lived in one house at that time, No. 10, Church-street, St. Giles's—I went and searched both their rooms.</p>

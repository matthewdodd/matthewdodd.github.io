I had some unions of hers to tie up in the tool-house, which joins her building, and is surrounded by a brick wall and a shrubbery - there is no way of getting into it but by getting over the wall, or the shrubbery, or in at the gates - I tied up the onions, and placed them in an inner place inside the tool-house; I locked that place and the toolhouse safe on the night of the 5th of December, 1830 - I went to the tool-house the next morning, found the door shut, but not locked; but the key of that door I had left hanging up as usual, and it might have been opened - there was no marks of violence; I had the key of the inside place, where the onious were, in my pocket - I went in, and found the door of that place standing open; the lock was broken off, and banging by one nail - I went in, and found the door of that place standing open; the lock was broken off, and banging by one nail - I missed all the onions; I think there had been twenty-five or thirty strings of them - I told Mrs. Nash, and then got a warrant; I went to Mrs. Scate's house, which adjoins our premises, with an officer - the prisoner is her brother; we there found about a bushel and a half of onions loose, and found the strings of them under the stairs - I know they were my own tying, and have not the least doubt but that the onions had been fastened to these strings.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of December, 1830, I got up at half-past two o'clock, to look after my horses; I met the prisoner, with Perry, about a stone's throw from my house, about half a mile from Mrs. Nash's house - Perry had a sack on his shoulder, which had something in it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290034"></xptr>but found no money on her, but 1s. 6d. was on the floor, but I could not tell what - they were coming from Mrs. Nash's, and close against her premises, though some distance from her house; they were about a furlong from Scate's, on the high road.</p>

The female prisoner is not the person that lodged at No. 36, Crown-street, and a person in the landlady's room recognized another young woman. I might go into the house with another young woman, and am I to suffer for what is found in the room? I took a shirt up to the young woman who took the room, to make; the landlady saw it, and can't deny it; it was partly made. On the Friday evening I went up, and the young woman was not there; neither have I seen her since. I went on the Saturday evening, and she was not at home. I met this female in Crown-street, and asked her to go there with me, which she did; we came out again together, and the constables seized me. As soon as the landlady saw this young woman, she said, "You are the girl that we have got another young woman in trouble for. "I am quite a cripple; I had my left hand in my pocket, and do you think, if I had four counter<lb></lb>feit shillings in my possession, I could have passed them out of my hand, with three constables by me. Because I came out of that house, I am to be answerable for what is found in that room, although no one saw what part I came from. I might have come out of any other house, where there was stolen property. I do not see sufficient proof that we lived to<lb></lb>gether.

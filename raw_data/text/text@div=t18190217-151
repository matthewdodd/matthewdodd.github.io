               <p>Q. How came you up all night - A. I had been to see a friend, and could not get in after ten o'clock. I fell asleep in the tap-room, and do not know who robbed me. When I awoke I found Lynch at the bar, and demanded a search. He said it was not him that sat by my side, it was Dodd - Dodd was not there then - I gave Lynch in charge. My watch was safe before I went to sleep. I had waited at a coffee-house all night, being locked out.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I was in the taproom between nine and ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and saw the prosecutor leaning against the fire-place, fast asleep. The prisoner, Dodd, sat by his side, with his two hands rummaging about the waistband of Rowe's breeches Lynch was sitting at the end of the table, to prevent the people from seeing what Dodd was about; he was looking at him. As soon as I took notice of Dodd, he jumped up and left the room - Lynch jumped off the table immediately to follow him. I caught hold of him, as he was the last, and said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, my good fellow! you are not gone yet." He turned round quick, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what do you want with me? The landlord and myself awoke the prosecutor - he found his breeches cut, and missed his watch. Lynch said it was not him who cut off his fob, it was Dodd. Maidment came and took Lynch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I am certain Dodd is the man.</p>

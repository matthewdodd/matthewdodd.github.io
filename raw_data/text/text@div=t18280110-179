            . I am an officer. When the prisoner was brought to the watch-house I sent for her husband; he said she had pawned these things unknown to him; she said he did know of it, or something to that effect.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress, and Mrs. Brown took the tickets from my husband, and said she would take the money as we could give it her, and she promised to give me work, till I could pay her.</p>
               <p>MARY BROWN. About a week before the 13th of December, she did acknowledge she had done something wrong, and I made the agreement, that if she would do no more wrong, I would forgive her.</p>

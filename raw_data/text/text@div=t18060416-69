Yes, at Dalston, I overtook them there, I borrowed a horse of the groom and got up to them; I said to them, gentlemen I am an officer, I must see what you have got in these bags, they each dropped his bag, and the prisoner Munday struck me a blow on the mouth with his fist, I struck him with a cutlass that I had in my hand on his head, his hat came off, and they both ran, they were pursued by some witnesses that I have here; I found the bags contained two saddles, three bridles, a martingale, and harness for a chaise cart.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoners were stopped, did they give any account of themselves. - A. They did not, I took them back to Hackney and had them confined; I searched Landsdown and found nothing on him; this box he threw away, another witness will explain that.</p>

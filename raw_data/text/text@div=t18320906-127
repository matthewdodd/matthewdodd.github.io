            . I am the storehouse clerk. I saw the papers of halfpence which had been marked, put into the cupboard in the evening; the prisoner came at four o'clock in the morning, and had to clean out the counting-house in which the cupboard was - I unlocked the cupboard when he had cleaned out the counting-house, and missed one paper of copper; they had been marked from No. 1 to 28, and No. 24 was missing - I was present when he was searched, and that identical paper was found in his trousers pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You saw the prisoner about four o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; I am always there at the beginning of business - there was nobody but him employed that morning in the counting-house - when he came out, and shut the door, no one could go in but myself; there were, perhaps, fifty persons in the yard.</p>

             (Police-serjeant K 16.) I was sent for, and found this packet of copper in the prisoner's trousers pocket; I found in his jacket pocket this chisel, and on the cupboard door was a slight mark, which appeared as if done by this chisel - I opened the door with it very easily.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE. This is one of the papers I marked - it is No. 24.</p>

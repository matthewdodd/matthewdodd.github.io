               <p>JOHN FOX. I am sexton of St. Ann's church. I was at the church, and saw the prosecutor go by - the prisoners and another person attempted to pick his pocket; I told the beadle, and we followed them through the market- when they got half way down Newport-market Wiltshire took the handkerchief from the prosecutor, and threw it to the other, but he did not take it; it fell on his arm, and then on the ground - I took Wiltshire, and the beadle took Lewis.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you see them attempt the pocket first? A. At the church door; Wiltshire attempted it - I was eight or ten yards from them: I told the beadle, and we followed them - I am confident they attempted it; I did not take them - I did not know they were committing a felony: I told the beadle what I saw - he took up Lewis; he did not attempt to take Wiltshire - when I first saw them I did not know I had any business to take them; the other one escaped: Lewis was rather behind him, but he had his hand upon his shoulder, and the other one had a pipe in his mouth - they walked with the hand on the shoulder; I did not know Lewis before - he did not touch the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am the beadle. Fox spoke to me -I saw the three persons in company; I did not see any thing done till we got to Newport-street, when I saw Wiltshire draw the handkerchief from the prosecutor - he threw it to the other: it dropped on his arm, and then fell - I attempted to take Lewis, but he ran across; I sung out Stop thief! and he was stopped - the prosecutor turned, and took up the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time of day was this? A. Between one and two o'clock; I did not see Wiltshire attempt the prosecutor's pocket before this.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

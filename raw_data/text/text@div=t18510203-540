I transacted business with the prisoner—the acceptance to this bill it not my writing, or written by my authority—I knew nothing about it till after it became due—I never desired the prisoner to tell Mr. Lindridge that I could not pay my debt, and that he must draw a bill for it; I owed him under 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th Oct.—I cannot tell exactly how long it had been standing, I had been in the habit of paying every week until the prisoner fell off collecting—I several times asked him the reason he did not call, he gave me no answer—to my surprise there was a bill left at the Albion public-house, Albion-road—it was made payable there; it is a house I use sometimes—there was an item in the account which was disputed.</p>

            . I live in Bedfordbury. I was in the Strand, and saw the prisoner catch hold of the prosecutor's coat with his left hand, and lift it up, then put his right hand into the left hand pocket, two others who were with him, at that instant closed upon him, and sheltered him from view. They kept following the prosecutor until he got to Southampton-street. One of them had a large bludgeon. I crossed to the other side of the way, they turned up Southampton-street. I informed Mr. Illingworth his pocket had been picked, and pointed to the prisoner, the prosecutor's son secured him - the others walked back into the Stand. I am sure I saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's pocket.</p>

               <p>Which of them was it you knocked down? - Freeman, I saw the pistol taken from him, Greenwell was in the well also, he run away directly, and was taken soon after, Greenwell had a blue coat on; the other had a whitish coat on, they had both aprons on, we overtook them about a mile, I was sure when I overtook them, they were the two men, they stood by the side of the well.</p>
               <p>Were they laid down, or were they standing up? - Rather stooping down, it is just close by the path.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, council for the prisoner Freeman. What time was this when you was in the chaise, when you was attacked by somebody? - About nine, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish the colour of a man's coat at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you describe what kind of cloaths, either of them had at the dirt house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not there a person on horseback? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why could they not have got out of your way, so that you could not have overtaken them? - They could have got over the hedges, if they pleased.</p>
               <p>Was it not a dark night? - No, it was moon light, Freeman came on my side.</p>

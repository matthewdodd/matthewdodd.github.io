                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Scott Ray, of the Dolphin public-house, Wapping. On the 5th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was coming over Old Gravel-lane bridge—there was a ship coming into the docks at the time, which delayed my crossing—I saw the prisoner near me, and moved from him several times—he followed me in a minute or so—the last time I moved, I went some distance from him—he came again, and I asked what he wanted so close to me, did he know me—he said, he did not want any thing of me—I said, "I think you are a young pickpocket," and gave him a bard slap of the face, and told him to get farther from me, for I had got no pockets, nor yet holes for him to pick—on looking round, I found I had got a hole in the side of my gown—Mary Sergeant spoke to me, and said I had got a very large pocket hole—the seam of my gown was unpicked, it was not injured—a gentleman brought the prisoner back, and a policeman took him—I saw him searched, and two shillings and three sixpences were found on him—one of the six-pences, in particular, I had remarked in the morning—it was what I call a <hi rend="italic">duberous</hi> one—I bit it, thinking it was a bad one—I could not tell to a shilling or two what I had in my pocket, but I had between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can swear to the sixpence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

I was on Old Gravel-lane bridge, and saw the prisoner go up to the prosecutrix three or four times—she tried to get rid of him, but wherever she went he followed her—I pointed out to Mrs. Ray the hole that had been made in her gown.</p>

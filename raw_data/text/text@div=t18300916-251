could he but find her he would kill her; when my mother awoke I told her what I had heard - she said something to me, and groans directly came into her throat, and she immediately died; she only said one word, which was asking me if my father said it loud - she had not been in liquor at all on Saturday, not before she died; she did not at any time lift her hand against the prisoner, to strike him - she died at three o'clock, exactly.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that your mother's name was Ellen or Eleanor? A. Eleanor; when any body used to call her Ellen she would say her name was Eleanor.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How came you to tell me her name was Ellen? A. I thought you asked me whether her name was Robinson - she used always to say her name was Eleanor; I have been ill since last March - the prisoner provided for us all; he worked at the West Indiadocks - he had only 12s. in his tobacco-box; there had been no liquor in the room that day - my mother was in her own room all day, cleaning up; it might be between seven and eight, or nine o'clock when she went out - I do not know where she went; she was gone about half an hour each time - it was on Sunday that she told his son not to look at him, &amp;c.: he got up, and said, "What is that you say?" she made him no answer, but went down, and he after her - Ralph and Lachmere came down directly they heard her scream; we had only a few beef bones boiling for broth, for dinner on Sunday - she had nothing else, no beer of any kind, nor spirits; she had no supper - she walked out both times on Saturday, but when she came in she complained of her breast - she got up as usual on Sunday.</p>

            . I keep the house in which the deceased lived; it is in the parish of All Saints, Poplar - the prisoner came home on the Saturday, between five and six o'clock; I was down in the kitchen, and heard words between them, but could not distinguish what passed; I looked up stairs and heard the deceased say,"Three shillings of this is owing for rent, and what am I to do with the remainder?" the prisoner said, "Give it me, I know what to do with it;" she said "No, it is owing elsewhere, it is not yours;" I looked up to the room, saw her coming out of their room door, and the prisoner struck her - I ran up stairs, and asked her to come down; he struck her on the left side of the head with his double fist; that was the first blow I saw - I was at the foot of the stairs, and could not see whether it was violent; I ran to her assistance, and saw it swell directly; she said to him, "Oh! you rogue; Oh! you villian, here is an eye you have given me;" she then gave me half a crown, went into her own room, and shut the door - I had some conversation with her about the half-crown, and am sure she knew perfectly well what she was doing - I went into my own apartment, and had not been long down stairs before words occurred between them again, and she came down to me - the prisoner came after her, and struck her two or three times; I screamed murder - I was so terrified - I cannot say where he struck her, but it appeared to me about her head, for I stood between them to part them, as well as I could - she and I both screamed Murder! they appeared to be violent blows - he appeared in great anger - I did not notice that he said any thing; Mrs. Lachmere, came down - she took hold of the prisoner, and asked if he knew what he was about - upon that he struck her over her shoulder - it struck his wife, and knocked her down; Mrs. Lachmere fell with her - she fell against the kitchen-table, and upset it; he then kicked his wife as she lay on the ground<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160110"></xptr>- he kicked her on the stomach, between the two breasts; that was done purposely, for I saw him look at her, lift his foot, and kick her with violence; Mr. Lachmere came down and persuaded him to go up to his own room - he went up with him - he said the quarrel had been about money - I heard him call Mr. Lachmere into his own room, and say, "Look her Lash., I have got half a sovereign, but that is owing elsewhere;" I heard no more that night - the deceased had not been into my room all Saturday, till this happened - I had seen her pass on the stairs - she had no appearance of being in liquor - she appeared in good health; I did not see or hear the prisoner again till between one and two o'clock on Sunday afternoon, when I was taking up my dinner; I heard words again, and the deceased ran down to my room, screaming violently; McCarthy followed her into the room - he struck her with his double fist; it appeared to me to be on the head or shoulder - I screamed for my husband, who came down directly - Mr. and Mrs. Lachmere came down after him - my husband took him by the collar, pulled him out of our room, and he challenged my husband to go to fight - he appeared in liquour; the poor woman afterwards got down some rags - I gave her two chairs to sit or in the empty kitchen, and there she died - I got up at half-past five o'clock; a medical gentleman was sent for, and examined her.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Mr. Natorff do any thing to her? A. Yes, he bled her - not above two drops came from her; he then had hot water put to her feet, and then he said she was dead - he was not present at the opening of her body.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he not examine the whole of her person? A. he turned her round and examined her.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and a native of France. I was called in at a quarter past six o'clock on Monday morning, and found the deceased's thorax and abdomen warm - I opened a vein, and got, I suppose, half an ounce of blood; I at first did not suppose life was extinct, but put her feet into warm water, and found she was dead - I examined her minutely outside, but was not present when the body was opened: I detected no appearance of bruises whatever - I could discern no cause of death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Finding her still warm, life could not have been extinct long? A. No, but it is impossible to say how long; it might have been half an hour - I examined the chest between the breasts; there was no bruise of any kind to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a violent kick to have been given between the breasts about noon, do not you think there must be some external mark? A. There would be a rupture of some small vessels, and an extravasation of blood, which would make its appearance at some time, but when, no medical man could tell - if the vessels are deep-seated the appearance would not be so quick; if she had been beat on the temple and swelling followed, there would have been some appearance of it - my examination did not lead me to form the least idea that she had died from personal violence: I have said, that to my judgment she died of apoplexy - I asked the beadle if I should open the body; he said he had a medical man of his own - it is usual when two medical men see a body, for both to be present at the opening.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you? A. A surgeon; I keep an apothecary's shop at Limehouse, about ten minutes walk from where the woman died - I never saw her before.</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am surgeon of Poplar parish for this year; the beadle requested I would go immediately and examine the deceased - he pointed the body out to me, laying on a bed-tick; several people were there - I observed a few slight contusions on the anterior part of the head, a little on one side, I think on the right, and about the fourth rib was another contusion; I cannot say on which said - I did not think it would be material, as I did not conceive any external appearance could be of any consequence; I examined the abdomen externally, and on the lower part of it was a discoloration on each side a little below the navel - perhaps a little more to the right than the left; I then opened the head, the dura mater was in a perfect uninflamed healthy state - the next two membraues were also uninflamed and healthy; the lobes of the cerebrum, both anterior and posterior, were perfectly healthy- it was the most healthy brain I ever saw; I found a slight degree of inflammation in the lungs commencing, but not sufficient, in my opinion, to cause death - I then examined the abdomen, and on laying bare the intestines, I found, a little below the smaller portion of the last intestine, which covers the ilium, in the highest degree of inflammatian, and a considerable quantity of serum and some portion of coagulum lymph in the cavity of the abdomen, which was the consequence of the inflammation - the uterus was also inflamed; these are the principal appearances I observed - I have every reason to conclude that the immediate cause of death was the inflammation of the intestines; the other causes had nothing whatever to do with the death, neither the signs about the head nor the inflammation of the lungs - I had frequently seen the woman before, having attended her child on the parish ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160111"></xptr>count; she was Mrs. McCarthy, and lived in Sophia-street, when I attended her - I never saw the prisoner till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the appearances of inflammation, to which you ascribe her death, have been occasioned by a blow or kick in the stomach within twenty-four hours? A. There is no doubt of it; violence occasions inflammation, and there was every mark of inflammation and the result of violence - if it had been internal inflammation the appearance would have been very different; it was external inflammation - the Coroner and Jury viewed the body as I examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your opinion is, that the inflammation of the ilium was the cause of her death? A. Certainly, that and no other - that intestine passes backwards and forwards in the lower part of the abdomen; it is principally below the navel; the jejunum begins where the ilium ends, but there is no fixed point of division, it is arbitrary - they are separated by an imaginary line.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not the upper part of the ilium called the jejunum? A. Decidedly not; the intestine is five times the length of the body - the next intestine to the jejunum is the duodenum, that is the upper one of all next the stomach; that was in a perfectly healthy state, and was full.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, would not a kick given between the breasts rather have inflamed the duodenum and jejunum than the ilium? A. But I observed no kick between the breasts that could not have produced the inflammation; if I had found the ilium as I did, and had not heard of what had happened, I should say it arose from external injury received in some way or other - I could come to no other conclusion; I dissected with care to ascertain if there was any hernia.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the same appearances of inflammation have arisen from other causes than violence? A. You make me something beyond human to decide what may be, but from the appearance of the body, I judge it arose from external violence; I examined the body between eleven and twelve o'clock - I was told by a person, whom I had never seen before that, some one had attempted to bleed her some hours after death - but I proceeded to examine the body as surgeon of the parish; the marks on the abdomen were sufficiently plain to see there had been contusions - they were only slight, but the woman dying so early, the appearances would not be so plain as they might be a few days after - they would not be quite so visible at six o'clock; nobody was present but my pupil.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you informed of the name or address of any medical man who had been there? A. Not at all - if I had I should not have objected to his being present at the opening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You confine the cause of death to the inflammation of the ilium? A. Decidedly so; blows, where the contusion was, might have caused the injury on that part - it corresponded with the commencing part of it, but spread both lower and higher; it was certainly connected with the contusion below the navel.</p>
               <p>Q. Would inflammation of that sort produce sudden death? A. That depends on the constitution; inflammation increases much quicker with some than others; the appearances I saw might have arisen in four or six hours; inflammatory action proceeds at times very rapidly; dissolution from inflammation is generally sudden; I should have thought she must have felt considerable pain in the abdomen for some hours - death from inflammation sometimes takes place previous to mortification.</p>

            . I saw the deceased after her death, but did not examine her till after Mr. Natorff was gone - I then saw a bruise on her forehead, on her left temple, and a bruise on her left side, between the left breast and hip, and an impression on the hip - this was the moment Mr. Natorff left - when he came he did not know she was dead; there was no other dead body in the house - I was not there when Mr. Tatham saw it.</p>

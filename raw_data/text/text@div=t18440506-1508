                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">general-dealer, Exmouth-street, Spa-fields.</hi> On the 2nd of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, a man named Bur<lb></lb>gess came to me—in consequence of something he said to me, I went that same evening to the Archers, and saw the two prisoners there—Burgess intro<lb></lb>duced me to them, and said that they had got a gun to dispose of, and part of another—Burgess said, "I have brought him "—after waiting a short time, Culling said, "Come along"—I, Burgess, and the two prisoners went to<lb></lb>gether to Parker-street, Drury-lane—Culling said his mother was out, and went next door but one to fetch the key—while he was gone I walked to the door, and saw him bring down a key-bugle—he fetched the key, and took me into the room, and there he showed me part of the gun—Lawson was then out<lb></lb>side the door—I do not think he saw the gun shows to me—I saw enough of the gun, and said that would do—Culling shut it up, locked the door, and we came away to the Archers, to see the other gun—when we got there, we stood in front of the bar, and then Culling and I went into the tap-room—Lawson came in with Burgess—we were all four in the tap-room together—I was waiting some time, and said I was in a hurry, I must go—Culling said to the pot-boy, "Go and get a light"—he got a light, and as I was going out of the room, I saw what I supposed was the gun-case, wrapped in a bit of green baize, just as it came out of a cellar-flap in the floor—it was taken up stairs, and the two prisoners, Burgess and J, went up stairs to the back-room, where the pot-boy took the case and gun—the pot-boy went out<lb></lb>side the door, and the two prisoners, Burgess and I, were in the room—I saw the gun and the case on the table—I undid the case, looked at the gun, and put it together—I said it was a good gun—the prisoners both concurred with me, and said it was a good gun—I made a bargain with Burgess that I was to meet him the next morning, and pay 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Who am I to pay the money to?"—both the prisoners said, "Me, me "—Burgess was to have the difference of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and ten guineas—the next day I met the parties—I had in the mean time communicated with the police—I saw all the property the next day, in the same room that I had seen it in the night before, at the public-house—the two prisoners, and Burgess and I were present—it was about ten in the morning—Burgess and the prisoners went and brought this gun and case under their arm, and took it into that room—the other gun was there—I said, "Well, I am to pay you 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, is that right?"—Burgess said, "Yes, pay it to them "—they said, "Yes;" just at that time the po<lb></lb>licemen came in—Archer took hold of Lawson, and Burgess and Barton took hold of Culling—he immediately twisted round, and jumped out at the back window—Lawson, after some struggling, rushed by me on the stairs, knocked down a policeman, and rushed out of the front door—I have no doubt about the prisoners being the persons I saw.</p>

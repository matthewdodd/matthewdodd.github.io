            . The prisoner worked eighteen months with me, during which time I have lost silver to a considerable amount. In consequence of the apprehending of the last prisoner, and discovering the duplicates, it induced me to go to Armstrong's, a pawnbroker, in Baldwin's-gardens. I went there on Friday, the 17th of March, about half-past one o'clock, which was the day after Beckley was apprehended. While I was there the prisoner came in to redeem four silver figures. I was giving a description of him to Armstrong at the time he came in. Mr. Armstrong said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man!" and seized him. He seemed confused at the sight of me, and begged he might have some water or something, for he was near fainting. We took him to the public-house opposite Hatton-garden office; I there asked him where he got the things from which were in pledge at Armstrong's? and asked him if he had not taken my silver to manufacture them? I made no proposition to him whatever. He said, Yes, he had. I said I was afraid a great many more were concerned. After that he begged I would be merciful, and said all the things were made of my silver.</p>

             re-examined. I have lost upwards of 300 ounces of plate within the last twelve months. The goods were not before him when he made the confession. I described the articles to him which I had found at the pawnbrokers' - he said they were made out of my silver. His confession was not confined to the goods found at Armstrong's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in business for myself three years, and bought the goods. Four of the snuffboxes were made for me by Mr. Angel's men in their over-hours. Everybody knew I was in business - his men have been to my house, seen me at work, and have issued cards. The prosecutor is greatly mistaken in the property he has selected from my stock - he has selected me for prosecution from suspicion only. The silver mug was given to me by my master, Mr. Socket, of Camberwell, when I was out of my apprenticeship. I was going into partnership with him, but he died while it was in agitation. I commenced being journeyman in April, 1818. The prosecutor had no reason to suspect my honesty, but as soon as he found out that I was in business for myself he suspected I must have robbed him. I went to Armstrong's on business, and met the prosecutor there, who gave me in charge. I do assure your Lordship I am entirely innocent. The same chaser worked for me as for the prosecutor. I have bought 173 oz. of silver within the last three years.</p>

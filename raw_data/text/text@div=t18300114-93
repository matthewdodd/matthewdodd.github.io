               <p>JOSEPH SADLER THOMAS. I am a superintendent of the Police. On the day before the robbery I was with the commissioners of the Police, when Breavington came and showed me a letter which came from the prisoner - I directed him to make the appointment; he met me on the following morning - we went to the premises, and according to the signal he tapped at the window; I saw him stoop down and receive something, but I could not see what; he came to me, and I asked what he had got; he said he did not know - he gave it me, and I took it to the officer; it was these fourteen silver spoons; I then went to Dr. Robertson's and knocked: the prisoner came to the door, and I spoke to Dr. Robertson - the articles in his parlour were all in confusion.</p>

               <p>DEAR FRIEND - I wish much to see you on particular Saturday morning, precisely seven o'clock, not exceed quarter past. I have a parcel I wish you to fetch. Take greatest care of, and put it under lock and key when you reach home. I will give you a shilling, Whatever you do, do not disappoint. I have something in view I think will be a great advantage to you; can say nothing till Sunday evening, when I hope to come for an hour or two. Excuse me, last Sunday I was an hour behind time. I shall have my kitchen window open, which faces the front of the street, because there if one side goes up Charles-street. Do not knock, I will look out for you. I wish you could make it convenient to go up west end between this and Sunday, to ascertain if that person has left, if you find he has, ask for the cook, and make all inquiries you can when he went, and further add, his wife sent you, then you will be able to judge for me. I must see him, but do not tell her so. Pray go if you can, and I will pay you. Also the parcel belongs to him, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140055"></xptr>am in fear he will find me out, for his brother see me cleaning the door-way yesterday. I am determined he shall not have it.</p>
               <p>S.B.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GEORGE BREAVINGTON. I am a labourer. I have known the prisoner seven or eight months - I received this letter, which I believe came from her; I gave information to Thomas, and he took the measures he has stated - I received the parcel containing these spoons from the prisoner at the kitchen window, in Long-acre; I gave the letter to Mr. Thomas.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness persuaded me to do it on the Sunday evening, when I called at his house.</p>

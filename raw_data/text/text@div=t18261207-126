About seven o'clock in the evening of the 31st of October, I heard a noise on our area steps; the gate was open all day - I ran to the area door with a light, and just caught sight of a man at the top of the steps - I turned my head to the cellar-door, and missed some clothes from a basket; I gave an alarm, and pursued him to the top of Queen-square; I saw the bundle under his coat - I did not see him drop it - the prisoner was taken in about five minutes; he has the same appearance as the man - I took the property up - I said at the office that I could not swear to his person; but he answers in size and dress to the person I saw at the area.</p>

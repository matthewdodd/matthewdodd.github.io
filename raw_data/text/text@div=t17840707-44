What opportunity had you of observing his face before he was taken? - I knew him again directly, I had no opportunity of seeing his face before, but I know he was the same man, I saw his face when he turned round, I could not be off seeing his face, he turned round and looked at me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070074"></xptr> full in my face, and I observed his face, and I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>What became of the bundle of things? - I picked them up myself excepting one apron, I gave them to the officer that took him, they have been in his possession ever since.</p>

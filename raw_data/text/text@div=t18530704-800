                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector</hi>). On Saturday, 4th June, in consequence of information, I went to No. 14, Newton-street, Holborn, accompanied by Maskall and another officer—I went to the back room on the third floor, it was about a quarter past 6 o'clock in the evening—I found the two prisoners in the room, and another man—on my entering the room, Newton stood up, and picked from off the hob some pieces of plaster of Paris mould, and dashed them into the fire—I said I belonged to the police, and I seized hold of him—a part of the mould was scattered from the fire on the floor, and he commenced trampling upon them—I seized him, and he resisted violently—I pulled him from the fireplace, and pushed him back against the window, and his head came against the frame; I then put him into the hands of Sergeant Maskall—while I was engaged with Newton, I saw Price throw something on the fire—I saw two shillings distinctly, and they melted—another shilling went into the crucible—I saw her throw more than two shillings out of her hand—one of them went into this crucible, and I got it off before it was quite melted—this is the crucible, with part of the shilling in it—I also took from the fireplace these moulds for casting 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces—one mould is whole, and there are several other pieces of moulds—they were in the fire, near where a pipkin was—some of these pieces I found on the floor, which I prevented Newton from destroying—these are moulds for casting 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., pieces, and here is a mould for making shillings—on the table near the fire was this jar, and in it I found thirty-nine counterfeit shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in a little box on the mantelshelf there were four counterfeit sixpences, and fourteen fourpenny counterfeit pieces—the fourpenny pieces are finished—the shillings are not finished—some of the sixpences are finished—on the table I found this file with white metal in its teeth—on the window cill I found a galvanic battery, wire, and plate; also a jar, and a jar containing acid solution, a portion of which I have got—I went to the cupboard, and in it I found this piece of glass, which is used for making plaster of Paris moulds, bearing on it marks of plaster of Paris, and some sand, which is also used—I forgot to mention that in the jar which was on the table there was, I believe, seventeen sixpences,</p>

I accompanied the last witness to the house where the seizure took place—when I entered I saw Newton take the moulds from the hob, and dash them into the fire—he was immediately seized by Brannan—he resisted very violently—some portion of the moulds remained in the fire, and some flew out on the floor, and Newton commenced trampling on them as soon as ever they were on the floor—Brannan seized him, it was all the act of a moment—I assisted in removing him to the other side of the room; he was there given into custody—I searched him on the spot; in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found three paper parcels containing counterfeit coin—one parcel contained ten shillings, the next five shillings, and the other twenty counterfeit sixpences—they appeared to be in a finished state, and were wrapped up separately—in his right hand waistcoat pocket I found a good half crown—he was then taken to the station house.</p>

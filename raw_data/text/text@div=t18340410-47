            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Wirgman. On the 25th of March, I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock - I fastened the doors myself, and the windows - every thing was carefully fastened - Mr. Wirgman was in bed half an hour before me - I was alarmed in the night by his screaming, "Murder," and knocking at my door with all his force - I ran to unlock the door, which was bolted underneath; and I found I could not let myself out, not remembering that I had bolted it - I then flew to the window, threw it up, and screamed, "Murder" - while I was looking out of the window, one man ran out, in a dark coat - he jumped over the gate in front of the house, and ran away to the right; and then a man in a white jacket followed him, and jumped on the rails, and rather to the wall - I know both the prisoners - Leppard is the one in the white jacket - the police caught him before he got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100033"></xptr>over - Smith's father had been employed to remove the goods into the house, and he himself had moved one load - when the policeman took Leppard, I said, "That is him; stop him: that is one of them" - I never lost sight of him - the policeman sprung his rattle, and another policeman brought up Smith directly afterwards - the policeman came into the house, and burst open my door - we went down stairs, and found the things produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What height is the wall they got over? A. He got over the rails, and from the rails on to the wall - the wall is about eight feet high - I never lost sight of Leppard - I could not distinguish his features - I saw the policeman catch him getting off the wall - he was off the wall when I saw him taken - the wall did not conceal him, because I was considerably higher than it, and could see over - I was very near them - I ran into master's bed-room, and missed his gold watch off the mantel-piece, and the silver spoon out of the kitchen.</p>

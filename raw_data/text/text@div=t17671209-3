On Thursday was se'nnight, as I was returning to my lodgings, I heard a girl singing at the Ship and Star in East Smithfield; I thought there might be some of my ship-mates there; this was between four and five in the afternoon; I called for a pint of slip; the girl at the bar came and sat by the side of me; then there came in an oyster woman, and we had some oysters; then she said, come, my dear, will you go with me to my room in the <placeName id="t17671209-3-crimeloc15">Back-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see her take your watch?</p>
               <p>Drout. I did; there was a little bit of a shutter to the window, so that there was light came into the room; I catched hold of her gown, and tore a piece off, but she got away; there were six guineas, and an eighteen shilling piece in the purse; I went in search of her, and she was taken about twelve o'clock that night; I never found my watch nor money since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Drout. I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house her room is in?</p>
               <p>Drout. It is the house of Thomas Linger; I have been there two or three times since.</p>

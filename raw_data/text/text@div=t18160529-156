I am sure I had the money and my watch when I went into the room with Hunt; the other girl left me. Sheffington came into the room while I was there with Hunt. Soon after Hunt went out, and did not return; she gave me no reason to suppose she was going to leave me. After she was gone, I missed my property. I immediately went after her; I heard a noise in the next house; several people talking. I went into the street, and to the next door; and heard some person say, you have made a fine booty. The persons were on the stairs. I went up stairs; I was accosted by

            ; she asked me where I was coming to, and what I wanted. I told her there was a person in her house who had robbed me. She said, no person had come in there, and told me to go about my business. I told her I would not go without my property. I called the watch, and we went up stairs and found the prisoner Hunt under the bed, and a gentleman in the room. I accused her of robbing me, and she denied it, or that she had ever seen me before. I told her, she need not say that; but if she would not give me my property, I would charge her with the watch. She then told me not to make a noise, for my property was on the stairs. I found my pocket book on the stairs, with a five pound note missing from it. I then insisted on leaving the other note; and she said, if I would give her a three shilling piece, she would give it me. I gave her the three shilling piece, and she pulled the note out of her bosom. At first, I forgot my watch; I had left it on the table in the room into which I had been with Hunt at first. I left it there, and when I went back, it was gone.</p>

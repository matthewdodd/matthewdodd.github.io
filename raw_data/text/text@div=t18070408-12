            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are carman to Mr. Brickwood. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner <rs id="t18070408-12-deflabel67" type="occupation">foreman</rs>

               <p>Q. On the 12th of January did he give you any order. - A. It was on a Monday; I cannot say as to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he was taken up. - A. I believe it was nine or ten days before he was taken up. He gave me an order to draw ten quarters of beans to Mr. Keeps; in consequence of that order I put them into sacks into Mr. Brickwood's storehouse; then we loaded them in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks were there. - A. Twenty sacks. I drew them to the <placeName id="t18070408-12-crimeloc68">New Cut windmill, Blackfriar's-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is that the paper that the prisoner gave you. - A. I believe he folded it up; I put it in my pocket, I never looked at it, I gave it to Mr. Keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the beans to Mr. Keep. - A. Yes, I left the beans and the sacks there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money. - A. I had the shooting money, a shilling.</p>

            . Q. What are you, sir. A. I am a <rs id="t18070408-12-viclabel69" type="occupation">cornfactor and corn-merchant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18070408-12-victim140 t18070408-12-viclabel69"></join> living at Broken wharf; the prisoner was my foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of January last you had a considerable quantity of beans in your granary. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had made this discovery, did you endeavour to ascertain what quantity was deficient. - A. I did; the whole of my deficiency I cannot speak to; I am certain of above forty quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a quarter. - A. Forty shillings a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner and Keep were examined at the office. - A. I was. I can swear that this was the paper that was given by Keep himself to the magistrate; I have no doubt of its being the prisoner's hand-writing; I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Q. When the corn is delivered out of your granary, is it usual to give written bills. - A. I have met with instances where there have not been any printed bills ready at hand; but the foreman never fills up notes. They are filled up by the clerk or myself. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the business of the prisoner as your foreman, to send out any corn without your knowledge, or the clerk's. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever he sends out any corn, is it the custom to make any entry in the book. - A. It is his duty to enter it in the delivery book; the clerk usually fills up the notes, and enters it in another book, and that is a check to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any entry on the 12th of January, of beans sent to Mr. Keep, New Cut windmill. - A. There is no such entry in the whole book; I never knew any thing of him till after the discovery of this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you are able to ascertain any loss of your sacks. - A. Not particularly; I saw nine sacks produced at the office with my name on them; there were twenty brought, in which the beans went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Have you any partners. - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to state to my friend, that these bills of sale are usually printed. - A. The tickets that are sent by the carman are usually printed</p>

               <p>Q. And sometimes I understand that they are not. - A. There may have been twice in seven years, if the clerk had not any bills at hand, that he has wrote them. I had but one clerk then, and he was at the Corn-exchange with me; it was impossible for him to have wrote it, and every foreman is positively ordered not to deliver any goods without an order from me or the clerk.</p>

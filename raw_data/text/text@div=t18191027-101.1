Last Thursday fortnight, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if Clark had brought a parcel for Mr. Dickens. Clark is coachman of the Blucher coach. I looked among the parcels, and told him there was none. My mistress said it was in the till, and I gave it to him from the till. I saw him at Worship-street office on the Wednesday following, and am certain he is the person.</p>

             and Co. bankers, Cornhill. On the morning of the robbery I paid the prisoner 70 l. in exchange for one 10 l., five 5 l., seventeen 2 l., and one 1 l. Luton notes. I am sure he is the person, because he presented the parcel of notes. I counted them, and asked him the amount - he said 65 l. I counted them a second time, and made them 70 l. again. I asked him where he brought them from? I think he said from a person in St. John-street. I said I made them 70 l., and gave them to him to count; he said again he made them only 65 l. I handed them over to my fellow-cashier, he made them 70 l., and I paid him. This fixed my attention to him, and I am certain he is the man. He was dressed like an hostler.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday last I apprehended the prisoner at Cheltenham, in the street; he knew me directly, and called me by my name. I took him into the Crown, public-house, and told him I came from town to apprehend him, for that parcel. I asked him to give me what notes he had got - he gave me eight 1 l. Bank notes from his pocket, a silver watch, and a gold key. He said a chap of the name of Handsome Billy had taken him to Oxford, and robbed him of 34 l.; that the watch was bought with part of the money, and as soon as I got to town I should pull Handsome Billy, for he was with him when he got the parcel. I asked him what he had done with the 20 l. bill, he said he had thrown it away, I know Handsome Billy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not make me intoxicated before I said any thing - A. No, he was quite sober, we gave him nothing till afterwards. I only gave him a glass of rum as he got on the coach to come to town.</p>

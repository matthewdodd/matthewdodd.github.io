On the 10th of October, at twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I looked at my watch in Long-lane, and am certain it was safe; I was walking behind the prisoners, who were strangers to me - a drover was passing, and struck Newman on the arm: she exclaimed that he had made her arm bleed, and that she had been bled that day - Walker turned round to me and said, "Did you take hold of that woman's arm?" I said, "I did not;" she looked me full in the face - I walked up Long-lane, and as I crossed Smithfield Walker laid hold of my arm, which I did not wish; I have a wife and children - I shook her off me, and turned up King-street; I turned up <placeName id="t18311020-74-crimeloc389">Salisbury Arms-yard</placeName>

I said Yes; she said, "What do you know of me?" I said,"No good;" she called out Joe! I saw several men; I ran, called a watchman, and told him to come, for I had a prisoner at the bottom of the yard - two watchmen assisted in taking her; she declared she had been at home for a week before, and was never out till that night - I have not a doubt of her; she was in the same dress exactly when I took her.</p>

            . I am a watchman, of West-street. I know the prisoners; I had seen them both before, but not together. About a quarter to nine o'clock I stood at the end of Salisbury-yard, and heard a scuffle - I looked round, and saw Walker running down the steps as fast as she could run; I am sure of her - I knew her before, and a few minutes after, Young came down stairs and asked me which way the woman had gone; I did not see Walker again that evening - Young said, "Stop, watchman, let us take her pal," and he gave Newman in charge; he said he should have secured Walker, but Newman had held his jacket - I was present next day when Walker was taken in West-street.</p>
               <p>Newman. Q. Did you see me standing listening to what was going on? A. No; the transaction was in the yard, before I came to the steps - directly I saw her, Young gave her in charge.</p>

I said, "No, I was not out last night;" he said he could swear to me by my blue gown, black bonnet, and red handkerchief, with yellow spots - here is the handkerchief I had on; he owned to the Alderman that he let me go the first time.</p>
               <p>Newman's Defence. I never spoke to the man; I was standing in the street, fainting away - the prosecutor stood at the corner of the street - he ran after some woman; he knocked against my bad arm - I laid hold of his coat, and said, "What are you about?" he ran on, and having lost sight of the woman, turned round and said, "Watchman, take this woman, she will do as well; we will keep her till we find the other;" as I went to the Compter he said,"Tell me where the other woman lives, and I will let you go" - I said I did not know her, or I would soon tell; I never saw Walker till she was at the office.</p>

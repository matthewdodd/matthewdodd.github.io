                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Roehampton, in the parish of Putney, in Surrey. On the 19th of April the prisoner came to my house about twelve o'clock in the day, and remained till about half-past four o'clock, and paid for it about five o'clock—he used to work at Squire Gordon's as a labourer, and then he used my house—he had not been to my house since he left "Squire Gordon's which was about Christmas time—I had nine sovereigns and a half-sovereign in gold, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, in different coins, in a box in my bed-room—the gold was in a bag and the silver loose in the box—the box was locked, but the key left in the lock—I had been to it about five o'clock that evening—there was then eleven sovereigns in it—the prisoner at that time was in the top-room—I brought two sovereigns down into the tap-room, and took them into the parlour—I had them in my hand in the tap-room, but I cannot say whether any body could see them—I took them to a man in the parlour, who give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and half-a-sovereign in change for them—he was a hawker, and was in the habit of giving me change—I immediately took it up-stairs, laid the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the corner of the box, and put the half-sovereign into the bag, where I had nine sovereigns—there was no silver in the box believe that—about nine o'clock that night I went up-stairs to my bed-room and mis<lb></lb>sed the money—the prisoner had gone out about seven o'clock—I saw him go out of the tap-room into the street, and meet Richard Sawyer in the street—all my money was gone except one sixpence at the corner of the box—I found the key in the lock of the box, but the box-lid was open—the box was standing on the floor—there were some notes, my watch, and different things in it—none of those were gone—the money was not marked—the stair-case fronts the street as you come in at the door—a person coming in from the street could go right up-stairs—there are about eighteen stairs—there is a stair-case on the top of the first stairs, before you get to the room—the prisoner was sometimes at work for three or four months together, at Mr. Gordon's, at other times he was off work for a few weeks—while he was at work he used to come to my house to breakfast and dinner—he was never up-stairs to my knowledge—he was taken about ten o'clock that right, and I saw eight sovereigns and a half in gold, 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, taken from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 19th of April I apprehended the prisoner, between ten and half-past ten o'clock, on the prosecutor's charge, in a hay-loft, over the stable belonging to Mr. Royal, of Rochamp<lb></lb>ton—it is a public-house, and is between two and three hundred yards from the prosecutor's—I searched him, and found on him eight sovereigns, one half-sovereign, one half-crown, 17 shillings and nine sixpence in silver—they were in his left-hand jacker pocket—all in one pocket, the gold, silver and half-pence—I made him no threat or promise—he questioned me, to know where I was going to take him—I told him on suspicious of robbing Mr. Boyton's bed-room of nine sovereigns and some silver, and I was going to take him to the station-house at Wandsworth—he replied, "Take me where you like: do what you like with me, and send me out of this b—country, for I shall do no good in it"—I found on him a key, a knife and part of a comb.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you know where to find him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By inquiry—I had no difficulty in finding him in the loft—he was locked up in the stable, and covered up in the third stall, but I found him in the loft over the stable—he had moved—he was drunk and al seep when I found him—he did not say he had taken that place for his bed for the night—while I was taking him to Wandsworth, he said the money was him own, and he had saved it by his industry.</p>
               <p>

            . My husband is a Policeman. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house - I found in her stays this duplicate of a silver watch, pawned for 1l. - it was in some wadding.</p>
               <p>JOHN DOUGLAS. I am a Policeman. On the evening of the 26th I had information of a watch being stolen, and saw the prisoner crossing the road with some money in her hand; I said to her, "Corbyn, where did you get that money?" she said, "What is that to you?" I said, "There is something wrong about a watch;" she said so help her God! it was a long time since she had seen a watch, she wished she had; I found on her seven half-crowns, one shilling, and 10d. - I said, "Where did you get this money? you have not had any thing lately;" she said, "What is that to you?" I searched her, but found nothing more - she then said it was the change of a sovereign which a man gave her for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I tell you I was going to give<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050051"></xptr>the money to the man that owned it? A. No; you said,"If hat is that to you? come and have some gin," and when we got into the house, Hill said, "That is the woman that took the watch."</p>

I was in this public-house, it is the White Hart; I saw the prisoner take the watch from Parish's pooket as he laid on the table, rather dosing - she went out of doors with it; I told the officer that was the woman - I told the prosecutor of it, because another woman was blamed for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave it me out of his hand, and he would have said so, but for his wife. Witness. No, she certainly took it.</p>

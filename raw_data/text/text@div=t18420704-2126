                  </hi>. I am matron of the General Penitentiary, Mill<lb></lb>bank—the prisoner was there under sentence, 'and was discharged on the interference of the Governors in 1841—some employ was procured for her and she left it, having something the matter with her hand—she went to the hospital, and then we took her back to the Penitentiary as under cook. On the 2nd of June, in consequence of missing something, I told her I had lost something, and must search her drawers—I searched them, and found some towels wrapped up in a sleeve of her own night-gown—found two pillow cases, one had the mark picked out, but the stain of the letter still showed the mark—it was the property of the Penitentiary—found an apron and a towel, the towels belong to me, and the apron the Penitentiary—I have a letter I have received from her since she has been in custody—I know it is her handwriting.</p>

               <p>Q. With what did he give it you?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I believe it was with his fist; I saw no weapon that he had; there was somebody coming with a lanthorn, then he made off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. Yes, I have seen him many times before; he was a neighbour; he lived but about a mile from me, and worked with Mr. Stanley, a blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him at the time he used you thus?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I did; and he knew me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. No, never in my life,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call you by your name?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. No, he did not; but he must know me; after he made off, I went to the surgeon's and got my wounds dressed, and then went home to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What family have you got?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I am a widow, and have five children; the next morning I went and had the prisoner taken; he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober that night?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I cannot tell; I had seen him at a public-house, where I had called with my oysters, but had no thought of his coming after me; I had not been gone from that public-house above half an hour when he attacked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if he had been sober, he would have made such an attempt upon you?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. He bears a very bad character in the neighbourhood, and if he had not perceived the light coming, I do think he would have killed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might he ask you for your money?</p>
               <p>A. Parker. I believe he asked me twenty times.</p>

On last Sunday week, a quarter after eleven at night I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, at the top of Skinner-street, two women came one of one side and one at the other and carried me into <placeName id="t18110529-45-crimeloc256">Skinner-street</placeName>

I never let the handkerchief go, I called out watch, they dragged me down the middle of the street, and before the watchman came the prisoner told the other woman to run away. The prisoner took my handkerchief and the other my two dollars.</p>

As I was coming home that gentleman followed me, he tore my shawl almost in two, he said I have been robbed by two women, I will swear you are one, when I came to a watchman I gave charge of him, they took me to the Compter instead of taking my charge they took his.

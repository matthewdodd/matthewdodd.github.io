            . I am a servant to Mr. Laycock, he is a cow keeper and farmer. On the 10th of last month, about two in the morning, I and my fellow servant met the prisoner in a field called Eleven Acre, belonging to Mr. Laycock, in a field where there were sheep. We have lost a great many sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Broad's - A. About a quarter of a mile; I was about thirty yards from him, I called out who is there; he said a gentleman; I said gentle or simple, I shall see who you are; I said where are you going, my friend; he said to Hornsey; I said that is not the way to Hornsey, he said he had lost his way: I said it is very odd you should come into this field among the sheep. There was no foot path in the field, only a dirty way where our carts were kept. He said he wanted to go by Ball's pond to miss the watchmen. I took him in custody and took him to Mr. Laycock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the road near the field - A. Yes, within a field. He begged us not to take him to Mr. Laycock, he said he would give us a guinea, or twenty pound, sooner than we should take him to the watchhouse, or to Mr. Laycock's, he said he was a very troublesome severe man, he said if he had known that we should have taken him he would have given us a run for it; I told him if he went nigh a hedge, we should have sent something in him that he was not aware of.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he from the hedge at the time you stopped him - A. Twenty five yards from the ditch, and three or four yards from a pond. I found the lead by the cart track.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you found the lead - A. It was day light when we found the lead; it was some pipe lead and some ridge lead; Mr. Broad saw the lead. We found some lead in a bag.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Broad to put up this lead spout on the the 2nd or 3rd of December. On Saturday the 10th the lead had been taken away; on Sunday morning following I went to the house; I saw it was gone on the 11th; I saw it at the magistrates; I put it up myself, I made it myself; it is the same lead.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it worth - A. Ten or twelve shillings.</p>

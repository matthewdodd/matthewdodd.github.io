                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Presland, and keep a shoemaker's shop at Stratford, in the parish of West Ham; My husband is very is, and has been so for some time. On Friday morning, the 10th of Jan., I was called down stairs by my son a little after seven o'clock in the morning—I found the show-room door open—the staple had been wrenched off—the door of the show-room opens into the passage, another door opens into the shop, and another into the sitting-room—a bureau that was standing in the show-room was broken open, and from it I missed from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, more than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and a check on Smith and Co. for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I also missed a great coat of my husband's, and a great coat of my son's—I went to the next room and found all the cupboards open—they were without locks—from them I missed nineteen silver spoons and a table-cloth—an old pair of spectacles, which laid on the table when I went to bed, were also gone, and many little things—on returning into the show-room I missed from twenty to thirty pairs of ladies' boots from ft glass-case—there was a pair of old kid gloves in my husband's coat pocket—I had put them in myself—I went to the back of the premises and found the parties had got in by boring a large hole with a centre-bit in the back door leading into the yard, big enough for my son to get through—the yard is surrounded by a paling—after getting in at the back door, they would be enabled to reach the other part of the premises, but not without wrenching the staple off—they could get into the other room because the key was in the door—I and my son saw the house safe over night at nearly eleven o'clock—the back door was then safe with two bolts and a chain, and there was no hole.</p>

I received information of this robbery on the morning of the 10th of Jan., and went towards the Whitechapel-road to look after the persons I supposed had committed it—when I got to near the London-hospital I saw two men from Stratford—I knew they were persons that came from Stratford—I had seen them at Stratford the day before—in fact I see them almost every day'—they separated, one came towards Whitechapel, and the other went down Eastmount-terrace—they were not the prisoners—about twelve o'clock hat day I saw the prisoners at the back of the London-hospital, opposite the British Oak—I knew them before—they did live in Stratford—Macey</p>

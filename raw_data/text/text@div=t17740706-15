My room is up three pair of stairs. Mr. de Costa brought six boxes up to me the night before, the 18th of May, and asked me if I wanted them; I bid him put them in a drawer in the bureau. Upon his cross examination he said the robbery was committed on the 19th of May, that some of the things were brought home the 26th of April, that he saw them on the 15th of May, and that Allies was taken, and the watch found upon him the 13th of June.</p>

            . I have known Mince about a twelve-month: I go a washing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his buying any shirts?</p>
               <p>Warren. I know of his wife buying three or four in Rag Fair, old ones; I believe I should know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it she bought them?</p>
               <p>Warren. About three or four weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. It is common for poor people to buy second hand linen there I believe?</p>
               <p>Warren. Yes. (A shirt shewn her). This is one of the shirts, but there is another got two pieces on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this shirt is one?</p>
               <p>Warren. Because the wristbands are newer than the shirt; she took off the wristbands that were very bad, and put those new wristbands on.</p>
               <p>Court. Are the wristbands the same cloth as the shirt?</p>
               <p>Warren. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shirt was wristbanded in October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray be a little certain about the time it was bought.</p>
               <p>Warren. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it was my linen, and in the state it was in when in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife put the wristbands on?</p>
               <p>Warren. No; I saw her making the wristbands to put on one of the shirts; I cannot be positive it is this shirt.</p>
               <p>- Curmelian. I am a watch-case maker: I know Mince.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he was on the 19th of May last?</p>
               <p>Curmelian. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ernest. Are you sure you saw both the prisoners at the door?</p>
               <p>Ernest. It is hard to swear to persons; I did not stop to look at them.</p>

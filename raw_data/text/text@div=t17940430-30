I was on the same floor, only the passage parted the two apartments. When I came to my own door, I saw the man run out of the front door of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What door was it you locked? - My own apartment on the ground floor, that was the only door that I locked; there were other lodgers in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you miss? - Not any thing, every thing was there, they were put on the bed they had been taken out of the drawers, a silk handkerchief, three linen sheets, one gown, two waistcoats, one petticoat, two child's frocks, one child's petticoat, a woman's shift, and a pair of flannel drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these articles left when you went out of your apartment? - In one and the same drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your apartment broke open, or how? - I cannot say that the lock was injured at all. I am very sure I left it locked, and there was no appearance of violence to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an upper or lower drawer? - It was the top but one, not the top, but the next to it.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Queen's-square. On this 19th of April I was just coming home, (I live in the same street,) it was about a quarter before five, between four and five, and I heard a noise of stop thief! I stopped, and I saw the prisoner at the bar run by, he ran from a house, No. 3, and these two witnesses, the prosecutrix and the other, following him, then I ran out as hard as I could run after him, and he turned into Poultney-court, a short court in Little Windmill-street, there is a throughfare in that court, but there is some posts goes across, and that is how I catched him, because he could not pass the post so quick.</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure that the prisoner was the man that these two women were in pursuit of? - Yes, I am very certain it is the same man, I apprehended him; and he says, what do you lay hold of me, for? I told him I would tell him soon what I laid hold of him for, and I took him back to Mrs. Sedgeworth's room, and found the door open, and seeing this property, which I have got here, laying on the bed in one heap, one upon another, then I saw the other sheet spread on a chair, close by the other things, then I took and bundled it all up together, and have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentlewoman took the property from the constable; I had the privilege of going for a soldier, but having the venereal disease, they would not take me, till I was cured; I was taken away for two days.</p>

               <p>Creedland. I did give them back to the woman for a short time, for about an hour or so, and she gave me the same articles back again.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sedgeworth. These things are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming past this woman's house, and I had got about twenty yards from the door, and they cried out stop thief! I walked about fifty yards, and then three curriers took hold of me, and they took me back to the woman's place; I was going after a place where I had been to work.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 20th of August, and told him it was on suspicion of robbing his master of a 10l. note and some sovereigns; he said he was willing to go with me; I said I must search him - he said "Well, you may search me, I have some money about me;" I found six sovereigns and 13s. on his person, and in his box in a room at Mrs. Ginard's, I found two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns screwed up in this paper; he said there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in it, and that he had taken half a sovereign from it from that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find on him any of the articles he had purchased? A. Yes; I asked where he bought them - he said he had them from his aunt; I asked where she lived, he refused to tell me; when he got to the station-house, he said a woman had purchased them for him, and before the Magistrate he said he had bought them at a shop in Middle-row, Holborn (this was not taken down) I went to several shops there, but could find no person who had sold them; I afterwards found out Harris.</p>

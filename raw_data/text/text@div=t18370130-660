                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Marshall, and live in the parish of Woolwich. The prisoner is my son—on the 16th of January he said to me, "Give me my discharge, and I will go up to London."I un<lb></lb>locked the box and gave him his discharge from it (he has been in the Artillery)—I had eleven sovereigns in the box—he said, "I want the other things"—I said to him, "Tom, you have nothing else here," and with that he swung my things out and took the eleven sovereigns—I strove to hinder him, but I could not—I would have locked the box again, but he kept the key in his mouth—he went to the door and flung the key on the floor, and said, "I have got what I want," and went out—I saw him again three das after—he opened the door and came in, but did not speak, or if he did I did not hear him—he went to the cupboard—I said, "Tom, what do you want?"—he said he wanted the spoons—I asked him if he had brought me any of the money back—he said, no, he never had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it—I had put to spoons away, and he sat down—I was all of a shaking and trembling—somebody went out and fetched a constable, and I gave charge of him—I am sure I had had eleven sovereigns in the box—they were in a little purse—I had seen them safe a day or two before, and had had the key in my pos<lb></lb>session—I saw him take them—he was scrambling about—I cannot say I saw him take them, but I will swear be got them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. I went after the prisoner, and found him at his father's house, on Thursday evening, the 19th—I asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had spent part of it—I asked him where the other part was—he said he did not know exactly, but he said it was not in money—I asked him what it was in—he said clothes, which he had given to a woman he had been with to do what the pleased with—I asked her name—he said, "Mary," and afterwards said it was Jane—I asked where she lodged—he said, "At Mrs. Mucklow's"—I went to Mrs. Mucklow, and she told me what she has now said—the prisoner said afterwards that the money was of no use to him, and he gave it to the girl to go and purchase clothes, because she was not dressed fine enough, and he got rid of it as fast as he could—I have some clothes here which the girl bought, and here is a gold ring which he bought—I have a bag here which the mother swears to—he was sober, and in his senses.</p>

               <p>Q. How come you to suppose this young woman, your servant, had got them? - I supposed it by missing a pair of tea-tongs. I immediately thought that my servant had made free with the other things; I went and searched the very next day, which I believe was the 19th of June, and the very first place I went to one Mr. Fordyce's, Shadwell Dock, where I found several pair of shoes; he is a pawnbroker. I found some more articles at Mrs. Crouch's, Ratcliff Highway, to the best of my knowledge; they were childrens shoes; a pair of red-morocco shoes, wrapped up in a South-sea handkerchief, belonging to me; they were left at the pawnbroker's.</p>

            Is that one of the eight? - No; I put it among this other parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any of the pawnbrokers know of these duplicates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are the duplicates of some of the things that have been produced? Are they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was two days with my prosecutor when he began to make attempts to seduce me, and repeated it so often that it was with great difficulty I could do my business. I told his wife of it, and she told me to keep my distance, and he gave me these things to seduce me, but finding he could not, he had me apprehended as a thief. No sooner was I taken than he went to my father, in hopes of making property of me, told him that, as he was a constable, his daughter had been robbing in the Back-lane, and now was the time to save her; but he could not leave his work in time before I was committed. The prosecutor told me last Wednesday, that he would throw the bill out if I could give him a note of hand for value received, and actually went to buy a stamp for that purpose.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever give her any of these things? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, you hear the reason that she has assigned, is it true or false? - It is entirely an invention. The father came to me, and begged of me to accept of half-a-guinea to make a slaw in the indictment. I immediately told him that I should forseit my recognizance if I did any such thing; I told him I could not do it, but I humbly ask for mercy for the prisoner if you can but grant it; I do not come here maliciously to prosecute her, my noble Lord, but I humbly beg, if there is mercy to shew, shew it to the prisoner at the bar.</p>

On the 20th of March, about ten o'clock at night, I went into the yard and heard some tiles rattle, supposing something wrong, I went to Hanbury's and gave information: one of their watchman came with me; I stood on the steps of a public-house nearly opposite, and saw two men on the house; one of whom was on his knees - I went afterwards to the door of the house, and saw two men rush out with speed, I followed, crying Stop thief! Johnson knocked down one, which was Boon, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long was this after you heard the tiles rattle? A. An hour or more, perhaps; I could not identify the men on the tiles - several officers were there when they rushed out; the gates were open when he came out; others had gone in, but they belonged to the brewhouse.</p>

            . I am one of Messrs. Hanbury's watchmen: Young fetched me; I went with him, and waited about a quarter of an hour: after some time I saw three persons on the roof; I went to to the brewhouse and returned with Shakspear and Johnson, and found Almond and Smith there; I heard the officers call, "Stop them at the door, they have run out;" I saw two men running out, Shakspear took one, but could not hold both - the house belongs to Sampson Hanbury and Co.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see them come out of the door? A. Not exactly out of the door, but I saw them run from the persons who were found the door.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch. I heard an alarm, and went with Smith to the door; they are folding doors; one seemed open, but was tied with a string; I broke the string, and went in; I then went up a step-ladder, and heard several men escape down through a hole in the partition; I called out "Stop them at the door"(Shakespear afterwards brought Robinson to the watch-house.) I went on the roof, and found two sides of the lead turned up from the gutter, and cut across, in two pieces; some wall-hooks, which fastened it, had been drawn out of the wall. I found no tools there; here is the lead - it was rolled up, and cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search Robinson? A. Yes; I found nothing on him. The lead was quite severed from the roof.</p>

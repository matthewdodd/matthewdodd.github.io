                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Morris, of No.7, Osborn-street, Westminster, he is a bedstead-maker. In August last my son was in Cold-bath-fields prison—the prisoner came to the house, on the 17th of August, and said he wanted to see Mr. or Mrs. Morris—I went down and asked him to walk up stairs, which he did—he said he was turnkey of the solitary cells in that prison-that my son was in a solitary cell, and unless out alive—and if we could send him some provision it would be of great use to him—my husband was going out to get some provision, but the prisoner said, "Not provision, but in money"—and my husband laid him down a shilling on the table, which he took up—he did not any say my son had sent him—he said he had come unknown to my son—my husband gave him the shilling, meaning it for my son—he came again on the 20th of August, he said he had bought provision, and had given it to my son, and he had made it last three times, we gave him another shilling—he said he was a turnkey and messenger—and it was under the belief that he was so, and that my son was in a solitary cell, that we gave him the money—he came again on the 24th, and said he had bought some meat, and his wife had given him some potatoes, and my son would he out on Satur<lb></lb>day—we gave him another shilling then—he came again on the Thursday and said I must send my son clean shirt, and he would be out on Satur<lb></lb>day—but he was out of custody then.</p>

               <p>Yes, and you said my son was starving, and if he did not have more pro<lb></lb>vision he would perish; you said, you should be turned out of your situa<lb></lb>tion if it was known you came, as you was a turnkey.</p>

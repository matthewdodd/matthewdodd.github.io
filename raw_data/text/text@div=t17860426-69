My servant had left some of my clothes in the passage, the door being left open to clean it, about nine they were gone; they were removed, I believe, by the servant; I generally take the key of the street-door up with me; but it was on the Saturday morning, and the girl was to clean the passage out, and I left it below; my clothes are frequently put there by the servant for the purpose of brushing them, but she had imprudently left the street-door open; the things I saw at eight disappeared before nine. I made some enquiry in the neighbourhood, and I found from a hackney coachman; I saw all the things at Bow-street on Monday, except the papers; a woman was in custody.</p>

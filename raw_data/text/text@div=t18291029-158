On the 23rd of October, between four and five o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up the area steps; I suspected all was not right, and went after him - as he was walking up Wimpole-street I overtook him, and asked what he had got - he said, "Take it;" and gave me this tea-pot, which belongs to Mr. Hamer - he then ran from me, and through several streets to Oxford-street; he went into a house and I lost sight of him - an officer came up and I went home - this was on Friday, and I saw the prisoner again on the Sunday: I am quite sure he is the man; I recollect his face perfectly - I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe he was quite a stranger to you? A. Yes; I was in my own room adjoining the pantry, his side was towards me; I went to the top of the area steps and saw him walking - I then got my hat and went after him; he had got as far as the corner of Little Wimpole-street - when I got the tea-pot he ran away; there were people in the street - I went into the house he went into, but could not find him; a good many people went in with me - he was walking when he gave me the tea-pot.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman, and live at No. 17, Moor-street, Bryanstone-square. I know the prisoner, and was with him yesterday week, from three o'clock in the afternoon till five - we first went and had a pot of ale at the Pitt's Head, Cumberland-street, Bryanstone-square; we smoked a pipe, and might stop for an hour - we then went to a public-house in the New-road, Edgware-road, took a little drop of gin, and I think we left at half-past four o'clock or nearly five.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are a hackney-coachman? A. Yes, and have been so about twelve years - I drive No. 19; I had been that day to Essex-street to get entered, which makes me so positive of the day; I have known the prisoner three or four years, but we were not particularly intimate -I have drank with him - I do not know how he gets his living; I never heard that he was in trouble two years ago; we have not drank very often - I rather think I paid that day for what was drank; I am a night coachman - I believe him to be very honest, and never knew him to be charged with felony - if he had said so himself in Court I would not believe it.</p>

            . My husband is a tailor, and lives in the cottages at the bottom of the Harrow-road. The prisoner came to our cottage yesterday week, about five minutes before five, or it might be ten minutes - he was rather intoxicated; I sent my daughter for his wife, and she came a few minutes after - the prisoner staid about half an hour, and I went home with him to his own cottage, some little distance below mine - he lodged with me about six months from March last.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Wimpole-street? A. No; these cottages are at the bottom of the wharf, near the Grand Junction Canal - the streets are not named; I know a Wimpole-street, Marylebone - I should think it is about two miles off; I do not often see the prisoner - I do not minute the time when he comes to see me, but my children were coming from school, and I told them to come home before five, as I had some things to send home to the Elm Tree-road - the prisoner left me about eight or nine weeks ago - it may be eleven weeks; I know his wife - I understood he was a painter by trade; I never heard any thing against him - if he had asserted in this Court that he had been tried and convicted I would not believe it; I think I saw him on the Thursday - I see him almost every day; I believe I had seen him on the Wednesday - I do not think I saw him on the Monday or the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>ANN ROGERS. My husband is a journeyman carpenter - we live at No. 5, Earl-street, Lisson-grove.

I had no particular reason - I have seen him a great many times; my husband does not know him - I do not know much of him; I never changed ten words with him - I remember the time because I was ironing a dress that was to go home at five o'clock; I have seen the prisoner with a brown great coat, and I think he had it on then - I never heard any thing against him; Mrs. Hanner told me to come here - I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

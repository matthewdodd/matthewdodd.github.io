            . I live in Well-street, Mile-end New-town; I am employed by Mr. Abbott to look after his houses. I repaired this gutter for the tenant, who left about three months ago; I received some information, and went to the house - I found the lead of the gutter had been taken up, and cut into three pieces, and one piece, seven foot long and one foot wide, was gone - one man could have carried it - we saw two persons on the top of the roof - James Smith was found up the chimney, and Joseph Smith between the fence and the privy - he said he had done no harm; I said if that was the case, he should not be detained; but I had seen them both on the gutter and called to them - I went up the ladder, and missed the lead - he said he knew nothing about it; there was a large piece of lead rolled up in the gutter, and a knife was found.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMITH'S Defence. I had done work - I was passing by the house, and saw a great many people in the parlour - I went in and was left there.</p>

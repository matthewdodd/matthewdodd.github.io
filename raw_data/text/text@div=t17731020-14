On the 29th of last month, about half an hour after two in the morning, I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200016"></xptr> the prisoner in my shop; it is at Hampton Court, just under the Park Wall. When I put the key in the door, the prisoner threw down the window and attempted to run out; Mr. Fray and I took him immediately; he had got in at the window and shut himself in, and was packing the things up; it was a very fine moon light morning. I missed the three pair of shoes and boots, and found them about five in the morning hid by the Park Gate. When I charged him with breaking the window open, he said he went in there to ease himself.</p>

               <p>I had been on guard that night, and got in company with a woman that lies about with the soldiers; we had a pint of beer; I went with her to the corner of the place where the shop is; there we parted, and as I stood by the place the men came and found the place broke open, and laid hold of me as I was easing myself under the wall. I am as innocent as the child unborn; I never saw the shoes and boots before.</p>

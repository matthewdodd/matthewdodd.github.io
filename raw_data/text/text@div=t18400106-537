                  </hi>I live in Roupell-street, Lambeth.

                  </hi>I am shopman to Mr. Folkard, a pawnbroker, in Lambeth Walk. I produce a gown pawned by Carroll on Friday evening the 27th, and a necklace early on Saturday morning by Blizzer, in the name of Barrett—I am certain of him, though he was differently dressed afterwards—I cannot swear to him positively—I have no doubt of him—Carroll also pawned a book—both that and the gown were in the name of Jennings.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I apprehended Carroll on the evening of the 28th—the prosecutor claimed the apron and shawl she had on—I found on her a snuff-box, and the duplicate of a prayer book—I ap<lb></lb>prehended Blizzer about a quarter to nine o'clock the same evening, at the Queen's Head public-house, about one hundred yards from the other public<lb></lb>house—I charged him with stealing a necklace and beads from Carroll—he said, "I have no beads"—I said, "The beads you pawned at Mr. Folkard's this morning"—he said, "So help my G—I had none, nor did I pledge</p>

On the Friday when Carroll left her place, I was at the Jolly Gardeners public-house—she came in, sat down along side of me, and drank with me—he asked if I would accept of that knife—she gave it to me, and afterwards took a snuff-box out containing a coral neck<lb></lb>lace and said, "I will make you a present of this for your wife's little girl"—I said, "Where did you get it? "—she said it was her own, and she had bought and paid for it—she asked where I was going—I said towards home—she wanted to go that way, and came with me—I went home, and the went elsewhere—next morning I was at the Queen's Head public-house—I took the necklace out of my pocket—several women there wanted to buy it of me—a shoemaker said, "I will go and pledge it for you"—he did take it, and pawned it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and brought me the duplicate—at night I was taken for stealing from Carroll—the pawnbroker said I was the per<lb></lb>son who pawned the necklace, but before the Magistrate he did not know whether I was the person or not.</p>

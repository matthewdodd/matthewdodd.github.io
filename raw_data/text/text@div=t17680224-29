            . I saw the two prisoners before me almost all the way from Temple-bar: the prosecutor was going along Cheapside with a book under his arm; I saw the two prisoners make several attempts at his pocket; when they were just beyond the Mansion-house, I saw Johnson put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and cross over into Lombard-street, and into an alley that goes into Cornhill; then I stepped up to the gentleman, and said, I believed he had been robbed; he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief; I said I believed the chaps that did it are gone up this alley, we followed them; then we ran up Cheapside beyond Bow Church, then we turned back just beyond King-street, they passed us; I said, these are they; I took hold of one, and he the other; I bid him take care of his hands; I had not spoke half a minute before a young man called out, but I saw the handkerchief fall from Shepherd under a coach wheel, which went over it; it was taken up, and owned by the prosecutor; we took them both to the Compter.</p>

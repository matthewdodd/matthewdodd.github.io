               <p>ALEXANDER BETSON. On the 23rd of July, I went to the West-end. I then took an omnibus, and went to the Tower - I then met Burnett, who asked me to go with her - it was then between nine and ten o'clock - I went with her to her own lodging - she asked me to give her some gin - I gave her a shilling, and she sent Finn for some - she gave me some in a tea-cup - I then went to bed, and felt sick - I had then a sovereign, two half-crowns, one shilling, and two sixpences - I felt it all safe just before I met this girl - after I felt sick, I went to sleep, and between one and two o'clock in the morning, the two male prisoners came and roused me up, and told me that was their bed - I said a young woman brought me there, and said it was her room - they said she had often done that when they were at sea - I then got up, and looked for my trowsers, which I had put under my head - they were gone, and I told the men I had been robbed - Ferguson found my trowsers at the foot of the bed - he heaved them at me - I went to where the rest of my clothes were, and my hat, handkerchief, and waistcoat, were gone - Ferguson then gave me an old hat, and told me to take that, and be d-d, and to be thankful to get a hat of any sort - I told them I would call the first policeman I found - Ferguson then led me into the court - when he saw a policeman he ran away - the officer came to me - I told him I had been robbed of my money and these articles - I went with him to the room at No.9, where I had been - it was then empty - the officers told me to stop there, and they went to No. 2, and found the two men and Burnett in one bed, and the other girl asleep in a chair - they called me to know if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040108"></xptr>these were the men - I knew them, and they took them - I found my black silk handkerchief in the bed.</p>
               <p>Burnett. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where did you see Burnett? A. On Tower-hill - I went with her about five minutes' walk - I had nothing but a little beer all day - I counted my money just before I met her - I had only been five days up from Scotland - I missed my money when the two men aroused me, and my trowsers were not where I left them - Burnett might have left me before the men came - I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock.</p>

I went home with the prosecutor - he was drinking with several more - he was very much in liquor when I first met him, and more when I left him, about eleven o'clock - I had no room of my own - I went to this young man's room to stop the night, as the prosecutor wanted to go at four o'clock in the morning.</p>

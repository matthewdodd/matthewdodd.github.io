            . I am constable of Enfield. I searched the prisoner's house at Enfield-highway, on Friday, the 6th of November - it is about half a mile from the prosecutrix's; I found two bags, with some walnuts and nuts in them, and eight fowls, three cooked, and five not cooked - these are the bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she swear to the cooked ones? A. No, to those with feathers - they were common.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they so common that a person who fed them would not know them? A. A person used to them might know them.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLES. These two bags are mine - one was in the stable, and the other in the wash-house.</p>

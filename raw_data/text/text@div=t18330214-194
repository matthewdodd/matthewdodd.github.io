               <p>JAMES MULLENIS. I am a Policeman. On the 8th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in <placeName id="t18330214-194-crimeloc1085">Mile-end-road, in Beaumont-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by DOANE. Q. Why not take them before? A. I could not, I was on the other side; I could see all that took place - I did not see them cut the glass; I had been there about five minutes.</p>

            . I am eleven years old; I was at home on this night - my father was not at home - a young man was in the yard, but I was the only person in the room. A few minutes before Mullenis came, I heard the noise like glass falling; we had one pane cracked, but none of the glass was out of it - I saw nothing until Mullenis came; there were cigars in the window - Mullenis brought the prisoner with him; the prisoner then had the cigars in his pocket.</p>

            . I rent the house; I am a hair-dresser. I had about sixteen dozen cigars in the window; one of the squares of glass was cracked, and puttied up - the glass was all in; I was out when this happened - next day I found the piece of glass was taken quite away; I did not look at it before then - a person could put their hand in through the hole, and reach the cigars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the window been cracked? A. More than six months; the putty was very dry, which would make it hold tighter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false.</p>

Oddy said, Murwell was obliged to to sell them, because he was going into the country; on the 29th of January they brought these three saws; I was not at home, they came and left them, and came the next day, and asked me what I would give for them; I took them into a back parlor, and looked at them, and saw the letter A upon them; I asked the prisoner his name; he said, it was Murwell; he said, he worked for Mrs. Allen in the Borough; I said, they told me the stock and bits were all they could get of a bad debt from Cleavely, and if they did not give me a satisfactory answer from Mrs. Allen, I would stop them; they went away, and came again on the 31st, and brought this letter; (producing it.) I told them that was not satisfactory, and that I had written to Mrs. Allen; after that, I met Oddy, and took him into custody; the other prisoner was taken the same evening.</p>

               <p>JOHN TURNER. I live at Worthing, and when in London. I lodge in the Kent-road. On the night of the 18th of December I was in a street, in a line with <placeName id="t18330103-147-crimeloc848">Shoreditch</placeName>

Brighton note - I know they had been safe a few minutes before the prisoner came up to me; I found a Policeman coming after me, and went with him to the station; I saw the prisoner and two others - I pointed out the prisoner, as the one who was most conspicuous in accosting me, and importuning me; I saw a 5l. Brighton note in a mutilated state - the one I had was not so; I was not sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could not swear I was the female, because you were surrounded by two or three? A. I said I could not swear you robbed me, but you were the one who made yourself most troublesome, and you accosted me first.</p>

             (Police-constable H 91). I was on duty in Shoreditch, early in the morning of the 19th of December; I saw the prisoner in company with the prosecutor - she was the only female with him at that time; she then left him: I saw her tearing a bit of paper, and throwing it away - she put her hand to her mouth; I followed her, she then ran: I pursued - when I came up with her, she produced three sovereigns, and begged me to take them and keep them, and say nothing about the robbery; I took the three sovereigns to the station, and left her in custody - I then went down the street, to where I had seen her throw something away, and found these two pieces of a 5l. Brighton note; one piece is lost - I then took the prosecutor to the station; he recognized her as one of the parties who had been about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the prosecutor very much in liquor - he was surrounded by two or three females; I saw the piece of paper at his feet: I took it up, and took the sovereigns out of it - I cannot read, and I threw the paper away; when the officer took me, I said I had three sovereigns, which I had just picked up.</p>

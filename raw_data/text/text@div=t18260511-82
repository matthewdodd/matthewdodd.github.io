In consequence of information I got an officer from Marlborough-street, and went to the stable, where I found Ward; I said "William, I have something serious against you" - he said,"Me, Sir; me, Sir?" I said, "You have been robbing me"- he said, "Yes, of a few tacks." The officer then said,"Do you mean to deny the rings;" he paused a moment, and then said, "A few rings." I then went to a marine-store shop, in Peter-street; we saw a man there; I searched the shop, and found a quantity of glue and some other things, which I believed were mine, but being out of the papers I could not swear to them; I went to Ward's lodgings the same evening, and found this bread-basket, this shovel, a navigator's tool, and four sancepans, which have our marks on them. I never gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Do you deal largely in such articles? A. Yes; and most things we sell have our marks upon them. I cannot swear that I had not sold these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you found this glue? A. Yes; and this bag that had come with it, but I cannot swear I had not sold it. I have related the whole of the conversation I had with Ward.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner Watts in Poland-street - I did not see her come out of any house; I had some suspicion of her reticule basket, and asked her what she had got in it; she hesitated a moment, and then said some rings, which she had bought of a woman, for 7s.; I then opened the basket, and saw a cloth, tied up with some papers, which seemed to be papers of nails; I said, "Here is something besides rings;" she said"I gave 7s. for them altogether." I then took her to the office; she was committed till that day week - I inquired at different ironmongers; among the rest I went to the prosecutors, where I received information, and left word for Mr. White to come to the office - he came; I we got a search warrant, and went to Watt's residence, in Peter-street; we searched, and found a quantity of glue behind the counter, in two baskets; the prosecutor claimed it, and I brought it away; there were some other articles, which he would not swear to; I then went to the stables in Nag's Head-yard, where I found Ward dressing a horse; Mr. White, who was with me, said to him, "William, I have something serious against you;" he said, "What is that, Sir?" Mr. White said, "Oh! we know all about it - do not you know what your wife sold this morning" - he said,"It was only a few tacks, or nails," nails I think he said - I said, "Do you mean to deny that there were some rings?" he said, "Yes, a few rings too." I then took him into custody. I went to his lodgings in Poland-street, and found these articles - some of which have a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITE. I know these nails by the papers they are tied up in.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Can you swear that these are the identical papers they were tied up in? A. Yes - they were tied up and marked on the 18th of April, by a person who had not been in our employ before. The things are worth above 30s.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS to THOMAS CLEMENTS. Q. You say this woman said she bought them of a woman? A. Yes; she might have carried away other things; it was in broad day. I told Ward his wife had sold them, because Watts said she bought them of a woman. I did not see Watts at their lodgings, but in the same street. I found nothing at Watts' house which the prosecutor could swear to.</p>

            . My husband is a publican - we live at No. 40, Poland-street, at the Pantheon coffee-house - Ward has lodged with me twelve months - he is married, and his wife lived with him; I have seen Watts several times - she came on the 11th of March, to see Mrs. Ward, who was then confined; she had been sent for on that account; I saw her with a reticule basket in her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL to THOMAS CLEMENTS. Q. Have you been to any solicitor on this business? A. No; I drew the brief myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. And did you receive any payment for it? A. No - I did it for nothing. The prosecutor's is a respectable firm. I was requested last night to do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY to Mr. WHITE. Q. Have you promised him any thing for doing it? A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How came he to do it? A. It was too late last night to get an attorney, and he said he would draw up a short brief; I wanted to employ counsel, and he said "We must get up a short brief," or I did - I cannot say which. I rather think I asked Mr. Plank to do it, and he said it was in very good hands. I did not give him any instructions - he had attended at the office. I suppose I am to pay him as an officer - he gave me the brief to look over, and then I put it into my pocket. I brought it to you this morning, and you said you were engaged in the case.</p>

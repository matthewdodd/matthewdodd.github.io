The prisoner entered their ser<lb></lb>vice on the 8th of March last as footman—he had the care of the plate, which was kept in the pantry—I was in the pantry on Sunday, the 18th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb></lb>soner was there also—I saw every thing as usual—I cannot swear that it was all there—I saw some of the plate there—I saw three waiters—there were four, but I cannot say I saw more than three that evening—and I saw the tea-pot and milk-pot—some part of it was on the dresser—the tea-pot and milk-pot went up for tea at nine o'clock—I remained in the pantry a few minutes—the prisoner went out once that evening between seven and eight o'clock—I think that was the time, but I am not positive—it was before I was in the pantry—he staid out about half an hour—I supped with him that night between nine and ten o'clock, and I saw him at eleven o'clock—he slept in his pantry—next morning I went to call him to breakfast, at about a quarter after eight o'clock—I called him, and not re<lb></lb>ceiving any answer, I went into the pantry, and discovered that he was gone, and all the plate—the plate-basket was out of its usual place, the lid open, and no plate in it—it was the prisoner's duty to shut the house up—I believe he did so that night, but I cannot say—he was the last of the servants up on Sunday night—I missed a small wicker basket or hamper which had been in the passage down stairs, it had a small handle to it—I informed my master—I had heard the prisoner take up my master's water as usual, at about seven o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>

            . I am a private in the 1st battalion of guards; I was on duty at the one gun battery, in the Tower, on Saturday morning, the 3d of September, at five o'clock; it is opposite to the court where this shed is - I saw three men go across Tower-hill, one of them had a black coat and top boots on - they went to the shed, and one of them attempted to break in; a second then tried - the third man then pulled something out of his pocket, and the door opened - two of them then went in, but the man with the top boots stood outside. I went on Monday morning, and gave what description I could of their dress, but I had not seen their faces. I could not swear that the prisoner is the man who had the top boots on, but he is like him.</p>

I said I would give him 1 l. for them, but he would not take it. I then borrowed 1 s. of a lodger to pay the money.</p>

I and Mrs. Stevens went down - we saw the three canaries and a goldfinch, in a cage, and a pair of boots - he gave a sovereign and 1 s. for them.</p>

            , a coachman. I have heard what the last witness has stated - it is true - I lent the prisoner 1 s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you come down? A. Yes, and saw the prisoner give the money, and also saw the man give him the three canaries, the goldfinch, the cage, and the boots; he is a dealer - he buys clothes for his mother, and brother in the country. I did not see him try the boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it who sold them? A. He was a shortish man with a fustian jacket and velveteen trousers. The prisoner owns the house, and I have lodged there about two months. My husband is a groom, but generally follows the coach business. On the Saturday night the prisoner came home soon, and went to bed, as far as I can recollect, about ten o'clock, and was in bed at half-past seven the next morning. He occupies the two parlours and the kitchen. I believe the birds all died on the Saturday - he has borrowed money of me several times.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STEVENS. I have heard what my wife has stated - it is true - I saw all this transaction - the man had a fustian jacket on, but I do not know what trousers - I am not aware whether the prisoner has any top boots or not.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PERRING re-examined. Q. Are you a regular servant to the prisoner? A. Yes; I saw the bargain - it was a man with a fustian jacket on - I never saw my master make a bargain before - he does sometimes wear top boots.</p>

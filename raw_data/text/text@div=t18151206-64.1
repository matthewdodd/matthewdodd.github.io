            . I received a basket of clothes on the 11th, to take to Mrs. Tippets's; I left my mother's house at about nine o'clock. The prisoner met me at the corner of Jane-street, which leads into West-street, where I live. She asked me if those were Mrs. Tippits's things? I told her they were. She asked me to leave them with her, for she expected her fellow servant to come and help her with them. I said, I was going of another errand for my mother, and I would assist her as far as Mrs. Tippets, as I was going past the door. She took hold of one side, and I took hold of the other, and I helped her as far as Mrs. Tippets's gate, which I opened for her, and she carried them towards the door; I then left her.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar, at about nine o'clock in the morning, in Skinner-street, Somers Town; it was on Saturday morning, the 11th of November; she had a basket, apparently full of linen, and lodged the basket on some steps, which are on the other side of the way. She appeared to be in a flurry, and that attracted my attention.</p>

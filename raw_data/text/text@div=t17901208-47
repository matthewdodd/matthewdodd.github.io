               <p>I am a glover, and live in Crown-court, Purple-lane, No. 2: Mrs. Leatham lives at No. 3. I was at my own window, and saw the prisoner go to Mrs. Leatham on Friday the third of December, between three and four in the afternoon, very nigh four; I cannot say I saw him go in, because her house is on a turn; I am sure as to the hour; he went by with nothing but a stick, and came back again with a bundle of soul linen under his arm, in the course of a quarter of an hour; I look upon it that one sheet was tied up in the other, and he carried it outside of his coat: I saw no more of him: I am sure as to the man, because I had seen him at Mr. Leatham's before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that when he went by first he had no bundle, and when he came back he had a bundle? - Yes, I am: my house is the next door.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the time? - I am certain that is the day and time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did ever you see me before in that court? - I saw him just before that very morning.</p>

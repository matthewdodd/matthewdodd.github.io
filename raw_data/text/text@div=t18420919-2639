                  </hi>. I live in Pall-mall. On the 31st of August, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking in the Strand, near to Hun<lb></lb>gerford-market—I felt some one put his hand into my pocket—I turned and saw the prisoner close behind me, almost touching me—I put my hand into my pocket, and found 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in loose silver, which I had placed there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before, in a bit of paper, had been abstracted—the prisoner passed me hastily, and walked very fast—I quickened my pace to overtake him—he turned into Hungerford-street, and began to run—I ran after him, calling, "Stop thief"—he turned into the Arcade, and was secured by the constable—I had not lost sight of him, except for a moment, when he turned the corner—I observed he struggled when the officer seized him—another person came to assist the officer, and I saw him take from the prisoner some silver in a paper—he was then taken to the station, and the officer there showed me this paper, which I ca identify as part of the paper in which my money was.</p>

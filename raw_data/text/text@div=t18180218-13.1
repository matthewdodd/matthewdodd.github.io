               <p>GEORGE WOODWARD. I am a Thames Police constable. On the 13th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was crossing Ludgate-hill, towards the Old Bailey, and saw the prosecutor come down the Old Bailey, the prisoner, and another girl, met him full in the face, tapped him on the breast, and said, halloo! he told them to be off; the prisoner immediately drew his watch from his pocket, he made a catch at her, but fell in the road, and they ran off; I followed them across Ludgate-hill, through a gateway, up two or three different courts - They parted, and I followed the prisoner into Dolphin-court, which leads into Ludgate-hill; when she got to the dark part of the court she dropped the watch. I still pursued, and took her. I asked her what she had done with the watch - She denied ever seeing it. I told her to come back with me, and see if we could find it; I took her back to the spot, called the watchman to bring a light, and found it down the area. I took it and the prisoner to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARLE. I am a watchman. Woodward called to me for a light, and found the watch in the area.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he give you a right direction? - A. I do not know; he said first, it was the last house but one, and then said, it was the house on this side of it, and at that time I felt the money go.</p>

             for two or three yards before they came to him; they were all three together; I saw them beckoning and winking at one another; Norbury had got a direction to the banking-house in his hand, Bond came up and stood close by his left side, shewing him where he was to go; I had seen them all before about the city. Taylor and Mackey came close behind him, and Mackey picked his pocket; I then went up to the young man and asked him what he had lost; he had, in the mean time, missed his money, and was returning and speaking to Bond; I told him the two principal ones were run up the passage that leads through into St. Michael's-court; we pursued them, and in St. Michael's-court I called out, stop thief; there were some ticket-porters standing at the tavern, and they directed us into Gracerhurch-street, we pursued them there, and were informed they went up the butter passage into Leadenhall-market; I went into the market, and we were informed by a butcher, that they were gone up the left hand side of the market; I very soon then saw Taylor and Mackey together in a dark passage; Bond we left behind in Birchin lane; I called out that they were there, upon which Mackey threw down some money into a cellar, two guineas rebounded from the bars, which I picked up; a constable then came up and secured them, and took them to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The young man has told us he applied to Bond first, to enquire something? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Bond did not run away? - A. We left him; we followed the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney, counsel for Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q.When Taylor was taken, I believe you found nothing at all upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say you saw him speak at all to Mackey or to Bond? - A. I saw them very close together, and in company together.</p>

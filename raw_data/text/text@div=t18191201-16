            . On the evening of the 14th of November, there was a house on fire in <placeName id="t18191201-16-crimeloc102">Charlotte-street, St. Pancras</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18191201-16-crimeloc102" type="placeName" value="Charlotte-street, St. Pancras"></interp>

When I got nearly opposite the house, there was suddenly a great rush, apparently of pick-pockets; I was suddenly lifted off my feet above the persons' shoulders, and completely carried by them, at that moment I felt a hand at my right hand pocket, being determined to secure it, I gave no alarm, but forced my hand down, and took hold of a hand in my pocket, then cried out, loudly, some one was robbing me, his hand is in my pocket, and I have hold of it; the persons round me said,</p>
               <p>"Hold him fast;" which I did, and said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, stand round me, or the thief will be rescued." Some respectable persons were nearer to me than the gang - they were hustled with me. I found it was the prisoner's hand, they laid hold of him. A gentleman who had hold of him, said his hand was full of paper; he found my 16 l. in his hand, and the gentleman handed it over to me. I never let his hand go until I collared him. There were one 10 l. and six 1 l. notes. I produce them, and know them to be mine.</p>

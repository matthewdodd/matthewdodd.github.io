            . I am an officer in his Majesty's custom-house. On the 29th of December ( Sunday evening) I stopped Ward coming on shore from the Elizabeth with ten carrots of tobacco. I asked him what he had got; he said, what is that to you? I took it out of his hand, and he ran away, and said he would call somebody; I called to the waterman, and asked where he brought it from; he said, from the Elizabeth. I took it to his Majesty's custom-house.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I brought Ward ashore when Mr. Brigs stopped him coming from the Elizabeth. I did not know he had the carrots of tobacco till I came on shore. I was coming from Union-stairs, he hailed me, and bid me put the boat round the lighter. I heard two voices; the basket was handed into my boat, which was covered over, and I got Ward and the tobacco in; he bid me stop, there was another coming; then Trotter looked over the stern, and said, are you gone? he made answer, Jemmy are you coming? he replied he could not come that night, because there was nobody on board but himself and the cook. As I was rowing him on shore, I said, I fancy you have something here that you should not have, if I had known it I would not have took you in; he said, what he had was no harm, for if any boat came along side he could drop it over-board. I told him it was hazardous to me and my boat too. I was agoing to row him ashore at the Hermitage, and he bid me row him to Smith's Ways; he bid me come after him, because he had no money; as he came on shore the officer, Brigs, stopped him. The tobacco weighed one quarter and fourteen pound. Brigs took it from him, and he ran away. I saw the prisoners drinking together. I charged them with it, and they both went out of the house.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it. I went on board to see James, and he was not on board; going on shore there was a man desired I would carry this basket for him: he said, he would come on shore at Smith's Ways and pay me, and he called a sculler. Going on shore the officer stopped me, and asked what it was; he took it out of my hand, and I went away, and said, I would get somebody to take it. I know nothing what it was no more than the child unborn.</p>

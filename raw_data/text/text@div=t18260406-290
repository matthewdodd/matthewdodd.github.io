            . I am a porter, and live in Henry-street, Hampstead-road. About half-past nine o'clock on the morning of the 8th of April, I saw the two prisoners and two other persons - I watched and saw Thompson go to Mr. Horsefall's, No. 11, Gloucester-place - he had nothing when he went in, but he came out with a mahogany case before him - I raised a cry and he handed it to Hussey, who turned a corner, but they were pursued; I helped to secure Hussey in a house into which he had run - he was making his escape out of the back door.</p>

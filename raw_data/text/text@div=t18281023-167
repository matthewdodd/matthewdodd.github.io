On the morning of the 18th of September, I was sitting between two and three o'clock, on the shambles at Whitechapel - I was sober, but very tired; I live at Sheerness; the prisoner came and asked what I did there; I said I was waiting for a coach; I had been to two houses to try to get a lodging, but they could not accommodate me; she said, "I can show you where you can get a bed;" I asked her how far it was - she said, "Not far;" I went about fifty yards, she met two more - they said,"Where are you going?" she said, "To a house, to get a lodging for this gentleman;" they said, "You know where to go;" and we all went to a house, and into a room on the first-floor - I saw the woman of the house, and gave her 6d. for my bed, but did not give the prisoner any money; she did not ask for any; I said to the others, "I am going to sleep here, and I will thank you to disperse;" they said, No, they would stop; I said, "I don't want you to stop here;" they would not disperse; I felt the prisoner's hand coming out of my pocket; I said, "You have taken my money;" she said she had not; I had not given her 2s. - she wanted 3s. of me; she began to unbutton my dress; I said, "I will thank you to disperse;" while the prisoner's hand was about me, I missed my purse with two sovereigns in it and some silver; I said, "If you don't give me the money I will call the watchman;" the other two woman were in the room at the time; I called the watchman; the person below let him in - he came up, and I told him the prisoner had robbed me of two sovereigns and 1l. worth of silver in a leather purse; the watchman found 17s. 6d. in the purse on the bed, but no sovereigns; I also lost a tobacco-box; nothing else was found but a bit of India-rubber; the watchman searched the room, and the other woman; I had seen the two sovereigns and the silver safe in the purse at five or six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you seen them? A. I came to London in the morning, and saw them at a house I had been at - I do not know the name of it; I had not taken lodgings; I was there getting a pint of beer - I took out my money to see that it was correct; the house is a very little way from Irongate at the Tower; I then walked down the Minories - I only went to two houses to ask for a lodging; I did not stop there long - I kept walking about till I got to Whitechapel at near two o'clock; I did take a little beer at the houses where I asked for a lodging; I was at Irongate till near nine, standing outside the house for about half an hour; I had been about with a truck to sell ketchup - that truck was taken down by the Mint; there were two men drawing it, and I was in it riding to where it was hired; I was not in the truck above five minutes; I asked the men to have something to drink, and they went with me to a back part of Whitechapel; I then said, "I will not go any further;" I know the name of one of the men was Griffiths; I lent them 1s. a piece - I do not know where they live; I was on the shambles but not asleep; I can swear that three women did not come to me; I did not say to them that my friends had behaved very shabby to me, that I had lent them 1s. a piece, and they left me there and I fell asleep; I do not know whether it was a front room or a back - it was a room where there were old rags, rope, and iron; I was sober; I gave one of the women 1s. for showing me the room; one of them said, "I should like to have a drop of gin," and I gave 1s.; I did not offer the prisoner 2s. to sleep with her - she wanted 3s. for me to stop with her; I said "I would rather you would disperse;" I said "I would not give you 2s. let alone 3s.;" I was not at any public-house with them; I was not sitting on the bed with them - the prisoner was close to the bed; I was looking at the watchman when he searched her, and he found 8s. 4d. on her; the room was on the first-floor - I do not know whether it was a front-room.</p>

I found on her - and this tobacco-box, and 3d. or 4d. on the other women.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take any means to ascertain whether she had any thing in her mouth? A. Yes; I took hold of her mouth, and said, "Spit them out;" she said, "What? I have got nothing;" she spoke in a good tone of voice - not half a second had elapsed: the prosecutor said he had given 6d. for his bed, and one of the girls something for beer; he did not say whether there had been any chaffing about 2s. or 3s.; - he never told me he had offered 2s. to the woman; I should think he had drunk more than a pint or two of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say any thing about 2s. that night? A. No. the prosecutor looked very red; I thought he had been drinking something, but he spoke very freely - he was very much flurried.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house when the prosecutor and prisoner came there; the prosecutor seemed as sober as the generality of men would be at that time; he might perhaps have had a pint of beer or so; I took notice of him - he was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the watchman has sworn that he appeared to have drunk more than a pint or two of beer, is that true? A. He appeared perfectly sober; he might have taken a pint or two; he did not tell me he had offered 2s. to this woman to sleep with her - he identified the person; that was nearly all that happened; he told me he had sent some one from the house for drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He offered 2s.; I said it was so little, I would not take it - I would rather go; I think he put the purse on the bed; when he gave the money for the room he gave me the tobacco-box.</p>
               <p>COURT to SAMUEL GREEN. Q. Did the prisoner say the box had been given to her then? A. No - she had it in her pocket, and I was going to take it out - she said "I will take it out;" I caught it in her hand - it was not cleverly out of her pocket. <rs id="t18281023-167-verdict988" type="verdictDescription">

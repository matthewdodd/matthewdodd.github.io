               <p>Q. How long did you stay down - A. Half an hour; until she called me up again. I bought one piece of her, and I brought it down stairs with me, and in the course of a fortnight I wanted money; my wife and me went and pawned it, about thirteen days afterwards. I bought it for my own use.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. I had private information that Mr. Loader had been robbed by Sinnott, his porter. In consequence of that information I went to Mrs. Phipps's lodging, in Angel and Porter-court, Golden-lane, in the garret. Previous to that I had apprehended Mrs. Phipps, and three others, for a burglary. Limbrick was in company with me. We searched a box in her room. It was nailed. We found these two pieces of cotton, and a quantity of other pieces. In consequence of that I apprehended

In an old shoe, in his box, Limbrick, in company with me, found eleven guineas in gold, and seventeen pounds in notes. We brought him to the office, and Mrs. Cochrane gave me this ticket of a piece of cotton, pawned for a pound, on the 23d of August, 1811. I have matched these two pieces with the piece in pawn. It makes twenty yards altogether.</p>

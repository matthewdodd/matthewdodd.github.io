                  </hi>. I keep a shoe-shop at No. 4, Vere-street, Clare-market; I do not five there. On the 29th of April I left it about eleven o'clock—I cannot say the day of the week—I know it was the 29th—I was before the Magistrate on the 30th—Lshut the door, and locked and, padlocked it—the shutters were also fattened by a bar, and bolted inside—I was sent for to the shop at eight o'clock next mornings and found the lock and padlock broken, and the articles stated gone—I did not know ex<lb></lb>actly what quantity was gone, but when I got to Bow-street the same morning I found ten pairs of boots, sixteen pairs of shoes, and some odd ones—they were my property, and part of what I missed from my shop—the elder prisoner lodged in the three-pair front room of the house where my shop is—I have seen him pass up and down—I do not know whether the younger prisoner lived there—I have seen his lace before.</p>

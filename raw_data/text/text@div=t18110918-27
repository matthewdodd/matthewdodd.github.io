            . On my going past Mr. Brown's door, I saw the prisoner taking the stockings, I informed Mr. Brown, and I pursued the prisoner, when he was stopped, he was surrounded by a quantity of loose people. I said I would never lose sight of him, and when I got hold of him, I would never loose him, the women that surrounded him took from his pocket three pair of stockings, they said why do you not knock the son of a bitch down, I told them it was impossible for him to do it. As soon as I got hold of his neck-handkerchief, by some means or other he got my fingers in his mouth, the women that surrounded him persuaded him to bite my fingers off, I brought him to Mr. Brown's shop, then there were two pair of stockings found upon him, but they were odd ones, the women took several pair out of his pockets, the prisoner said they should not be found upon him, therefore girls pick away as fast as you can. I never lost sight of him.</p>

When the stage got about the middle of the bridge, I thought I saw a scuffle; I turned, and saw the prisoner away from the coach, throwing my handkerchief from him; a gentleman was collaring him; the handkerchief was picked up and shown to me - it was mine.</p>

            . I am a tea-dealer. I was on London-bridge at a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and another little lad with him; the prisoner was hanging to the coach, close behind the prosecutor, and the lad was sitting on the step of the dickey; I saw the prisoner put his hand once or twice to the prosecutor's pocket - he took out a silk handkerchief, folded it up in his hand, and jumped down - I directly seized him; the lad jumped off, and ran into the Borough - he was eight or nine years old, or rather more. The prisoner never got from me - he threw the handkerchief on the ground when I seized him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was riding behind the coach, and when I was tired I dropped off; the gentleman caught hold of me, and accused me of stealing the handkerchief - he searched, but could not find one on me; the coach stopped about twenty yards off, and they picked one up: the boy was not with me. I was riding over to my sisters.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of January I went to the prisoners lodgings, he kept a pastry cook's shop in Princes Street, Leicester fields, I found thirty pair of stays tied up in this tablecloth in the prisoner's window, the prisoner was at home; I also found in the same bundle some twilled jean to the amount of forty-eight yards, and other remnants of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180018"></xptr>cotton packed up in this paper, I asked him how he came by these stays, he told me that a poor distressed friend of his that was in an insolvent state, and had become a bankrupt, had left them there for protection, I told him I was not satisfied with that, I should take them to the office. At this time we had no information of Mr. Favell's robbery, Lavendar who was with me agreed to take the stays, and to keep them till the Saturday for him to bring the insolvent friend before the magistrate, which he agreed to. On the next morning the Friday, Mr. Favell gave information, we went to Thomas's house, but we could not find him until the 21st of August, I apprehended him at a public-house in Westminster, I had been frequently at his house, but could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday, in January, were you at the office. - A. Yes, and the prisoner and his friend did not come, I took thirty pair of stays, and, by the order of the magistrate, delivered to the prosecutor twenty-four pair of stays and kept six.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, and called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

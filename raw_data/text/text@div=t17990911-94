             sworn. - I am watch-house keeper and night-beadle: On Friday, the 16th of August last, about ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged by Mr. Fuller with robbing him of a five pound Bank of England note, three guineas, three half-guineas, and two seven-shilling-pieces; he said he had served him with some cheese, and he had put down a guineas to pay for it, and Mr. Fuller gave him change; the charge was given him and he took the bag up a second time, and as he was going to put his hand in it he snatched it from him and run out of the shop with it; I searched him and found upon him ten shillings and six-pence in silver, and a penny and a farthing; when he was brought to the watch-house he had this brown wig on. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I admit I went in and bought some cheese of Mr. Fuller, I had dealt there for three months before, I lived six doors from him; I was going to Fleet-market to get something for my supper; when I got into Leigh-street I was knocked down, and a parcel of people came round me and took me to the watch-house, and then Mr. Fuller said I had given him the bag back; I never had it at all, there was no charge given against me that night.</p>
               <p>Fuller. It is not true, I gave charge of him that evening.</p>

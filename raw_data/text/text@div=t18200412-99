            . I live in Phoenix-street, Soho. On the 10th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18200412-99-crimeloc566">Covent-garden</placeName>

I put my chain and seals into my fob before I went into the crowd. I had a five-shilling piece and two half crowns in my pocket, in a purse. I was standing with two boys in front of me. I saw the prisoner, Barnett, a little to my left. I think Sampson was one of the boys, but I am not certain. I missed my watch and money, but did not perceive it go. I laid hold of a boy, who was searched, but nothing found on him - he was discharged. I went to Bow-street, hearing a person was taken. My watch was produced there, and I saw Barnett among others in the room, and identified him particularly, as being near me at the time. My purse was also produced. Part of the chain was broken in my pocket.</p>
               <p>HOLLAND JONES. I was with Henney, and saw Barnett<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120034"></xptr>about a yard and a half from him, and I think Sampson also, but I am not certain. I particularly noticed Barnett, I saw him leave a person who said he suspected him, and ran after him, calling Stop thief!</p>

            . I am a constable. I was on duty at the corner of King-street, heard the cry of Stop him! and stopped Barnett. I found a watch in his right-hand breeches pocket. About twenty minutes after, Henney came to the office and claimed it.</p>

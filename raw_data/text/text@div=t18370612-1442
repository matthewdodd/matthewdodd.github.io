                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. In consequence of inform<lb></lb>ation, I went to No. 2, Crown-court, Liquorpond-street, on Saturday morning, the 12th of May—I waited, and saw the prisoner at half-past two o'clock—I called him by name, and said, "Do you remember taking up a fare at the corner of Tottenham-court-road and Oxford-street, which you set down at No. 35, Grosvenor-place?"—he said, "No"—I then said, "I want you for stealing a writing-desk and umbrella which was left in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on that occasion"—he shook his head, and said, "No"—I asked him for the key of the room—he produced it, and unlocked the door—I went up stairs with him to his room—he produced a box, which he said was his; and in it I found this case cut as it is now—there were about twenty letters and memorandums in it, which I returned to Sir Culling—after taking the case out I said, "Where is the umbrella?"—he said he did not know—he said there was an old one in the cupboard on the stairs—but I could not find one—he then said, that after he set down Sir Culling he took another gentleman to Pimlico, who said, "Here are these things in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>"—the prisoner said, "Yes, there is an umbrella too;" and the gentleman said, "No, there is only this one, which is mine."</p>

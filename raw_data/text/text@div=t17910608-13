               <p>On the 19th of last month I was looking through my master's shop window, opposite Guy Earl of Warwick, Gray's-inn-lane, and I saw the prisoner run out of the house with his apron full of linen. As soon as he came out, I saw some of the linen drop out of the cloth, and he did not stop to pick them up, from whence I suspected him; I ran out of the shop, and called stop thief; the prisoner ran up Gray's-inn-lane, cross Holborn, up Castle-street; I kept my eye upon him till he got nearly the top of Castle-street, and then he turned the corner of Magpie-alley; and when I got to the corner of Magpie-alley, I saw Collingridge had got the prisoner by the collar; I am positive to the man.</p>

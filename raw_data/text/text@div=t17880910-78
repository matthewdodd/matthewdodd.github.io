               <p>On the 11th of September, I was called down by somebody in the house, who said, they imagined somebody was stealing the wet linen; it was in a washing tub of hot water; I came down, and found the prisoner concealed in the coal-cellar, with the linen by her; she said, she only wanted to go to the necessary; I sent for the constable and delivered her to him, and told the constable where the linen was; I would not pick it up; I touched it, and it was quite hot.</p>

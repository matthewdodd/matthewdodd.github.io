            . I am wife to Francis the prosecutor. I had been gone seven weeks and five days out of London, and left the prisoner in care of my house. When I came back again I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them by name.)</p>

               <p>Q. When did you go from home?</p>
               <p>A. Davis. I went from home the second or third of March last, and returned again a month ago last Monday night. I took the prisoner up and had her examined. She confessed she took them away, and pawn'd them to four pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the pawnbrokers names?</p>
               <p>A. Davis. One is named Coronel, a Jew, another Howel, another Jones, and the other Reynolds. She own'd every thing that I charged her with, and said they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she own that?</p>
               <p>A. Davis. Before justice Welch. (The goods produced.) I found this gown (taking one in her hand) at Mrs. Reynolds's. the curtain and candlestick at Coronel's the Jew, one sheet and pewter dish at Howel's, and the poker at Mr. Jones's in Holbourn. I can't say at which pawnbroker's I found the coffee-pot. They are all my property.

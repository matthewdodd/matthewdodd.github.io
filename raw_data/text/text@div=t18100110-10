On Tuesday the 12th of December, a lighter came to the wharf, marked M, with one hundred and ninety-nine firkins of butter; It came under my direction as wharfinger, when the porters landed them, I took charge of them; I counted them twice, and found them to be exactly agreeable to the lighter bill, one hundred and ninety-nine. I put my watchman to take care of them, and when they were put in the warehouse, I counted them again, and found there was a deficiency of two, the parcel was two hundred, one was left on board the ship. I missed No. 41 and 94: on the next day, the witness came and asked me if I had lost it.</p>

            . I am beadle of the Portuguese Synagogue. In going through Cutler's-street, Woolpack-alley, on the 12th of December about two o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners, Allen had the load on his shoulder. I heard Ditch say to Allen. go on. I had suspicion that the property did not belong to them; I catched hold of Allen and Ditch, and insisted upon knowing what they had got; Allen replied, dirty butter. I took them to the Compter, by information, I found that Mr. Aylwin was the owner. It was concealed in this bag: Allen said, if I would let him go, he would give me the property.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Allen's Defence. I was coming along Houndsditch, a man asked me to take that bag into Winfield-street, he would give me a shilling; and going along Petticoat-square, this man took hold of me; asked me what I had got; I said a firkin of butter, I put it down, he said, he must take me to the Compter: I said, I am willing to go with you; that is all that passed between us; I never said, I would give him the firkin of butter.</p>
               <p>Ditch's Defence. I know nothing of it; I was going to buy an old pair of shoes for myself; he took hold of me, and said, I must go to the Compter.</p>

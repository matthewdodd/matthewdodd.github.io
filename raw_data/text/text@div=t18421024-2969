                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Henry Cove, a linen-draper, at Tottenham. On the 24th of October I saw a young man, about the pri<lb></lb>soner's size—I do not know whether the prisoner is like him or not—he came into Mr. Cove's shop and asked for a pennyworth of tape—there were six silk handkerchiefs on the counter, near to where he stood—I served him, and he left—he returned in two or three minutes, and asked for more tape, and wider than the other—he said some one had hurt his leg, and he wanted it for it—I served him, and he went out—I think I should know the two pieces of tape again which he had—I did not miss the handker<lb></lb>chiefs till the next morning, when I saw the prisoner in custody—these handkerchiefs produced are exactly like those I missed, and these are the pieces of tape I sold to the person—here are the pieces they came off.</p>

At half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 25th of October I was on duty at Stoke Newington—I saw the prisoner in High-street, and then I saw him cross the road to a companion—I met them again in Bowling Green-street—I stopped his companion, and the prisoner went on—I let his companion go, and went</p>

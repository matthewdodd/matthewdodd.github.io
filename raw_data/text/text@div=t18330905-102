               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know what Cooper was? A. I considered him a general agent - I employed him to get several debts in for me, and so did others.</p>
               <p>Cooper's Defence. I have known Pritchard for thirty years, and had several dealings with him - I met with him at the Hope public-house, and asked him if I could have some patterns of tea services - he said if I called he would give me some at the warehouse - I called and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050072"></xptr>patterns were given to me - I showed them to some persons and among the rest was Mr. Knight - he asked the price, I said, five guineas - he said, that was too high for him, but if I should have any about three guineas, he should have no objection to treat with me - I returned those patterns, and had some other patterns which I showed to several persons, and among others to Mr. Knight - he selected this pattern, and I asked him 3l. for it, he said, he would give me 2l. 8s. and take 10s off an account which I owed him - the price Pritchard told me for this set was three guineas, and twenty per cent, off for cash, which reduced it to 2l. 8s., so that I got 10s. by the sale - I then went to the warehouse, and told Pritchard to get them packed up and sent for me, according to the direction, which he did, and I signed the book - if I had known they had been stolen I could have got them away without having a book signed- because when the book goes back I know it is looked over, and the cash book examined to see if the money is entered for them, and the goods are entered in the daybook - when I received the money, I went and paid Pritchard 2l. 8s. which he acknowledged before the magistrate that he had received.</p>

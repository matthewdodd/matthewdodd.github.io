             (police-constable H 170). I went to search the prisoner's house; I found the property which was identified by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this bag opened at the station-house? A. It might be for a quarter of an hour - it was merely opened for the prosecutor to look at - I am not aware that it was opened when the prosecutor was not there - I was there several times when the prosecutor was not there; the bag was not opened in my presence, when the prosecutor was not there - I saw the prisoner's wife at the lodgings we went to - I have known the prisoner some time - I have seen him there - I went there with the prosecutor.</p>

I knew it was his lodging, the day before; he told me he lived in New Nicholl-street; but the morning we took him, he said, he lodged in Cock-lane - but we went to the house he had before told me he lived at, in New Nicholl-street; he did not mention any number - I don't know how many houses there are there - we found a woman there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you swear before the magistrate that you had seen him go into that house? A. No; I cannot tell when I had seen him go in - I think it was nearly three weeks ago - I will swear it is full three weeks; it was nearly one o'clock in the day - I don't know the number of the house - but I had known him and I reside very near that spot - there are two doors to the house, one is up a court; it was up the court I saw the prisoner go - I believe there is a house or two up the court.</p>

Next day, I saw it hung up in the hair-room, on the bell-pull; the day after, it was gone, and a dark one put in its place; I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and saw the same front which I had seen in the hair-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your's is a considerable manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner, I believe, got 200 l. a year?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, wages and perquisites.</p>



               <p>Q. This hair is valued at five shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great number of fronts in your warehouse of the same colour? - A. Yes, but not of the same make; this is of a peculiar make, and I should be able to distinguish it from any other; we never made one in that way before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner a power of selling any articles? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. When he sold any thing, was he not expected to render an account of it? - A. Yes, to bring the money, and enter it in a book.</p>

             sworn. - I saw the prisoner making up the front which was found in his lodgings, and asked him who it was for; he said, for a lady, who was to call, of the name of Thomas, or Thompson; I asked him what the price was, in case she should call; he said, seven shillings; I thought it too little; he said he had agreed for it, and could not charge higher; I paid particular attention to it, and am quite sure this is the same; he never accounted for the sale of it, but told me he had pinned it up to the bell-rope in the hair-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q Did you ever call upon him to account for it? - A. No, I frequently asked whether the lady had called; he said, no.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer, and searched the prisoner's lodgings, No. 13, Peter-street, Half Moon-alley, where I found a quantity of hair, and this front in a cupboard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. If a lady comes into the shop for an article, and chooses that which is made for a customer, we sell that, and make another for the person who bespoke it, rather than lose the sale; so it was in this case; I had the hair myself, and made the one which is produced for a friend of mine; I made it up on a Sunday, and I believe a person is here who called upon me at the time, and saw me making it.</p>
               <p>(The person was called, but did not appear.)</p>

I met William Punchard on the 10th of June, at the Ferry-house, in the Isle-of-dogs - I gave him my watch to take care of - I was going over to Greenwich - it was an old-fashioned silver watch, and the maker's name was Brown - it had a steel chain, a seal, and a key.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PUNCHARD. I received the watch, and as I was returning home that night, about half-past ten, I met the prisoner and another woman - they asked me to go with them - I went to a house in <placeName id="t18340703-211-crimeloc1174">Limehouse-hole</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your friend asked you to take care of his watch? A. Yes; I had been drinking a little when I went with the women; but I was not drunk - I had been in one public-house, and stayed about half-an-hour with a young man who is now just gone in to Sydney - after I left the public-house, I had to call at a doctor's - I had the watch safe then - that was about one hundred yards before I met the women - the prisoner laid on the bed; the other woman on the floor - I had been in the house about half an hour when I fell asleep.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Shadwell. On the 11th of June, about half-past seven in the morning, the prisoner came to me and brought a watch - I advanced her 1l. on it - it was an old-fashioned silver watch, and had a steel chain, a seal and key - the maker's name was Brown - there was a red stone in the seal, with the initials"M. B." on it - it was redeemed the same evening by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No - she was in the shop about five minutes - we have a great many persons come there - I took notice enough of the prisoner to swear to her.</p>

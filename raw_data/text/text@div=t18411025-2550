                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweeper, and live at Kilburn. On the Thursday morning, 16th September, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner leading a mare—he asked if I could tell him where there was a horse-slaughterer's—I said there was none in our village, but there was one a mile and a half off at Paddington—I asked why he wished it killed—he said some one had stabbed it—I found a large wound, which I could put my hand in—it was quite fresh done, and was bleeding—I asked where it was done—he said he had turned it out on Roxley-heath common, and some one had done it in the course of the night out of spite to him—I said I did not consider the entrails were hurt, and persuaded him to take it home again—he said he had taken it to a farrier's in the neighbourhood, who had probed the wound to a great depth, twelve or fourteen inches, measuring it on his arm, that he had said the entrails were cut, and he had better dispose of it—he said he was a poor man, and could not do without a horse, he must make the best he could of it, put some more money to it, and buy another—I called Mortimer, my neighbour, across, and his opinion was the same as mine, that the entrails were not cut, and advised him to take it home—the prisoner went away towards Paddington—I afterwards saw the same pony at Guildhall.</p>

I was in company with Lamb—the prisoner told me the pony was his, and he had brought it from Roxley-heath, that he had had it some time, and gave 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and that it was very poor when he bought it—he asked me what I thought it would fetch at the horse slaugh<lb></lb>terer's—I said, "From 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said he should not care if he could get 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said I would give him a sovereign for it, and some steak for his breakfast—I bought it—I afterwards offered it for sale at Smithfield—it had partly recovered from the wound—I had sewed it up, and it burst again—I was told at Smithfield that it was stolen, and I was given into custody.</p>

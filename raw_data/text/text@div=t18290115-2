On the morning of the 16th of December, (I believe) I got up about six o'clock, and found a large piece of beef, which I had cut, laid on the counter in the bar - I had left it in a small sitting-room adjoining the bar, and saw it between twelve and one o'clock the night before, when I retired to rest - I went to bed last. I found the till open, which I had locked previous to going to bed, and a false key in the lock - it was pulled out, and 8s. or 10s. in copper missing; I then went into the parlour and missed a large desk, which had a silver watch with a ribbon to it, locked up in it - it was safe the last thing at night; I found the tap-room window partly open - the sash had been thrown up; it was down just before I went to bed - there is no fastening to it, but it was closed; it is on the ground floor - I saw footmarks of dirty shoes on the seat inside the window; I then traced the footsteps across the paved yard, and over the wall into the yard of Mr. Alexander adjoining my house, over a shed and an out-house; I saw a pair of stockings lying in a cupboard adjoining the bar - the cupboard was a little open; the stockings were not mine - the prisoner lodged in my house for three weeks, and we expected that night that he had retired to bed before we did; we had seen him in the tap-room about half-past ten or eleven o'clock that night: the watch was worth about 12s.; I missed a snuff-box, which was found on the prisoner - I did not miss it at the time I missed the other things; I had shut the tap-room door when I went to bed.</p>

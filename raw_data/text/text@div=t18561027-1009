On Monday, 27th Oct., my brother asked for the key of his house, and I went across the road—it was between half past 5 and 6 o'clock—I went across the road, and in going I saw Garnon standing at the end of my father's gate; that is about twenty yards from my brother's house, and I saw there was a light in my brother's house—I had not got the key the first time—I went back and got the key, and when I returned Garnon was standing there then—I saw a light in my brother's bedroom—I opened the door, and saw Williams on the stairs—I said, "What do you do here!"—he threw me down, and knocked me on the head with a crowbar—I got my clothes torn all to pieces—I was very much injured, and have been under the doctor's hands ever since—after Williams knocked me down became insensible—I know that Garnon had a cap on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. On Wednesday evening, the 14th of Dec, in consequence of previous informa<lb></lb>tion, I was inside the house No. 12, Carpenter-street—the prisoner came to the door, and I apprehended him at the door—I told him he was charged by the witness Williter with having uttered a forged note to her—she was pre<lb></lb>sent at the time—I think I told him it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note—I told him it was my duty to caution him that whatever he might say I must name else<lb></lb>where, and if he wished to say anything it was my duty to hear it—he said, "I shall say nothing at all about it," but immediately afterwards he said, "I will tell you all about it, I took it at the fight down the country" (when he knocked at the door a female opened it—he refused to come in—I was in the parlour—he could not see me—the female asked him to walk in—he declined, but asked if Ann was in—the female said, "Yes, walk in"—he de<lb></lb>clined to come in, and waited at the door—I went out to him) I searched him, and found on him a key, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a note addressed to Williter—he at first said his name was Henry Miles—he afterwards said his name was not Miles, that they called him <hi rend="italic">Miles's boy</hi>, but his name was Henry Eastgate—he at first said he lived at No. 5, Arundel-terrace, White Conduit-fields—I said I should go there—he then said he did not live there, but his friends re<lb></lb>sided there—I afterwards learnt that some notes had been found in the street, and a spot was pointed out to me in Carpenter-street, about twelve feet from No. 12, where he was apprehended—in going from the house to the station with him, I had passed that spot, but the notes lay on the right, and he was on my left—I do not think he could pass that spot on leaving the house, but in coming to it he might, or anybody standing at the door might easily have thrown them there.</p>

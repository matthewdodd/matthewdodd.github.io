               <p>Q. You took them before a magistrate, and they were committed: What foundation had you to do that? - The foundation was, that the property was found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - No, it was produced to me in the course of an hour after the robbery was committed.</p>

I said to Spinoza, I will take hold of the little one, and told him to take hold of the other: I took hold of his hand and he had a sixpence in it; and the other witness said, the big one had dropped something, says he, he has dropped a watch, then says I, stop him and take him over to the Flower Pot, and examine him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You must not tell us that.</p>
               <p>Court. You found out at length that the prosecutor of the indictment had left a watch or watch case? - I did, the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought to the presence of the prisoner? - He was not, he saw him the next day before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass material to give evidence? - No further then Mr. Wayland saying that he had his windows broke the night before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I will thank you to tell me a little over again what you told his lordship just now. You found Good and Williams standing near together, see one deliver something into the others hands; what it was you could not tell? - Yes; then Mr. Jostling took hold of one prisoner and told me to take hold of the other; consequently I did, and when I went to take hold of his hand he dropped something; says I, jostling, he has dropped something.</p>
               <p>Q. You was before Mr. Alderman Boydell? - I was, on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give an information there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that your hand writing, that signature? (the information shewn him) - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave exactly the same account as you do now? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told him that you found a knife? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us see the knife. It is not a common bread and cheese knife, as any body may have? Pray, sir, what has been your employment? - I am a confectioner by business.</p>

               <p>Q. He that seen your employment? - No, I go out to assist Mr. Jostling.</p>
               <p>Q. You have assisted, I believe, a considerable time in this sort of way. How long have you assisted him? - About six or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You have gone with a good many men? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me that? Was not you in some employment of this sort six or eight months ago? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you removed from some employment of this sort by my Lord Mayor? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you, on account of a little suspicion of your extorting six guineas from a man for putting off bad money? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been employed by one person or another in taking up persons? - About six or eight weeks, with Mr. Jostling.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been employed by any other person? - Not at all. only going with him, as I told you before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Three years? - It may be three years or four years, it may be later, or it may be sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a reward? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you could guess to the amount of it, if you was to try? - I don't know that I could. What reward do you mean? I don't know what you mean by reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. What, pray, may the amount of the reward be? - According to a man's desert.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080171"></xptr>Q. What amount may be the reward for a man convicted of burglary? - Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if there are two, there are two forty pounds? - There may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say your motives are of such a public spirit that you don't expect any share of the reward if the men are convicted? - I do expect some share according to my merit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you along with Jostling, and concerned with him in advising this indictment for a burglary? - No otherwise than the robbery was committed, he indicted it as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. These two young men were not committed for a burglary? - I cannot say; I believe, according to the evidence we gave, it was a burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this, whether you was assisting Mr. Jostling in advising an indictment for a burglary? - No, I did not advise at all.</p>

             standing together, &amp;c. and the informant, Spinoza, on his oath says, that he was with Jostling, and on his going up to the prisoner Williams, he dropped the inside case of a watch, and part of a watch movement, now produced, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(The watch case produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine; I know it by the dial plate, and I have the work in this box that belongs to it, it exactly sits; it is an unfinished watch; I can swear it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It appears to be a very common sort of a watch? - It is a common one, it is a watch that can be sold as cheap as three guineas and a half, when it is finished.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing at all remarkable that a movement should go on four points like this? - Yet it would be very remarkable if you could find another; you might try five hundred and not do it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Good. I never saw the young man, Williams, in my life, before I was taken up, and put along with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams. I don't know any thing of the prisoner at the bar, I never saw any thing of him before I was taken into custody with him; when the two gentlemen came up they said they heard something drop from some body, they did not know who; and they swore when they were before the Lord Mayor, that nobody was passing at the time; when it is as public a place as any in London at seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Williams called one witness, who said, he never heard any harm in his character.</p>
               <p>Jostling. Please to ask this person if Williams was not discharged from the New Bastile the night before I took him.</p>

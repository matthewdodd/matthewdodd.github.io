                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mrs. Gill, a pawnbroker, in Wilmont-street, Brunswick-square. I produce a pair of candlesticks, snuffers, and tray, pawned on the 11th of May last by the prisoner Green—he gave his address No. 9, Homer-row—the duplicate produced by Goff is the one I gave Green when he pledged these things—I took the pledge myself, and am quite certain he is the person.</p>

I took Green into custody on the 22nd of Jan., at 39, Drummond-crescent, Euston-square, where I knew he lived, from information I received from Mr. Evans—I searched his apartment, and found this metal box—I took it up and opened it—he said, "Oh that is of no consequence, there is nothing in it, it is only an old tobacco-box"—seeing it was of no value I put it in again, and there it remained till Mrs. Rathbone came and saw it, and claimed it.</p>

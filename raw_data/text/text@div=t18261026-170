            . I am a carter. On the 9th of October I was in the New-road, and saw Mr. Taylor - I saw the prisoner with three more boys, who appeared to be knocking up a kind of fight - I kept at some distance, and saw them come up to Mr. Taylor - I thought they meant to push him into the mud; I then saw the prisoner take a watch and chain from Taylor's waistcoat-pocket, and put it into his own - I left my horses and ran over; the prisoner crossed the road down a street; I followed - he turned back at last and gave himself up; I brought him back - the watch was found in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROBERTS. Q. Do you mean to say this is the boy who seized the watch? A. Yes, positively he is the hand who took it - I did not see him throw it down; he ran two or three hundred yards, and seeing persons before him he gave himself up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did the robbery happen? A. At the further end of Euston-square.</p>

            . I live in Field-terrace, Bagnigewells. I was in the New-road, and saw some boys fighting; and, as I went on, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I thought it was the boys calling one after the other - three boys came one way, and one threw something out of his hand into the water; he was not so tall as the prisoner - I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the prisoner doing at the time? A. He was running.</p>

On the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I came to town, and about seven at night, I went into a public-house in Bride-lane, Fleet-street, and changed a sovereign. I went out and met the prisoner in Fleet-market, and by her persuasion, I went to <placeName id="t18241028-15-crimeloc86">George-alley</placeName>

I paid the 2 s.; the prisoner afterwards said she would have something to drink, and the servant fetched some gin; we each had a glass - I paid for it, and we went to bed. I wound my watch up and put it into my fob - I then had four half crowns and a shilling in my pocket - I put my trowsers under my head. I awoke between three and four o'clock in the morning and she was gone. I felt and missed my watch and money - I could make nobody hear me. I went down stairs as soon as it was light; I knocked at the parlour door, a woman came out, who said she was mistress of the house, that the girls were not about, but if I called about twelve o'clock no doubt I could get my watch. I called at twelve o'clock and saw the prisoner, who said, if I would call at three o'clock I should have the watch without expence or trouble, if I would go no further in the business. I said I knew she had taken it, and expected that she would find it, and the money also. I left and called at three o'clock, and saw her - she called me aside and asked for 2 s. and said she would redeem the watch directly. I gave her 2 s., she went down, returned in a quarter of an hour, and said she had not got it, it would not be long, and I must give her 6 d. for something to drink - I did so; she went down, and in ten minutes brought me up the duplicate of the watch, pawned for 12 s. I said she must fetch it out, or I would trouble her about it; she said she would not and abused me - I left her, keeping the duplicate; she had put 4 d. in copper into my purse on the night of the robbery in the room of the silver. I had her taken next night - I was perfectly sober, I never gave her the watch. I had given her 3 s. 6 d., besides 2 s. for the room.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cross, pawnbroker, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. On the 14th of October, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, a young man pawned this watch, the duplicate produced corresponds with it.</p>

               <p>ANN FOX. I am servant at this house; the prosecutor came in with the prisoner, and gave me 1 s. to fetch some gin, and when I came back, he said he had no more money, he wound his watch up, and said</p>
               <p>"I will leave this watch for 12 s., you pawn it, and I will call for the ticket in the evening;" the money was 9 s. for her, and 3 s. for the room; she gave it to a young man to pawn. I do not know his name. The prosecutor did not pay me for the room. I went to bed at three o'clock - the young man brought the money for the watch between seven and eight; the landlady of the house had been out all night.</p>

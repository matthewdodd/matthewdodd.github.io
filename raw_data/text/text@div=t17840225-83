               <p>On the 21st of February, about half past ten o'clock, I was waiting at supper, on my mistress and her niece, and I saw, as I was removing the things, the prisoner rise from behind the counter, there was a glass partition, I was within the room; there were a dozen of candles in the shop: I told my mistress, and immediately opened the door and pursued the prisoner, I collared him when he was got out in the street about ten yards, he had just delivered something to another of his own size, who ran across the way, but what I cannot say; I said hold of him, I collared him, and said, what have you taken from behind the counter? then some gentlemen coming from the City Coffee-house surrounded us, but no person laid hold of him but myself, and I brought him back myself, and my mistress said the till was gone.</p>

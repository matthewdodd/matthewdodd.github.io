                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. There is a duplicate among these for two pairs of shoes, pledged by a person named Ann Bell, of No. 2, Chapman-street—I know Sarah Bell, but I have no recollection of her pledging that particular property—she has been in the habit of pledging at our shop for four or five months—these two table-cloths was pledged by a woman named Bell—I have two duplicates corresponding with those found in the oven—I cannot swear that she is the woman that pawned them—Lea gave me information of the robbery—I sent to the station-house to say that such property was pledged in the name of Bell and produced them at Lambeth-street on Monday last.</p>

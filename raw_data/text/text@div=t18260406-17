On the 28th of March the prisoner came into the shop and asked to see some yellow gloves, which I shewed him - he took off his hat, put it on the counter, with the top downwards; he then wished to see some drab ones; I went to the window for them, turning my back to him, and when I returned he had put his hat on; he said he would call again, and was leaving the shop, but I detained him and found two pair of gloves in it - they were part of the parcel I had shewn him; he ran out, I followed, took him, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. How long after you consider the prisoner had the gloves was it that you saw the officer? A. About ten minutes - I had thrown the gloves on the top of the parcel they came from, to follow him - I did not know him before - he came to buy half a dozen pair. I know these gloves to be the same as he took.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

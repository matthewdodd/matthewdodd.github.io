            . I am toll-keeper at Westbourne-green gate; I saw the prisoner on Friday morning, at half-past four o'clock, riding on one of these asses, and another person with him on another; the other man came and offered me 2d., but the toll being 4d. I refused to take it; he said sooner than pay 4d. he would go back, which they did; the prisoner was riding the smallest of the two asses. A gentleman named Roach came at eleven o'clock and asked if I had seen any asses; I told him - I saw the prisoner near the gate the same afternoon and knew him to be the man; he was secured; I have seen the donkeys since, and know them to be the same they were riding; I had not known the prisoner before.</p>

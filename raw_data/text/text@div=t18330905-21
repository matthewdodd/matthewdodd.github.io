On the 19th of July, I saw the prisoner, Goode, take a sieve of cherries off the stand - he took it to his basket, and Brandon emptied it into their basket, and Goode ran away with it on his head, leaving our basket behind - Brandon came walking by the stand - my uncle called him several times, he would not answer, and he went and collared him - Goode was brought back with the cherries.</p>

               <p>Brandon. I was helping a man there with a load; he said, Jacobs wanted me - I went to him, and he said,"Who pays for the cherries?" I said, I knew nothing about them; it is common to help each other to empty our fruit. Witness. Brandon did not attempt to go away; he said something about the person outside (Goode I suppose,) paying for them - Goode ran away directly he took them - Brandon did say he thought they were sold - my uncle said, "What have you done with the sieve of cherries?" and he said something about the other person settling it.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Jacobs. I went after Goode - he ran up Bear-alley with a basket of cherries on his head - I stopped him with them and made him carry them back.</p>
               <p>Brandon. Q. As I came here did you not say you believed I was innocent? A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Brandon's Defence. I went to the Borough-market to buy, and came to Farringdon-market with a young man who I always work with - I never work with this prisoner - when I was taken, I had no money, but my partner had the money and was in the act of buying two sieves of cherries of Jacobs at the time, my baskets stood just by - this prisoner asked me to help the cherries out, which I did; and then helped another man, with two sieves more, and I did not see where Goode was gone.</p>
               <p>JAMES VERYAN. They don't generally empty the fruit themselves - they look at it to see whether it is dry and sound; and if it is good - the basket belonged to Goode I suppose.</p>

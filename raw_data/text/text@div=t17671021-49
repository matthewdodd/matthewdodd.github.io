            . On the 24th of October, about eleven at night, the prisoner came and knocked at my door; my husband opened the door, he came in, and called for a pint of beer; he asked me if I wanted any sugar; my husband told him to bring it, and he would get somebody to buy it (thinking to get the Custom-house officers to take it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitt. The prisoner was employed as a lumper on board the ship; he solicited the captain to let him look after the lighter, which was loaded with part of the ship's cargo; he was put on board her, and after that he left his charge; I desired him to go to his duty; I and my brother officers missed him from his charge; at twelve at night a brother officer and I went on the lighter, and found some sugar in a lighterman's frock; the sleeves were done together, so as to hold a great quantity; we took it into the ship, we found a shovel lying by, and a good deal of sugar spilt; about two o'clock the prisoner was secured by an officer; he said he had been for a pint of beer, we found nothing upon him, but his clothes had sugar upon them.</p>

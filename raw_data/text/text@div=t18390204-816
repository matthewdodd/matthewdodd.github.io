                  </hi>. I was a waiter at the King's Head tavern, Islington, but have left. At a little after five o'clock in the morning, on the 23rd of January, I had been walking about all night—I had to call at a house that morning, and I went into the Three Hats, at Islington, to wait till I could go there—I was sober, but was fatigued, and I fell asleep on the form after I had been there an hour—there were some <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> men and some women there, but I do not remember seeing the prisoner—when I went to sleep I had nine sovereigns, a silver twopenny-piece, and one penny-piese, in my purse, in my trowsers pocket—I had some copper in my waistcoat pocket, but I do not know how much—I had a good hat on—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—when I awoke, about eight o'clock, my hat and money were all gone, except a few coppers, and an old hat was left in place of mine—the prisoner was taken the same evening—I know nothing of him.</p>

I work at a plasterer's, and have known the prisoner for four years—he lived near me—on the 23rd of January he called me out of doors, and asked whether I would go and pawn a hat for him—I said I did not mind—I went in doors and came out again, and then he asked if I would go and sell it in Petticoat-lane—I went there with him, and he sold it—after he had sold it he told me he had stolen that hat from a gentleman at the Three Hats, at Islington, and had left his old hat there—he said he took 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the gentleman's pocket, and that he got his hand under three</p>

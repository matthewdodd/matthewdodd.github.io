             (police-constable S 28). On the 23rd of April, the prosecutrix told me she had lost this property, and wished to have the prisoners taken, but they were not there then - the male prisoner came there that evening, and I took him in the room - I told him it was for robbing his furnished lodgings - I found these duplicates in the table drawer - as I was taking him to the station-house he ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you found some duplicates on him? A. Yes - but not relating to this property.</p>

               <p>Charles Beaumont's Defence. What was done by my wife was done at my request, so that I conceive she is innocent - with respect to myself, I was in difficulties, and was obliged to make use of the furniture to meet existing emergencies, not for a moment having an idea of robbing her - had she given me but one hour, I would have got money, redeemed the articles, and paid her great part of her rent - I went out that evening with a few shillings to get tools, and when I got home at half-past nine o'clock, she had missed the property, and gave me in charge - in going along I ran away to go to my wife, who was then on a visit.</p>

I saw a parcel at Crawley's house; It belonged to my master - it was 6lbs. 1os of tea; I had packed it up about half-past three o'clock, and placed it on the fourth counter from the door, I left my master in care of the shop; I came into the shop again in about twenty minutes and it was gone; it was to go to our other shop at the west end of the town - I was quite certain of it when I saw it again.</p>
               <p>GEORGE COOK. I am a constable. I apprehended Kirkham at Crawley's - the pracel of tea was there; I asked how he came by it: he said he had it from Mr. Summers, a carpenter, in Mare-street, Hackney - that he had it as part of a debt of 5s. for making a pair of trousers; I asked him his name, and he gave me the name of Kay - I went to Mare-street, but could find no Summers there; on Monday morning I took Furnley to Mr. Crawley's, and he claimed the tea.</p>

            . I can say this is the parcel I packed, for as I was tying it, one of the threads of the string broke, which I see here plainly - it was not entirely broken, but cracked - it corresponds in weight with the parcel I made up: I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Kirkham's Defence. I had it from a man who did some work for - I met him, and he said, "I cannot pay you money, but if you will take this tea, I will call and settle with you in about a fortnight;" if he gave me a false address, that is not my fault.</p>

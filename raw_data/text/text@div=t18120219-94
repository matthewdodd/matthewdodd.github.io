I told him to get out of the way, and with another shove drove him into the room; the passage is about six feet square; there were two women sitting in the parlour at a table, and I then endeavoured to shut the street door on purpose to secure the party that I suspected were in there, there being something under the door; I could not do it; Nathan turned round and halloaed out some expression in Dutch, which I did not know the English of; I immediately heard a violent bustle over my head. I took a light from the table and made towards the foot of the stairs; I saw a light in the one pair room, I observed a man coming out of the room; I halloaed out fall back immediately; before he could turn round I was upon his back, and he went into the room from whence he came. When I got in the room the door being very narrow, I stood in the centre of the door way, and put the candle down, and called

I then asked the prisoner Solomon if he knew any thing of the other two men; there were three persons in the room; Dearing was sitting on a chair: I asked Solomon if he knew how they came there; he said, he did not. I then asked Dearing how he came there; he said he had come to Mrs. Solomon, and she bid him go up stairs; I then asked Greaves how he came there; he told me that he was an acquaintance of Dearing's, and met with him by the way, and accompanied him there; I then addressed myself to Solomon. I thought it very extraordinary that these men should come in his mother's bed-room, and he did not know any of them; I then asked him if his mother was at home; he said she was not: she had been out on a visit some hours, he had but just come home from his master's; he was an apprentice; I told him it was extraordinary if he was an apprentice that he was always there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes; since the 1st of January; he is always there. The owner of the house has abscouded ever since the 2d of January for a barrel of mustard that was stolen; I then secured the prisoners, got assistance, and took them to the compter. I saw Levy there, I ordered him to aid and assist me; the prisoner Dearing was endeavouring to get out of the door; I pushed him back again, and tied Dearing and Greaves together; I then went and fetched the three reams of paper which were laying at the foot of the bed; I asked Solomon if he knew how that paper came there: he said he knew nothing at all about it; I produce the paper; I went to this house in consequence of information that two men had just gone in the house with a large swag.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same paper that I missed; I have got the following number, and the number preceding; I have a note from Mr. Cripps at the paper-mill. This is the same make and the same date and exact quantity that I missed.</p>

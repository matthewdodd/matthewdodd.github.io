            : They were all taken out of my bar in the sore room. This was about seven in the evening. In about 20 minutes after, being in the street, there were many people got together. A little boy said, he saw two thieves go along loaded. I went as directed by him, and overtook the prisoner and another man. I took him by the collar, and said, What have you got there? He said, An old hat that I found in the street, and produced Morgan's hat. I said, What have you else? He said, Two others which I picked up all over mud. They were mine, but not dirty at all. I value my hats at 10 s. and Morgan's at one.</p>

               <p>About half an hour after seven o'clock I went by that man's door. I stopping to make water, kicked against something. I stooped down. It happened to be three old hats. I took them up, and was going along, and he came and asked me what I had got, and I gave him them.</p>

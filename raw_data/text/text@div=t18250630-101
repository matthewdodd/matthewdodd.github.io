The prisoners came in together on Saturday, the 25th of June, and asked for some silk shawls; I showed them three or four - they all looked at them, and said they were too dear; one of them (I think Burke) then asked to look at some cotton shawls - I showed them some, which they said would not wash; Burke then asked me to shew them some lace: I showed them a box of lace, and on turning it out I saw Burke take one piece, and place it under the corner of Cottar's shawl, which laid on the counter; Burke had an apron on, which she folded up on the counter, and passed the lace from under the shawl, under the apron, and gave it to Bergin - they did not buy any lace from that box. Cottar asked to see some Urling's lace, but before I showed that I went and told Mr. Fry what I had seen - he placed himself behind them: I then showed them a box of Urling's lace, and they bought three yards, at 1 s. 6 1/2 d. per yard, which they paid for amongst them; I wrapped it up, and gave it to them, and as they were going out Mr. Fry told them to come back - they came back to the passage; Cottar and Burke stood on one side, and Bergin on the other. - Mr. Fry then accused them of having the lace, which they denied - he went for an officer, and I saw the lace laying on the ground, just by where Bergin stood, in the passage; I took it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the lace." Cottar fell on her knees, and offered me 10 s. to let them go, as she was married, and had two children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. And so though you saw a felony committed, you thought it right to sell lace, and take money? A. Yes, I did - they had been before that morning; I had not urged them to come back when they had sold their fish to buy a shawl.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BURKE'S Defence. We went into the shop in the morning, and bought an apron for 1 s. 6 d.; the shopman said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you want a shawl?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I have no money, we have laid out all our money in mackarel" - we went in again to look at a shawl, and he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Don't you want to buy a shawl;" we looked at them - Cottar then bought some lace, and as we were going out we were charged with taking this lace. I can be upon my oath that I had no shawl - he then said I had put it under Bergin's shawl. He took us into the back parlour, and then turned round, and found the lace by the back door; the man said at the office first that he saw her drop it, and then he said he only thought so.</p>
               <p>BERGIN'S Defence. I had but 14 s. 9 d. in my pocket, and the shawls were too dear. We looked at some lace; Burke bought three yards - I lent her 1 s., and Cottar lent her 2 s. - he said when we were going away, he saw her take the lace, and shift it to the other prisoner; he had enticed us all day, and said in the morning,</p>
               <p>"Go and turn your mackarel into money, and come and buy a shawl for to-morrow;" and when we came back he charged us with the robbery.</p>
               <p>COTTAR'S Defence. If the shopman spoke truly he cannot say that he saw me take the lace.</p>

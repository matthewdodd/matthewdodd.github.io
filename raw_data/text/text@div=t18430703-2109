                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant, and live at No. 2, Golden-square, in the parish of St. James. On the 19th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by the policeman springing a rattle—I looked out of window—the policeman said something—I west down directly, and found the prisoner lying under the table in my dining-room—I opened the door, let in the policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

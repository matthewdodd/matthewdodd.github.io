No; I went to the back parlour, and I found a pair of boots were there; I immediately brought them to him; he shewed me where; the boots were not finished; he said they wanted a stiffening at the heel; I said, the gentleman is in the parlour, you must go and shew him what they want; he went into the parlour; I took the boots in my hand, and I left them on the table, where the gentleman, Mr. Laird, my master's brother, was sitting at the time; the prisoner put his hand down the boot, and turned it down, and said it wanted a stiffening at the heel.

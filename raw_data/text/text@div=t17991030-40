             sworn. - I am a gangsman under Mr. Bolt: I was landing sugars on the 11th of October; there was one hogshead came in in a very bad state, the head was nearly out, and the hoops on the outside were all broke asunder; we took it as far from the scale as we could, that we might land other sugars, till we got a cooper; Bryant called to me, I went to his assistance immediately, he had hold of the prisoner at the bar by the collar; I saw the prisoner take his hat from his head, I saw him throw the sugar from his hat upon the ground; I immediately secured him, and told Bryant to pick up the sugar; Bryant put it in his apron till the officer took it from him; I compared the sugar with the sugar in the hogshead, it was exactly of the same kind; there was no other hogshead that he could have got it from. (The sugar produced).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There was one of the hogsheads that the head flew out, and a great deal of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300033"></xptr>sugar slipped, and the coopers asked me to lend them a hand to pick it up, and I put some into my hat to throw into the hogshead, and that young man came and knocked it out of my hat.</p>

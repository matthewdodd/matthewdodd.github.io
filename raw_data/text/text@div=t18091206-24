It was one evening in September, Wicks was with us, and the two prisoners, we met at Wicks's house we proceeded altogether to Hanworth park, we beat about for rabbits, we caught nothing. The two prisoners parted from us, they went towards Mr. Evans's rick yard; we stopped in Mr. Evans's field, about three hundred yards; we had not taken the nets up. In about half an hour they came towards us, they had some fowls, among which was a guinea fowl; I do not know what number, I did not see them, they were dead. One of them said, we have got them; Wicks said, I see you have, and if Evans had seen you he would have shot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that there was one guinea fowl among them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the fowls after this - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you any of the fowls - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they accuse you about stealing these fowls - A. Yes, they did, and then I told the truth, the same story as I do now. Coombes and Simpson went away with the fowls together.</p>

            . I am the lad that belongs to Mr. M'Beth's cart. I took up a bundle to White Hart-court, I ran after the cart; I saw my master making from the cart, and when I got to the cart the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120011"></xptr>was in the cart; I asked him what he wanted; he said, his parcel. I told him he did not want any parcel; he said, he did. He got out of the cart with a bundle under his arm; I followed him, and catched hold of him by the collar; we scuffled a bit. He threw the bundle into the cart; I still kept hold of him. He asked me to let him go as he had nothing; I told him he should not go until master came. I held him until master came, and then I told him of it. I saw him getting down out of the cart when I came to it.</p>
               <p>MR. NALDER. I was coming by, I took the prisoner in custody; I did not see the bundle, it never was in my possession; knowing the prisoner I secured him.</p>

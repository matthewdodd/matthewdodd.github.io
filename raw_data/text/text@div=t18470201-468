On the 23rd of Jan., about a quarter to eleven o'clock at night, I was in my shop, taking some watches from the window—I was leaning forward to reach them, and my head was close to the plate glass when I felt an immense blow, a sort of shock, at the window, and before I could collect myself there was a second, and then a third, and then the window went in with an immense crash—a large square of plate glass of great thickness was broken to atoms—a great number of watches fell out on the pavement—I immediately opened the door, and saw Wilson and Williams running from the window the moment I opened the door—I followed Wilson—he ran into the middle of the road, running in and out of the cab-stand—Williams dodged me and crossed me several times—at the corner of Holborn-hill a policeman stopped Wilson, in my presence, and at that moment I saw him throw a watch into the road—I turned round, followed Williams, and collared him—I had seen them both run away from the shop—the watch Wilson threw away is mine—I was in the act of taking</p>

I live in Chandler-street, Soho-square; on the 11th of August in the evening I went out to spend the evening, I had a brother come out of the country, we were going out together about eleven o'clock, we met with some brother upholsterers, and went to a public-house, and drank pretty freely till about one o'clock; going home alone I met a watchman in Gerrard-street, I invited him to drink a glass of gin; we went to the Two Blue Posts, and there drank two glasses of gin; about half an hour past one the two prisoners came in, they wanted me to go with them, and I refused it; I went out at the door, they followed me, and took me away to <placeName id="t17680907-49-crimeloc268">Banbury-street, St. Giles's</placeName>

            . My stand is in Gerrard-street, I saw the prosecutor about half an hour after one that night, he came to me as I was between Gerrard-street and Princes-street; he asked me if I would drink a glass of gin; I thanked him, we went to the Two Blue Posts; by the time we had drank the gin, the clock struck two, then the two girls at the bar were standing by the door (I knew them before;) I went and cried the hour, and left him there; about ten or eleven in the forenoon I was told the prosecutor had been looking for me; he came again in the afternoon, and asked me if I knew the two girls, saying, they had robbed him; I found them the Sunday after at the King's Arms; I said to Tine, Sal, you must go along with me to the watch-house; one of them said, I suppose it is for robbing the man; I called another watchman to my assistance, they went very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk or sober when you first met with him?</p>
               <p>Squire. He was not very drunk, I drank part of three quarterns of gin with him.</p>

               <p>Q. How many will you swear to?</p>
               <p>Squire. I drank eight pennyworths and two half quarterns, that was the most.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober, so as to form a judgment how drunk he was?</p>
               <p>Squire. I left him there, and the two girls with him; when I left him he was as sober as near as I can guess, as he is now.</p>

On the 27th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked to look at a pair of ear-rings; I took the tray from the window, and shewed them to her; after looking at them some time, she said she would call again on Monday: I then missed a pair of ear-rings from the tray which she had been looking at - I said I missed a pair of ear-rings which I was confident were there when she came in; she said she had not got them - she asserted that over and over again; I still stated that I was sure she had got them; she had a pocket-handkerchief in her hand, and I asked her if she would shake that, as probably she had taken them up in a mistake; she shook it, and said "It is not here - it is not here;" and if they had fallen then I must have heard them; she was then shuffling her foot on the ground, and I asked her to move from the counter, as probably they had fallen; she moved a little backwards, and as she moved she scraped her foot again, and got these ear-rings to the step of the door, which was not far from where she stood; she then stooped, snatched them up, and ran away; I got from behind the counter, and gave an alarm - she ran to Castle-street, which is about thirty or forty yards off, and there she was taken; I ran after her as fast as I could, and was not far from her when she was taken: I have never seen the ear-rings since, but I am positive and certain that I saw her take them from the ground, and run away with them.</p>

            . I live in the Almonry, Westminster. On the night of the 6th of April I met the prisoner coming up the passage into the Almonry - he asked me to go with him, but I would not; he then asked me to go and have some supper - we went to a cook-shop, in <placeName id="t18310407-282-crimeloc1499">Tothill-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you make any alarm in the shop? A. No; but I felt your hand in my pocket, and you took hold of my hand immediately - I told you I missed it when I got on the step; there was a hole in my pocket, but the paper could not get through it - the Policeman did not give me a half-crown in the watch-house to try it, and it went through.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in New-way, Westminster. On the night of Tuesday, the 5th, or rather on Wednesday morning, the 6th of April, I saw the prisoner being taken to the watch-house - I followed him, and saw him put his hand up as if he was going to put it into his waistcoat pocket; I then saw his hand drop, and saw this paper laying twisted up on the ground - I went up to the watch-house, and heard the charge - the prisoner was then set at liberty; I was going back, and the prisoner came to near the same place where I had seen the paper lay - he seemed to be looking about for something, or I should not have thought of looking; I then looked, and found this paper, with half a crown in it - this was in about seven or eight minutes after I first saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken to the watch-house, and this man followed - what money I had about me, which was some copper, was returned to me; I stripped, dressed again, and as I was going away this man stooped down, and said, "I have picked up half a crown;" I was then taken back - the Policeman gave her a half-crown, and it fell through a hole in her pocket - it was a French pocket, in front of her apron; Bartholomew swore he saw me put my hand into my pocket.</p>

            . They did take down that you put your hand into your pocket, but I put up my finger, and said, "No, Sir;" I repeated what I had said, that I saw your hand as if you had put your hand into your pocket, but I saw nothing drop - I saw the paper on the ground; I never saw the prosecutrix till that evening; I heard of the charge as I sat in my own house - I went out, and followed him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met this girl of the town; she wanted the to go home and sleep with her; I said I had a wife and three children - there was a woman in company with her in the shop, who said, "I know him to be married, so go about your business."</p>

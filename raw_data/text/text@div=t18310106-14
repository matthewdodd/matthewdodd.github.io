            . I am a constable of Portsoken ward. On the 16th of December I saw the two prisoners in company together, in Basinghall-street, going towards Fore-street - I watched them; Mr. Pullen and a lady were coming from Fore-street, towards them - they crossed the road, and turned back after them; I followed them up Old Jewry, across Cheapside, into <placeName id="t18310106-14-crimeloc84">Bow-lane</placeName>

               <p>Pearce. Q. Did you not state at Guildhall that you did not see the handkerchief taken from the pocket, but another gentleman saw it? A. No, I said I saw it taken; the Alderman asked for the gentleman who called out.</p>
               <p>Curter. He said another gentleman saw it taken, but he did not. Witness. I never said so.</p>

            . I live at No. 80, Fore-street, and am a student at Cambridge. I was walking down Bow-lane with a lady; somebody called out that I had lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060016"></xptr>my handkerchief - I did not perceive it go; I felt and missed it - it was afterwards shown to me by the officer.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Pearce's Defence. I have no knowledge whatever of Carter; I never saw him before; I had been to Bennet's, in Chiswell-street, and was not in his company.</p>
               <p>Carter's Defence. I was going down Bow-lane, to my master's, Cull's printing-office, to see if there was any work for me - Morgan collared me, and charged me with this; I know nothing of Pearce.</p>

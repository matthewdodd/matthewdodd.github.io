            . I am a coal-merchant. On the 2nd of July, (the opening of the new Hungerford market,) I was riding over Westminster-bridge - I observed the prisoners pressing rather close upon the prosecutor's heels - I suspected them, turned my horse round, and watched them - they followed him up one side of the bridge, and crossed over when he did - and directly he got over, I saw Wheatley distinctly take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to Taylor - I rode on and told the prosecutor - I got off my horse, and took both the prisoners - a crowd assembled, and the handkerchief was taken from Taylor's trowsers pocket - he said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a crowd of persons? A. Yes; more persons than usual were on the bridge - I can positively swear to them - I cannot be mistaken - there were a number of persons on the bridge looking at the ceremony of the market being opened.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. I never saw Wheatley in my life before I was taken - I picked up the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. POPE. Q. You say there was a considerable crowd on the bridge when you observed them pick the pocket - do you think it was possible for you during the time you got off your horse, to lose sight of the prisoners so long as not to be able to be certain of them again? A. I was watching them from one end of the bridge to the other- I have not a doubt of them.</p>

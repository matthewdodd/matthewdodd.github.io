            . I have lived with Mr. Harvey two years. I do not sleep there, but serve in his shop; I have known the prisoner about three months; this pot is my master's - the prisoner asked me for it, and I gave it to him, and a great many other things; he often asked me before I gave him any thing; these are things master dealt in; I used to give them to him at master's gate, close to the shop - he asked me a long while before I gave him any thing; I never got a farthing for them - he had the butter and cheese on Monday; he paid me nothing for them; he once gave me some grapes, but nothing else; after I had given him a few things, I was frightened. This began about three months ago - he used to talk to me, and then ask me for things; I had no part of the produce; I have dined with him sometimes on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you come to me, and ask if I would have some tobacco and several other things? A. No; I gave him the pot at the hedge, and the butter at the gate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He brought them to me; I did not steal them; he gave them to me sometimes at the gate - I asked if there was any danger - he said No, he had paid for them.</p>

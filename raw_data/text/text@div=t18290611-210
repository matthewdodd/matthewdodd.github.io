               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You of course paid him all you owed him, and there was a balance struck? A. He owes me something now; he left a cage and two birds at my counting-house, and wished me to buy them for 12s., but I refused; I had a dispute with him, and discharged him, but he said he was in distress, and should feel obliged if I would give him a few days employ, and I sent him on messages; I cannot swear how long I kept him; at the time he brought the cage a captain was there who had paid him money which he had not handed to me, and I told him to leave the counting-house and never come again; I do not think he remained with me a single day after that - a gentleman once gave him an old sofa for his attention to him at the docks; I cannot now recollect whether that ever came into my possession, so many things pass in the course of a twelvemonth - if I did, I gave it to one of the men, at the docks - but it is a trifling circumstance, and I cannot say whether I had it or not; I only say, if it was given to the prisoner, it was given away again to some of the men, and I must have given him a compensation for it; I have had many such things in my possession; I do recollect something about one, but what it was I do not know; it was not worth 5s. - it was an Indian couch, they are sold at 10s. new; I remember one was given to him, but whether I ever had it I cannot say; I did not authorise him to receive money generally, but I have sent him for money, and if any was brought to the counting-house he received it; I cannot say whether I told the Magistrate he was not authorised; he did receive small sums such as 1l. or 2l.; I know Captain

            , he was not on board the Wellington; I have a hundred small accounts, and cannot recollect them all; I have no recollection of desiring him to borrow money on my account for dock charges - but it is common with us, if we want to ship goods in a hurry, to borrow money till the morning to pay the dock charges.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner ever demand any thing as due by you to him? A.Never; I made this charge about a week or a fortnight after he left.</p>

             WEBBER. I live at No. 48, Chiswell-street, Finsbury. I carried a letter, containing money, to the prisoner; the letter appeared to me to contain money - I felt money in it: I staid while it was opened; it was from Mrs. Thacker, directed to Mr. Taylor - I took it to the East India Chambers, Leadenhall-street, which was Mr. Taylor's counting-house; I delivered the letter to the prisoner, and was in the counting-house when it was opened: I did not positively see him open it- I said I had brought that letter for Mr. Taylor, and I was to take a receipt back for it; he said Mr. Taylor was not there, but my paying it to him would be quite right, the same as if I paid it to Mr. Taylor - he gave me a stamped receipt; I brought it home, and gave it to the lady who gave me the letter - she was in town then; it was Mrs. Thacker's mother; I never read it myself; I did not know what the sum was - I am sure I gave Mrs. Thacker's mother the same paper I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He might have passed off as Mr. Taylor to you, if he had chosen? A. yes; I felt something like money in the letter and heard it jink - I knew it was money; I am sure he is the person to whom I gave it, and who gave me the receipt.</p>
               <p>JANE MANSON. I am Mrs. Thacker's mother. I myself brought the money down to my daughter to put into the letter; I do not know whether I saw her put it in -I was in the room when she wrote the letter; I brought it to London, delivered it to Webber, and told her to take it to the East India chambers, Leadenhall-street -I know it contained money; Webber took it out, returned, and gave me a paper, which Mr. Taylor has got(looking at it); this is the man's receipt for it - I am certain it is the paper Webber brought me (read).</p>
               <p>August 1, 1828. Received of Mrs. Thacker the sum of 13l. 7s. 10d. amount of bill delivered for

               <p>MR. TAYLOR. The whole of this receipt is the prisoner's hand-writing; he never accounted to me for this sum - I never knew it had been in his possession till this was discovered.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that his salary was 1l. a week, but he at times received but 5s. which was an inducement to commit crime; that he had been in possession of the prosecutor's monies for a considerable time, but always accounted for them when called upon to do so; that he had not taken money with the intention of embezzlement, for a sum was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110096"></xptr>due to him as salary, and that the prosecutor had offered to drop the prosecution for 35l.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, living in Cumberland-row, St. Pancras. On the 23rd of October the prisoner came to my shop, and stated, that he wanted two gallons of gold-size, six quarts of turpentine, 7lbs. of white lead, and 4lbs. of ivory-black, for a Mr. Townsend, a coachmakers, at New-street-mews, Bermondsey-street, and if I could put them up and send my boy, the money should be returned for them, or the goods—I put up the things for him, they are articles used by coachmakers, and amounted to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent my boy, George Wa<lb></lb>ters, with them, and the prisoner accompanied him in the cart—I told the boy not to leave the goods without the money—I only knew Towns<lb></lb>end by name—I had had no dealings with him—I had no intention to part with the goods to the prisoner in any way without receiving the money for them—he is a person without a home.</p>

I am now in the employ of Mr. Loveland, a butcher in Theobald's-road.—On the 23rd of October I was in the prosecutor's em<lb></lb>ploy—on that day some articles were put into the cart to be taken by me and the prisoner—I knew him by sight by coming to my master's shop—we went together in the cart—he at first said he was going to Mr. Towns<lb></lb>end's, but before we got there he said he was going somewhere else—be told me which way to drive—he did not tell me the party's name—I drove to Paddington—when we got there he told me to stop—I did so—he got some parcels out of the cart which had been put in at my master's and took them into a work-shop or counting-house—he came back again without the parcels—the others were in the cart—he then told me to drive to Mr. Towns<lb></lb>end's—he told me to stop at New-street mews, Dorset-square—he took the cans and went into Mr. Townsend's with them—I staid at the top of the mews three quarters of an hour—he did not come back—I went round to the end of the mews near to Mr. Townsend's to see if I could see him—I saw him—he came back and asked me if I would have anything to drink—we went and had something to drink—I afterwards went back to the mews—he then said he should go down to Mr. Townsend's, he should not be a minute, Mr. Townsend had not come in—I waited there about half an hour—he did not come back—I went down to Mr. Townsend's to see if he was there, but could not find him—I next saw the prisoner on the 17th of January, in Greek-street, Soho—he said, "That was a pretty case that night, it was a bad job"—I said yes—he said he had paid Mr. Furniss three parts and he was going to work the other out.</p>

I had the misfortune to lose a sovereign that Saturday night; I went to my sister's to get a sovereign; she happened to be out of town for ten days; and when I came back the boy was gone.</p>

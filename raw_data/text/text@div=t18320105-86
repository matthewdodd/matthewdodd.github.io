On the night of the 7th of December I was in the room adjoining my shop; the door was wide open - the prisoner Beringer, I think, came in, and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco: his voice exactly corresponds, and his dress is the same - I stooped down to serve him, and when I got up he was gone with my bacon; I had not seen it removed -I followed, and saw the person who had been in my shop joined by another person; I followed two persons, both running down Scott-street, leading into Hare-street-fields- I then fell down, and lost sight of them: I then called Stop thief! the weight of the bacon was 20 lbs.</p>

               <p>Beringer. I never entered the shop. Witness. Yes, you are the person who asked for the tobacco; there was no one in the shop but you - I am confident you are the lad.</p>

I was near the shop on this night; I saw Beringer looking through the window - I went into a house opposite; there were two men with Beringer - I came into the street afterwards, and heard Mrs. King give an alarm, about a quarter before nine o'clock; my attention was directed to Scott-street - when Beringer was brought back, he said at first that he knew nothing about it, but when he saw me, he said I could not prove that he had it; he said he had not been in the street - I said, "Was not you here when I came up?" and then he acknowledged he was in the street.</p>
               <p>Beringer. It is in my way home: Waring was on the other side - I said, "Good night," and he went up to his master's. Witness. He said to me, "Halloo! Cock-tail, there you are."</p>

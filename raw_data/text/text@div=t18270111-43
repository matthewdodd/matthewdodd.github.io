            . On the 6th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another person walking along Fenchurch-street; a boy was dragging a truck with a large basket in it - I saw the prisoner cross to the truck and take out a square paper parcel; he crossed to the opposite side of the way, and delivered it to his companion, who went over to him - he crossed to the truck a second time; but the boy saw him, and he went away - the boy called Stop thief! I followed him, and never lost sight of him till the officer took him - I am certain he is the person that took the parcel - his companion got away with it.</p>

I looked at my watch a quarter before nine on the 11th of November; I was crossing the passage from the parlour to the bedroom, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs with a bundle; he dropt it on the stairs; he said nothing to me; he came to me; he came to the bottom of the stairs, and I collared him, and cried, Brother, brother, a thief, a thief, a thief! He gave me a blow on the breast, and ran out of the house; he left the bundle behind him. My brother pursued him immediately; he was brought back in less than ten minutes. I am positive the prisoner is the person who ran out of the house. The street-door is always open on account of the shop; he ran out at that door; the parlour door was open, and I had a candle in my hand, so that there was light both ways. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house; the constable has the bundle.</p>

               <p>I live in Eagle-street; I am a housekeeper. On the 13th of November, about a quarter before nine, I was sitting in my parlour, I heard my sister cry out, Brother, brother, a thief! I got up, and ran out; I saw the prisoner in the passage running out; I had a very good view of him, because there is a very good light; my sister had a candle in her hand. I pursued him into Holborn; as he turned the corner of Dean-street I lost sight of him; that may be 20 yards. Mr. Walker stopped him in Holborn. I went up to them. The prisoner is the man that I saw run out of the house. When he was brought back, he said, he was not the man. He was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>- WALKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I heard the alarm before he ran out about a quarter of a minute; the man that came out of the house came out stumbling; he ran past me; I endeavoured to lay hold of him, but I missed him the first time; I then followed him down Dean street about threescore yards; I seized him in Holborn by the skirt of his coat; he struck back at me; I caught his arm, and held him by that arm and his collar; he swore at me, and asked what I wanted; I told him, I did not want him, it was those who called after him that wanted him. Mr. Cutt then came up; he was secured, and brought back. I never was three yards from him.</p>

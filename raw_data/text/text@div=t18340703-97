            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and took him - I found these articles in a box, under the bedstead - he said it was his bedstead, and I found him in that room - he said the goods belonged to Mr. Calisher, his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say that before the magistrate? A. Yes; I think I did - I believe what I said was read over to me - both Mr. Calisher and Mr. Levin were present when the prisoner said so.</p>
               <p>JACOB NATHAN CALISHER. This is my property - I had discharged the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to say you did not know where the prisoner lived? A. I did not, till I was sent for by Mr. Levin, and we went to his house - I did not owe the prisoner any thing at that time; he had summoned me for his wages before that; when I asked him what his wages were, he said 4l. 9s. - I said it was 3l. 17s. 6d. - he said that was not right, and he went away and summoned me - he said Mr. Alexander was by when I agreed with him, but he was not - he summoned me, and he had to pay the costs - he left me on the 25th of April - I found these things about six weeks afterwards - some of them have my mark on them - I might have sold some of these things with my mark on them.</p>

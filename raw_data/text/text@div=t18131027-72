               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Fraser in King-street - A. Yes; Mr. Fraser was on the left hand side of the way; I saw a mob; I went, and asked what was the matter; I saw Mr. Fraser; I was going away; Mackdonald said, he would take Mr. Fraser to the watchhouse; Mr. Oxberry said, he would sooner give a guinea for a bed than Mr. Fraser should go to the watchhouse; Mr. Fraser fell down, the seals of his watch were not outside his chain could be seen. I took the watch to give it to Mr. Oxberry, Mackdonald, the watchman, seized hold of the watch; he said, give it to him; I said, nobody should have it but Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald had hold of the watch, he took the watch out of my hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure Mackdonald took the watch out of your hands - A. Yes; I intended to give it to Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald was stronger than me, he took it. I said, you, nor no one else should have it than Mr. Oxberry; I said to Mr. Oxberry, here is the chain and seals, Mackdonald has got the watch. Mackdonald, at the watchhouse, said he knew nothing of it; he then said he had it, and somebody took it from him. When he denied having the watch, I said I have got the chain and seals, the watchman has got the watch; he said, no, he had not; I shall charge you for robbing the man. A girl, was standing by, she said, what is this on your finger; that was the ring that parted the chain from the watch.</p>

            . I am a performer at Drury-lane. On the 28th of September, between eleven and twelve, I was in King-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last witness there - A. Not there; I saw him, but not his features, until he came to the watchhouse. Mr. Fraser was there. I came up while the mob was about him; I saw a number of persons assembled at the window of a watch-maker's shop, that is the corner of Orange-street; I asked the reason of their being assembled there; a watchman said, it was a gentleman who had been dining at the O. P. and P. S. tavern, and was very much in liquor. I said, if that is the case, I must know the gentleman; I had been dining there also; the O. P. is in Russell-court, Drury-lane. I immediately looked down, and saw Mr. Fraser upon the ground; I told him who I was, and requested him to get up; with the assistance of some persons he was raised from the ground. I asked the watchman what they meaned to do with him; they said, take him to the watch-house. I replied, there was no necessity for that: there was a public-house a few doors from the place where we then were, they perhaps might get a bed there; if not, it would be better to deposit what property he had about him, and send him home in a coach; if not, they could convey him a part of the way home, as far as their best extend, and then give him in charge of two others. I also offered to reward them for so doing; I don't know whether I mentioned the sum; they said, no, and persisted in taking him to the watchhouse; I followed, and we had got into Hart-street; I think Mr. Fraser said, take care of my watch; a voice said, you had better give it to Mr. Oxberry, who seems to be the only person who knows any thing of you, and several others said, aye, do; many more persons now had come up, and I was removed from Mr. Fraser about two arms-length; a minute or two now elapsed. I saw the chain that I imagined belonged to Mr. Fraser's watch held out towards me; I had not got near enough to lay hold of that chain; some one held the other part very tight, the watch end, with a little force; I got possession of the watch-chain without the watch, no watch attached to it; there then was a scuffle; I exclaimed, I had got possession of the chain without the watch. A watchman, I will not say it was the prisoner, demanded of me the chain, and appendages, the seals; I don't know who that watchman was, as they meaned to take Mr. Fraser to the watchhouse; I there delivered it up.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know who had got the watch - A. No, I do not. A watchman proceeded to force me, I pushed him from me; I cannot say the watchman's name; two watchman seized me very forcible; we now came to the watchhouse, leaving Mr. Fraser behind, he was still in custody of some other watchmen. I deposited the chain and seals at the watch-house, in the custody of Mr. Davis, the constable of the night. A person, whom I understand his name to be Farthing, that man is here; he came into the watchhouse not in charge; he came with a number of other persons; he there accused the prisoner of forcing the watch from the chain, while he was in the act of giving it to me; he threw off his watchman's coat in a violent manner, and said, search me; a general search took place; this watch was not found. He then gave charge of Farthing, and said, he had stolen the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Fraser and Mr. Oxberry coming to the watchhouse - A. Perfectly well. Mackdonald brought in Mr. Oxberry, he said, he had got the gentleman's property; I saw in Mr. Oxberry's hand a gold chain and seals. The prisoner said to Mr. Oxberry, I'll have it; Mr. Oxberry said, you d - d rascal, you shall not; a scuffle ensued; I am not certain whether Mr. Oxberry struck the watchman, or not. After peace was obtained, the watchman held out a ring to me, he said, that was the gentleman's property; after that Mr. Oxberry handed me over the chain and seals; then a person of the name of Farthing came in, he said to Mackdonald, you are the watchman that has got the gentleman's watch; Mackdonald declared he had not; I searched him; there was not less than sixty persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270051"></xptr>searched; no watch was found. I desired Mr. Fraser might he put to bed.</p>

            . I am the watchhouse-keeper's daughter. I was at the watchhouse this night; Mackdonald brought Mr. Oxberry in with the chain in his hand; Farthing came in, said he handed the watch over to Mr. Oxberry. Mackdonald charged Farthing and Mr. Oxberry with robbing Mr. Fraser; Mr. Fraser was brought in; no watch was found about him. Mackdonald was still holding his hand out, still persevering that Farthing and Mr. Oxberry had stolen the watch. I saw a ring on the watchman's finger; I asked what it was; he said, it was the ring that belonged to the gentleman's chain, the watch had been wrenched out of his hands, he could not tell by who.</p>

            . On the 28th of September, in my way home, facing the upper end of King-street, in Hart-street, I saw ten or twelve people together; I saw Mr. Fraser intoxicated, I saw Mr. Oxberry speak to him; I saw Farthing take Mr. Fraser's watch, and hand it to Mr. Oxberry. I persuaded Farthing to give the watch to the watchman; Farthing said, he did not know the watchman. I said, nor do I know you; we will soon know who the watchman is. He said, he would deliver it to no one but Mr. Oxberry, as he was Mr. Fraser's friend; Mr. Oxberry came near, Farthing extended his hands towards Mr. Oxberry with the watch; the watchman collared Farthing, and demanded the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the watchman got the watch or no - A. No, I did not see in whose hand the watch fell. I am sure Mackdonald is the watchman that collared Farthing, and demanded the watch.</p>

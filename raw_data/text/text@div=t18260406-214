            . I am an attorney, and am acquainted with the hand-writing of the prisoner. I have seen her write three times, and have numbers of her letters in my possession; the first time I saw her write was in December last - I have a sufficient knowledge of her writing to swear to it. I believe the signature "M. A. Ducket" to this register, to be her writing.</p>

No - there is certainly a great similarity; the a is turned over in the same way, but there is a difference. The only time I ever saw her write was when she came to agree upon the terms of separation from Mr. Truss - I saw her sign the deed, but I have letters which came from her.</p>

            . I was a painter. I remember the prisoner and Thomas Lloyd, but I did not know him before he was married; I was at the Yorkshire Stingo tea-gardens about 1812, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew as Ducket's daughter, as I had lived opposite to her - she spoke to me, and asked how I did, and said she was married; I asked to whom - she said to Lloyd, the baker - I think she said that day, but I cannot be positive; while I was talking I heard somebody say, "Mr. Lloyd, there is Mr. Jackson joking with your wife - will you stand that?" I turned round, and saw three bakers standing together, but I did not know Lloyd; he was pointed out to me afterwards. Lloyd is now in Court (pointing him out). I do not know where they lived afterwards, nor do I know that ever I saw them walking together. I cannot say whether this is the man I saw at the gardens.</p>

            ; they lodged with me about a week. They both came again the following year, after he had made a voyage to the East Indies - they then staid a fortnight or three weeks. She came there again the following year, and went by the name of Bligh. I have seen her write frequently, and know well the character of her hand-writing. I think her present writing is much better than that in this register, but as far as I can judge, I think this is her writing - I believe this letter to be her writing (looking at one); I believe Bligh was mate of a ship - I was given to understand that after he went to sea, the first time, she was a companion to a lady of the name of Truss, in Claremont-place; she said that she was companion to her, on account of her being deranged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Upon your oath is there not a considerable difference between the hand-writing you have sworn to, and the hand-writing in this book? A. I think her hand considerably improved, but I still think it is her hand-writing. I did not know any thing of her writing till 1822. I do not know whether she did live with a lady of the name of Truss or not; she went by the name of Bligh only when I saw her write.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did she say she was going back to this woman? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. YATES. I am the wife of John Yates. I have seen the prisoner write; I think the signature in the register is her writing. I believe this letter to be her writing; I have seen Bligh - he appeared to be a respectable man - he was mate of an Indiaman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not her writing a much better hand than that? A. Yes, it is now; the name I saw her write was Bligh - there is no similarity in the names. I had no knowledge of her writing in 1814. I think this name "Thomas Lloyd" is her writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does she write a better hand now than she did at the date of these letters? A. Yes, I think she does - her present hand-writing is much better than this in the book.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was 5s. thrown down by the sailor, a fellow of the name of Lloyd took up the money, and the sailor took the lady? A. Yes, the landlord took the money - I think that is ten years ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever paid her one shilling? A. No; we lived together for two years before we were married, and after we were married, for four years; we lived very comfortably for the two years, but not so afterwards; our acquaintance first commenced in the street - we first lived in Chalton-street, and afterwards at the Polygon in Somers-Town; I did not know but that she was the window of Captain Bligh - I did not know a person of the name of Bligh; I have not taken any proceedings in Doctor's Commons; my object in bringing forward this prosecution is not merely to get rid of the marriage.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. When was the settlement made? A. In the latter end of last year - I had not, till after the deed was executed, the slightest reason to believe that she had deceived me - she conducted herself properly before our marriage, and it was her solicitation that induced me to marry her; she represented herself as the daughter of Mr. Graham, brother of Sir J. Graham, who was first cousin to the Lonsdale family - she mentioned Lady Styles and Mr. Bosanquet as relations on her mother's side - she spoke of a rich aunt of the name of Hearn, but did not say what her expectations were - it was not my proposal, but her urgent request that I should marry her; she frequently went away from me on visits - the trustee for her, under the settlement, was Captain Atkinson, the commander of the schooner St. Helena - he frequently visited at our house after the marriage.</p>

            . I live in Bouverie-street, and am a silversmith. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Truss; I knew the prisoner about ten days after her marriage with him - she represented herself as the widow of Captain Bligh, and neice of Lady Stiles and Mr. Bosanquet; I went down to Bognor with the officer last Saturday four weeks, and found her in bed with Captain Atkinson - the officer drew back the curtain and saw them; I accompanied them to town - she was very free in talking - there was no threat or promise held out to her; she said she was married to Lloyd, and she would not deny it, but she had been sold by him to a sailor of the name of Bligh, for 5s. and a bottle of wine.</p>
               <p>A letter was here read from the prisoner, directed to Thomas Lloyd, Pershore, Worcestershire Signed, Elizabeth Lloyd, dated Feb. 14, 1816. Also the address and signature of a letter read, dated Broadstairs, July 19, 1822, addressed to W. H. Truss, Esq., East India-house, London, Signed, E. W. Truss. The contents of these letters (which are those proved to be the prisoner's hand-writing) did not relate to any matters connected with this case, but were only produced to prove the prisoner had avowed herself by the names signed to them.</p>

            . Q. Did you say it was more than twelve years since you heard of the death of her father? A. No; I dare say it is between eleven and twelve years since I heard of it from Mrs. Ducket - she did not say how long he had been dead.</p>

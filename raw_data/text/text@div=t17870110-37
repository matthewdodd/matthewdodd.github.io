               <p>On Monday, the 1st of January, about five minutes before eight; I was not up, but I was awake; I heard Mrs. Figgess, my lodger, unlock her kitchen door, and come up stairs; she went along the passage, and opened the street door, and went out; she shut it after her in a minute; somebody came and opened the street door, and went softly down stairs, I concluded it was her, and I wondered she should go down so softly; I heard nobody speak, nor any thing afterwards, till Mrs. Figgess came back, and came into the passage, and she called out who is there? nobody answered; at last, I heard her say, who do you want? what business have you to go down into my place? I heard somebody say, you must go down into Castle-street; she said she knew nobody there; she said he had been robbing her; I heard a bustle in the passage; she immediately called out, three or four times, Mr. Robinson! I jumped out of bed and opened my door, and went into the passage, and I saw the prisoner and her struggling against the street door, and the street door was shut; I then went and laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him into my place; we searched him, but found nothing; she went down, and came up again, and said she was robbed; she then went back and fetched in the bag; I took the prisoner into my room; I did not see where the bag lay; I live in the parlour; I took him to the round-house; he wished me to go to his wife, to let her know; he said he lived in Tennis-court, Middle-row, Holborn, No. 1. I asked his wife if Mr. Dunn was within, she said no; he told me his name was Dunn at the Justice's; he said he never saw the bag, but that his wife sent him after a washerwoman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. He gave you a true account of his name, and where he lived? - He did.</p>

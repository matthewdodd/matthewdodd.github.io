             sworn. - I am a broker at Fulham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time meet with Hibbert and Jones, at Fulham? - A. Yes; the day the King set off for the Nore, Wilson came to me, and I went with him, about six in the evening, to the Golden-lion door, there I saw Hibbert, he asked me, if I would buy some coach-glasses, I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100046"></xptr>him the sizes of them, he said, Wilson had got the sizes upon a piece of paper, which he had; I then went with him and Wilson to my own house, which was next door; I looked at the sizes of them, I asked him, what he asked for them; he asked me four guineas for them; I told him, I thought four guineas too much, for I should get nothing by them, if I sold them; I offered him three guineas for them; he said, he could not take it; he and

             both went away together into the Golden-lion; he said, he had taken them in trade, and could not take it, he had allowed more money for them; he and Wilson went to the Golden-lion, and I went over to my mother's, which was opposite; in about a quarter of an hour, Wilson came to me to tell me I should have the glasses for three guineas; I came out at my mother's door with Wilson, and Hibbert was over at the Golden-lion door; he told me I should have them for three guineas, and he desired Wilson to go with him to help him bring them; Jones was then at the Golden-lion; they went for them, and in about a quarter of an hour they returned, or less; they had above a mile to go to fetch them; they brought the glasses, each of them brought four; we all went to the Golden-lion, I had nothing but a pound note in my pocket, and I asked Mr. Poney to lend me two guineas and a half; he went to his wife, and brought me two guineas, was going to tell the silver down, and I told him six shillings would do; I went and called Hibbert, Wilson came with him to the bar-door in the passage; I paid Hibbert two guineas, a pound note, and one shilling; I went in and drank with Hibbert, Jones, and Wilson; the next morning, I had some business in Town, I packed them up, and brought them with me; I took them first to Mr. Knight's, in Compton-street, he was not at home, and I took them to Mr. English's, and sold them to him for 3l. 8s.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Poney). Q.Was there any body else in the tap-room besides these people? - A. Yes; thirteen or fourteen people; I had a great number of lodgers in the house, and most of them were at home.</p>
               <p>South cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Can you give the Gentlemen of the Jury any reason why you called these people out of the tap-room to conclude your bargain? - A. Not to lay it before so many people. Mr. Poney was in the bar, but was called away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you call these people out of the tap-room? - A. I was receiving the money from Mr. Poney, when Hibbert was coming out; I said, here you may as well take your money; he received it at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he did not receive it in the passage? - A. Yes; the bat is in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you give any account of these glasses? - A. As soon as I heard that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sent for by the officers of Bow-street? - A. No, I was not; I came voluntarily; I sent word to Mr. Cloud, that I had had some coach-glasses through my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you had bought them cheap, and had bought them at a sale? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell Mr. English so? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know Jones had any thing to do with this business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Jones was not present during any part of the conversation of what was to be given for the glasses? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any conversation passed about the glasses, while you were with Jones? - A. No; none, till after they were paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in coach-glasses? - A. I deal in looking-glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy any coach-glasses before? - A. I have bought a post-chaise glass of a neighbour, which I took with me to Mr. English's, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When was it you had first any knowledge that these glasses were stolen? - A. I heard that Hibbert was taken up for receiving coach-glasses, and Jones for stealing them; and I sent the very same day that I heard of it, to Mr. Cloud, to let him know that some had gone through my hands, this was on the Saturday, and on the Sunday Mr. Cloud came to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Before you sent to Mr. Cloud, had you been sent for to give an account of these glasses? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for brokers to buy various kinds of articles that they can buy and sell again, without confining themselves to any thing particular? - A.Certainly;</p>
               <p>THOMAS ENGLISH sworn. - I am a looking-glass manufacturer: The latter end of October or beginning of November, I bought some coach-glasses of Mr. South, I cannot say the number, but I think it was 3l. 10s. I gave him for the whole; the glasses were put down in the shop; I had some carpenters at work, and they had been moved about from place to place in the shop, till Mr. Cloud called for them; I afterwards delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 3l. 10s. a fair price for them? - A. Yes; I would not have given more for them, because I am a manufacturer myself, and they wanted working over again. (Seven of the glasses were produced).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you recollect the account that South gave you of where he had got them? - A. Yes; he came to my house, and brought them down in a box in a cart; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100047"></xptr>him, how did you come by them; says he, I am a broker, and bought them at a sale.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that a very reasonable thing, and you purchased them of course? - A. Yes; or I should not have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they with frames, or without frames? - A.Without frames.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilson.) Q. How were they when they where brought from Hibbert's, had they any frames upon them? - A. No frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they no frames when you first searched them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cloud. I have no doubt but these are my glasses, they every one sit the places that they came from.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But the frames are gone? - A. I have made an allowance for the frames, and they sit within a quarter of an inch, all of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You know that a quarter of an inch may make the difference between almost an hundred different glasses? - A. No; you might try half the coaches in London, and not find them sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could have picked them out from others? - A. When I went into Mr. English's shop, I said, these were the four.</p>
               <p>Q.If they had been mixed with other glasses, should you have known them again? - A. If they had been mixed with five hundred, I do not know that I should.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coach-maker: I have tried these glasses with Mr. Cloud's coaches, I made an allowance for all the frames, as we always do, and then he went and fetched these glasses, and they answered to the measures that I had put down; there was one that was a little bigger, but that might be owing to the difference of the frame.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you ever measure those frames which included these glasses? - A. No; I guessed at the breadth of them.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an inch in a plate makes a difference between, perhaps, an hundred different glasses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But making a frame of the usual proper size, would a frame of the usual size to these glasses, sit the coaches? - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Ellis, of Ludgate-hill - on the evening in question, I was in the Quadrant, between nine and ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner looking earnestly in at the prosecutor's window - I watched him, and saw him deliberately thrust his fist through the window, from the inside of which I saw him take some things - he immediately ran away - I followed him, and caught hold of him in the middle of the road - he escaped from me - I still followed him, crying, "Stop thief - stop him!" - he ran down Air-street, and got into Piccadilly, where the policeman ran after him, and he was secured - I never lost sight of him - he is the man - I went back to the shop, and then to the watch-house - when the policeman took him he struggled violently - he did not appear to me to be drunk.</p>

               <p>MR. BRADY. I cannot swear to this bracelet, as other houses may have the same pattern - I have no doubt about the pair the boy brought me, because it has our private mark on the card.</p>

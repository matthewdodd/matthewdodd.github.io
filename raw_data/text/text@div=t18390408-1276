I came to town on the 2nd of January, and went to the London Docks to inquire for the ship <hi rend="italic">Cancer</hi>, from Sydney—I met with a very respectable man as I thought, who asked what ship I was looking for—just as we were coming out of the Docks the prisoner joined us—the other man and him did not appear to be acquainted—the prisoner said, "These are very fine docks, gentlemen"—I said, "Yes, but I never was here before"—the other man said, he had never been there before—they then said, "Let us go and have a drop of gin-and-water," and we went into a public-house—we each of us paid for our own glass—the prisoner sat at another table, not where I was—after a while the prisoner said he had just come out of Bethlehem—I asked what for—he said he had been clerk to old Jemmy Wood, of Gloucester, and he had left him a great deal of money, that he did not know what to do with it, and he gave a bullock to be roasted entire to the people, and the corporation had him taken up—I asked him who got him out of Bethlehem—he said, "Alderman Wood, of London"—I</p>

               <p>asked where was the certificate of his discharge—he said he had left it at home—he then put his hand into his side pocket, and pulled out a great roll of notes which looked like Bank of England notes—he said he had plenty of sovereigns likewise—he said he had got so much money left, he did not know what to do with it, and he would give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other man, to give away in charity—I said, "It is very strange, you must get a friend to give your money; can't you do it your<lb></lb>self?"—he said he had been to the Bank, and sold out 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by Mr. Jack<lb></lb>son, the stock-broker—I did not stop with him more than half an hour—we then all three came out, and crossed Tower-hill—the other man went one way and the prisoner another—I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to Bishopsgate—I had asked the other gentleman what he was—he said he was a general shop-keeper at Ipswich—I asked what inn he put up at, and he said, "The Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street"—I said, "Do you make that your board?" he said "Yes"—I said I should be in town the next morning, to go to Mr. Calvert's, as I had some business to do there—I came to town the next morning, by the omnibus—when I got out at the Four Swans, this re<lb></lb>spectable shop-keeper met me, and appeared very glad to see me—we walked up Bishopsgate-street together, and the prisoner joined us—we all three walked along till we got to Abchurch-lane—I said I was going to Calvert's, and the respectable man said he was going to his shop-keeper's, near London-bridge—we all went into the White Hart tavern—we called for two sixpenny-worths of gin-and-water, and that was all we had—I left there, and went to Calvert's, and drew out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in four £50 notes—I re<lb></lb>turned to the White Hart, and sat down—the prisoner said he could not think of giving away his money, without I could show my respectability equal to the other—(the respectable man had said that he could show he had got money)—I said I could show that I had got some—I then pulled out my money, and the other man pulled out his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the prisoner then took a chair, and came and sat opposite to us—I laid down my four £50 notes, and the prisoner laid down his, and the other man laid down his—the other man then said to me, "I will take care of your money, and put in your fob for you"—he leaned against me, took up my money, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it along to the prisoner—I do not know which took it—I never saw it any more—the other man kept me down, and said he would put my money into my fob, and he kept me down sideways till he put it in as I thought—the prisoner then said he would go and fetch a stamp—I asked the other man what he wanted a stamp for—he said he did not know, and that he would go and get a sheet of paper, which would do just as well, and off he went—I then looked at my pocket, and found I had only a dirty hand-bill and a bit of paper—I went to the bar, and told the lady that I had been robbed of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ran out, and had it not been for the number of turnings, I am sure I must have caught the other man—he did not go across Abchurch-yard, or I certainly must have seen him—he could have got but a very few yards, I am sure, before it struck me that I was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>—I went down to Bristol last month, and saw the prisoner there in prison—I looked at him very hard, and I said to myself, "That is certainly the same man, but he is not in the same dress"—I was not with him on the second day above five minutes before I went to Calvert's, and not more than a quarter of an hour in all—I had a good opportunity of seeing him—the waiter came in while we were all three drinking in the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, when was the next time you saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The next time that I think I saw him was at the gate at Union Hall, hand<lb></lb>cuffed, with another man who was tried at Horsemonger-lane for the same kind of offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he not pointed out to you distinctly by the officer, and did you not say, "That is not the man, nor nothing like the man?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, sir—I said, according to his dress when he got out of the van, that he did not appear like the man—I did not say, he was not the man nor any thing like the man, to my knowledge—this was some time in February—it rained very hard when he got out and I did not stop—I was told that two men were coming and I went to look at them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to believe all these tough stories? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I was taken by surprise about old Jemmy Wood—I did not make an appoint<lb></lb>ment to meet either of them the next day, but I came to the Four Swans, as I always do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At Bristol you said to yourself, you thought that was the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I went to the Court, and when the prisoner and another man were brought in, the prisoner turned as yellow as saffron, and he tuned quite black—he hung his head down and fetched two sighs—when the jailer came up to the Court he called me on one side and said, "Do you know what the prisoner has been saying to me?"—"How should I know?" says I—the prisoner was in the same room, but I cannot tell whether he heard it—the jailer said the prisoner had said that I was the old man that was robbed in the City.</p>

I have so much money left me by Wood that I do not know what to do with it, and I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there was then some conversation about taking more grog, and one of them proffered a journey to see the Great Western—the farmer then descended the stairs, and I called him on one side—the prisoner then descended the stairs, to follow the farmer, and I instantly took him into custody, and pushed him into the bar—I did not wait for any reply from him, but put him into custody of a man of mine—I then ascended the stairs, and brought the other down—I pushed him into the bar also—I afterwards found by the side of the chair, between the pri<lb></lb>soner and his companion, 2515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fictitious bills—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing them</hi>)—there are three different sorts of them—the prisoner was searched in my presence, and this knife was found on him, it is to cut ap<lb></lb>parel to as not to cut the body or the thigh in doing it—he had nothing else bats few shillings, which I returned him—I charged him with this robbery of Mr. Moreton—he denied it, and was very abusive and daring to an ex<lb></lb>treme—I took him to the lock-up-house, and the following day I took him before the Magistrate—he was remanded—the prosecutor came down to Bristol, he saw the prisoner in Bridewell, and knew him instantly on his coining out of the cell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What house was this you were called into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Griffin, in Church-street, St. George's, in the Borough—they fought in. front of the bar—I think this was two or three days after Christmas—there was a great deal of blood over the prisoner—I did not see him after he was washed—his eyes were swelled and black to that degree that any person might see it—I do not know how long it would take to bring the swelling down—I should say it could not be well in a fortnight—I had one tome time ago, and it took nearly three weeks to bring it down.</p>

I have known the prisoner four or five months—I am not a friend of his in particular—I saw him at the Griffin public-house, near St. George's church, about the 28th of December—his face was very much swollen and blackened—his eyes were black, and quite puffed up—I should think his eyes could not be well by the 2nd of January—I was summoned to go to the Mansion-house, but could not go—I was subpoenaed here.</p>

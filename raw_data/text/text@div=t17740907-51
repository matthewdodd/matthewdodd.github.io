I took Nicholls; when I had taken him I saw him shuffling something out of his pocket within the flap of his breeches; I asked him what he was doing and immediately seized hold of his hand and took this watch (producing it) from within the flap of his breeches; upon his finger I found a marquiset hoop ring; after that I searched his breeches pocket and found a pair of gold sleeve buttons; he said he gave seven pence for them. (They were produced and all the articles were deposed to by the prosecutor.) We did not know where the goods were lost from till we took Clarke; when he was taken he asked if there was any evidence; I said I did not know; then he said he would tell where he took them; he said he took them from Mr. Frosser's show glass; his expression was that the Old Gorge was asleep when he went into the shop.</p>

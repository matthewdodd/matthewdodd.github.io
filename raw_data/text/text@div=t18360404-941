                  </hi>. I am wife of Joseph Goulding, of Finsbury-street, he is a lady's shoe-maker. On the 17th of March I was on a visit to Mrs. Burrows, the wife of Charles Burrows, No. 98. Bunhill-row—I was there in the absence to Mrs. Burrows—I saw the prisoner Thomas East—he came to look at a room, which he said was for his sister, who was cook in a family, and was going to leave her situation that day—he inquired if there was a furnished room to let—I told him there was—he said should see his sister shortly, and he would call again in an hour and a half—he called again, brought a small parcel, and said he had seen his sister, and she would come that evening, and he would leave the parcel, which he did—he came with the other prisoner in the evening—they were shown into a room on the second floor, and on going up-stairs he said to his sister, "You will not want a fire this evening"—I said there had been a fire for three hours in the room—when we got up, the female prisoner said how clean and comfortable it was, and she was much obliged to me—the man said, "I shall not be able to bring your boxes till ten o'clock to-morrow"—she said, "That will do"—I left them in the room, and went down stairs—in a quarter of an hour I heard a knock at the door, or the shop shutter, as if with a fist—I went to the door, and the female prisoner was two or three satires from the bottom, with a bundle—she said the would open the door—I thanked her, and said I would open it myself—I opened it, and saw</p>

"I dare say you find it so"—she said "Yes, I have been standing over large fires, cooking three dinners a day"—the man was then outside—he said to her, "Come along"—she said, "I do not think I shall go out this evening"—he said, "Come along," and they went out, and at half past twelve o'clock we went up-stairs, found the door locked, and the key gone—we found the bed had been stripped of every thing—this is the quilt—blanket, and sheet, which came of the bed.</p>

On the 27th of June, about half past one o'clock, at night, I stopped the prisoner in Hackney-fields, with a basket and seven roots of flowers; he had two chissels, a large clasp knife, with a saw in it, in his hand - I asked where he lived, he said, in Mare-street, Hackney - I said, I would go with him, he then said, he did not live there, but in Cotton-gardens, Hackney-road; that he slept there sometimes - I asked if he had any residence of his own, he said, No. I took him to the watch-house, he said, Mr. Hayford would satisfy me about the flowers - I went to Hayford, who directed me to a little cottage opposite his house, which had a padlock on the door; I there found the articles stated in the indictment, the mattress had the words</p>
               <p>"Stolen, pray stop it," on it - he told the Magistrate I had no business to ramshackle his house in that way.</p>

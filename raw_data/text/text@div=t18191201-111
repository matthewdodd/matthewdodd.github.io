            . I live on board the Thames Police vessel, which is moored off Queenhithe - I am an officer. On the 30th of November, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was at the top of <placeName id="t18191201-111-crimeloc646">Fleet-market</placeName>

I refused. She took hold of my arm, and kept hold of it till I had crossed the market, then two more girls came up, and asked me to go with them - the prisoner quitted my arm and came in front, the other two came, one on each side. The prisoner pulled my watch out, and ran up a dark court; I followed but lost her. I do not know what became of the other two - I think I saw one of them come down the court, but am not certain - this was on the Tuesday. On Friday I met her again about the same spot, and am quite sure she is the same person. I asked her for the watch she had taken from me on Tuesday; she said she had never seen me nor the watch. I said if she did not give it to me I would take her to the Compter. She still denied it, and I took her into custody. I was sober.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live in Princes-street, Barbican; I am the prosecutor's uncle. He had come with me from Hertford, and was sober when he left my house. About a quarter past ten o'clock at night he returned, and said his watch was stolen. On Friday night I was with him, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Fleet-market. He went after her; I came up - he was eight or ten yards from her when he first saw her. She denied it, and I assisted in taking her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor stood at the corner. I do remember seeing him on the evening of the robbery. He was in liquor - two women who stood there knew him well.</p>

On the 25th of February, I was called home about half an hour after 8 at night, and told a person had robbed my shop, and the man described to me that was seen to run out of the shop. I caused a hue and cry to be made about the country. I was told such a man was seen going into Brentford. I was coming to London, to acquaint Sir

We brought him back to Brentford: there a person said he had seen the prisoner in a field. The prisoner at first denied it; at last he said he would shew us where the buckles were: they were found accordingly. I was not by when he told this, but I heard him confess all afterwards.</p>

            . On the 25th of February I was in bed; Mr. Howard sent for me; I went. He told me he had been robbed; (I am a constable at Brentford;) we took him before a Justice of the peace. He a long time denied knowing where the buckles were; but when we got him to the Justice's yard, then he said he would tell us where they were, if we would not let a mob be about him. I and Mr. Howard's man went with him to the place where he said they were; it was a garden near Brentford. He said they were on the other side the pales; I got over, and there found them (three pair produced;) he said he had them out of Mr. Howard's shop.</p>

               <p>- Charlton. I was in my own Shop over-against Mr Carr's, and saw the Prisoner lift up a Blue Cloth, which lay over these Stockings, and take a Parcel of them away, and put them under a ragged Sort of an Apron. I called out, Carr, Carr, There is a Fellow has got some of your Goods away. I did not run after him, because I had no Body with me in the Shop, but he was pursued, and taken in Princes-street.</p>
               <p>- Weldon. I saw the Prisoner run along with a Bundle of Stockings, and just by my Door he dropped them. I called out to some People to stop him, and they did stop him, and the Prosecutor came up and seized him. - I believe this to be the same Bundle that he dropped, for I was just by when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Carr. My Wife picked the Stockings up in the Street, and I ran after him, went up to him, and took him hold by the Collar; by that Time there were some other Persons about him, and he said, Gentlemen, take Care what you do, don't use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Carr. As high as I can tell it was between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along, and some People tried out Stop Thief; and so a Man stopped me, and said I had stole some Stockings; I said I knew nothing of the Matter. I am entirely innocent of the Fact. <rs id="t17430413-2-verdict11" type="verdictDescription">

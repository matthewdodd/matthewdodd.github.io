               <p>MARY BADLAND. I am a widow, and live in Morgan-street, St. George's, with my mother; I have a daughter, six years of age. On the 6th of June she came home crying - I took her out, and she pointed the prisoner out to me; I pushed her into a shop, and said she had robbed my child; she said she had not: I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you in your apron?" it was the child's pelisse, which she had on at two o'clock, when she went out to school.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young woman, who asked me to go and pawn the pelisse for her; I said I would, and as I was going along the little girl took hold of me, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the girl;" I took it from my apron, and said I was going to pawn it.</p>

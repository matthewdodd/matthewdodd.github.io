                  </hi> I am a carpenter, and live at Black-horse-yard, Rath<lb></lb>bone-place. On 21st March, about one o'clock in the night, I was going home along Oxford-street, and saw a female twelve or eighteen yards before me—when I got opposite Dean-street a man took hold of me, and pinioned my arms behind me—the female who was in front of me then turned back, and attempted to search my pocket—two or three men came up—I saw one on my right, one on my left, and, I think, one or two behind me—they searched my waistcoat and side pockets—I felt the women's hands about me, but am not certain they were in my pocket, but some of the men had their hands in my pocket—the prisoner Higgins is the women, and Wynn is the man I saw on my right side I am certain—after hustling my pockets, as they could not succeed in getting their hands into my pocket at first, I was struck in the face—I cannot say whether Wynn struck me—Higgins did not—they all went away towards St. Giles's—I was getting up off the ground, having been thrown down by the party who were searching my pockets—some of the party came back and kicked me—I believe it was the male prisoner—he said "The old b—, you have plenty of money, and we will have some of it"—I will not swear it was him—I am sure he was one of the three men—he did not search me then—I afterwards gave information to the police, went with the police<lb></lb>man to a house in Church-lane, and picked out the prisoners as two of the party—Wynn was in the house, Higgins came up stairs afterwards, and I identified her—I was taken to the hospital, and then I missed three keys, ✗ pencil, and some halfpence—my pocket was gone—I had been at the Mischief public-house, in Oxford-street, the evening before, and saw Wynn at the front of the bar—I am certain of him—the pocket produced is mine.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Murgatroyd. I saw the desk safe in his shop, at Pimlico; the prisoner could get to the shop from the private door - I saw it safe on Saturday night, the 11th of August, about nine o'clock, and missed it on Monday afternoon; I found it in pawn that evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time was the shop open? A. About half-past seven o'clock. I suspected you, because you offered me some duplicates the day before, and said you were in distress - I know it by a private mark; I saw you leave the house that evening, and followed you to No. 5, Charlotte-street; you were taken next morning.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner on the 14th of August. I was searching for the duplicate, he said, I had no right to search his things - I asked when he was last in Jermyn-street; he said on Saturday - he said it was useless to deny it any longer - that he had done it, and was sorry for it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I admit pawning it. I met an acquaintance named Jones, who owed me 7s., which I asked him for - he said he was short of money, and wanted to pawn the desk, which he had got, but felt tenacious of going to a pawnbroker - I pawned it for him and gave him the money; he paid me 5s., I allowed him 2s. for the duplicate.</p>

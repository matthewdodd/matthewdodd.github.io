               <p>Sarah Banford. The prisoner came into my house the 4th of December, for a pint of beer; she desired to toast a piece of bacon at the fire; she had a little knife like a pen-knife; she got to my pocket as I sat by her, and took out two Half-guineas, two gold rings, and some silver. When she had done, she got up and ran away, and left half her pint of beer; I presently ran after her, but never catch'd her 'till the Saturday following, in St Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive her to take the things?</p>
               <p>Banford. I did not mind her when she was doing it; I took her before Justice Fielding, he could not make her confess any thing for a great while; I offered to give her the money if she would confess the rings; then she confessed to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say the rings were?</p>
               <p>Banford. She confessed she had taken them and pawned them to

            ; the Justice sent to her, she came and brought the rings and shew'd them to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what money you had in your pocket at that time?</p>
               <p>Banford. I had told it to pay the distiller; and I missed the money as soon as she was gone, and there was no body in the house at that time but the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. These are my property, and what I lost at that time; the prisoner said she was going into Staffordshire, and wanted a little money to carry her down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Crasteyn; the coat was his, but it was in my care. I lost my coat from off the coach-box on Whitson Monday, and having seen the prisoner there I suspected him. I took him about a fortnight after in Cheapside as he was buying some cherries; I ask'd him if he knew me, he said yes, and that he had seen me in the coach yard. I charg'd him with taking the coat, and going along he confess'd he stole it, and sold it in Rag-Fair for seven shillings. I took him to my Lord Mayor, and he confess'd the same.</p>

               <p>I have been thro' the yard several times when I liv'd at the Cock eating house, near the Royal Exchange, but I know nothing of it. He took me up, and carried me from Alehouse to Alehouse, and told me if I would own the taking the coat before my Lord Mayor, I should be clear, and so I owned it. He went to the house in Rag-Fair, and the people said they never bought such a thing.</p>

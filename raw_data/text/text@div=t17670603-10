I heard it rattle, but cannot tell the sum. Then he took down a large cannister of tea, and filled a large paper bag with tea out of it; when he had done, he replaced the cannister, and brought the bag, and set it down, while he placed the chair again, and got upon it, and hung the key on the bracket again; then he took the bag of tea in one hand, and the chair in the other, and went up stairs; he staid there a few minutes, and came down with his hat on, and went out at the entry door, and pulled the door after him; it has a spring lock; he was gone about half an hour, or thereabouts; then he came in again, and went up stairs, and was there some time; in the interim there came an acquaintance, named Lyes, and knocked at the door; he came down; the person enquired whether Mr. Bacon or his wife were at home; he said, no; she asked where we were gone; he said he did not know; he seemed rather willing she should not come in; she came in; it was then I believe, pretty near six o'clock, the maid-servant came home about seven; I had bid her come home about that time, in order to release the porter; in a few minutes after she came in, and was gone up stairs, the prisoner came down with the paper bag of tea tied up in handkerchief; I saw the paper bag in it, and believe it to be the same bag he had filled with tea; (I had observed he had nothing in his hand the first time he went out;) he carried the bag out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the maid see him go out?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bacon, No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bacon. I got a constable, and took the prisoner in my shop on the 11th of May; I charged him with taking the tea; he would not confess for some time; I ordered the constable to take him back to the counting-house; when he found we had such positive evidence, he confessed he took about six pounds, but he soon did acknowledge the whole to an ounce; there was eight pounds and upwards; he owned to whom he had sold it, and directed me to the man he had sold it to, where I went and found it; the man and tea are here now in court.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise of favour in order to this confession?</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday evening, the 17th of November, I took a bale of tobacco into my cart with other things—I was going to Mr. Barlin's down Wormwood-street, and had the bale safe then—I proceeded about thirty yards further, and missed the bale—I ran up the street, and met a young man who gave me information—I went round the corner into Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prisoner with the bale on his back-not three minutes elapsed between my seeing it safe and seeing it on his back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you miss it by turning round to look for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was riding on the front—I was nearly at Broad-street—the prisoner had got, I suppose, twenty yards past the watch-house, nearly opposite to Houndsditch—I did not notice whether he was sober—he stumbled, and the bale fell on the ground—my master's name is Henry Foster Mellin—he would be answerable for the bale if lost—my instructions were to carry it to Mr. Barlin's—it weighed 1271bs.—the prisoner could get that upon his back off the cart without assistance—it was not fastened in any way—it was quite at the tail of the cart—I felt no motion of the cart when it went away—it could not have dropped—it was right up to the tail-ladder—it was pulled over the tail-ladder, which was chained up as tight as I could chain it.</p>

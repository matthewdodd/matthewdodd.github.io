               <p>Court. Q. Did you at any time, and when, lose any carpeting? - A. Yes: On the 18th of January last, I was sitting in the accompting-house with Mr. Swift about a quarter before six o'clock in the evening, and happening to look towards the door, I saw a man with a piece of carpeting upon his shoulder, just going out of the door; I immediately ran out of the accompting-house, and followed him across the way; as soon as I had got up to him, I laid hold of the piece of carpeting, and he let it fall from his back, and ran away; I hesitated some time whether to follow him or take up the carpeting, but I took it up, and I immediately observed a man lay hold of his collar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was the man that laid hold of him? - A. Dowsett, the Bow-street officer; he secured the prisoner, and brought him over, and I the carpeting; we took a coach, and went with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you seen that piece of carpeting that day in your shop? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of it was there? - A. Twenty-eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. It was valued at four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the shop was it at the time you saw it first? - A. When I saw it first, it was on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you form any distance how far it was from the door? - A. It was some distance from the door when I saw it in the morning, about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to the door when you first saw him with the carpeting on his back? - A. He was just going out of the door when I saw it first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you did not see him take the carpeting? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You only supposed that it was the prisoner? - A. It was the same person at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, you were some distance from the house when the prisoner was stopped? - A. Just across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons may you have employed in your shop? - A. At that time there was only me and Mr. Swift in the shop; it was almost dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't recollect any other person being in the place, except this gentleman you are speaking of? - A. No, there was only Mr. Swift.</p>

             sworn. - Court. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this carpeting being stolen from these persons, the prosecutors? A. Yes, I do; about a quarter before six on the 18th of January, in the evening, I was passing by Mr. Hurley's shop, it was then dark, there was no light in the shop at all, I observed the door of the shop standing a little way open, and a man standing at the outside of the shop tapping at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner? - A. No, not the prisoner, another man; I went about ten yards from the door, and waited to see the event of it; I immediately saw the prisoner come out of the shop, and run directly across the way with the carpeting upon his back; I observed somebody pursue him out of the shop; the man that was standing at the shop window likewise followed; I crossed over the way before the prisoner could get across, and met him; Mr. Hurley seized the carpeting upon the man's back, and I immediately seized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the man? - A. I am confident of that; he scuffled, and attempted to get away, but I prevented him; the other man disappeared immediately that was standing at the window; then I took the prisoner to the shop, and afterwards to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You naturally had a suspicion that all was not right in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then saw the prisoner come out of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200007"></xptr>Q.You were near enough to the shop to have prevented it? - A. I might have gone to the shop door, and have been apprehended the same as the man was.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could have prevented the man coming out if you had gone to the shop door? - A. I could, it was done momentary.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Hurley). Q. Do you recollect in what state your shop door was, whether it was open or shut the last time you saw it? - A. There were two persons came in, but I am not certain who came in last; the door was shut, but I am not sure whether it was latched or not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence, but called three witnesses to his character, who gave him a very good one. GUILTY</p>

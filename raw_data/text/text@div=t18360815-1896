                  </hi>. I am barrister, and have chambers in Brick-court, Middle Temple. I lost one of the keys of my chamber-door about ten weeks ago—there were only two in the chambers instead of three—on Friday, the 8th of July, when I got up in the morning, I missed my purse which I thought I had left on my sitting-room table first—next morn<lb></lb>ing the 9th of July, when I awoke I missed my watch, generally hung in my bed room—if I do not put it there, I leave it on the table in my sitting room—there was a guard-chain to it—the watch cost 35 gui<lb></lb>neas—the chain is worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The prisoner was in the service of Mr. Ombler, on the same floor—the door of my chambers and his are opposite—in consequence of suspicions, I went into Mr. Ombler's cham<lb></lb>bers with a constable about half-past ten o'clock—we met Mr. Ombler on the stairs, and stated the circumstance—we knocked at the door—the prisoner opened it, and Mr. Ombler said, "Do you know of Mr. Lodge having lost any thing?"—he said knew nothing about it—Mr. Ombler said, "I shall think it necessary to search you, have the goodness to walk into your room"—we walked there—he continued to protest he knew nothing about it—I do not think it was mentioned what I had lost—Mr. Ombler searched his person all over, and I saw a box in the corner of the room, into which I looked—the very first thing that met my eye was the watch, with the face turned down, and the dial-plate quite black with the marks of dirty fingers—close to that I found my watch-key, and the key of my chambers, which I had lost about three weeks before—when I held up the watch before the prisoner, he said, "I found it on the stair<lb></lb>case near your door."</p>

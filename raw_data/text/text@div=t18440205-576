                  </hi>. I am journeyman to James Edwards, a coach-spring maker, in Dudley-court, Denmark-street, St. Giles. I locked up the work<lb></lb>shop on the 19th of Jan., about eight o'clock, and took the key home with me—I returned at half-past nine, in consequence of information, and found the lock of the work-shop wrenched off, and the things inside all in confusion-some springs, which I had hung against the wall, were taken down and put into a new sack belonging to my master, ready to be taken away—they are worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 62.) I was on duty in Denmark-street, a little after nine on the 19th of Jan., and on going into Dudley-court, I heard a talking in the prosecutor's workshop—I looked at the door, and found the bar down, and the padlock on the ground—I went for assistance, and Restieaux and Baker came—we then went into the shop, found the three prisoners inside, and took them in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been round your beat before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about five minutes before—it was all right then—I could not hear what was said when I heard the talking—I heard no other noise—I went with the prisoners to the station, leaving two other policemen in charge of the place, who are not here—I found the sack about half an hour after, when I came back—it was about a foot from the door—I did not see it when I first went—I had no light, but one was turned on—the sack was standing up against the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> I have witnesses to prove I was not there that night; he is false-swearing. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was one of the three; he escaped that night, and was taken again next day in Marlborough-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 108.) I went to Wynch's assistance at the shop—I noticed that the locks were forced—I found the three prisoners inside, first Ford, and then Smith—he was behind the forge—I collared Ford, and asked what he did there—he said, "Nothing, don't hurt me, Baker, you know me, I will go with you quietly; it is a <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> for me"—I then collared Smith, took him out, and gave him to Restieaux—on the way to the station, Ford went quietly to the corner of Great St. Andrew-street—there was then a rush of the mob, and Smith was rescued—I was knocked down in the road with Ford—I held him—he tore part of his coat-sleeve almost off in endeavouring to get away, but I succeeded in keeping him—Restieaux came and assisted me in taking him along after Smith had escaped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> These officers are constantly here to transport poor men innocently; he and Restieaux have had three or four cases this session; they do it for their expenses; I know nothing of the springs. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have had three cases this session—two have been transported, and the other had six months—I proved two former convictions against one prisoner—we only get paid in one case—I feel a pleasure in transporting such characters, for the benefit of the public.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 49.)

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> He told my sister he would be sure to transport me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never said so—his sister and all the family are here.</p>

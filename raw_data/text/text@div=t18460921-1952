                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi> 70 <hi rend="italic">P.</hi>) On the 29th of August, at half-past one o'clock, I was on duty in Surrey-buildings, Kent-road-there is a shed where water-carts are kept—I was coming through the buildings, and I turned my light on the shed to see if anybody was sleeping there, as it was sometimes not locked—I saw a quantity of butcher's meat there-mutton and bee£ several joints—I concealed myself to watch, and the prisoners came for it about half-past four o'clock—one spoke to the other as they came in—I do not know which it was—he said, "Here it is all right; you put it in, and I will go to the water—closet"—Jones went into the water-closet where I was concealed—I shut them both in the shed till I got assistance—I asked Page where he got that meat from—he was quite astonished at first—he then said, "I know nothing about the meat"—Jones said, "I only came here to ease myself"—they both had baskets—nobody could see the meat without a light—they must come round a door to find it—I generally turn my light on there-the shed has a barred gate to it, and there are bolts—sometimes it is locked and sometimes not—when I first saw the meat the doors were dosed, but neither locked nor bolted.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I was on the watch, and saw the prisoners turn up the court with two baskets—I heard a rattle springing—I went to Brewer's assistance—this shed could not be in the prisoner's way to any place—it is out of the road, and the water—closet belongs to a house—you must go to the shed to get to it, but it is no thoroughfare-the water<lb></lb>closet is not visible as you pass along.</p>

Brewer showed me two legs and a shoulder of mutton, and two pieces of beef—I knew them to be my father's—they had been placed in an out-house in the Kent-road, ten or twelve yards from this shed—we have a slaughter-house—the legs of mutton were outside in our shed—not the shed in question, it joins the slaughter-house—they could get the meat by getting over the garden wall and over three or four fences.</p>

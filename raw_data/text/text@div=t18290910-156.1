            . I am a parish officer. I heard a cry of Stop thief! on the 31st of July, about six o'clock in the evening, in King-street; I saw the two prisoners running, Condon first and King after him - I took King, and called to a gentleman, who took Condon; I took this handkerchief from a person who picked it up - I did not see it dropped; I went to the office, and heard a gentleman, who stated his name to be Loftus Henry Bland, examined; he stated the handkerchief to be his.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How far from the place were the prisoners taken? A. They had just turned round the corner of King-street; I did lose sight of them; I do not know who took the handkerchief from the ground; I was told it was taken up at the corner of Bloomsbury-place, at a fishmonger's shop - the prisoners went quietly to the watch-house.</p>

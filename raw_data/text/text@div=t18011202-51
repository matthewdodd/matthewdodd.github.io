               <p>Q. Are bladders the common mode of keeping them? - A. No; about a quarter past eight in the evening, I concealed myself; we had placed Mr. Holdsworth outside the door, where he was to wait for a signal, when he was to stop the prisoner; I saw the prisoner take the bladders one by one out of the box, and put them in his pocket; after that, I saw him return them into the box again; I should suppose they were too large for his pockets; the next day, about twelve o'clock, I examined his boxes, and found the bladders reduced in size, and, in the corner of the same box, I found a brown paper containing preserved apricots; in the evening I concealed myself as before, and saw the prisoner take the bladders out of the box, and put them in his pockets; Mr. Holdsworth was outside the door; my brother gave him the signal, and he brought the prisoner in, and searched him; he fell on his knees, and begged for God's sake we would save his life, and he would confess his guilt; upon his finding, that would not do, he fell flat upon his face, kissed our feet, and begged we would save his life, and he would confess every thing; I made answer, that his conduct had been too infamous for him to expect any mercy; there were two bladders containing preserved apricots found upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. I was in Union-street, Bishopsgate, on the 9th of February, soon after five o'clock, and felt a tug at my pocket—I turned and saw Aspree at my elbow—he passed on my left and went up to Lyons who was about two paces from me—Aspree gave him my handkerchief which I missed from my pocket—Lyons took off his hat put it in, and they both went off—I followed, and cried, "Stop thief"—Lyons was stopped at the end of Union-street—he made a desperate resistance, and I think would have got off, but another officer came up, his hat fell off and ray handkerchief was in the crown of it—Aspree was taken the same evening—I saw him the next morning, and he exactly answered the description which I gave the officer of him, in his dress, his cap and every thing—I believe him to be the boy.</p>

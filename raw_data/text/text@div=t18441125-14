                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Goldie, of No. 39, Baker-street, Portman-square. We went out of town about the 3rd of July last—it might be the 10th—it was early in Jury—I returned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250017"></xptr>
               <p>on the 2nd of Oct—the prisoner Phasey was our laundry-maid—we left her in charge of the house—the prisoner Berry was a charwoman, and had worked as such at our house a short time before we left town—on coming to town, Phasey told me my wardrobe had been left open—it stood in my bed-room—on examining, I missed from it a diamond brooch, a pair of diamond earrings, an emerald hoop ring, and a new purple watered silk dress—these articles were left in the wardrobe when I left town—I told Phasey these things were missing—she said she was sorry to hear it, or something of that kind; and said it was her opinion the charwoman, or a man named Edward Payne, had stolen them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say they had been at the house at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said the charwoman had been in the house with her, and likewise Edward Payne had been there some days—she said Payne was a servant, who had lived next door to us at Leamington, when we were there—that he was out of place, and was looking for a situation, and she asked him to come to the house—she never said what apartment he occupied in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she describe the prisoner Berry as sleeping at the house, or coming there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Coming to the house—she did not at first lead me to believe that Payne had lodged there—I did not understand so from her—she had asked me before I left town if she might have the charwoman come and stay when she went out, and I said, Yes.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Dobree, pawn<lb></lb>broker, No. 20, Gilbert-street On the 16th of Sept. the prisoner Berry came to our shop with a brooch, which I produce—she said she had brought it from Madame Davis, of No. 17, Gilbert-street—(I believe there is no such person there)—she asked for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, which I lent her—our foreman, Mr. Jackson, was present, and saw it—she came again on the 18th of Sept., and wanted 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on it, which I advanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the interval, had neither you, nor Jackson, nor Mr. Dobree ex<lb></lb>amined the brooch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it did not occur to us that it was valuable—we should not have lent more on it if it had been paste—Jackson does not profess to be a judge of diamonds—the prisoner was dressed as she is now—she came again on the 19th, and produced a pair of ear-rings, and said Madame Davis wanted them put to the brooch, and to make it 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you since learnt that the lowest value of them is 200 guineas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not till the policeman came—the prisoner said they were paste.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Goldie. Before we went out of town, I was desired by mamma to put her things away in the wardrobe, and to lock it, which I did—I did not open the boxes of jewellery, but I saw the boxes in which they are usually contained—they were in separate small boxes—I locked the key of that wardrobe in another wardrobe in the same room—I am perfectly sure the lock caught, for I tried it—I also tried the second lock—I carried the key of the second wardrobe into the country, and gave it to mamma—put it on a bunch of keys while in town, which I carry in my pocket—there are folding-doors to the wardrobe where the diamonds were, with a bolt at the top and bottom—I secured both bolts, and the lock shot into the bolted half of the door—on coming to town I found the wardrobe in which the jewels had been, not unlocked, but the bolts were undone—the key had not been turned, so that the bolt of the lock was not back but, the bolts were undone—the doors were closed together, but not fast—I did not find any appearance of anything having been introduced to prise the door open, or raise the bolts—it is a patent key, and I believe a Bramah, a small round key with a small catch in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the service of Mr. Mills, of Elstree. I had lived with Dr. Reed—I left his service on the llth of Aug.—he lived at No. 10, Bloomsbury-square—I was out of place exactly a month—part of that time I lodged in Spring-street—I knew Mr. Goldie's laundry-maid—I called to see her—I slept in the house two or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250020"></xptr>
               <p>three nights—I slept one night in the front room, above the best bed-room, on the third floor—I slept the other time down below stairs, fronting the area—there was another man, named Tit ombe, slept one night on the ground-floor room with me, but nobody on the third floor—that man was not in the house at the time I slept on the third floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to sleep in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was in the summer time, when I was out of place—I was bitten in the place where I lived, and Phasey told me I might sleep there—I slept there two nights, a) I was going to my place, and should have broken into another week of my lodging—Captain Goldie had slept in the bed where I slept, on the third floor—I believe he is Mr. (ioldie's son—he was there while Mr. Goldie was from home, but went away—I had cleaned his shoes—there were plenty of servants' rooms—I do not know what room Phasey slept in—I never knew the charwoman sleep in the house—there was nobody in the house but Phasey and me the night I slept on the third floor, that I know of—I had some of my meals with Phasey—she was on board wages—there is no floor above the third—Phasey did not sleep in the same room with me—I went to bed before her—we did not go up stairs together—I went to the third floor because Captain Goldie had slept in the bed the night before, and it was aired—he had been there about a week, I believe—he knew I was there—I was out of place, and went to clean his shoes, and Phasey gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., saying Captain Goldie had sent it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect one evening Phasey desiring you to do anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me one evening to fetch a boa out of one of the bed-rooms—she told me to go into one of the bed-rooms—I went into the front bed-room, instead of the back—I came down and told her I could not find it—I was to get it out of a wardrobe—she then told me to go and look in the back bed-room—I did so,"and found one—she went out that even<lb></lb>ing, after putting it on—it was about seven o'clock—I went out with her—I do not remember whether she was dressed different to usual, except the boa—I believe not—she had a cleaner gown on—I found the ward<lb></lb>robe doors open in both rooms—I cannot tell the date this happened—I slept in the house two or three nights before I went into service, and went to my place direct from there—I went to my place on the 11th of Sept., the day after sleeping there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try both the wardrobes in the front room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only one—I found one open in each room—I believe Berry minded the house while we went out—I went out with Phasey more than once—I believe she once went out without leaving any one, in the house—on an<lb></lb>other occasion we left Berry in it—both times were in the evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Phasey. the wardrobe door was open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I do not remember that she made any observation—I told her the wardrobe. in the front room was open—when I went to the wardrobe in the back room I found it unlocked, the first time—I went more than once to it—I think about twice, but am not sure—Phasey gave me the key—I do not know why she sent me for the boa, instead of going herself—Tit<lb></lb>combe slept there on one of the nights that I did—I think I slept below about two nights—I am not sure whether I slept more than once in the captain's bed—Titcombe did not sleep there while Captain Goldie was there, to my knowledge—I only knew him there once—that was when I slept down stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you sleep below, or in Captain Goldie's bed, the second night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>. I did one of the two—I am not sure whether it was two or three nights that I slept in the house—I do not know whether Titcombe visited Phasey, but he lived with a butcher, who served Mr. Goldie with meat, and knew her by coming to the house—he had called in to see her more than once, and I believe she had other friends call—I believe a man named Dent, who worked at the house, called.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see Captain Goldie last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When, I was at Mr. Goldie's house—it was in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he spoke to me and saw me in the house—I waited at table on him more than once or twice—I did not wait on him regularly—I did not tell him I had slept in the house—I became acquainted with Phasey at Lea<lb></lb>mington, by knowing her fellow-servant—Phasey told me I might sleep there—she said I need not break into another week—I had called to see her as a friend—the fellow-servant who I knew had left—I only knew Berry, from seeing her in the house—the first time I saw her was the night I left my place, about nine or ten o'clock, when I called there—I went that night to my lodging—I called to see Phasey, and Berry was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did either of them go out with you that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, I will not swear it—I saw Berry again next morning, at Baker-street—I did not take a walk with her—I may have met her in the street, but never went out with her from the house—I have met her in the street, I cannot say how often—my first acquaintance with her was the night I left my service—I do not know how often I met her by accident, and walked with her—it is not half a dozen times—I lodged at No. 17, Henry-street, Crawford-street—Berry lived in some mews, leading out of Dorset-street—I went there once, about a week or so before I went to my place—I can<lb></lb>not say whether that was while I was sleeping at Mr. Goldie's, as it was in the day<lb></lb>time—Phasey sent me there—Berry was not at home—I did not wait for her, and do not know whether I saw her that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had you been doing during the day that you found the ward<lb></lb>robe open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but looking for a situation, inquiring at the shops in Oxford-street—Dr. Reed gave me a character to my present situation—I got that place about a week before 1 went to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to be inquiring about a place the day you found the wardrobe open? it was the day before you went to the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not.</p>

               <p>place, and it is not as though I marked it down; I cannot recollect one way or the other—Phasey did not tell me it was her mistress's boa that she went out with—I did not know whether it was her mistress's or not—I had no doubt it was her mistress's boa; being in her mistress's wardrobe, I supposed it was—I did not walk out with her in it on more than one occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you mention any day during the month you were out of service that you were not at the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot remember any par<lb></lb>ticular day—I was there every day—I believe I was never left in the house alone—I do not remember Phusey going out for beer; I fetched that—I believe when she went out I went with her, if I was there—I can<lb></lb>not swear it was the night that Captain Goldie left that I slept in his bed—I went to bed long before Phasey, as I was not very well—I went to bed about seven o'clock, or it might be eight—I did not see her again till the morning—I believe Berry was not in the house that night—I went to bed the other time about ten or eleven—I always left Phusey up—the butcher did not sleep there more than once, to my knowledge; I believe that was about the middle of the month that I was out of place—I believe he had some beer there—I do not know whether Berry was there that night—he got up and went away early, before me that morning, and did not stay to breakfast</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you told Phasey the wardrobe door, in the front room, was open, did she make any exclamation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember any remark but telling me to go to the back bed-room—I do not remember her saying, "Good God! is the wardrobe open?" or, "What am I to do?" or anything more at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Berry's Defence</hi>, I went to Mrs. Goldie's soon after Christmas; pre<lb></lb>vious to that I had worked nearly two years for a Madame Francis, of No. 26, Castle-street, facing the back of the Princess's Theatre; unfortunately she is now in France, or she would come forward to prove that I was ac<lb></lb>customed to go with her linen backwards and forwards to different places, and to none but French people; and when they could not pay, I had been accustomed to pledge things for them; I had pledged for a lady named Davis, in Gilbert-street, No. 16, or 15, which made me make use of that name; on account of breaking a china jug of Mrs. Goldie's, which Phasey said I must match before the family came home, I went and tried to do so at several shops; among others I went to a large china shop near Gilbert-street, to try to get it matched; I have the piece at home, which I took with me; I then went to Gilbert-street with the brooch; when I came home she said, "What a little, you outfit to have got more;" I have been in the habit of fetching things out of pledge for Phasey, and paying the interest for her; and I have pledged different things that have been proved to be her own; when I was having these things to pledge, I did not know they were of the value they are, neither did I know but they were her own, as she is a person that has good clothes of her own, and always appears respectable on a Sunday, so much to, that she told me herself that the cook said one day, when she went out, "That can't be Elizabeth, I thought it was Mrs. Goldie!" and I did not doubt but what I was doing was right—one morning in August, as near as I can recollect, when I went, she said, "Oh dear me, I am in a good deal of trouble;" I said, "What is the matter?" she said, "That stupid Edward, I sent him up stairs to get one of the boas, to go out in, and instead of going into the</p>

               <p>back room, he has gone into the front room, and opened mistress's press;" I said, "Is it possible?" she said, "Yes, what shall I do?" but she said she locked the door, and kept the key in her possession, as she owned to Mrs. Goldie afterwards; but previous to that, when the house was re<lb></lb>paired, the second floor was all papered alike; and when I was cleaning the young ladies' room where the boas were kept, there was a chest of drawers with a small press on the top: I said to the man who was paper<lb></lb>ing, "Will you help me to move this press back? "he pushed it back, and the doors flew open; I immediately called Phasey up stairs; when she came up, she said, "Dear, dear, what a thing it is;" she put her finger unfortunately, and pressed the lock back again; she was sorry afterwards that she did so; she then locked the door; on the Monday after, she was very uneasy, and said, "I wish I could get a key to get the press locked; I will ask Mr. Dent," who is an upholsterer, that Edward lodged with; I said, "Well, if you feel so uneasy, shall I try to get you a key, if I can borrow one?" she said, "Yes;" I borrowed some keys of my landlady, having none of my own, and brought them to Phasey; when Phasey re<lb></lb>turned them to me again, she said there was ne'er a one that would fit, but since that she said she found one on the bunch that locked the press, but she took it off, and flung it away; on the Sunday after the family came back, she told me, out of the back window that looks into the laundry, to go to Mr. Dent, and beg of him not to say anything about the key or keys; I said, "Very well;" I went, but neither Mr. or Mrs. Dent were at home; I went on the Monday morning, and left word with his wife; I did not see him; the last thing that I pledged was the dress; I was then going out to work where I had been the day the officer took me; it is Mr. Matthews, a grocer, at the corner of East-street, and I was to go there next day. My husband is a coach<lb></lb>maker, and there is a particular sort of paper which they use; there are only a few shops which sell it, and I went to one in Goodge-street, and I pledged the dress as I went along. When I came home it was nine o'clock; I thought it was later; I knocked at the street<lb></lb>door; Phasey came up to me, and said, "O, what brought you back to<lb></lb>night? George is not gone, (who is a respectable young man, belonging to the Life Guards,) will you come down?" I said, "No, not to<lb></lb>night, I am going out to work to-morrow." I gave her my purse, a dark one, with yellow clasps; she said, "How much have you got?" I said, "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" she said, "Very well, that will do." I gave it her; and from that time I never saw the purse but once. I did not go the next day, but the day after. I said, "Where is my purse?" she said, "O, it is a pretty purse," looking at it; "I will give you another for it;" but she has never given it.</p>

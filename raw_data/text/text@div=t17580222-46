I got up on the 14th of January and found my window broke open, the closet door was also broke open, the lock hanging upon one nail, and the other three on the ground; out of the closet I miss'd the tea chest, in which were the other things mentioned, except a large silver spoon, which was lying upon a shelf. I went up stairs immediately, and found my four lodgers in bed. Lokin was one of them, who upon my asking told me he heard a noise between one and two o'clock, like the falling of the window bar upon the table, and that he heard somebody say, Betty, Betty, open the door for me; upon which I took a neighbour, and carried him before justice Fielding. Then Lokin said, he believed it was the prisoner, upon which I took up the prisoner. Then Lokin said he was the person that robbed me. But upon justice Fielding's hearing Lokin's name, he told him he believed he had been guilty of stealing some lace, which he confessed. The prisoner was committed to New Prison, I went to him there, and he confessed to me that

            . I am a constable. On the 14th of last month Mr. Barnard told me he had been rob'd, and that Lokin told him, one West, a neighbour of his, had call'd his maid up at two o'clock in the morning. We took West up, and before justice Fielding Lokin at first said, he heard West call the maid up; but the justice hearing the name of Lokin, he charged him with a robbery. Then Lokin said, he could give an account of this if it would save him. Then West was discharged, and Lokin committed privately. After he had given an account, against the prisoner at the bar, at night I took the prisoner, when he came to the prosecutor's house, he having appointed to meet Lokin there. And on the Sunday, in the round house, he confessed to me he did commit the robbery, and that he had broke the buckles and sold them, and had thrown the tea chest into the necessary house. He told me he got in at the window, but did not say any thing about breaking the lock.</p>

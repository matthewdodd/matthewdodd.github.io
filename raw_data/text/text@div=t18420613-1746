                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Benton, of No. 33, Abchurch-lane. The prisoner was in his service for eight months, be left on the 21st of February—about ft fortnight after that, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up stairs, and saw the prisoner and another boy behind a door in the passage—I went up and told my master, then came down, and pursued the prisoner—he ran into a court, and I lost sight of him—I fastened up the house on the night of the 15th of April, as soon as it got dark—I dare say it was after eight—it was all fast about ten, when I went to bed—I came down in the morning, at five o'clock, and perceived the area-door open—it was fastened when I went to bed the night before—the kitchen drawers were opened, and the things pulled out, and also the things out of a work-box which was in the window—a few halfpence were taken from the work-box, and twopence from under an egg-cup on the dresser, which was there the night before—a piece of mutton, a pud<lb></lb>ding, a loaf of bread, and some cheese were taken out of the safe—Mr. Musprat has an office on the first-floor-a desk of his was broken open—it was supposed the thieves had got in from the churchyard, over the shed into the area—a board had been taken out by the side of the area-door, and the canvas was cut through—that would enable a person to put his hand in and undo the fastening—any person who had been living in the house would know where the fastening of the door was—the opening was just by the fastening—I found a pair of shoes on the shed</p>

The pri<lb></lb>soner was in his employment, and left on the 21st of February—on the 16th April I received information from Ellis, and was shown these shoes—I know them by the lace in them—it was a stay lace, and I reproached the prisoner with it on the Friday, and asked him if that was the way in which he went about my house—I am quite certain this is the stay-lace—it was my property—I saw the prisoner when he was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody, he had a gentleman's slipper on—I did not see his other foot, only one foot—I have no doubt these shoes belong to the prisoner.</p>

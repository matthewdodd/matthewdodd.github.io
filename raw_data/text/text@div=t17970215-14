               <p>Q. Did you see him do it? - A. No, I saw him taking the parcel out; it was three reams of demy paper ruled, it was tied up in whited brown paper; I said stop thief, and he dropped it about two yards from the cart, and then he ran across towards Castle-street, and I lost sight of him; I saw no more of him till a person took him; this was about six o'clock at night; he was brought to me to the cart in about three minutes; the young man that brought him said he saw him open the doors behind, and take it out; I cannot swear to the man; the paper was picked up by Charles Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the parcel he picked up was the same parcel that was in the cart? - A. Yes, it is the property of Richardson and Harrison; I fetched it from their warehouse in Portland-street; it is marked on the outside the number of reams; I had a bill of parcels from one warehouse to the other, it mentions three reams demy, sixteen lines in faint and cross lines; there were six reams in two parcels, but only three were missing; I don't know the value of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Strutton-ground, Westminster. On 16th Feb. the prisoner came to my shop between four and five o'clock, and asked for half a quartern loaf, and gave me a bad shilling—I did not notice it to be bad till he was turning out of the door—I put it on the back counter, apart from all other money, marked it, and put it in a piece of paper, and locked it up in a drawer, where it remained till the 28th, when the prisoner came again for two half-quartern loaves—I remembered him, walked into the shop and busied myself with the gas lights till he put down a half-crown—my wife was serving him—I picked up the half-crown, bent it, found it was bad, and put it into my pocket—I told the prisoner that made the second piece of bad money—he denied it being the second piece, and said, why had I not given him in charge on the first case—I took the bread off the counter—he said, "Well, let me have the bread master," and threw down a good shilling—I, in the hurry of the moment, gave him the bread, and took the money out of the good shilling—I could not leave my shop as my wife was very near her confinement; I could not see a policeman handy, and therefore let him go—next morning I saw the policeman, Brine, pass my shop—I spoke to him and gave him the half-crown and shilling wrapped in a piece of paper.</p>

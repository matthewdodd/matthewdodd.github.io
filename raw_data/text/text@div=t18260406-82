            . I am waterman of the coach-stand in Oxford-street, at the corner of Argyle-street, opposite the prosecutor's shop. On Friday morning, the 7th of April, at half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner there, and watched him for three-quarters of an hour, walking first on one side, and then on the other, looking at Hammond's shop; I saw him look in at the key-hole twice, as he went by, and give a kind of cough - a waggon went by the last time that he gave the cough; I immediately went and informed a watchman - a watchman came up, crossed Oxford-street, and look him into custody, just as he was coming away from the door - about three yards from the door. I saw no person come out of the house, but saw a person running away on the other side of the way; the watchman called Stop thief! but he got away; I found a bunch of keys and a bag, like a clothes bag, on the step of a door, on the opposite side, a good distance from the house, near Queen-street, and delivered it to the watchman - the keys were under the bag - the prisoner could not have dropped that bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You observed him walking about for three-quarters of an hour? A. Yes; he went to the door and looked through the key-hole - a coachman directed my attention to him - I did not see any one with him - he put his head down to the door and coughed - he walked on one side of the way, and then on another - the bag was found in the direction the other man ran.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often do you think he passed the prosecutor's door? A. I suppose twenty times; he did not look through any other key-hole, nor cough, except at this door - it was a kind of short cough, as if for a signal - I cannot find out the coachman.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James. Wyan called my attention to the prisoner. I noticed him for about five minutes, during which time he went to Hammond's door three times, and stooped down; I was too far off to say whether he made any noise the third time - as he came from the door I collared him within three yards of the door, and two men immediately sprung out of the shop door; when he saw them spring out, he immediately said</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to do with them;" one man went down Argyle-street, and the other ran across by Queen-street; I saw him drop the skeleton keys and bag - the prisoner said nothing more to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see him go into the shop? A. No; I could not hear him cough; I was about three yards off when the men rushed out - nobody else was there; his back was towards the door - one of them rushed by him but he could not see them come out.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. How far was you from him when he went to the door three times? A. Not near enough to hear if he had coughed; I was the width of the street from him - but the third time I was making towards him- within three yards of him - one of the keys opened the shop door - it was quite newly filed; I saw the property found behind the shop door.</p>

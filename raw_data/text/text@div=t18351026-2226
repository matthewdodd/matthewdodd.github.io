The prisoner came into my service on the 9th of October, and next day I missed this property—she went away on Friday evening, the 9th, at night, and came again on the Saturday—she did not sleep in the house—she went away a few minutes after five o'clock, on the 10th, without my knowledge—my husband had been out a little way, and when he came home, the prisoner was absent—she had gone out at the back door, without any notice, and left the door open—I did not see her go, but in a few minutes I found the door open, and she was gone—I went up-stairs,</p>

The prisoner had an apron on with the resemblance of a ticket porter, with a brown coat and white buttons: I should have trusted to him.

               <p>Levy. I never spoke a word to you.</p>
               <p>Court to Aquilard. Relate what this man said? - I went to my butcher's to order some beef, and this man was there, and a parcel of Jew people, and he came round, and said, if you will take the trunk, he said, if you will give us something for our trouble and make it up; I said, I cannot say any thing about it, and the trunk was sent to my house the next day; the Jew constable asked me if I would take the trunk and give the woman something to make it up.</p>
               <p>Levy. As I stand here upon my oath, I never offered to the gentleman; there was a wedding in Duke's-place, at the butcher's; I was employed as constable; the gentleman came and ordered some meat; says he, have you found any thing of the box? says I, no; says he, if I could but get the box, I would no hurt any body.</p>
               <p>Did not you say what Mr. Acquilard has said? - I did not say thing at all about sending the box, for I did not know any more than he what was done with the box.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was any body else that you know present at the time? - There was the butcher's man I believe that I believe brought the trunk.</p>
               <p>Court. If there was a second witness that is present, I shall order this man to take his trial for perjury? - If I was to be hung up now directly, it is false what the gentleman has said; I shall speak the truth, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Court. Who brought this man here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Turnbull. When there was an examination yesterday before the Grand Jury we found this constable was not with us on the back of the bill, and this gentleman wished to have him, as he knew something about the box.</p>

               <p>Court to Levy. Upon your oath, who took the trunk to Mr. Acquilard's? - Upon my oath, I do not know; I do not know the butcher's boy.</p>
               <p>Daniel. The constable told me he knew the prisoner very well.</p>

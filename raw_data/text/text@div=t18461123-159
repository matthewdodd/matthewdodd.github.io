Last Thursday, Nov. 19th, about noon, I saw the prisoners there, to the best of my belief—one was short and one tall—they had a pint of porter, and remained a short time—I saw them leave—I saw them again next day and recognized them—in my judgment my house is about three quarters of a mile from Perry-hill.</p>

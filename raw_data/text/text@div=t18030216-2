               <p>Q. How many penny-pieces? - A. I did not count them; the officer has them, they were in his pantaloons, and his jacket pockets; I cannot swear to any of the money, the till was not locked in the morning, I don't know how I left it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you in liquor? - A. I might be a little; I missed some halfpence and penny-pieces, I did not know I had any silver in the till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I put him and his wife to-bed drunk that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- LOVEDAY sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 16th of January, about a quarter after four in the morning, passing the house of the prosecutor, I saw a light through the window-shutter, I looked through, saw the prisoner go to the bardoor, open it, and go in; he had a candle and looked on the shelves; he took a silver spoon, and put it in his pocket; he put something in his pocket, opened a drawer by the till, and took a parcel out; he took a knife out of his pocket, and endeavoured to force the lock of the till, but could not effect it the first time; he tried to open it at the side, he could not; he then tried the lock again, and opened it; he took out a parcel of something, and put it in his jacket-pocket; he repeated it again; he took out something, and put in his pantaloons; then he put to the drawer again; he took a candle and looked about the bar; he came out, and went from the bar to the fire, the landlord was asleep in the tap-room at the time; I am sure it was the landlord, for I heard him cough, it was then near five o'clock; I called another watchman, we stopped about the house, expecting he would be coming out; he did not, I then knocked at the window, and told him I wanted something; the prisoner tapped at the window, and said, he was coming; about a quarter of an hour after, I knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it, I found Mr. Haram sleeping, with his head on the table, in the taproom, he was in liquor; I asked the prisoner if we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160004"></xptr>could not have somethink to drink; in order not to alarm the prisoner too much, we had something, and paid for it, and laid the money on the bar; I endeavoured to wake the landlord, which I did, with some difficulty; I took him without the taproom, and asked him if he knew the prisoner, he said, he did; I said, that man has robbed you; I took him into an adjoining room, and took some penny-pieces, and halfpence out of his waistcoat-pocket; I found a seven-shilling piece, and seven shillings in his pantaloons pocket, (produced the money and a knife with blood on it, with which he opened the drawer,) I suppose, he had cut his finger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The two seven-shilling-pieces is what my master King gave me; Mr. Haram changed a seven-shilling-piece, the landlady desired me to take care of the bar, her husband was so drunk; I gave her the money till she fell down in the bar, and they carried her up to-bed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030216-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

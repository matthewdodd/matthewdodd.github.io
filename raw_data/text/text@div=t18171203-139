            'S Defence. A woman, who said her name was Ingram, came to my bed-room, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, and said she had a watch in pledge, and sold me the duplicate - I gave her 1l. 8s.; she went and got it out. She sent me to pledge a seal for her. I went in to get a glass for the watch-when I came out I could not find her.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th of April, 1834, I went out—I locked the street door and took the key—I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found the street-door open, and the parlour-door, which I had locked, was open—I missed from the parlour a bundle of linen off the chair—I lost the article stated in the indictment—I noticed a man, who has since been transported, leaning over the pales, before the house, as I went into the house—he has since been convicted of this robbery.</p>

I can see Bell's house from the side win<lb></lb>dow of my own house very distinctly—On the 17th of April, last year, I was at work in my shop, and observed three men lounging about; one had a paper parcel in his hand, tied with red tape, and sealed—they all three went up to Mrs. Bell's door—one separated from the others, about fifteen yards, and stood against the pales, while the others looked through the key-hole and one corner of the window—I hardly knew what to make of it—I thought it was an execution, and they wanted to get into the house—di<lb></lb>rectly afterwards, they pulled something out of their pocket, opened the door, and went in, and shut the door—I could see they were up stairs, rummaging about—I ran out of the house, and just before I got to Bell's door, two men came out with a bag, three parts full of things—I, being an old man, (and they young, and at a distance,) was not able to get hold of them—I secured the one who was set to watch, and he has been convicted—I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of the other two—I am not posi<lb></lb>tive; he appears to me about the size of the man.</p>

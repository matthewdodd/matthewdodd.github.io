            . On the 28th of October last, Mr Applebee came to my house, he ask'd me how my father did.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>T. Reeves. I am a coppersmith and brazier, and live in Bride's-lane Fleet-street; he ask'd me whether I could make him some brass kettles. I ask'd him when he would have them done? he said, when I could do them. I said he might have them on Monday or Tuesday. Then Mr Gyles came in and said, Mr Applebee, why do not you tell him what you came about? then Mr Applebee said, did not you sell some copper at Mr Gyles's to day? I said, Yes: he ask'd me how much? I said, 15 pounds weight: he ask'd me for whom? I said for Mr Swinton, he desired me to sell it for him. I sold it for 12 s. 6 d. at 10 d. per pound; he brought it to my house. The copper produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where was this piece taken from?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. From out of my warehouse. I had mark'd some pieces upon Mr Gyles's information. (He looks in a parcel produced, bought by Mr Gyles's man, he finds some of them) I can swear all here is my property: here is also a copper sauce-pan and cover, which I found in the prisoner's lodgings, mark'd with my own hand. The prisoner, upon being charg'd, down on his knees and ask'd pardon; and desired to be sent abroad in the King's service, rather than to be transported.</p>

I desired my master, as I had been six months, in a French prison, to send me abroad, rather than lie in prison here. Please to call Mr Waters.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr Waters. I cannot tell any thing as to his private character. I have known him 2 or 3 years, I never heard a great deal of him.</p>

               <p>Josias Taylor. On Tuesday the 16th of November. I had a pretty deal of Business to do; and towards the Evening I ordered one of my Servants to hang the Doors on. I desired him to get what he could ready on Tuesday Night, in order to be sent into the Country the next Morning. - The Doors were shut; there is a Sash-Window on each Side of the Door, and Grates before them, which were fastened to the House. - I had 120 Pound Weight of Chocolate brought from the Office, which had been sent there to be stamped. It was brought in on the Saturday; and the Monday before the Tuesday Night on which this happened, it was put in the Window to dry, because it is damp when it comes from the Office. - It lay about two Foot from the Window. My Man was in the Shop heading two or three Barrels, and I was in the Compting-House; I saw the Chocolate fall down, and did not know but it might be the heading of the Barrels that might have disturbed it. My Man presently went to the Door, then came and called me, and told me that I had been robbed. When I came, I found that there was 26 Pound of Chocolate taken away, and the Grate was likewise taken away, and thrown into the Street, which I did not find till about two Hours afterwards. There was a Coachman going into the Green-Dragon Inn, his Horses would not go along, which was occasioned by the Grate lying in the Street, which the Coachman took up and carried into the Inn-Yard. At last seeing a good many People looking at something, I went to see what it was, and found the Grate lying in the Inn-Yard. The Chocolate was sold to one

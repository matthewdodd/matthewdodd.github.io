             fastened my barn on the night of the 6th of February, and next morning he told me it was broken open - I examined, and found part of the roof had been untiled, sufficient for two to have got in; I missed some wheat from the bulk - I thought about two quarters; I found a hat in the barn, which I believe is here - I gave notice to Camp, the officer, and went with him to Taylor's, at a place called Journeyman's-green, on the following day - I think Wheeler went with me; Catling lives next door to Taylor - I found at Taylor's a bed-tick filled with wheat in the chaff, and the bed clothes on it - the bed appeared made; I think there were about six bushels in the tick, and I found about five pecks in a sack in the house -I have compared the wheat I found there with that in my barn, and I believe it to be part of the same wheat; I found at Catling's about five pecks of wheat, from which the chaff had been blown, and some chaff was buried by the side of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Do you pretend to distinguish your wheat from other wheat? A. As far as possible, I think I can - there is much difference in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160090"></xptr>quality, weight, and colour of it; it was in the chaff, in which state it is not sold - it was very good, and cleaner than it is in general; that I found at Catling's was not in the chaff, but it was not then in a marketable state - it was in such a state as a poor person might have it for his own use; Catling was in my service about three years ago - I do not know that we had any difference; I do not recollect having a fowl injured or killed, or talking of instituting a prosecution against any body, and applying to Catling to give evidence - he made a false charge against me, but I am ready to meet it in any way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not said before that you could not say that it was the same wheat? A. No, Sir, I never said so to any one - I said I could not positively swear to it, but I believe it was the wheat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they not both under the same roof? A. Yes, it is not common for houses of that description to have a communication - I never saw it before; the partition-wall is usually carried up to the top; the door is in the partition and pulls up - it is in the up stairs room; you go under the roof which hangs over, in a sloping way - the wheat found at Catling's, has some chaff in it now - Catling and Taylor were not at home when I went; Catling gave himself up the next morning.</p>

            . I am Catling's sister. His wife, my brother, and I, gleaned some wheat, and Catling had it about a week before from my house in Silver-street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did you glean it? A. In August last, about Edmonton - we gleaned sometimes in three or four fields in a day; this was mixed wheat - we gleaned some of Mr. Boards' and some of Mr. Knight's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you permit the small wheat to remain with it? A. We cleaned it ourselves in a little sieve on a sheet - I put the chaff on a little piece of ground before my garden; I know my sister had two chaff pillows given to her.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. BOARDS. Q. Did the chaff you found buried appear to be fresh buried? A. It was not matted as chaff usually is, which has been in a pillow or a bed.</p>

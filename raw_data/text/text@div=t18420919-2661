                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, and live in Silver-street, Tottenham-court-road. About eleven o'clock on Sunday night, the 5th of Jane, I met a woman at the end of Tottenham-court-road—I went with her to a house in Church-street, St. Giles's—a man came in and wanted me to make some arrangement with the girl—I would not while he was in the room—directly after he had gone out, I took my coat and waistcoat off, and placed my watch and guard in the waistcoat pocket—the light was put out, and I found my waistcoat, watch and guard were gone—the woman took them, and went out with them—I afterwards found my watch at a pawnbroker's in Goswell-street—the prisoner was not the man who came into the room—no one could have taken them but the woman.</p>

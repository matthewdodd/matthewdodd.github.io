               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly assure you I went to Bartholomew-fair with this woman's husband - he told me she was in the habit of taking all his money and valuables, wasting them, and then coming back to her old quarters; when he returned home that night he found her drinking in a gin-shop with her daughter - after I got home he chastised her, and then they went to bed with the witness; her clothes were in a chair by the bed-side- I heard some one touch the clothes, and her husband rose up and said, "Henry, Ellen is off;" he dressed himself and went out; he returned in the morning, and said he had found her in a watch-box with the watchman, and she had been circulating scandalous reports, which I do not choose to repeat - she came home; her husband and this man gave her a beating; she then desired me to go to the house of a person named Smith, to inquire if she had left any money there - I left the house without knowing any thing of the money; the trousers I have on were given me by a friend, and the hat I exchanged for an old one.</p>

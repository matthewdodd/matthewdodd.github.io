On the 22d of May, between twelve and one o'clock, as I returned from Hatton-garden, I saw Austin come from Little Bath-street, into Great Bath-street, and meet Goodwin; something passed from her to him so quick, I could not discern what it was - thinking all was not right, I took him, and asked what he had got, he said,</p>
               <p>"nothing" I took him into a public-house, and took this muslin from under his jacket; he said, he found it - I left him in charge, and went to look for Austin; and saw her and Davis sitting in Mr. Benstead's shop, in Little Bath-street; I took her, she asked Davis</p>
               <p>"What does this mean" - I took them both, and on coming out, Davis said to Austin,</p>
               <p>"I am afraid he is taken;" I found nothing on Davis, and discharged her - she followed us to Hatton-garden, and was taken - Benstead's shopman claimed the muslin.</p>

On the 22d of May, the female prisoners came in together, and asked to see some prints; I asked if they had tried a pattern which I gave them yesterday; they said, No, but they wanted another dress - they had paid 1 s. on a dress the day before - I gave them a pattern; they said, if it washed, they would have another - I shewed them a great many prints, on the 22d, and as they liked none of them, I asked them to look in the window, outside, and see if there were any they should like; and in a few minutes, Austin went out to look at the window, as I thought, Davis remained - she returned, and the officer came in - I did not then miss any thing, till he produced the muslin - they had come together the day before.</p>

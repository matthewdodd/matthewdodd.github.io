               <p>I am a carpenter, I was employed on the premises of Messrs. Stevenson at the Horse Shoe Brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any wood lost on their premises? -  Yes, there was a good deal lost, but I cannot prove the time when it was lost.</p>
               <p>

            Did you perceive that wood was missing? - Yes, the prisoner lives in the same street, about one hundred yards off; he is a shoe maker, he lives in Bembridge-street, No. 3. I live in Great Russel street, Bloomsbury. Friday night, the 10th of January, I was sent for to the brewhouse and had some information that made me apply for a search warrant, I got one on Saturday morning, about eleven o'clock, I went with it to the prisoner's house, and two officers were with me, we went into the front room, the parlour, where the prisoner was making shoes, his wife desired the officer to tell what he wanted, he was present, I do not recollect that he said any thing that time, she said the would bring it him if she had it, the officer asked if they had any timber or wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that loud enough for the prisoner to hear? - It was, then she fetched the key of the kitchen, she said she had some in the kitchen, we went to the kitchen door together and I went out into the yard, the prisoner we left in the front room behind, and I went into the yard, and there I saw two pieces of timber, joist fir timber, I immediately said that it belonged to Mr. Stevenson's and Co.'s brewhouse; I said that, and the prisoner immediately answered and said, that was the only two pieces he had from the brewhouse, I am certain that he said that one of them the bricklayer gave to him; he said his name was Hogan. I asked him if he knew Hogan, the bricklayer? these were found across the yard, on the top of the yard; after that we went into the kitchen, and he followed us, as we went down under the stairs, there we perceived a large quantity more, they handed it out to me, and directly as I put my hand on the timber I said I knew it to be Mr. Stevenson's property; they are called tye pieces; there were some boards also lay at the bottom of the stairs, there was a large quantity that I had not the least doubt but what it belongs to Mr. Stevenson's, though I had no particular marks for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now having looked down stairs where else did you go? - We went into the back yard again, and there are two little sheds, one on the left and one on the right, that on the right hand the door was open, we looked into it, nothing was there at all; the prisoner was there in the yard at this time, and when the officer asked him what was in the other? he said that he had let that place to an old woman and she was gone out, there was nothing there. The officers began to break the door open, he said as I was a carpenter I knew better how to get the door open; we opened the door and there we saw a large quantity of wood more, this was not all fir, there were two oak planks, about eight feet long each of them. I had no particular mark for them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hogan with you the time the search was made? - No, he was not, he has seen these planks since, and he knows them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150195"></xptr>Q. Did you find any thing else that you know to be the property of the prosecutor? - We found a piece with two streaks of iron nailed on the side before we began to pull down the building, it stood under the upper lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you think there was contained in this shed? - As much as five or six men could carry, the posts were about seven inches square, and about five or six feet long, the wood is here. There is one piece of joist new stuff, that I had matched, the fellow piece to it, found at the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing with regard to the rest of the wood? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Godfry, what is the firm of Messrs. Stevenson's? - John Stevenson the elder, John stevenson the younger, and William Blackwell.</p>
               <p>Q. No body else? - I don't know that there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the prisoner lived where you described you went before? - I never knew that he lived there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Stevenson went before the magistrate? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he swear it to be his property alone, and not the property of the partnership?</p>
               <p>Court. He knew it was what belonged to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knap. The wife told you that if there was any wood you should see it? - Yes, she did.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner then was left in the front room, was he left by himself? - He was not, there was an officer with him, and another man stood at the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to execute the search warrant at the prisoner's house? - Yes, on the 11th of this month. When I went into the house I saw the prisoner at the bar and his wife, I told them I had a search warrant to search for stolen property; his wife made answer, what was it? I told her it was timber; says she, here is the key I will shew you some timber that we have got. I went down to the kitchen, and there was a quantity of timber that she had got, Mr. Godfry was along with me, and he pointed out what timber belonged to Mr. Stevenson, I think we found ten pieces about two or three yards long, there was some flooring and other thick pieces of wood, in the yard there was a very large piece there, Mr. Godfry said that belonged to Mr. Stevenson; the prisoner was in the front parlour at that time, in custody with another officer.</p>

            While he was in the yard did he say any thing? - He did say something, but I cannot recollect what it was; here was a little house, there was no person in it, but only an old woman that lodged in it, the windows were broke, I looked in at the windows, and I saw a great deal of timber in it, I burst open the door; which wood found there, the carpenter said belonged to Mr. Stevenson, that is all that I know about it; I think it was the prisoner said that an old woman lodged in it; there was a fire place in it, but no appearance of a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of an officer being with the prisoner, had the prisoner any opportunity of making his escape, if he had been so inclined? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know whether any body lodged in this house, besides the old woman? - This was in the yard, but I dare say there were lodgers in the house, both men and women.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course these men and women that lodge in the house had access to all parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this place in the yard had the appearance of a lodging house, because there was a fire place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>CONSTANT HOGAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at any time at work on these premises of Mr. Stevenson's? - Yes, I am a bricklayer, I know the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the search warrant took place did you see the prisoner on the premises at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation passed between you? - Yes, he asked me for a piece of joist that lay there.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of wood was it? - Fir; it lay on the outer part of the bottom scaffold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he wanted it for? - He said he was going to build a shed, I told him he should not have it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards change your mind, and give it him? - No, I did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time give him any wood? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - It might be about half after eleven, two or three days before it was found in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of that piece afterwards; did it remain there? - When I came back from dinner that day, I missed it, in the course of the afternoon I met the prisoner, he came opposite the building as usual; I said to him I perceive you have taken that piece? no, says he, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you charged him with having taken it, and he denied it? how long was this before he was taken up? - A day, or two, or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the piece of timber again? - I see it when it was brought back in the caravan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the caravan came from? - I see it set down in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that piece? - It came along with the rest in the cart.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what timber that was? - He went through the passage and left it in the yard, and said nothing, but came out; it seemed to be a dirty piece, I did not see him put it into the yard, but I saw him walk back again into the street, he said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you observe? - Nothing else.</p>

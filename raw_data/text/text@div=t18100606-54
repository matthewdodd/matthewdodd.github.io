The prisoner obstructed me from going down St. Ann's lane, and would not let me pass, but rushed on before me, squeezing me up against the corner. I had a good opportunity of looking him full in the face. I said to him, my friend, you are in a violent hurry; while the words were in my mouth, I felt my watch go out of my fob pocket, he was obliged to pull it very hard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060032"></xptr>my breeches being very tight. I immediately cried, stop thief, he has got my watch, he crossed over into Maiden-lane, and ran very fast until he got out of my sight. A witness in court saw him do the fact, and followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt as to his person - A. I know his person very well, I had an opportunity of staring him in the face, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEPPARD. I am a cabinet marker. On the 18th of April, I was passing up St. Ann's-lane close behind the prisoner, I saw the prisoner take the watch out from Mr. Biddle's pocket. I immediately ran after him, when he turned up Gutter lane I was close behind him. Mr. Webster, a gentleman volunteer, with his musquet in front stopped the prisoner; then I laid hold of his collar, and said, he was the man that stole the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of him - A. No, only as he was turning the corner; I was close behind him; I never lost sight of him for a minute, I am certain he is the man.</p>

               <p>I <rs id="t17760417-39-viclabel213" type="occupation">keep poultry</rs> and buy sweepings to feed them with: these people came and borrowed bags of me, and said they had some sweepings to bring; I concluded it was dirty corn; I happened by accident to be up that night, and they did bring some bad offal corn for sweepings to my house; then another bag was afterwards taken upon King; what that was I cannot say: Westcote told me he had got into a scrape, and he asked me to help him out of it, and therefore I did tell the constable it was a trifling thing and hoped he would let him go; I did that merely to save him.</p>
               <p>Merrit called nine witnesses who had known him many years and gave him a good character.</p>

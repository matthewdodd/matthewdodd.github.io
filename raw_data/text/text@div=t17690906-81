After that a person came and told me he saw some of them on the Wednesday following at the Black Dog, the house of Mr. Fryer, in Spitalfields. I went there, and there I found nine alive. Mr. Fryer told me he bought them of

I took Mr. Fryer to see them; he said they were the lads that sold the pigeons to him. Mackaway did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060053"></xptr> once rent the loft where the pigeons were taken from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fryer. On the 27th or 28th of May, in the morning, the two prisoners and another came to my house. Mackaway said he had a mind to part with all his pigeons. (I knew him before, and that he did keep pigeons.) He produced five. He is a cooper by trade, and lives in Whitecross street. I gave him five shillings for them. Then the other lad and Fenton went and fetched eleven more. I gave them nine-pence a-piece for them. When they were gone, I asked Mackaway how long they would be gone; he said, Not a long while; they were only gone into Whitecross-street. They came again in about three quarters of an hour. (The pigeons produced in court, and deposed to by prosecutor, pointing out which he bred, and which he bought.)</p>

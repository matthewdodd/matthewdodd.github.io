            . I left the 50l. bill in consequence of that agreement; I never saw any of the company besides the prisoner, nor any body pretending to belong to it - I saw a gentleman named Brown; there was a little stock in the warehouse, but it was thrown away in a few days - they could not get it pickled - the salmon was put in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050061"></xptr>pail, and I believe burnt; I never sold an article - it was all moon-shine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Who did you see in answer to the advertisement? A. I received a letter three or four days after answering it, and went to Peels', and saw a strange gentleman, who referred me to St. Mary-hill - I have seen that person many times since - he is now out of the way; after the agreement was signed, Brown said he was about going into partnership with Earle; I took the prisoner up on the 18th of October, to the Mansion-house; I called with Brown on Mr. Tibbets, my brother-in-law, in Austin-friar's, as there was a suspicion of the bill being genuine; I never knew it was in Brown's hands to negociate - it was taken there to know if it was genuine; I saw Brown in October, when the prisoner was discharged from the Mansion-house for want of the bill being produced; I never saw Brown till he referred me to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you and Brown negociating to take the business into your hands, and supplant me? A. I know nothing whatever of the circumstance; I have been at great pains and expence to find Brown, to place him with the prisoner; he came to the Mansion-house voluntarily to clear himself; one sample of salmon was produced, and after a short time taken away; I was once allowed to take one pot of salmon for my own use.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the stock? A. That was to be brought from Ireland - he represented that he had a right of fishery there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any circulars printed for your use? A. Not for my use; as I understood I was going a journey in a few days I put five hundred circulars into the hands of a commercial friend to distribute; I have a few of them here - there were two or three thousand about the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first complain to me about the bill? A. I could not see him for a fortnight, nor find his residence; I took him up about the 15th of October, but the bill not being due we could not produce it, and he was discharged; he gave me an order on Brown for the bill, but since he was at the Mansion-house, I have lost sight of Brown; I gave Mr. Walker notice on the 6th of October, that the bill was only lodged as a security.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you explain what passed between you and Brown, when he put the bill into your hands? A. I was to have had half my account in money, and half in two months - I could not get the money; I left town, and left my foreman to settle it - this bill was handed over to him; Brown said, "I will endorse this bill over to you if you will give me 20l. out of it" - I was glad to get any security, and said I would, if he would agree to give me good security, but his security was not what I wished, and I kept the bill, as I found it was a very good one; Brown wished to get it back - I would not give it up, and he said, "If you will arrest Earle, and get him out of the company, I will come forward with my friends;" the prisoner gave orders for the oven on the 24th of August, and Brown ordered some additions to it - they pickled a few pots in it; I tasted it - I think I saw about two dozen pots.</p>

I know the Act of Parliament about joint stock companies; allow me to say that on the 11th of August, the draft of a lease for very considerable premises at the bottom of Gray's-inn-lane, was sent to us for perusal, and on the 15th of August I saw the prisoner - his statement to me was, that he had fishing in Ireland, for nearly one thousand years, and there was a proposal, on his part, to dispose of a secret for curing fish, with the fishery, and the lease of the premises at St. Mary-at-hill, to twenty persons, and the prisoner was to receive an annuity of 2000l. for twenty years - on the 7th of August he saw me respecting a meeting which he said was to be held between himself, and a person named Gage, and others, on the 18th; he saw me respecting the party, and on the 22nd, he said the meeting was postponed; he continued from time to time to make that statement.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any thing of the company from that time to this? A. I have not - I have been on the premises at St. Mary-at-hill - they were closed early in October.</p>

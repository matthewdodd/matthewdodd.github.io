             Davis. These things were in the stable, which communicates with the kitchen. On the 8th of September the doors were all made fast - there was a broken pane in the stable window, through which a hand might be put, and the window unbuttoned. Three gentlemens' servants came to me about nine o'clock, I went to the stable with them, and found the bed, bolster, and pillow on the stairs, tied up ready to be taken away. They were kept in a room over the stable. I missed some blankets.</p>

            . I am porter to the Earl of Radnor. I saw the prisoner and another man standing at the corner of Mr. Davis's stables. I had known him by sight for twelve months. Lord Sidmouth's coachman asked them what they wanted - the prisoner said he belonged to the premises, and began to pump at the pump; the other man said he came to fetch some things of the prisoner's away. The coachman told him to convince him that he had a right there to come to the Burlington Arms, as the people were there who knew the premises; the prisoner went to the corner, but would not go in. He referred us to the Green Dragon, in Swallow-street, where he said his coat and hat were. We went there, he took his coat off the bench, and went out with it, but without his hat. We afterwards went to the front of the house to warn the people, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ramsay, of Conduit-street. I heard the prisoner talk to Holding, and confirm his statement - they left me, and went with the prisoner to the Green Dragon. I then went to my stable in the same mews; I afterwards came out, and saw the prisoner coming up the street, he saw me, and made into the Burlington Arms - he was without his hat, but had his coat on then. I followed him into the yard, and saw him get on the parapet wall, and into the prosecutor's stable window. I called to him, he said he was going to sleep there. I said good night, then procured five men and a light, placed three at the back of the house, and took two with me to the front, and found him at the bottom of the stairs. The property was tied up, and his hat laid by the side of them - he claimed the hat. He said Lady Rumbold's coachman gave him leave to sleep there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 82.) I went to the White Horse, in Pitfield-street, on Friday, the 30th of Aug.—I received from Mr. Wells, the landlord, this box, which I produce—I took it to the Smithfield station-house, and opened it with this key, which was given to me there—the box it directed "For William Franklin, pig dealer, St. Neots, Huntingdonshire"—I found in the box a quantity of male apparel, in coats, trowsers, and so on—I found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—I searched the pockets of the clothes, but found nothing—I then took up this coat, and felt something <hi rend="italic">crimp</hi> in the sleeve of it—I looked, and found it had been un<lb></lb>ripped between, the lining and the sleeve—I put my fingers in, and found the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes and two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; notes which I have produced to-day, and which the witnesses have seen—I marked the notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Wells, a publican, in Pitfield-street, Hox<lb></lb>ton. About six o'clock on Thursday morning, the 29th of Aug., the pri<lb></lb>soner came and brought this box—he wrote this direction on it—it was not corded up when he brought it, but he corded it there, and asked if he could leave it to be taken care of—I told him he could if he left it inside the bar.</p>

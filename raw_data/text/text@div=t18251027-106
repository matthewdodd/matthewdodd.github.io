            . I am a labourer at the East India warehouse. On the 27th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was near Mr. Holloway's house, which is in <placeName id="t18251027-106-crimeloc581">New-terrace, Mile-end</placeName>

I am sure he is the man; the other three separated when they got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you an opportunity of seeing him? A. About half a minute. I never said I saw but one person come out of the window.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was near Mr. Holloway's house, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I ran to the Commercial-road, and saw the prisoner running very fast with this bundle, and when I got within three yards of him he dropped it. I called Stop thief! and he was stopped immediately, without my losing sight of him. I picked up the bundle.</p>

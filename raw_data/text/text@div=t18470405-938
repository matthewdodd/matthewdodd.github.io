                  </hi> I live in Alpha-place, Regent's-park. On Saturday, the 13th of March, a little girl came up stairs to me—I went down and saw the prisoner—she had sent word up stairs that she was a pew-opener—I asked</p>

               <p>her what she wanted—she said she came from the Foundling-hospital—I saw a portion of a coat hanging under her shawl—I took hold of it, and found it was my own coat—I said I should give her in charge of a policeman—she said, "You can't do that, you did not see me take it"—I looked out and saw a policeman—I beckoned to him, but he did not see me—I went back and got my hat—the prisoner went out, and was going away, but I got a policeman, and he took her—I had thrown the coat down in the hall.</p>

                  </hi> I saw the prisoner take the coat off the nail in the hall—I took hold of the sleeve, and I asked her what she was going to do with it—she turned up against the wall, so that I could not see the coat—Mr. Gutteridge came down directly.</p>

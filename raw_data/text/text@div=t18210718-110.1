I was continually being robbed, and discharging my men on account of it, but did not suspect him. On the 5th of May, I discharged five men and the prisoner also. I told him I would give him work to do at home, as I had confidence in him. On Thursday afternoon I was coming through Hanway-yard, and saw his wife in a shop offering figures for sale; I went in and asked how she came by them; she said one of the workmen gave them to her husband. I took her to Marlborough-street, and went to the prisoner's lodging, and asked if he had any property of mine; we searched, and in a drawer found the articles stated in the indictment. I said, "How could you rob me in this way, when I kept every thing shut up?" he said his wife gave them to him out of the store-room; his wife chared at the house.</p>

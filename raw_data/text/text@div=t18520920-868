                  </hi>. I live at 6, Durham-place, Dalston; I was formerly a farmer, residing at Chingford, in Essex. In June, this year, I was desirous of emigrating, and sold off for that purpose—I intended to proceed to Port Philip, in Australia—on 25th June I was passing through Austin-friars, and saw a board hanging out in the yard, against a tree, at No. 6—there was a large placard on the board, with red letters, on which was "Gold Mineral Company," or something of that sort—it was about emigration—it said the vessel was going to Port Philip—I did not read it—I went upstairs to the second floor, into what appeared to be the office of the company—I saw the prisoners, and three other persons—Mr. Greenwood was one—the title of the company was on the doorposts of the office—I spoke to Mr. Tripe, and asked him about the vessel going to Australia—I told him I had seen the board below, and asked him if he had anything to do with it—he said he had, and I told him I wanted to go to Port Philip—he said, "<hi rend="italic">We</hi> have a vessel going"—I asked him how much he would take us for—he said, "25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each"—I asked him how much he would take off for four to a certainty, and it might be six, including myself—he said he would take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off—I asked him to take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off, and he said very likely he would, but he would see when we came to pay the money—he gave me this bill, with a dietary scale on it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it says they allow a bottle of wine a week, and a pint of beer a day—I was attracted by that; I thought it was very good living on the water—I am a Welchman—I asked him when the vessel was going, and where she was—he said she was going between the 15th and 20th July—(he had named the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> to me)—I wanted to go and see the vessel, and he</p>

Docks, Import Dock"—he said it was a very quick voyage; she had come home ten days sooner than any other one had come from Sidney here—I asked him if it belonged to a good firm—he said the company was very respectable; that there was a lord belonging to it; they were a gold mineral company; and that they had engaged the ship—"In fact," he said, <hi rend="italic">"we</hi> engage the ship;" and that it had been surveyed, and found all right; he did not say by whom—it was next day, when we went to pay the money, that he said there was a lord belonging to it; I had asked him if it was safe for me to pay my money—I cannot remember what I said, it is so long ago—I did not see Montague the first day—after that conversation with Tripe, we left the office—a man named Barker was with me—I went with him to the West India Docks, and went on board the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and next day we went to the office again—we met Tripe coming out into the street, as we were waiting for another person to meet us—I told him we were coming to pay him the money, but we were waiting for another man to come up, and I asked him what he would take off—I said he must take off 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, as there were four of us to pay the money—he said, "It is a great deal to take off, but I will do it"—he ran indoors, Barker and me remaining outside—he came out again, and said, "I have made it all right with Mr. Montague;" that he was going on business, and we had better go upstairs—he then went away from the officer—I went upstairs with Barker and Wagner, and saw Montague, in a private room, not the room in which I had seen Tripe—I told him we were going to pay part of the money for the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, to go to Australia, and said, "My name it Jones"—he said, "Oh, ah, it is all right"—I said, "I suppose Mr. Tripe settled the fare with you how much I am to pay?"—he said, "Oh, yes"—while we were talking, Tripe came in, and I said, "You said, Mr. Tripe, you would take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each off, did not you?"—he said, "Oh, yes, that is right, Mr. Montague"—I said, "I saw the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> and the mate, and he said it was all right; they have been looking at it; they have settled with it to go out—Montague and tripe said it was a very fine qcick-passaged vessel—Montague said the vessel was engaged by the company to go out—I am sure of that; and Tripe said also the vessel was engaged, but he did not tell me who by, but he was present, and must have heard what Montague said—we were to pay 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—that was the half of the passage money—I laid the money on the table—Tripe counted it, and Montague put it into the drawer, wrote this receipt and gave it to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—Australian Gold and General Mining Company, 6, Austin-friars, London, June 26, 1852. Mr. J.

               <p>Australia," I believed him, and when Montague told me so the second time, I believed it, or else I should not have paid my money—I believed the representations they made—afterwards, in consequence of something that occurred, I made inquiries of various persona, and, about a fortnight after paying the money, I went again to Austin-friars, but could not find the defendants; they hsd left the office—there were other persons inquiring as well as myself—I eventually found out that the offices were removed to 26, Harp-lane, from the clerk to Tripe and Montague, whom I happened to meet that day—Harp-lane is near the Custom-house—I called there several times, and eventually saw Tripe—that was six or seven days, at near as I can recollect, after I had paid the money—I asked Tripe about our money back—he told me Mr. Montague had all the money—I said, "Mr. Tripe, I am come here after my money; I understand this vessel it not going at all," or something like that—(there were three men with me out<lb></lb>side)—he called me into the private counting-house alone, and said he was very sorry he could not pay the money then, but not to make any noise about it—I said I would not make any noise if he would pay me the money—he told roe Mr. Montague had all the money, and was at Bristol; that he (Tripe) was going to charter a vessel, and he expected Montague back every day—I told him he was telling a falsehood, for that Montague was in Whitecross-street—Tripe then said he was—I again asked him for my money—he said he could not give it to me; he had not got it; Montague had it—(previous to that I had been to Montague)—I said I would go to Montague"—I went, and found him in Whitecross-street prison—I told him I was very sorry to see him there, and said, "I have come after my money; Mr. Tripe says you have got it"—he said he had not; that Tripe had it—he said Tripe had every<lb></lb>thing, and that he was taken there for debt, for the rent—he said he would write me a letter directly to Tripe, to give me the money back—his wife wrote the note, and he signed it, and gave it to me—he begged me not to be too hard upon him, for the sake of his wife and children—he said I was to be quick, and with<lb></lb>out doubt Tripe would pay me the money back; that he should be very sorry that any bother should be made about it, or for his name to be published—I said I wanted my money—I took the note to Tripe the same day—I did not get the money—when I delivered him the note he said he had not got any money; that Montague had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not know what 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—other persons were with me when I went back to Tripe—we all went to Captain Lane, the Government inspector of emigration, next day, and the matter was brought before a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>a company, and whether it was respectable, for the purpose of governing me in my conduct—I meant, if they were not respectable, not to part with my money—no prospectuses were shown me with the names of persons as directors on them—Tripe told me there was a company, and that they were sitting twice or three times a week—he did not show me the names, but he told me some of them—he said Lord Kilworth was one—he did not give me his address or show it to me—he said Major Hawkes was another—he did not give me his address—he told me Mr. Edward Rudson Read, wine merchant, of Mark-lane, was another—and that Captain Smith was one—he did not tell me that Charles Brown was another—he said John Lutwyche was one—he did not say of Hendon—he did not tell me that the Hon. Charles Plunkett, or Mr. Hud<lb></lb>son, or Richard Burton, were others—he told me that Mr. Greenwood was secretary—Mr. Greenwood was present the greater part of the time when the representations were made; not every time, but twice or three times—he was present on the 25th and 26th at Austin-friars—Barker, a friend of mine, was also present—Greenwood was present during the whole of the conversation with Tripe on the 25th, and on the 26th he came in when I was paying the money—I saw no gentlemen during any of those periods besides Tripe and Greenwood—I saw three or four young men sitting there writing—I saw Major Hawkes at the Mansion House—I do not know Lord Kilworth—I heard the Alderman say something about him—his name was mentioned pub<lb></lb>licly before the Alderman, and the names of Major Hawkes, Captain Smith, John Lutwyche, and Mr. Greenwood also—I do not recollect that Mr. Rudson Read's name was mentioned—Tripe never told me he himself was a director—I treated him as a clerk in the employment of the company—Tripe did not refer to Greenwood, on 26th from time to time before he answered my ques<lb></lb>tions—Greenwood did not, when the vessel's name was mentioned, write the piece of paper which enabled us to go on board—he put these figures on the back of it, remarking that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was too much to take off—Barker was present—I am not aware that Greenwood and Tripe spoke together after Greenwood had written the figures on the paper—I cannot pledge myself whether they did or did not—90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was mentioned, but I do not know whether by Green<lb></lb>wood or Tripe—Tripe told us he would let us kuow next day whether they could take 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was spokesman for the party—I asked what they would take half a dozen for—I do not know which of them it was answered "140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—all the money was paid to Montague—Greenwood was present at the time, walking backwards and forwards—he is a man of about fifty years of age, I should imagine—I went on board the vessel, and saw a person on board who said he was the mate, and that the ship was engaged—I have never seen him since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the firm of Messrs. Willis and Co., ship brokers, of Crosby-square. In June last they were brokers of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, which was lying in the West India Docks—if any arrangement had been made with reference to the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, it would have come under my cognisance in the regular course of business—I have seen both the defendants—I saw Mr. Tripe first; it was at the office of what I believed to be the company, in Austin-friars—I went there in, consequence of receiving two notes from Mr. Tripe—I believe those notes are destroyed; I have tried to find them, but have not got them—I have searched in all likely places—I put them in my pocket, and as I am in the habit of destroying anything that is of no use, I have no doubt that they are destroyed—they requested me to call on Mr. Montague at the office—it was in consequence of the second letter that I went—I believe it was on 25th June, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that was the first time I called—I saw Tripe there—he brought me into a room marked "Board room," and there I saw Mr. Montague—I told him I had come in consequence of those notes to learn what he had to propose for the <hi rend="italic">Camlla</hi> (the notes had mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>)—we had a general conversation, the words of which I do not remember—he said he would send us a positive offer the following morning by 10 for the charter of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and the conver<lb></lb>sation ended—Tripe was present during the whole of the time—there was a sum spoken of, for chartering the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, about 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I think I said we should expect about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were various sums mentioned during the conversation—I heard nothing more from the defendants about the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>—that was the first interview; I had a subsequent one—there was no propo<lb></lb>sition sent to us the following morning—the other interview I had was in consequence of it having come to our ears that passages had been engaged for the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>—that was about fourteen days afterwards—I saw Mr. Monta<lb></lb>gue at the same office in Austin-friars—I told him we had heard it, and we could not allow it, and I came to see what he had to say before we took steps to put a stop to it—he said, as near as I can remember, that he understood that passages had been taken, and that he regretted it, and would take care it should not happen again, and that the money should be returned—that was all that passed between us—Tripe was not present at that interview; I have not seen him since—the 2,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have had to be paid for the chartering before the vessel was permitted to go on her voyage—I had never given any authority, either to Tripe or Montague, to engage berths in the <hi rend="italic">Canilla</hi>—I have told all that passed on the subject.</p>

               <p>the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, and previously for another vessel, over a period occasionally of three weeks or a month; it came to nothing—I saw Greenwood at the office of the company, the second time I called—I spoke to him, but nothing on the subject of the chartering—I saw a gentleman, who was afterwards pointed out to me at the Mansion House as Major Hawkes; he was writing at a table in the office, in the board room—I did not see any of the other directors that I am aware of—I saw no prospectuses there—I did not see one at the Mansion House—I saw one, I think, here last session, at the time we were waiting for the Grand Jury—there no doubt would be a mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, but I am not aware of the fact—he would be the officer in command in dock, when the captain was ashore—the owners of the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> are Fletcher and Sons, of Limehouse; a negotiation could have been opened directly with them—the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi> had not been advertised at that time—in chartering a ship, any man can act as broker who can find employment for a ship—we were not employed by Messrs. Fletcher to let the vessel; we had no authority to let it without their sanction, but we knew if we could let it the Fletchers' would be extremely glad to avail themselves of our services—the broker is asked if he can recommend a vessel; that was the case in this instance, we were asked to recommend a vessel; there are plenty of brokers in the City of London, to any of whom these parties might have gone—a deposit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be sufficient to secure the ship; a deposit of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might, but that question was mooted by me with Mr. Montague—I did not hear anything said about the company, I took no note of it.</p>

In June last I was desirous of send<lb></lb>ing a nephew of mine out to Australia—on 28th June I was going along Lime-street, and observed a board in front of No. 8, with two bills on it; one was of a ship going out, and the other was headed "Australian Gold and Emigration Company"—I did not read any more—I went into the house, No. 8, and found Tripe there, and a little boy—I asked Tripe if they had any vessels going to Australia—he said yes, they had got a very nice one just come home from Valparaiso, and that she would be going out to Port Philip about 20th July—I asked the name, and he told me it was the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—he did not say whose ship she was, or who had the management or ownership—I talked about hiring a passage for my nephew, and asked him the price—he told me, for the open steerage, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if I could see the ship, and he went with me and my nephew to the City canal, where we found a French vessel of that name—I went on board of her—Tripe accompanied us, and</p>

               <p>went over the vessel—it was not fitted up—he said the Government offcer Would soon be over it no doubt he wouid pass it, and she would be readyfor the dry dock in afew days—I understood him that the company had engaged the ship, that he was engaged by the company, and that the company had chartered the ship—I will undertake to swear I understood him to say that the company had engaged the ship, and she would go out in a very short time—he used the word "chartered"—he gave me no further information of what the company was, or who composed it, but I understood from Tripe that they were a respectable company—I found a French crew on board the ship—I spoke about that to Tripe, and he said that in the charter half the crew were to be English—I did not then arrange with Tripe to pay the money for the passage—we came back to Lime-street, and I wanted to see a dietary scale; he gave me a bill, and said the dietary would be the same as the <hi rend="italic">Abel Gower</hi>; then, after some conversation, I asked him if he could give me a list of the company; he looked about, but could not find one, but he told me they were perfectly respectable gentlemen—I told him as the Govern<lb></lb>ment officer had not yet passed the ship, as soon as he had done so, if he wrote to me I would come down and pay the money—he said the company could not do that, because there were only two or three places va<lb></lb>cant, and they could not keep them for me; and on those terms I was obliged to pay the money to secure a place—I then paid half the passage money, amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"No. 18, Lime-street, June 28, 1852.

               <p>interpreted it, that the vessel was chartered to go to Port Philip—the captain is a Frenchman—the vessel was not chartered on 22nd June to go to Port Philip—I saw both the defendants at Austin Friars—they said they had merely gone on board to look at our ship among a number of others; which was satis<lb></lb>factory—I asked them what was the utmost price they would give for the ship, provided the owners would allow her to go to Port Philip—(they had said no<lb></lb>thing to me about chartering the vessel before that)—they said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a registered ton—the vessel was 384 tons French register, 464 English—I informed them that I would communicate with the owners, and immediately I got a reply I would let them know—on Friday the 25th I saw Mr. Montague twice, to the best of my recollection, and Mr. Tripe once—Mr. Tripe was in the outer office—he conducted me into the board room, where Montague was—there was some conversation about chartering the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—the negotiation went on from the 25th to 28th, but no arrangement was concluded about chartering the vessel—it went off for want of a sufficient guarantee—I asked them for the guarantee—I asked them if they could give me the names of four of the directors, and their signatures to this document, by which I meant the signa<lb></lb>tures of the directors themselves—they did not produce the signatures of any directors to me—neither of them undertook to do it—that was suggested on the last occasion, the 28th—Mr. Montague said he could not ask for it, but he pointed to a sum of money lying on the table, which was to be at our dis<lb></lb>posal on signing the contract, and which was stated to be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they offered no guarantee of any kind—that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be the first instalment if the matter was carried out—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was drawn up by me as the terms on which the vessel was to be chartered—the whole sum would hare to be paid before the vessel finally left the docks—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit would have entitled them to sell berths, provided she had gone through the regular survey by the Government—it was on the morning of the 28th that I saw Montague—Tripe was not with him—I cannot charge my memory whether Tripe was with him on the 28th, on the second occasion—Tripe took part in the conversations—he suggested different things—the negotiation was broken off on the afternoon of the 28th—it was in the morning that the guarantee was first mentioned—we did not break off in the morning—this charter was drawn up on Saturday afternoon, and I left it for Mr. Montague's perusal on Monday morning, he asked me if I would have the goodness to leave it, as he had to see a friend about it, and I left it, and went again in the afternoon—Tripe had called on me during the negotiation—on Saturday afternoon, the 26th, he called at our counting-house—I did not enter into proposals with him—Montague promised to be with me at four o'clock in the afternoon, but instead of his keeping his promise, Mr. Tripe came with some<lb></lb>body else, and I declined entering into it with him—I was rather angry that Mr. Montague did not keep his appointment, and refused to have anything to say to them—the party who came with him was Mr. Railton—our firm is Batten and Edwards—I never authorized Montague or Tripe to dispose of berths on board the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi>—she is now on her way to Calcutta—we acted as brokers for the owners, and she was chartered to Calcutta—I did not see Montague or Tripe after the 28th till they were in custody—I did not hear that either of them had sold any passages on board the <hi rend="italic">Medicis</hi> until they were in custody—if we were the brokers of a vessel which had been chartered, it would not be at all necessary that the parties who had chartered the vessel should com<lb></lb>municate with us about the passage; it is just like a person letting a house, they can do as they like with it after they have got it—it is marked out by the Government inspector to carry so many passengers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the United General Gaslight Company. Their offices are at 6, Austin-friars—the whole house belongs to us; we let off a portion of it—I know Montague well—about two years and a half ago we underlet a portion of that house, which we did not require for our own use, to the Union Mining Company—about April or May this year I found Montague in possession of the offices which I had let to the Union Mining Company—I did not know how he came into possession—I came back from Ireland, and on applying for six or nine months arrears of rent,</p>

               <p>found him in possession—he did not pay it—it was a difficult matter to find when he did come in, but he was found there, and I applied to him for the arrears of rent repeatedly—when I first applied to him, I said the Union Mining Company owed us rent—he said, "Give me time, and I may pay something of it; and I wish to apply to your board to become the permanent tenant of this place"—I said, "My board will object to it"—he said very little about the former company—I expressed surprise to him at his being there—I said, "You are here without our consent"—he appeared to wish to become the tenant very strongly, and to make arrangements to continue—he postponed for a day or two—the board instructed me to issue a writ, and a broker went in—I said, "Bring me one responsible party from your company, and his guarantee will satisfy my board, and we will treat with you," and Mr. Lutwyche was mentioned—we distrained on 22nd or 23rd June this year—I pressed him for a name and he gave me Mr. Lutwyche's, but refused the guarantee—he said, "Don't press me for a day or two; time is the great object"—I believe I said, "Surely, your company will not break up for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," the amount of the writ—he then promised 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a day or two, and on 27th June he was not to be found there; or I may be wrong about 27th June, it was the following Saturday, 4th July—I did not receive the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or any guarantee—we never received any rent from Montague during the time he occupied the office—I saw Tripe in the house, up and down, several times, and twice in our establishment—he came and begged for time; it was not exactly said to me, it was said with open doors, begging for time and promising a few pounds in a week or so—I cannot remember what he said; it was not a direct communication to me—he said, "In a day or two certain arrangements will be made"—he appeared to make the application as two joint parties—he did not say anything about being sent by Montague—I never saw anybody else about it—it was a remonstrance, "Why do you send us out? why are you so harsh to us?" but the internal management I am a stranger to—I also saw a third party whom I do not know; it was before the goods were surrendered—he came and pleaded hard, but Mr. Lutwyche I was not allowed to see—I said, "I want to call on Lutwyche," or, "Bring Lutwyche to me," but he declined, and they said, "Do not call"—I believe I expressed the wish, "Bring me a responsible party" two or three times—he did not name any person besides Lutwyche in the course of conversation—I may have expressed the wish twice to call on Mr. Lutwyche—before the premises were closed, Montague was absent three or four days—I think the premises were closed about 7th or 8th July.</p>

Julius Tripe, and Co."—that was about a week or nine days after 3rd or 4th July—Montague did not come there at any time—I never saw Montague till I saw him standing where he is—Mr. Tripe used to come there every day, and I saw a good many persons coming in and out of the office, but I do not know their business—Tripe remained, it might be, about three weeks after the name of "C. Julius Tripe and Co." was written up—he did not sleep at the house, he only occupied it as an office—I did not know of his leaving, he gave me no notice of it; his father attended when he left the office—I have had no money in advance, and have been paid no rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canterbury-road, Newington. In June last, I was desirous of emigrating to Australia—I was acquainted with a person named Waterford, who was going to emigrate, and in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing he told me, I went to 6, Austin-friars—I do not recollect the day, but I should say somewhere about 13th or 14th June; it was 10th July I was to sail—I only saw a couple of youths at Austin-friars, but I saw Tripe the same day at Captain Tomlins's, 63, Cornhill—Mr. Vallance, a solicitor, in Essex-street, had money of mine to pay the passage—I told Tripe if he would go up to Mr. Vallance he could receive the money for my passage—it was not mentioned then what ship I was to go by—I did not go with Tripe to Mr. Vallance's—I did not pay the money; Tripe told me he had received it—I saw him write this receipt, and believe this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be in his writing—after I had read it, I saw him on the subject of it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Australian Gold and Emigration Company, 6, Austin-friars, June 23rd, 1852.—Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that our ship, which sails on 15th July, (the <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>), is now in the West India Import Dock, which you can go and see; she as just returned from the colony in ninety-one days, and a very fine ship; I am, dear Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. Tripe, superintendent of shipping"—after I received that letter, I saw Mr. Montague in Austin-friars—I asked him if I could get any passengers what he would allow me; I spoke to him and Tripe on that subject in what was considered the board room, and took the letter I had received from Tripe with me—I did not show it to Montague, but I spoke to him on the subject—I asked him whether if I could get them some passengers, as I was going by their vessel, what they would allow me by way of commission—Mr. Tripe appealed to Montague, and asked what they could allow, and he said they could allow me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per head—I did not succeed in getting any; the affair blew up soon after—I had received a sort of printed receipt from Tripe, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is not for the second 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that is alluded to; this is the receipt for the money Mr. Vallance paid for me, he paid no more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not had it back, or any part of it—I found no <hi rend="italic">Camilla</hi>, or any passage—(<hi rend="italic">receipt read, marked</hi> G.—"Australian Gold and Emigration Company, 6, Austin-friars, June 22nd, 1852.—Mr. Finch has paid 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as deposit, on account of passage money, per a ship to sail 20th July; Capt.

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Bloomsbury-street, Bedford-square, and am an attorney. The name in this prospectus (C) is not in my writing—I was never appointed solicitor to this company.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware that in any degree, during the investigation at the Mansion House, any favour was shown to any of the directors, or to any other party? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; and in lieu of favour, there was great harsh<lb></lb>ness, as I wanted to elicit the truth.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand that Lord Kilworth was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, under summons, the first time; I had no personal knowledge of him—I had some personal communication with him, independent of what took place at the Mansion House; it was on the subject of this case—I heard the case against the whole of the persons summoned with the intention of committing such parties as I thought the case was made out against—Lord Kilworth and Major Hawkes were not at all in the same position as the defendants—they were summoned by my direction, because their names were on the prospectus, to answer any question that might be put to them—I could not tell whether I should examine them as witnesses, or what I intended to do, until I beard the case—I without hesitation granted the summonses—they were to answer any questions—nothing occurred to cause them to be defendants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean they were summoned there on speculation, to see if any<lb></lb>thing occurred to make defendants of them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the case; I should say Tripe certainly did not attend voluntarily, but I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said you had some communication, which was not public, with Lord Kilworth; be good enough to state what it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know it was Lord Kilworth sitting next to me, and seeing him, I said, "Have you any professional gentleman engaged for you?"—he said, "No, I shall merely tell my own tale; I don't want any professional gentleman."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell his own tale? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he did not know anything of the company—I did not bind him over, because I had nothing to do with him.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Montague was brought up on a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> from Whitecross-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; none of the directors who were summoned were examined as witnesses on the part of the prose<lb></lb>cution—I do not remember that you made a request that they should be examined in the defendant's hearing and mine—you did not ask me to exa<lb></lb>mine them, or I should not have refused your request—as you were present at all the examinations, you will give me credit for saying that I thoroughly investigated the case, not only against the defendants, but against all parties—I remember at the examination a book, in the shape of a day book or some<lb></lb>thing of that kind, being produced as evidence on the part of the prosecution, a book belonging to this Mining company, in which the names of persons were written—I do not know where that book is—it was the only book that we could obtain from the office at all—it was called a call book.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 13, West-street, St. Giles's, and have the care of an Episcopal Chapel there—the service of the Church of England is performed there. On Wednesday night, 23rd Feb., I left the chapel locked up safe—the vestry door was locked, and all the property within was safe—I went there again about nine o'clock on Thursday morning—the vestry had then been broken into, the plate-chest broken open, and a chalice, two pat<lb></lb>tens, or salvers, and two cups, which were used for the purposes of the Church, taken from it—the poor-box in the chapel had been broken open, and a little money taken from it—three cassocksm a gown, and two scarfs were also gone, and some money, out of a small cupboard.</p>

On Thursday, 24th Feb., I went to West-street Episcopal Chaple—the outer door was not broken open—at the vestry door the door<lb></lb>post had been worked away by a chisel, or some sharp instrument, which allowed the box of the lock to be forced back, with a little pressure, and the door to Come open—there were marks of its having been forced—I afterwards went to Compton-street and High-street, and saw the three prisoners walking up High-street together—I got out of the way, as well as I could, into a pawnbroker's shop, and as they came by I beard Welch say to either or both of them, "Now don't be a b—y month, and I will wait for you"—they went on, and Welch waited close by there—I lost sight of the other two and of Welch, for a minute—I them fetched West and another constable, and when we came to the end of Compton-street I saw Robins coming down on the opposite side—where he saw me he ran up a court—I ran after him, and said I wanted him—West came, and took him into custody—I then came out of the court, and Davis was passing by with this handkerchief, which I afterwards found contained nearly all the plate—the handle of the chalice was aticking out of the handkerchief, through an opening—it was not tide up very closely—whether he saw us or not I cannot say, but he turned into a shop close by there—I went to him, and told him I wanted him for stealing the communion<lb></lb>plate in West street—he said he knew nothing about it, and commenced fighting with me very violently—I ultimately secured him, and handed him over to another constable—I then went into a barber's shop, at the corner of Hampshire Hog<lb></lb>yard, where I saw Welch standing, and said I wanted him for being concerned with Davis and Robins in stealing, the communion<lb></lb>plate in West-street—after conveying him to the station-house, I went to 27, Compton-street, to the back room, third floor, and there found the remnants of two surplices, these three letter<lb></lb>bags, and other property—I had seen Robins go into that house once previously—I believe they are his discharged at the station-house—Robins stated at the station that she was his wife—West also found a great number of things there.</p>

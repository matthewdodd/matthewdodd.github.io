                  </hi>. I live at Lower Tulse-hill, Brixton, and carry on the business of a silk trimming-manufacturer in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row. The two prisoners were apprenticed to me from the parish—I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium with each—their time was very nearly out—they slept in the warehouse, for the protection of the place—in consequence of suspicions I entertained, I desired my foreman to obtain officers to watch them—some silk was afterwards produced to me, which I identified—it is worth 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

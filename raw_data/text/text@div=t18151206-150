            . I am an officer belonging to the public office, Bow-street. I recollect meeting the two prisoners at about a quarter past six, on the evening of the 1st of December, in Play-house-yard; they had two looking-glasses, each carrying one. Frost was with me; he laid hold of Brooks, and asked him where he got the glasses, and he pointed to Gilvin, and said this is the person who employed me to carry them; I directly went and laid hold of Gilvin, and told Frost to keep fast hold, for I knew Gilvin. We took them into the public-house, and I searched Gilvin, and found on him a pair of gloves, and a pair of spectacles. I asked him where he got the gloves, and he said they belonged to himself; and the spectacles he could give no account of at all. We took them to Bow-street, where they were committed; and in coming across Spa-fields we heard of the robbery. We went to the prosecutor's house and there they gave an accurate description of one of the glasses.</p>

I saw the two glasses in his houss, at ten o'clock on Friday morning, and missed them about six in the evening; they were hung up by screws to the wall. The bottom sash of the windows was laid open at that time, and the parlour blinds laid open two; but the shuttets put to; any person could have got into the parlour by opening the sash. I had not seen the windows from teno'clock in the morning. until six in the evening. I won't say anything about the gloves, but I know the glasses to be my master's property, as well as the spectacles.</p>

            . I am horsekeeper at Mr. Flight's, Adelphi-wharf. I was in the stable just by the gateway, and a man come down in a white jacket and an apron, about seven o'clock; he called Benfield out, and talked to him. I will not swear Dexter was the man. They turned back; the caravan came out of Benfield's stable, turned round there, loaded with furniture. Reynolds's horse fell down; he had a cart there loaded with grains. Benfield was with the caravan when it set off. The goods came out of the warehouse over Jenny's hole.</p>

            . I am a private watchman at the Adelphi. Between nine and ten o'clock on the night in question, I found the prosecutor's premises in Jenny's hole broken open; I went and informed him, he came down, and missed the things. Next morning information was given of the prisoners - I took them. Dexter said he drove the caravan up, and that the goods went into a small court, in Drury-lane; he said he was employed by two Irishmen and a sailor to move them, and that he paid Benfield 2s. 6d. for the use of the caravan.</p>

             Simpson; she is a baker; she lives in Stanhope-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; he lived in her service about twelve months ago. On the 3rd of September, I missed a black coat, a pair of grey trowsers, a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, a two-pound note, and five one-pound bank notes. These things were put in my box; my box was at the top of the house; the bake-house was in the lower floor. I missed the property on the 3rd of September, about eleven o'clock. In consequence of that, I traced out the prisoner; I suspected him. I had seen the prisoner about two months before that, at my mistress' house. I traced out the prisoner at the Edenburgh Castle public-house, at Wapping; I found that he had lodged there on Saturday and Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was the 3rd of September - A. That was Saturday. I enquired if he was at home; they expected him soon. I waited, and in about half an hour, he came in. I told him he was the man I wanted; (however, in the mean time, I sent a young woman down, to the Thames Police office, for an officer.) When he came in, he was without his hat. When I asked to speak to him, he wanted to go out of the room; I kept the prisoner in the room. The officer came, his name is

            . I delivered the prisoner to him; he took him into custody. We searched him, and found nothing on him. As we went over Hermitage-bridge, the prisoner jumped into the water; there was a boat there that took him up again. Then Dyeball took him again, and brought him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q Have you got your property again - A. No. Part of it is in the constable's hands.</p>

             went away. He happened to come to my house on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know what day of the month it was - A. No. The prisoner was apprehended on the Monday; it was the Saturday before he was apprehended. He came in for his box; he was very much intoxicated. A friend of his seeing him have a great deal of money, advised him to give it me to keep for him; he gave me a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, and five one-pound notes. Then I helped him down with his chest, and put it into the coach. I went with him to the Edinburgh Castle; we put the box down there. His sister came there; I gave her the money at the Edinburgh Castle; I gave to his sister twenty-one pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; a fifteen-pound note, a five-pound note, a one-pound note, and eleven shilling and sixpence in silver. The rest he paid to a young man.</p>

             delivered the prisoner into my charge. I told the prisoner I must search him; which I did, and found nothing. I told him he must go with me to the office; he rather refused. I asked him if he had any clothes there that belonged to him besides what he had got on; he said none but what he stood up in. In taking him to the office, he tried to make his escape, by jumping over the rails into the water; he turned himself on his back, and swam like a cork: he was taken up by a boatman. I got him again, and I took him to the office, and went back and enquired if he had any box there; they readily told me he had, and pointed it out. The box is now in court. My brother officer and I searched the box. In the box we found this coat, and these trowsers.

            . I am an officer. I went with Dyeball to the Edinburgh Castle. I waited for the return of the prisoner's sister; she came in company with her husband. I informed her the situation of her brother, and requested to know if she had received any money of him; her husband answered, we have received three bank notes of him. The sister pulled them out, and shewed me two bank notes, not the third; one is a fifteen-pound bank note, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140020"></xptr>other a five-pound bank note; these are them; I received them of the sister; I have had them in my possession ever since. The other was a one pound note they had broke into. They likewise acknowledged that they had received eleven shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that coat and trowsers - A. The trowsers and coat I am quite clear are my property. The fifteen pound note produced by Mr. Smith; and the five pound note, are part of the property I had in my box. I know them by my handwriting being upon them.</p>

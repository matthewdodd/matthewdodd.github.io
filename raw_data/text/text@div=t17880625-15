               <p>On the 7th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner Hoddy in St. James's Park.</p>
               <p>What was you doing there? - I was going home, I had been into Oxford Road.</p>
               <p>Where do you lodge? - In Gravel Lane.</p>
               <p>So you took St. James's Park in your way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were very drunk I suppose? - I was not sober, nor I was not very drunk, I went home with Hoddy.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - No; I gave her money to get salmon and beer for supper, and then we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Did you undress yourself? - Yes, I put my breeches under my head, and the rest of my clothes on the bed, and my shoes and buckles and hat under the bed, I waked about seven o'clock in the morning, and found all my clothes gone, and I was locked into the room; I could not tell what to do, I would have jumped out of window, but I could not get down; I found a poker in the room, with which I broke open the door, and a soldier that lodged in the under room lent me some clothes to go home in; he and I went about to try to find my clothes but could not find them; as I was going home I was told that the woman was taken, I went back and found the prisoner Hardiman in custody; she owned where Hoddy was, and then Hoddy was brought to the office.</p>
               <p>You only saw Hoddy the night before? - No, I went with Hoddy to a woman's where she had sold my shoes and hat; the Justice gave her the shoes and hat till the trial came on, and she has since run away, I found all the other things and they were produced before the Justice the next day.</p>

               <p>Was you sober enough to know Hoddy again, think you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>

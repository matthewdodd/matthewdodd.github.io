On the 26th of August, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was alarmed by the barking of a dog; I was in bed, I got out of bed, opened the window, and I looked in the front area, where I saw the prisoner with his hands in the butter safe; I called to him and asked him what he did there; he attempted to make his escape by climbing up the area wall. I then called the watch and sprang the rattle; which I heard answered in several places; it was a very fine moon light night; I directed the watchman where I saw him go; he turned down Weston street, which is the first turning. I presently heard he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not pretend to say it was the prisoner by seeing of him - A. I do; I was about seven or eight yards from him; I was in the bed room on the second floor; he had a white jacket on. I should not have known him by his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any butter - A. Yes, two pound and a half; I saw the butter there the morning before the butter was gone, and the safe door was open.</p>
               <p>- I am one of the patrols of Bow-street; I heard the rattle; I saw him coming down York street, Battle bridge, coming from Mr. Cook's, and eight or nine watchmen running after him; when I came up to him he knocked me down; I instantly got up and pursued him again; when I came to him again another of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140041"></xptr>my brother patrol was struggling with him; we secured him and took him to the watchhouse. Two pounds and a half of butter was found upon him.</p>

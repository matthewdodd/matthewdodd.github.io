On the 4th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop with two others; they asked to look at a silk hat; I showed one to one of his companions - it did not fit him; I put that into the window, and went to the back of the shop for another; the hat was within reach of either of them - when I came back the prisoner was gone, and his two companions had removed from the window; they then bought a hat, and paid for it. I went to put away the hats afterwards and missed the one I had put into the window; there was no other person there at the time. I looked about, and saw an old hat at the end of the counter. I then went down White-cross-st. - and on coming back I looked up Playhouse-yard, and saw the two persons who had come with the prisoner, just turning into Golden-lane; I watched them into a court; and then lost sight of them. I got an officer, and saw the prisoner in about five minutes afterwards, in another court in Golden-lane, with the hat on his head; he said he had bought it of a Jew that morning, and had given his own in exchange, and 10 s. I am quite certain that it is mine; it has our private mark in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. All the hats have the same private mark - A. Yes. I have sold a variety of hats corresponding in price and quality with this. I never saw the prisoner before that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired captain in the army, but am now agent for Gordon and Co., wine merchants, in Dublin; I lodge in George-street, Old Kent-road. On 12th April I was in the main road, which I consider High-street, Deptford—I met a man named Murphy, and had some conversation with him—I had never seen him before, but he was a poor-looking wretch, and I thought I would give him a meal—in consequence of that I went to a butcher's shop and purchased a beef steak; I went to the Star and Garter beer shop to have it cooked—after I had finished it, and sat a little time, the prisoner came into the room; I am not sure whether he came in before I finished my steak or afterwards—Murphy addressed him, and had some conversation with him—after I had finished my steak, the prisoner and I had some conversation—I gave him some refreshment, some bread and meat</p>

               <p>—when the landlady came in I took my parse from my left waistcoat pocket and paid her—she gave me some change, and I then put my purse in my left waistcoat pocket—the prisoner, who was standing near the fire, immediately sidled up to me—I think I paid about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I had in change 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I put the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece in my purse, and put my purse into my pocket—the prisoner was in the room when I took my purse out—it was a crimson velvet purse, with a brass clasp, which had worn very bright—after I had paid the landlady I had a sovereign in my purse and some silver, I am not exactly clear how much—after I had paid, and placed the purse in my pocket, the prisoner, who had been leaning against the mantelpiece, came close up to me, and sat down on my left bane, close to me—that was the side on which the purse was—there was a little con venation between us, I do not recollect the substance of it; and he very shortly after that left the room—I do not recollect any particular remark that he made before he left—Murphy shortly followed him—I then put my hand into my left waistcoat pocket, and found my purse was gone—that could not have been above a couple of minutes after Cotter was gone—it was a very short time—I exclaimed, "I have been robbed!"—I got up, went out of the house, and got a policeman—I went down the street, and fell in with Murphy; I gave him in charge, and immediately after I met the prisoner and gave him in charge, as the person who picked my pocket—between the time of my putting my purse in my pocket and missing it, no one had been near me but the prisoner, with the exception of Murphy, who was on my right band—I had been walking about all day, and had had a glass or two of ale—I was a little excited; I had walked about a great deal</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What corner was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The corner of the Broad way, leading to Deptford-bridge—I had some conversation with Hill—I cannot at all pledge my memory as to how many times I have talked with her on this subject—when I first saw the prisoners they were running—I joined in the pursuit—Murphy was stopped by one constable—I ran after them and saw him stopped—the time I was running was not the time I saw the purse in the prisoner's hand—it was after we had got the prisoner, and were taking him to the station—it might be two or three minutes after he had been stopped, that I went back to the Star and Garter—that may be fifty or sixty yards from the corner turning round to Deptford-bridge—I found the prosecutor in the tap room—there was no one with him—I had seen him half an hour before—the prisoner was searched—there was nothing found on him.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HODGES. I felt something at my pocket, and I clapped my hand down, and said, bless me, why you have robbed me; and immediately she ran from me about a hundred yards before I overlook her, and then I gave her in charge to the watchman; she denied having the money, but the watchman got it back.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KAY. I am the watchman. I told the prisoner it was best to give the money up; and she said she had not got it, though she owned she knew where it was; she took me back to find it, and after taking me about a quarter of a mile, she stooped down and picked up something, and put it into my hand; it was the leather purse which the prosecutor claimed with the money in it.</p>

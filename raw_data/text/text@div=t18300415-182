               <p>William Piper, being asked by me if he had any thing to say, cautioning him, that what he said would be put down in writing, and used in evidence; neither promise nor threat was made or held out to him, but he voluntarily saith, "I went with Wallis last night to Islington, and we returned together about twelve o'clock at night; we went to my father-in-law's, in Benson's-yard, Tottenham - we staid there about ten minutes; we parted at my father-in-law's - I went directly home to my lodgings, and went to bed about one o'clock; I know nothing about the articles now produced."

            , the son, being asked by me if he had any thing to say, cautioning him, that what he said would be put down in writing, and used in evidence (neither threat nor promise was made or held out to him), but he voluntarily says -"Yesterday evening, after work, I went to Islington with William Piper; we returned to Tottenham about half-past twelve o'clock at night - we went together to Piper's mother-in-law's house, in Benson's-yard; Piper went home to his lodgings, and I went home to my father - about a quarter to one o'clock I had occasion to go into the yard; I found all the articles now produced, tied up in two sacks behind the privy - I took them into the house, and put them in the room below stairs; I opened the sacks, and I saw in one of them a dead pig, "which I took out and laid it on the table - I then went to bed; in the morning, when I got up, I told my father what I had found behind the privy."

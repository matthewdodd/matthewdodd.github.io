               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Trueman. I had a pint of beer; there was a young woman bid me come in, and she would put me in the way to Cow Cross; and while she was talking to me at the door this man came up; he was in the house, and laid hold of me by my arms. (I had stept into the house about a yard) the woman put her hands into my pocket; I had a five and threepence, a shilling, and one farthing; I gave a struggle and said she has got my money; he took me by the shoulder, and said none of your soldiers tricks; thrust me out of the house and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man?</p>
               <p>Trueman. Yes; I found him on the Tuesday after, and took him to the justice; I found him in the same house. Two of my shop mates went with me to the house, and we took him to the justice; he said, it was not him, it was a woman he called

               <p>I know nothing about it; he came to the house, and said how do you do; he said don't you know I was here on Saturday night; I said no; he said don't you know I was robbed here; I said no; I waited half an hour for an officer, but none came; the woman he speaks of knew she was guilty, and therefore she fled: had I known I was guilty, I would have fled, but I staid, I don't know the woman that robbed him, but by the description he gave, it is

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Mears. On Monday morning, when the prisoner came to work, I was in the yard, and heard the box opened - I went up-stairs, and missed some brass; and as the prisoner was going to breakfast, mistress told him, to leave what he had got behind him; he said he had nothing, but bread and butter - he went into the room, and after some time, pulled this metal from his hind coat-pocket - he was taken in charge, and owned that he had taken it.</p>
               <p>MRS. MEARS. Clitherow's statement is correct - the prisoner said, if I would go with him, he would take to me where I should find what was gone; he took me to Bevill, where we found 21/2lbs., and to Bassett, where there was 53/4lbs.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Moss, a dealer in marine-stores, No. 7, Kingsgate-street, Holborn; I bought 11/2lbs. of brass of a person at 4d. a pound, but cannot say it was the prisoner - there was iron among it, or it would be worth 6d. - some of it was pure brass - I have no knowledge whether I bought it of a man or woman - it was some time the week before Mrs. Mears came - I have been in the shop a year and three-quarters - I cannot say whether I made any inquiry about it - I have no belief as to who I bought it of, whether it was man, woman, or child.</p>

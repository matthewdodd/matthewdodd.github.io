            . I was standing on that day to see the Welch procession; I did not see the prisoner do any thing to the prosecutor, but I saw Mr. Batson take hold of the prisoner with the watch in his hand; the chain hung down; I saw him drop the watch out of his hand; upon that we secured him, and went to the Globe-tavern; he acknowledged he had taken it from the prosecutor.</p>

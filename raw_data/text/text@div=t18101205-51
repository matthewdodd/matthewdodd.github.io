On Saturday evening, the 24th of November, about seven o'clock, I went out of one shop into the other to snuff the candles, I snuffed the candles on the compter, I went to the glass case in the window and snuffed three more, I perceived some cotton waving up that the silver knives lay on; I perceived some knives were gone out of the tray. I came into the back shop, I put on my coat and hat and took a large stick and went out of my shop on the Snow-hill side and round the corner into Skinner-street, I saw the prisoner with another at my shop window in Skinner-street, I came up between them both, I saw the prisoner's right hand in the pane of glass what he had broken, with a knife in his hand, he drew the knife out, it was such a knife as this; I catched hold of him by the collar and the other person too, I saw the other person receive the knife of the prisoner, I said, you have robbed me long enough, and when I collared him he struck me on my side and kicked me two or three times and plunged and said d - n you, sir, I am not the man, what do you want of me; in so doing he got out of my hand and ran across Fleet-market. I brought the prisoner in and searched him, I found none of my property, I found a clasp knife about him like others I have seen before to cut windows. I lost five knives, this is one I brought to shew you what sort of knives I lost; I am sure I saw him take one and the other received it; before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050030"></xptr>I took him to the compter; he said he would have a pint of beer, Stanton asked him how he came to rob me, d - n him, said he, he would rob me as soon as any other man.</p>

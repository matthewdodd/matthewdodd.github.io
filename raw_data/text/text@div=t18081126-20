            . Q. What are you - A. A tailor. On the 26th of last September, near one o'clock, passing by the corner of Arundel street, I saw a person in a blue coat give the pocket book to the prisoner, and the prisoner put it into his right hand coat pocket and ran away; the moment it was delivered to him the other walked away.</p>
               <p>Q. When the person in the blue coat gave the pocket book to the prisoner, were they both standing still together, or did the one walk on to the other - A. They were standing still together; I pursued after the prisoner, he quickened his pace to make off, he ran very fast, he ran down Arundel street and then towards Essex street into Devereaux court; I came up to him; there I called out stop thief and two gentlemen stopped him; he said he had got the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him about the pocket book - A. I said he had got a pocket book belonging to somebody; he said he had got a pocket book; the constable searched him at the public office, Bow street, I saw the pocket book taken from him; the prisoner then said he picked the pocked book up; I told him that I saw a person in a blue coat give it him; he said I did not, he picked it up.</p>

I heard the cry of stop thief; I live just by, I crossed over Little Essex street; I saw Cressey and others having hold of the prisoner; the prisoner was just stopped and was panting for breath. When I came up I asked what was the matter, they told me that at the corner of Arundel street in the Strand, at the print shop, a man in a blue coat had picked a gentleman's pocket, and had given it to him; I took him to Bow street, there I searched him; I found this pocket book on him, containing a letter from his royal highness the duke of York, and some cards of lieutenant

I was walking from the Golden Cross in Charing Cross; I had been to see after a situation; there were some waiters there that I knew at that time; I walked from there and was going to the Temple, I happened to see the packet book fall from somebody, I picked it up and stood and looked round me, and could not see any person that I knew who it belonged to: I looked at the picture shop with the pocket book in my hand; I walked down Arundel street and looked at the clock. I was to meet my father at one o'clock, I ran, seeing it was near one o'clock; I heard somebody cry out stop thief, I asked what was the matter, they said it was something about a pocket book; I took the pocket book out of my pocket at Bow street.</p>

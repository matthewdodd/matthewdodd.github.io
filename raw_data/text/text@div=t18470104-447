                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 164.) I know the prisoners Donovan Ma<lb></lb>honey, and Brady—I saw them together about four o'clock, or a few minutes after four, on the afternoon of the 23rd of Dec.—they were standing by Bull-court,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184701040092"></xptr>
               <p>leading to Mill-lane—I desired them to move—they went in the direc<lb></lb>tion of Mill-lane—I apprehended Mahoney on the Thursday, the day after<lb></lb>wards—he had a blue jacket on, and he had the same on on the Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock—I told him what I spoke to him for—he said he knew nothing about the better, but that when I spoke to him on the Wednesday, he left the neighbourhood, and went over the water to Rosemary-lane, hearing that his father was dead—none of the witnesses had described his dress to me—I had not seen them—I saw Menhinick at the police-office on the 24th—he described him to me as in a blue jacket, not in a white jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mahoney.</hi> Menhinick said I had a white jacket, and Sims said I had a white jacket on when he moved me away from Bull-court—he told the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate that I had disguised my dress, that the day before I had a white jacket on, <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I told the Magistrate he disguised himself by but<lb></lb>toning his jacket up close to his chin, and his collar partly disguised him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mahoney.</hi> He told the Magistrate I had a white jacket on, and he ordered me away from the court; and the next day when he caught me by the wrist, he said, "Ah, you have got another jacket on!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Donovan. Q.</hi> Did you not come by Bull-court with a sailor with a bundle in your hand, at three o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Donovan.</hi> You went from there to Morgan's-lane, to the George—you stopped there an hour, and you came out, and said to me, "Go on"—you made a kick at me, and with the force of it you fell back into the pawn<lb></lb>broker' shop—you were quite slupified; you had been drinking rum and water, and a small bit of sugar in it—you came back without the sailor or the bundle. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I was not in the public-house the whole day.</p>

               <p>February the 2d, about half past twelve in the day, I called at Mrs. Branch's; Mrs. Branch shewed me three bundles of hairs which were offered to her for sale, and that a woman had brought in the morning; I asked her why she did not detain her, as she asked 1 s. 6 d. for goods worth 3 s. 9 d. the boy servant of Mrs. Branch watched the woman out, and saw her join another woman; Jackson worked for me a year and half; I was led to suspect the prisoner from the hairs being tied with lay-cord, which is used in tying up mops; I applied at Bow-street, but could not obtain a warrant, as I had not missed any thing; my foreman went to the house the woman was watched to;

(Produces several small bundles of hogs bristles.) When I took them in my hand, I knew them to be Morley's, by their being damaged; and being so damaged, they cannot be manufactured by themselves; on feeling them, they have a clammy, greasy feel; I swear they are Morley's.</p>
               <p>Jury. Point the mark out that you can swear to these bristles by. - They are nearly effaced, from frequent handling. (Produces a parcel of brush boards.) These brush boards are Morley's; the trade have not had any timber of this sort for many months; it is called whole-ends; Primmer, who is in Court, can further identify them. (Produces some broom-stocks.) These were made by Carr, of Tunbridge; these are not manufactured by Morley; therefore have not his mark: I do not swear to the wire-board.</p>
               <p>Morley. When Jackson was going to be conveyed from his lodgings, Langdale and Jackson being on the stairs, he begged he might return, and speak to me; they returned, and Jackson declared the property to be mine; he was not stimulated by any promise of favour, or by any threat; he said he would give it up to me, if I would not expose him to the trade.</p>

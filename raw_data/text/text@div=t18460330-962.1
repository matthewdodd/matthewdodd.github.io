                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my sister Frances, and live at No. 7, Smith's-place, Kennington—we carry on the business of linen-drapers—we have the house on lease—we sleep there—it is in the parish of Lambeth. On Sunday the 8th of March I went to bed about eleven o'clock—my sister slept in the same room with me—we were the last persons up—the servant went to bed just before us—I left the house safe, the windows and all the doors fast—I was awoke between one and two by a screaming, and soon after I heard a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drive down—some one spoke to somebody, and they replied, and directly after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> had passed on I heard a window thrown up, and directly polled down again—I was not aware at that moment whether it was in our house or not—I listened for some time, and heard a noise in the drawing-room, directly under my bed-room—I then got out, and walked round to the bed-room door, and listened—I again heard a noise as if somebody was picking a lock, and I was quite sure it was the drawing-room door—I aroused my sister, threw open the window, and called, "Police"—there were no policemen on the beat—I called to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>men, who said there were no police, and the cabmen came down immediately from their rank, and they went off for the constable, who came, and got in at the drawing-room window—I saw him do so—I was looking out of window—it was shut down before the policeman got through—he pushed it up, and it opened directly—I had tried the drawing-room door when I went up to bed at night, and I found it right; and when I came down I found it locked, with the key outside—I unlocked it, and turned the key two or three times before I could do so—when I unlocked the door and went in, I found the prisoner in custody in the drawing-room, with the two police<lb></lb>men—my next door neighbour is a butcher, and has a sort of shop or pent-house over the shop—that would enable anybody to get in at my draw<lb></lb>ing-room window—the scream appeared on the common, and the policemen were called off for that—so the cabmen told me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 41.) On this Monday morning, in con<lb></lb>sequence of what some <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi> told me, I went to the last witness's house—I got on the butcher's shop which is next door, and by that means got access to the drawing-room window, which I opened and entered—I found the window down and the blind down likewise—I got into the drawing-room and there I found the prisoner, standing on the sideboard by the chimney—he stood concealed, so that we could not see him the first time of looking as there is a nook—the chimney projects—I asked him what he was doing there, and he said he had come for a night's lodging—I looked at the lock of the door—it was partly forced off—Mrs. Turner afterwards unlocked it from the outside and came in—when I got the prisoner to the station I found on him a few silent lucifer matches.</p>

I got up to the house as the pri<lb></lb>soner was being brought out in custody—I went into the drawing-room and searched, and found in the chimney this dark lantern and this screwdriver, some paste, and some brown paper—when the paste is spread on brown paper and put on the window, you may crack the glass and it will fall with<lb></lb>out making any noise—I took those things to the station—the lantern had the appearance of having been lighted—it was black at the snuff—I produced the things at the station, and the inspector asked me, "Where did you get these from?"—the prisoner said, "I found them"—he seemed to think the inspector spoke to him.</p>

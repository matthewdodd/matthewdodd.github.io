            Who were the founder that cast them? - Mr. James Burrows in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at this time in your service or not? - He was as a labourer slator. When I went to look into this tool house, I found about ten pounds more or less in this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all the two inches and a half sort or were they mixed? - Mixed, with large ones at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. With how many forts were they mixed? - Three, it was a bag that was kept on purpose for long nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an unexpected thing by you to find three forts in this bag? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that excite any suspicion? - I cannot say it did at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other fort of nails kept? - In tubs. The bag was put on the top of the tub; I had the other witness with me that saw them, I then gave him a note to go to Mr. Burrows for half an hundred more of two inch and a half, and two inch, and inch and a half; I went home then, all the men had come out of the yard except the prisoner, the remainder part of the men went home with me, the prisoner stayed behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there or did you only suppose that he stayed behind? - I only supposed that he stayed behind, I saw all the others leave work, he was on the premises at that time, I left him on the roof when I came down from the roof, before I left the premises, if he had gone out of that yard he must have come through a door that I must have seen him; I received some information that evening, I got up at five o'clock the next morning, and was in the Church-yard just as the clock struck six, that was before the workmen came to work, then I went into the tool house as soon as the doors was opened, and I searched the tool house and found the bag missing with its contents, I waited there till half past seven when I saw the prisoner coming with a bag in his hand in the old Church-yard, I went to him, as soon as he saw me, he had the bag in his right hand, he put it between his great coat and his little coat, this was as soon as he saw me, before I could get up to him; I then asked him what he had got there? He said nothing; I then took the bag from behind him and I asked him what he had done with the nails that were in it last night? he said he had not taken any thing with it but a bit of mortar.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got possession of the bag was you able to say whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150110"></xptr>the same bag that you kept in that place? - Positive, I made it myself it was one that was cut of a large one that was wore out, and we cut the large ones up and make smaller ones of them as they wear out; I then took him to a public house to get an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - He denied it strictly, still persisted; I then left him there, I was not willing to be troubled with a tedious prosecution, that he might go away, and I went on to the church, in about half an hour afterwards he came up towards the building, he there b-st-d my eyes and limbs, and swore that he would prosecute me for taking away his character; I then took him back to the public house again and I then sent for an officer, I then when the constable came, gave him his choice either to go into the cage or to go home about his business, and send his wife at night and I would pay her, and never let me see his face any more, to do which he liked; he then said he would be damned if he would not see himself righted, then he was put into the cage till eleven o'clock, and he was taken before the bench of justices in Worship-street, he was there committed for re-examination but was taken into a public house adjoining to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the magistrate was any thing said to him advising him to confess, that it would be better for him? - There were not. He was taken in custody of the officer to the public house, when I was going away, he then said that he had got something to say to me, he had been examined before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him to frighten him into a confession of his guilt? - I asked him to turn evidence against the man where he sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to confess, or made him any promise? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp here objected to going into the evidence of the prisoner's confession but was overruled by the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said he had never sold any; he then was taken into the little room and the magistrate was there, he confessed before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said before the magistrate taken in writing or not? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the magistrate make him any promise of favour? - Not that I heard and I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if he had you should have heard it? - I am sure I should. He there confessed to taking three pounds of nails.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words? - Them were the words, and he likewise told the justice where they were at his lodgings. the officer and I and the prisoner went to the lodgings, but I did not go up, we went by his own directions where he pointed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the lodgings? - I really cannot tell; I went within five or six yards of the door; the officer went up and the prisoner went up with the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing brought out of that. house? - Three pounds two ounces of nails and other things, the officer brought them out and the prisoner with him, the officer has got the nails, the officer then requested of me to go up into the room likewise, I went up and he searched the room, and he charged me to aid and assist him to take him back to the office, when he was committed for reexamination on Monday, when he was finally committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted you employed a great many workmen in this slating of Hackney Church? - Yes, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150111"></xptr>Q. How many at this time? - I believe there might be eight persons at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you furnished the pattern of the nail that you have described? - I filed the nail up and I took it to Mr. Burrows that he might cast me a certain quantity according to that sample.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a nail maker? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in them? - I deal in them when I buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in them as a manufacturer of nails? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You then employ of course a person dealing in that trade for the purchase of them? - Yes, I buy them of the founder.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a slater? - Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have roofed many churches before this time? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have used the same sort of nails? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this was a new scheme of your own to try these sort of nails? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Not being a manufacturer of nails you will not say that other manufacturers of nails might not have the same sort of nails? - When the founder is here he will prove that he cast them; I did not tell you that I made them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so angry? Will you take on yourself to say that other manufacturers of nails might not have some of the same quality that you charge to have lost? - I verily believe that they have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if nail manufacturers are here, and will produce nails of the same quality, and exactly similar to your own, you will be surprized? - No, I shall not.</p>
               <p>Q. I like that answer extremly well, with respect to the bag, how long might you have had that bag belonging to you? - About six months or more.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is made out of a large bag? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What purpose is this bag for? - To take nails in smaller quantities for smaller jobs.</p>
               <p>

            I take it for granted that your workmen take this bag out to do their jobs? - Yes, they do, but not of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed the bag and made it yourself out of an old bag, you have many other bags in your warehouse? - I had none of that size exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this bag with the nails, you saw in a corner of the shed, the night before? - I said, it was on a sirkin in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked in there and saw ten pounds of nails? - I did not look in, Burn took it out of the tub and gave it to me, I saw the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, seeing this, it created no suspicion in your mind? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated just now to the court that it was unusual to put these sort of nails in the bag, did it not surprise you to see a quantity of these nails in a bag on a sirkin? - No, it did not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag was in the use of taking a quantity of nails out of the tub and carrying upon the roof? - It was employed for taking large nails only.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to this bag, has it never happened to you to lend this bag to workmen for any purpose whatever? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar never borrowed this bag for any purpose? - Never, he has a bag of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never borrowed the bag in the question? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that the prisoner before the magistrate stated what you have said, by way of confession, that he had taken three pounds weight of nails, was your examination reduced to writing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150112"></xptr>before the magistrate? - For what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sign something? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know very well it was taken down, why did you trifle with the jurors time in this way, as your examination was taken down in writing, and the other witnesses, was not the examination of the prisoner, that you have been talking to my learned friend, taken down in writing? - I cannot tell whether it was or not, I will not swear either way, I don't know that it was, I did not see it wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by daring to say that it was not taken in writing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean that you believed it was not taken down in writing? - I signed a paper myself, but whether there was any thing else more than what I signed, I know not, it might be taken down, for any thing I know, and it might not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by telling my lord that you believed that it was not taken in writing, on that presumption my lord took the confession as part of the evidence against the prisoner; both times when you was before the magistrate, was there any examination of the prisoner taken down in writing? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was not? - I did not see any of his consession.</p>
               <p>Q. The confession of the prisoner, will you swear that it was not taken down in writing? - I do believe it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear positively? - I will, if the confession is what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you mean to swear positively that there was not any confession taken down of the prisoner? - I did not see any writing, and from that I should naturally suppose that there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there were other persons suspected of this as well as the prisoner? - Not to my knowledge, never, not in stealing of the nails, but I have of lead.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you where to go to his lodgings? - He keeps two different lodgings, he went with me by the desire of the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. He complied with that desire, and shewed you his lodgings, where these nails were found; the very next day he brought the bag back to Hackney Church; you know; you took it from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three sorts of nails described to be in this bag, do you mean to swear to the others as well as to the two inch and half nails? - I should not have sworn to them, if it had not been for his uncle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This person first of all went through a regular examination before the magistrate? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any writing going forward at all? - No, only the clerk wrote a paper, which I signed after they were all gone away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any writing going forward at that moment that he gave his confession? - There was not.</p>

            Perhaps you are not much acquainted with nails? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Bates. These are the nails I had particularly for my work at Hackney Church, I swear to them from the size of the nails, I do not swear to the others.</p>

               <p>Q. How many sorts are there? - Three sorts.</p>
               <p>Bates. They are the three samples of nails that I used at Hackney, the large ones for the large slates, and the other for different size slates, I have not the least shadow of a doubt about the others.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you swear to that sort by the size or composition? - By the size.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe about the others? - I verily believe those to be my property.</p>

            Pray did you happen to know the next morning whether the bag was missing from the tool house or not? - When I went into the tool house the bag was then gone with the nails, and I took him with the bag.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw him at this time, was he coming up to his work? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you looked at the bag? - I have; it is mine, I know it by the fringe and make of it, there is no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You swear to the make and fringe. It is a square bag, like any common workman's bag? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it common in the ordinary business for these bags to be taken home by the workmen? - No, They are made to carry certain samples of nails up on the church, as we went on with the business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say particular; I leave it all to my counsel. My master said that I was the last left in the building; there were twenty men at work after I left the building, of stone masons and carpenters; we were always the first that leaved the building.</p>
               <p>Court to Bates. Was there any men left on the building after your men came down? - There were no men of mine, but there were other peoples men.</p>

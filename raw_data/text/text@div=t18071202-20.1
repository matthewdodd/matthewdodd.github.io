            . On Saturday the 31st of October, about half past eleven in the day, I was going from my accompting house, 45, Lime-street; into Leadenhall-street; I was just by the <placeName id="t18071202-20-crimeloc123">India house</placeName>

The handkerchief the constable has.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive it is the man. - A. I am positive it is the man; he pushed me about enough, I shall alway recollect him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. There were a great many persons near you as well as the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be some other hand that went into your pocket. - A. By the position that I was standing to him, and by the circumstance of the handkerchief being in his hand, no person could do it but him; I saw him drop the handkerchief; my reason for not seizing him immediately, I saw it was a gang of pickpockets; I was afraid of his being rescued.</p>

               <p>CHARLES DOBSON. I am a constable. On the 31st of August; there was a great riot at the India house, I was called to take two men in charge, I did; going along to the mansion house with them, Mr. Bourdieu told me the prisoner had picked his pocket; I took him in custody; I searched him at alderman Birch's door; these two handkerchiefs were in his pocket, and this Mr. Bourdieu gave me.</p>

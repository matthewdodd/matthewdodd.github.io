               <p>J. Morgan. Because she confessed it to me, and told me all the places where she had sold them at.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she confess this?</p>
               <p>J. Morgan. On Monday last before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did she say she sold them?</p>
               <p>J. Morgan. She said she sold one to a person named Mary M'Can, and the others in Field-Lane.</p>
               <p>Mary M'Can. The prisoner came to me on Saturday last, and asked me to buy a tub that she had fetch'd out of pawn; saying, she wanted twopence to pay for her lodging. She asked me a shilling for it. She had it with her, and I bought it for nine-pence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That evidence has known me seven years. She can give me a character.</p>
               <p>M. M'Can. I have known her about eight years ago, she was then in a very good place; I have known but little of her since. I know she has been in distress.</p>

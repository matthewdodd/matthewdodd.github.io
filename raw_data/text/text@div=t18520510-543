                  </hi>. I am a German physician, and live at 4, Ovington-terrace, Brompton. The female prisoner was in my service; she entered it on 11th Feb—I met with her, in consequence of an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, at the Yorkshire Grey Coffee-house, in Lower Thames-street—I asked her if she had put the advertisement in the paper—she said yes—I thought she was a superior woman, and said a place of all work was not fit for her, she was more fit for a lady's maid—she said she had been accustomed to work from her infancy, and did not mind it—I said I lived alone with my wife, and she could try the place if she liked—I took her into my service on Wednesday, 11th—the next day, between 4 and 5 o'clock, she asked to go out to make some little purchases, and she was gone about an hour, but in the mean time I found she had left the street door open—on her return, she asked me if I or my wife had been in the kitchen—I said no, but reprimanded her for having left the door open, and cautioned her I had been robbed twice before, and that it was not like Germany—she was then in a great <hi rend="italic">flurry</hi>, and said she had lost a valuable brooch which had been given her by her brother-in-law—she said a beggar had come to the window, and she opened it to drive him away, and must have left it open and the brooch lying there—she then reminded me that there had been three coats hanging in the passage—I only found two, and then we missed a teapot and some forks—the next day my wife missed a sovereign from her purse, and a great part of the bills on the file were taken away and burnt—on the 16th, five days after the female entered our service, I saw the man standing at the end of the terrace where I reside, and my wife pointed him out to me as a friend of the woman's, who had called several times at my house in my ab<lb></lb>sence—he had a parcel under his arm—I then went home, and saw him come to the house and have some conversation with the female, who then asked me for some paper to write a letter to her mother, just to say she was com<lb></lb>fortable and happy, as her brother-in-law was waiting outside and was going that very day to Germany; that was between 11 and 12—between 12 and 1 I sent her out to fetch some flour, and she never returned—she went out rather heavily dressed to go just round the corner—my suspicions were roused, I went up stairs, and missed my wife's jewel case and its contents, some of my wife's dresses and shawls, and some spoons—there were a great many rings in the jewel box, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I gave information to the police—the female told me she had been living six years with a counsellor on the Continent, and gave me this written character with a seal to it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is very satisfactory—the house is my dwelling house, and in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington.</p>

In consequence of information, on 17th Feb., at 1 o'clock, I went with superintendent Otway to the Hotel de l' Europe, and went to No. 6 room, where I found the two prisoners—the female was in the act of counting some money into the male's hands—I told them we were officers, and had come to take them into custody—I took the male prisoner, and to way the female—I commenced searching the male pri<lb></lb>soner—he caught something from his waistcoat pocket, held down his hand,</p>

               <p>and I then discovered he had a razor in his hand, and before I could wrench it from him he cut his left wrist twice—the razor fell on the floor, the female caught it up, and cut her left wrist once—we mastered them, sent for assistance, Dr. Linton came, and he advised me to take them to the Hospital; they were badly cut—they were taken to Charing-cross Hospital—I found on the male prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and two keys, one of which unlocked a portmanteau which was in the room, and in the portmanteau I found this jewel case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been broken open—there were some jeweller's tools in the box; the male prisoner is a jeweller—I found two seals in his pocket, one of which makes an impression like that on the written character which has been produced—the portmanteau and boxes were packed apparently ready for starting—the female has been in the Hospital ever since—I subsequently searched the portmanteau again, and found in it two cloaks, a sheet, and an ivory brooch, and in the box, which was locked, and which I opened by the other key I found on the male pri<lb></lb>soner, I found a lady's dress, a shawl, and two pieces of ribbon.</p>

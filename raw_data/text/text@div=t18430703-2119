                  </hi>. I am single, and am a hosier and glover living in Re<lb></lb>gent-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On Saturday night, the 24th of June, I went to bed about a quarter to one, leaving my shop-door and window fastened and bolted—I saw my assistant do it—at five o'clock in the morning I was alarmed by the police, got up, went down into the shop, and found that and the parlour in confusion—my goods were all thrown about the shop, not as they were the night before—two panes in the fan-light, over the door, were broken, so that a person could put their hand in and undo the bolts—both the bolts of the door were undone—I missed two silver table spoons, four dessert spoons, two tea spoons, a mustard-spoon, a pair of sugar<lb></lb>tongs, and a gold watch, which had been locked up in a closet in the parlour—I missed a variety of small things out of a work-box, fifteen silk handker<lb></lb>chiefs, two scarfs, and six Chesterfield tweed coats from the shop—these coats, now produced, have my assistant's writing on them—I cannot swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutrix. I saw the shop safely fastened on Saturday night—the fan-light was secure at twelve o'clock when I left it—next morning I went to the shop about nine o'clock, and found two panes of glass broken in the fan-light, and missed the articles stated—I know these coats to be Miss Batterson's property—they are quite new and were safe in the shop when I left it—this piece of shawl is also hers.</p>

I said, "I do not know;" he said, "Where are you going to take them to?"I said, "That gentleman there told me to take them to No. 18, if you ask him he will tell you;" we went to find No. 18, but could not, and he took me to the station.</p>

            . I live at Redstile, about seven miles from Tucker. On Monday, the 13th, at half past five o'clock in the morning, I was near my own house, and met the prisoner with ten or twelve pigs, some large and some small; one was very small, and had a white spot on the left side, near the hind part; I have known the prisoner nine years, and am certain of his person; the fattest would weigh four or five stone, I think the small one about two stone; he was going towards Colneyhatch, and another man walking by his side, but the prisoner drove them with a stick or whip; I should not have noticed them if the prisoner had not spoken to me; he said, "Hold on one side, master, and let my pigs come by;" I was not in the road; I said I will; he said, "Oh, is that you, Ned?" he always goes by the name of Tom Ponto; I never heard him called Wood; I asked him if he was going to take them to Smithfield; he said "Aye" I asked if pigs were dear or cheap; he said dear.</p>

Mr. Tucker told me of his loss; I traced the pigs to Colney-hatch; they had been fed upon frosty potatoes, which scowered them, and that is how I traced them; I traced them about a mile from the yard down a bye lane, beyond where Drake met the prisoner, and there I lost the traces.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Thursday night last, a butcher gave the prisoner into my charge; he asked me if it was about Walker's horse; (see page 216) I said No, about the pigs; he said "D-n the pigs."</p>
               <p>GEORGE TUCKER. I had fed the pigs on potatoes, beans, and peas - one small one had a white spot, and was about two stone weight.</p>

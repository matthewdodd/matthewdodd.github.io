             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker; on Wednesday evening, the 3d of October, the prisoner offered me a metal watch, and a mourning ring to pledge; he asked two guineas; I enquired if it was his own property; he said it was, but not giving satisfactory answers, I doubted him; I enquired where he lived; he said at No. 18 or 19, Tottenham-court-road; I asked him if the landlord or landlady of the house knew he was possessed of this property; he said they did; I told him I would go home with him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240035"></xptr>seemingly had no objection; still being doubtful of him, I called upon Meecham, the officer, and took him with me to Tottenham-court-road, he was going a wrong way; he said then, he did not live in Tottenham-court-road, but some where up in Oxford-street; the name of the place he could not tell; it was near the Balloon; I desired Meecham to take him into custody; I have the watch, and the ring; he was examined the day after; the property was advertised, and Mr. Smith identified it.</p>
               <p>(The watch and ring deposed to by Mr. Smith.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There is my name in the watch, and my sister's name in the ring; the prisoner lives as labourer, next door to my house, which communicates to the upper part; we continually keep our trap door open, and he continually works at the upper part of the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going from my work about six at night, and in Holborn, there a came a strange man to me, and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, how are you countryman; I said pretty well; he gave me share of two pots of beer, and three glasses of gin, and he asked me to buy a watch; I do not know the man; he said he would let me have it for three pounds ten shillings; there was his wife with him, or a sister, she had the ring on her finger, and he said he would give me the ring into the bargain; I gave him the money, and took share of two pots of beer; he said he lived at No. 16, in Holborn; I enquired there, and there was no such person lived there; I was but three days out of the country.</p>

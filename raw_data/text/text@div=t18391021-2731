                  </hi>. I am porter at Slee and Pike's wine-vaults, in High-street, Borough. On Saturday night, the 14th of September, I was at that house, between nine and ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner Chapman there—I know a boy named Critchfield, by seeing him here—I saw him standing outside, on the step of the door that night—Chapman came to me, and got two sixpences for a shilling, and I heard him tell the boy to stand there—I did not hear him say any thing more to the boy—Chap<lb></lb>man had a Macintosh cape on—he was at our house twice that night—he did not stay more than five minutes altogether—he came in and went out again, and when he came back again I gave him the change.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Vine-court. On Saturday night, the 14th of September, I was in High-street, Borough, standing leaning against the door of Slee and Pike's wine-vaults—the prisoner Chapman spoke to me—he had a Macintosh cape on—he asked me if I was going over the bridge—I told him yes—he asked if I knew King William-street—I said yes—he asked me which side of the way it was on—I told him the left-hand side—he told me if I would take a par<lb></lb>cel for him he would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a parcel—I agreed to take it, and he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went inside the wine-vaults, and told me to stop outside, as he was going to get change—I was going in with him—he told me to stop out, which I did, and he brought me out a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a gas-light at the next house, and one on each side, which lighted the place where we were—he told me to take the parcel and ask if there was any answer, and to come back to Slee and Pike's and tell him, and asked how long I should be gone—I said I should not be long—I went</p>

               <p>to King William-street, and could not find the place—I returned to Slice and Pike's, but Chapman was not there—I went directed there and back—I went again to King William-street, and found the prosecutor's shop, and left the parcel there—I am sure Chapman is the person who sent me.</p>

J. Lovell and Son, lock manufacturers, Chard-street, Birmingham," on them—I saw Lovell the same evening, and showed him the cards in the pocket-book—he said they were his, and asked a pencil-case.</p>

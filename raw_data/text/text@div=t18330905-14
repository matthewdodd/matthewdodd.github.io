I know the prisoner by sight - I saw him with a lot more in Mr. Carpenter's house; I cannot tell on what day, it was about a quarter to eleven o'clock - he went out of the tap-room and came back again in about three or four minutes; he had nothing with him - I did not see anything in his hands; I did not take any notice of him - he stood in the taproom, and then we all went out together about eleven o'clock, as it was time to shut up, and he ran across the road out of the tap-room with two rabbits, one under his arm, and one in his hand; he ran across the road with them - he ran into the back yard from the tap-room - I did not see him come out of the back yard, but he got out into the street in two or three minutes, and ran across the road - I knew the rabbits to be Carpenter's; I had seen them before - they were kept in the back kitchen - he had nothing in his hand when he went out of the tap-room.</p>

I live in Stingo-lane, half a mile from the Bricklayer's Arms - I know the prisoner by sight; he came to my house on the 15th of August; he brought two rabbits - I was not at home, he came again in an hour's time, when I was at home, and asked me to buy them, he said, he had won them the previous night, at a raffle, and asked me 4s. for them; I said, I was rather overstocked and did not want them; after standing a little while, he said "I have no where to put them, what will you give me for them," I said 3s., and after a short time he took the 3s. and went away - I heard in the afternoon that Mr. Carpenter had lost some; I fetched him to my place; he saw them and claimed them, that was the same evening - I have them here.</p>

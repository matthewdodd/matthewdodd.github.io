               <p>I lost three shirts, &amp;c. last month; on the 23d of September, they were up in the one pair of stairs room; I was sorting my dirty linen, and I went down stairs, and when I went up again I saw the prisoner with the things in her apron on my own stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a lodger in the house? - I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - She went out of my own passage, and I followed her out into the court, and I saw the top of my own stays, O dear, says I, you have robbed me; I immediately laid hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you lost sight of her? - Yes, I did, but I followed her and I saw the stays; she knocked me down, she gave me three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure her at that time? - I could not, she knocked me down in my own place, and made her escape.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she secured? - The same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the things? - She threw them down in my own parlour; I followed her into the court, and pulled her back when I saw they were my own things into the house again; I have got the things, they are in court.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was taken up on another affair, and this constable made the woman say that I was the woman, because I had a dark bed gown on, and some woman came to me and said, if I would give her two guineas to give the constable, she would forgive me.</p>

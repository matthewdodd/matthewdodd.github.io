               <p>Q. In what place are the letters sorted that are put into your house - A. It is not the customary thing, or at least they ought not, to be sorted in the shop; they are to be sorted at the office in the back part of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing to do in carrying them to the back part of the house, or to sort them - A. He used to make it his business to carry them into the back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140040"></xptr>office for the postman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that on the 2nd of August - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of August did you give him any money for any purpose - A. I did; about six o'clock in the morning I gave him a two pound note, and two one pound notes, making four pound together for the purpose of paying three pound five shillings and one penny at the Times office for newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out for that purpose - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned did he deliver you the change - A. He was to go and buy the newspapers, deliver them, and then deliver me the change; he brought me back fourteen shillings and eleven pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long has this lad been with you - A. A year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come with a good character - A. He did, and I never had a ground of complaint against him; I once gave him a pound too much, he brought it me back again.</p>
               <p>- PHILLIP. I am the publisher of the Times newspaper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Perfectly well, by his being in the habit of coming for Mr. Blackburn's papers in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his coming on the 4th of August - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at your book, and let me know what the amount of Mr. Blackburn's newspapers came to on the 4th of August - A. Three pounds five shillings and one penny. That note is the note I took on the 4th of August for them papers; I have marked it 4th of August, 8 for 1808. Bkburn abbreviated for Blackburn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you delivered the newspapers and change to the person that brought you that note - A. I am not sure that I delivered the change and the papers to the prisoner, but to the person that brought me the note most assuredly I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether that was the prisoner or not you will not undertake to swear - A. I will not undertake to swear positively.</p>

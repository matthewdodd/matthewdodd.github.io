At this time she waited for me a great while at the barracks till I came. We had rum and water and beer to the amount of four shillings and six pence. When we went to pay, she said, here is the money I have just received from my master; I will make you a present of it to buy a ring, and you shall make me a present of it to keep till we are married; and she took the buttons and ring and gave them me to keep for her sake.</p>

            . I am a soldier in the regiment. The prosecutrix waited in the barracks for the prisoner. I saw them together in the publick-house. The prosecutrix told me the prisoner had taken fourteen shillings and six-pence from her. The prisoner paid the reckoning, and then said, Now my dear, if you will smile, I will give you six-pence a smile. She smiled four times, and he gave her two shillings.</p>

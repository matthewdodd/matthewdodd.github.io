                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, in Long's-buildings, in the parish of St. Luke. I know the prisoner—he was at my house on the 16th of January—he came in, in company with three others, about half past ten o'clock at night, and went to the first-floor room, where persons go to smoke—there is a skittle-board in the room—I did not see him go into the room, but I saw him go up stairs, and afterwards saw him in the room—I went up, in less than ten minutes after, into the front room, and he was there—I came down again, and went up again within three minutes after—he was not there then—I missed him, and one of the party who came with him—I heard footsteps overhead in my bed-room, and went up, and when within just three steps of the bed-room door I saw the prisoner coming out of the bed-room—I stopped him on the staircase, and asked him what business he had there—he said he had been lighted up there by a gentleman who described it as a skittle-room—I told him that he was wrong, that he had not been lighted up there, and I wished him to go down with me—I then called for a light, a person who came out of the bed-room after him having knocked my light out of my hand—I cannot say who that other man was—my wile brought up a light—she passed me and the prisoner, and followed us down stairs—I went first, and the prisoner behind me—the other man escaped when he knocked the candle out of my hand, and he had a large bundle with him—I could not observe that the prisoner had any thing in his hand—I collared him when I first met him coming out of the bed-room—I had no struggle with him—he at first said he would strike me if I did not let him go, but afterwards he said he would go quietly—my wife was within hearing when I first collared him—I brought the prisoner down stairs, and gave him into the custody of a police-officer—my wife went up to the bed-room—I cannot tell how the bed-room door was when the prisoner first came to the house, as I had not been up stairs myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. The prisoner came to our house on the night in question, about half-past ten o'clock—I was in the bar parlour—I carried the prisoner up a pot of ale, and from thence I went up to my bed-room—that was at twenty minutes before eleven o'clock—I had not been in the bed-room before, since half-past nine o'clock—I left the door shut and latched then—it has no lock,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290058"></xptr>
               <p>merely a latch, which we lift up—I am quite certain it was Istched when I came down stairs—when the prisoner came he went up stairs—I did not see him come into the front door, but I saw him in the parlour when I carried him some ale—(I had not seen him enter the house)—he was then standing in the parlour with the skittle-ball—there were five or six others in the room—I then went up to the bed-room to fetch some<lb></lb>thing—I found the door as I had left it—when I came out I shut the door as before, and came down stairs—my husband was down stain at that time—he went up a few minutes after, and I heard him on the stain call<lb></lb>ing for a light—I went up with one, and saw him holding the prisoner, who said, "D your eyes, leave me go," and then he said, "I will go quietly, Sir"—my husband came down first, the prisoner next, and me be<lb></lb>hind, down the second flight of stairs—I had stood on the landing, and they passed me, and I walked behind with my light—I saw nobody else on the stairs—I saw the prisoner throw a towel, a napkin, and a pillow-case from his jacket on the stairs—they belong to us, and had been in the drawer in my bed-room—I went down stairs, and screamed out for the police—a policeman came in immediately, and the prisoner was given into custody—I went up to my bed-room and found the door wide open, and a great many articles disturbed about the room, and taken from the drawers, which were broken open—they had been locked before—two of the locker were forced off—I missed some shirts, shifts, flannel petticoats, sheets, pil<lb></lb>low-cases, and drawers, and a good many articles—I picked up the things the prisoner dropped, and I am quite sure they are my husband's.</p>

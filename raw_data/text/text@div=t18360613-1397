                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Joseph Cockerton, of the Royal Hospital public-house, Chelsea. I have lived there twelve months, during which time I have known the prisoner—I understood him to be in the service of Mr. Richard Hall, in the neighbourhood—he has been in the habit of coming with orders and for change for Mr. Hall—on the 21st of May be brought this note to me, which is directed to Mr. Cockerton, but it was delivered to me—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "Please to send by the bearer one bottle of gin, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver in paper, your obedient servant, R. Hall"—believing the prisoner to be in the service to Mr. Hall, I furnished him with it—I have three fourpenny pieces and a great quantity of sixpences—the water of the note was wet—it was addressed to Mr. Joseph Cockerton.</p>

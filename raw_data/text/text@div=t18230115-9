On the 12th of December, I saw some paper looked out, about four o'clock, and put into the cart, which left the premises - it returned about seven o'clock, and next morning I saw a ream of bag-cap at the Mansion House, which had been put into the cart the preceeding afternoon. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

All the paper was right then - I stopped inside the shop about ten minutes, and left nobody in care of the cart. I heard an alarm, ran out, and found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Brown in Rosemary-lane - the paper laid on the pavement close by the cart on the opposite side of the way. I had not noticed him near the cart.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a linen-draper, and live two doors from Mr. Davis's. I saw the prisoner come out of the cart with the paper on his back - suspecting him, I looked into Davis's shop, and saw the carman, told him, and followed the prisoner; he had not got above twenty yards from the cart. I cried Stop thief! and he threw the paper down - I never lost sight of him. I took him two or three hundred yards down Rosemary-lane, and took him back; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far behind me were you when I turned the corner - A. I might be twenty yards; but never lost sight of him all the way.</p>

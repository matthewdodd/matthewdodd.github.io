               <p>Can you upon your recollection, say, it was this woman that brought the apron? - The owner said she had lost other things, and we searched the warehouse and found another apron.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This shirt I know by being joined in the collar, it was too little, and had a piece put in, the other shirt has my initials, I do not know this apron; I cannot swear to the sheet.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was she a servant at your house? - Yes, at the time; I took her up immediately on finding the things at the pawnbroker's, I never gave her any shirts, she was only a weekly servant.</p>

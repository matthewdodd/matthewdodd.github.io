               <p>I lost my watch on the 6th of June, at one in the morning, I had been spending the evening in Poppin's Court, Fleet-street, I was a little in liquor, and unfortunately picked up that woman, I knew her before only by name, I took her to my lodging, and about four I awoke and found I had lost my watch.</p>
               <p>Where did you pick her up? - By the side of Fleet-market, when I awoke missing her, I suspected I had lost something, I found my watch was gone and a shirt from the top of the bed, I applied to some man of St. Brides, he took me to her lodging on the Friday night, and on Saturday night she was taken, they called on me, I said I believed her to be the person from her appearance and voice; she then promised that she would bring the property the next day, saying she had pledged them; we depended on her word, but she never came; we found her again and took her before Alderman Sanderson, he questioned her about the matter, and she said she had sold the watch and pawned the shirt, in consequence of which he committed her, there were no threats of any sort, she said she had pawned the shirt, she said she gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250093"></xptr>it to the person that lodged in the same house by the name of Elizabeth; I never saw the watch since, she said she had sold it to a person in Chick Lane.</p>
               <p>You was drunk I suppose at this time? - Rather so, I should be sorry for an act of that kind if I was sober.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that that is the girl? - Quite so.</p>
               <p>You was not quite sure when she was taken first? - I said I thought her to be the same, and I believed her to be the same.</p>

               <p>One of the Jury. My Lord, before the alderman he said he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. You was very drunk? - I do not know what you mean by very drunk, I did not tumble about; I had lost the faculty of my senses.</p>
               <p>Where did you come from? - I had been in Poppin's-court, but I went part of the way with a friend.</p>
               <p>Where had you been drinking? - In Poppin's-court, the sign of the Bell.</p>
               <p>Did you meet with any other woman? - Not a soul that I can take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had your watch when you came in? - Quite sure, I saw it some little time before I quitted the company, and I have a custom of putting chain and all into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did not you lose it chain and all out of your pocket in the street? - I know from nothing else but her own confession.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure you had it when you came home with the girl? - I am as sure as I am here, I let myself in and fastened the door on the inside, so she let herself out; I had seen the woman before.</p>
               <p>But she had never been at your lodgings nor you at hers? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you know her name? - I think she told me her name was

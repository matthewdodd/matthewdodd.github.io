I had seen a man exactly like the prisoner, pass with a basket, about two minutes before, and heard the rattling of pots in the basket.

I was going up George-street, Portman-square, and saw the prisoner with a frail basket with a cover to it, and saw him take two or three pint pots from the rails and doorway of different houses. I saw him at No. 30, King-street, Portman-square, in company with a boy about eleven years old; the boy took a pint pot off the door, and the prisoner put it in the basket. I went towards Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner coming along with the basket, apparently very heavy. I thought he belonged to a publican, and did not suspect him; he came to Adam's Mews, dropped the basket and ran off. There was a cry of Stop thief! - he joined in the cry, I saw him stopped; some time after, I went to Marlborough-street, and saw him in the middle room - he tried to escape.</p>

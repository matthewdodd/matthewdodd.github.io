Q.</hi> I do not understand you to say that you saw the prisoner before the Judge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in the apartment where his Lordship was, but in the hall of the chambers—I do not know Mr. Samuel Hanson Williams, of Woolwich—his name is not very well known about Woolwich—I never heard his name—he does not live at No. 5, Charlotte-place—Mun-yard lives there—I know Munyard perfectly well—he was before the Judge the second time—I do not know that he was there the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then are we to understand that Williams does not live when he describes himself to live, but that Munyard does live there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Munyard lives at the place named in this writ, and I never heard of Mr. Williams re<lb></lb>siding there at all—I did not see Munyard at the chambers at the time I was ordered to repay the money—I know his person very well—Mr. Williams was not there—Simmers, his clerk, attended for him—I never saw the pri<lb></lb>soner till I saw him there, and never afterwards till he was brought in before his Lordship to be committed on the warrant for this indictment—I happened to be at chambers that day—I saw him in conversation with Simmers in the hall when the order was made by the Judge to discharge these proceedings—Mr. Eager was there, and Mr. Wittenbury.</p>

                  </hi>. In August last I kept the White Hart, at Hawk well, in Essex—I know Mr. Wittenbury—I recollect his going to Chelmsford market with me perfectly well—it was on Friday, the 26th of August—he had slept at my house the night before (Thursday,) and also on Wednesday night—he dined with me on the Thursday at Rochester market—he breakfasted along with me on Friday morning, and after breakfast we went together in my horse and cart to Chelmsford market—we got there about eleven o'clock, and dined at an eating-house close by the Black Boy, at Chelmsford—after dinner we went into the market together, and did business—I bought eight sheep—I do not believe Mr. Wittenbury was absent from me ten minutes all day till I saw him on the coach—I am not able to say the name of the coach, but I went to the coach-office, and saw him go off by the coach that went from Chelmsford about half-past four o'clock, as near as I can guess—I do not re<lb></lb>member his being away from me all day—I do not believe he was absent from me ten minutes—he went to market with me, and continued with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does Mr. Wittenbury always sleep at your house when he comes down to that part? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He always did at the time I had the house—I have known him ever since he has been building Hockley Spa, (not longer,) when he came down to see after his men—I am not able to say how often I have seen him in the course of a month—I forget whether or not</p>

               <p>he was at my house the week before—he was there in Sept.—I was not there in Nov.—I left the house then—he did not send me word when he was coming down—he used to come down to see after his business—I never kept any particular account of his coming or going, but that day, the 26th of Aug., I noticed his going to market with me, and doing business there, which my market-book will show—he has been with roe at other markets, but never at Chelmsford market, except that one day—I did not make a memorandum in my book that he accompanied me to Chelmsford market that day—I have frequently done business at Chelmsford market—at different times—I cannot say whether or not he has been at my house, on other market days besides the 26th of Aug.—I know he was with me on the 26th—he has been with me at different times before and since then—I have here a copy from my market book of the purchase of cattle I made that day—I cannot say when I was first applied to to become a witness—I think it was about a fortnight ago—I had a subpoena, and was not able to attend—I had received notice of this trial before that—I recollect, some time in Sept, Mr. Wittenbury asking me what day of the month it was that he went to Chelmsford market with me—he never said anything at all about his being arrested—I went and looked at my market-book, and said, "On the 26th of Aug., sir"—he said, "Very well, I don't know whether I am likely to get into trouble or not abort that day," and that was all he laid to me about it—I was not applied to to make an affidavit at that time.</p>

            . On Thursday the 28th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010016"></xptr>September I was standing at my window talking to my landlord, I saw a boy come with a barrow full of pots, he was trying to wheel the barrow against the posts; I told him he need not to ryt get the barrow through without you take the pots out and hold it sideways; he took the pots out, got the barrow through, and put the pots in again, and he wheeled them down the court; I saw he had sore eyes; that is all I remarked of him. The boy came down about an hour afterwards, he was crying very much, he said he had lost the barrow with the pots; I said what sort of a boy was it that took your barrow away; he said he had sore eyes.</p>

            . I sell things in Holborn. This boy asked me to give an eye to the barrow while he went to the scowerer; he took two or three pots out, he left the barrow up Plow-court. I did not see him again till the next day; I said to him, what did you leave the barrow there for. I took him up to the constables house; he said he took the pots to the scourers in Chicklane. I am sure this is the boy that left the barrow and told me to give an eye to it.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Andrews. On the 28th of September I was informed there was a barrow left in the passage of Plow-court; I found from Mrs. Simonds that a boy had left it there between four and five; I took it to my own house. I got a description of the boy that had left it there. I found out that Mr. Walduck had lost the barrow; and during my absence Mrs. Simonds brought the boy into my house the back way, he took the advantage and run out of the front door. I took the prisoner the next day in Smithfield market, I asked him if he would tell me what he had done with the pots it would be greatly in his favour; he said they were done; he was willing to go to sea.</p>

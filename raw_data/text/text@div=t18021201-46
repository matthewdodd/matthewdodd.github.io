Yes; I am positively sure it is without the City of London; I made for the Dark-entry, and as I was going over, I saw the prisoner, with two other men, run from the passage down the street, very fast; I am positive the prisoner was one of them; I then saw the prosecutor endeavouring to make after him, without hat or stick, I knew Joseph to be very lame.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know him before? - A. I have known him these four years; knowing him to be lame, and hearing they had robbed him of his watch, I immediately pursued them to the Army Victualling-office, the space of about two hundred and fifty yards; I called out stop thief, and the prisoner, and two other men endeavoured to drown my noise, by making a noise as if there was a mad bull coming; I kept fight of the prisoner till he was stopped by Mr. Young, a painter; when I came up, he was in Mr. Young's custody.</p>

I only know, that about ten days before this, a clergyman was robbed, and upon calling stop thief, the thieves made a cry of a mad bull; I seized the prisoner immediately; he asked me, what I meant by stopping him, I told him, I should stop him till the mad bull came up, for I suspected what he was, and while I had hold of him by the collar, he dropped a silver watch between his legs, upon the ground; I said to a person standing by, sir, I will thank you to pick up this watch, and give it to me, which the person did; he that time there was a vast concourse of people.</p>
               <p>Q.Amongst them, did you see Anthony Joseph? - A.

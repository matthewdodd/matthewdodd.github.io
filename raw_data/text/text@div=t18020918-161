             sworn . - I knew Kelsey , and saw him at my master's , Mr. Holdworth , leather-seller , Aldgate, on the 10th or 11th of August ; he had a small piece of leather, and asked what sort it was; as it was not coloured, I could not tell whether it was a Russia hide, or not, but thought it was, and that it was worth eight , nine, or ten shillings , a skin; I cannot recollect who he said he bought it of, but I saw him again on Wednesday the 11th , and told him a person had enquired for such skins ; I saw him again afterwards, and told him the man did not like two of the skins ; upon which he brought two more on Thursday , (two skins produced and identified ); I gave him ten shillings a skin for them.</p>

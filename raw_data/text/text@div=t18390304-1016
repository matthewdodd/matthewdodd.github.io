                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Brooks, who is gone to America—he went in the Michaelmas week, and left me forty sovereigns and some bills that I was to get in, and to go after him—I have known the prisoner for nine or ten years, and I went to reside at her house at Southall Green, in the parish of Norwood—about the 6th of January she said to me, "I suppose you have spent five or six of those forty sovereigns"—I said I had spent three and lent one, which made four—she advised me to lock it up, as her son-in-law was out of work, and money was a temptation—I then locked the thirty-six sovereigns in my trunk, which stood in their room—on the 10th of January I went to my box, at twenty minutes before twelve o'clock at noon, to take something out, as I was going to Harrow—my box was all right, and the thirty-six sovereigns were there—I went</p>

               <p>to Harrow and returned at nine o'clock at night—on my return I met the prisoner's husband at the door, but the prisoner was not there—her husband went to bed at ten o'clock, and I sat up till twelve o'clock, expecting the prisoner to return, but she did not—I then laid down till the morning—the prisoner's husband got up and went to work as usual—I then went to make my bed, and I noticed that the prisoner's night cap and gown were not there—I saw her box was ajar, and her clothes were gone—I then went down and said to her son-in-law that Mrs. Avenell must have run away, as her things were gone—in a few minutes something struck me to go and look if my money was safe—I went up—it was then between ten and eleven o'clock—I took out my key, opened my box, and saw my clothes had been moved—I put my hand down and my money was gone—I ran down stairs, stated that it was gone, and was going to the prisoner's husband to tell him—a lodger who was there said, "You must have mislaid your money"—I said, "I have not"—I ran up stairs, turned every thing out of the box, and it was not there—I went down, put on my bonnet and cloak, and went to Avenell, to see if he could tell me where his wife was—he disclaimed all knowledge of it, and joined me in the pursuit—we came to town by the steamer, and went to Mary-le-bone office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Liverpool. In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I searched the house of a person named Johnson, in Regent-street, Liverpool—I found the prisoner there on Friday, the 15th of February, a little before eight o'clock in the morning—I had written to the prosecutrix, and she had come down, and was with me—I got the landlady to knock at the prisoner's room door, and say she was wanted—the prisoner was in bed—as soon as she opened the door, I said, "Mrs. Avenell," she said, "You are wrong, my name is Hooper"—I said, "No, it is Avenell, you have committed a robbery in Middlesex, and the party is come down"—she said, "Well, I will tell you all about it, I have taken the money, and I have redeemed a quantity of things"—her stays were there, and a pocket at<lb></lb>tached to them, in which I found nineteen sovereigns and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked what she had done with the other money—she said, "Redeemed some things out of pledge—this watch, and some other things"—she owed a week's rent, and with the consent of the prosecutrix I paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the silver.</p>

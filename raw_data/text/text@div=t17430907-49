               <p>Barth. Menitray. On Saturday, the 9th of July in the Evening, on Tower-Hill I met the Prisoner and another Woman; the Prisoner wanted me to come into a House; I went into a House with them both, and then the Prisoner asked me if I would not have a Quartern of Gin: The Gin was brought and I drank a Dram of it, and it had such an Effect upon me, that I fell fast asleep, and slept from seven to ten. - I had not been drinking to signify any thing, I was as sober as ever I was. After I awoke I knocked for some body, in order to go away, and saw only an old Woman with a Pipe of Tobacco in her Mouth, who asked me, if I would not go away; I said I was willing to go, but feeling in my Pocket, and missing my Watch, I said I was not willing to go, for I had the Watch when I went into the House; after I had asked for my Things, in comes a Soldier with his Hanger, in order to thrust me out, and gave me several Blows; I was going to call the Watch, and the Soldier said, What do you want to ravish my Wife? You Dog, get out, I have a good mind to murder you; and though I was in that found Sleep, I was almost positive it was the Prisoner that took the Watch out of my Pocket. I am positive to her Person that she was with me.</p>

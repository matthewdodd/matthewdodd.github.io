             sworn. - I am an officer of Shadwell: I received information of a man stealing some pots, and I received information from a little boy, which led me to the prisoner's lodgings; I found him at home, in a place they call Match-walk, Shadwell; I searched in the cupboard, and I found a quantity of pots, and in the side of the fire-place, and amongst them I found two pints of Mr. Green, and one belonging to Mr. Tindal.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, or he to you? - A. He said he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person in that room with him? - A. No, there was only a little boy in the house; he keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other people living in the house? - A. There is a woman that lives in the house; he was in the room where I found the pots; he made an excuse that he wanted to go up stairs to get his coat; he made a spring at the stairs, and jumped right to the bottom of the house into the cellar; he then got into the garden, and the next minute I happened to step into a pail of water. In the mean while he got over the pails, I pursued him, and in about twenty yards Mr. Bellamy caught hold of him; I am sure he is the man, I was not ten yards from him when he was taken; I only lost sight of him when he got over the paling; I found in his room four pint pots, a half pint pot, a half pint liquor measure, and a half quartern.</p>

               <p>Brown. He lives close to my house, he knew me.</p>

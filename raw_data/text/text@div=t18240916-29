On the 20th of July these articles were on a sofa in my room - they are worth 23 s. I opened the passage door, and saw the prisoner with them in her apron; she dropped them, and ran away - I went to the street door, and called to my man, who was at work opposite, to stop her; he pursued, and took her. I am sure she is the person who dropped them. The parlour door is always open, but there is a lobby or passage which is kept locked - hearing the street open caused me to run up stairs from the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long had you a view of this woman - A. But for a moment - I saw enough of her to know her again. I have a gentleman and a lady live in the house. I cannot tell how she got the things, but I saw them in her possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she came back with your servant did she appear just in the same dress and exactly to correspond with the person you had seen - A. Yes. I have no doubt that she is the same person.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the prosecutrix. I was at work opposite the house, and heard Mrs. Cook say,</p>
               <p>"Stop that woman" - the prisoner was then running ten or twelve yards from the door: there was no other person running. I followed her down High-street, and never lost sight of her till I took her: she continued running. I brought her back to Mrs. Cook; she then fell on her knees, and requested forgiveness.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent. At the first examination a scarf was brought against me, and on the second examination a bonnet and a veil. I never was in the house, and never fell on my knees.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lyon-terrace, Edgeware-road, and am a widow. The prisoner came into my service on a Thursday afternoon in March—I do not recollect the day of the month—I went into the kitchen on a Wednesday morning, and desired her to fetch a roll for break<lb></lb>fast—I found a bunch of artificial flowers in the kitchen—I asked her where she got them—she said she found them among the saucepans—I know they had been kept in a box in the kitchen—when I ordered her to go for the roll, I went into the kitchen—I found she had taken her own basket to fetch the roll, instead of the common market-basket; and when she came back, I saw her take some knives from her basket—I then desired her to undress, and from her pocket she produced a candlestick and some other things—she was sitting near a coal-scuttle, and I saw there a parcel of knives, which I took up, in cloth, and some forks in a cloth—I asked her how she came by these things—she looked at me, but did not reply—she dressed again, and I was going to discharge her I said, "Let me see the remainder of your things"—she took them and spread them on the floor—I then went up stairs to tell a lady who was living there; and while I was talking to her, she cast her eye to the window, and said the servant was going out with a parcel—I sent after hr, and had her stopped; and she had got a sheet of mine, which had been kept in a store-room, and she acknowledged there was another sheet in the meat-screen—these are the articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. My mistress did not give me clean sheets on my bed when I entered her service, and, at the first opportunity, I took a pair to air them, and put them on my bed—the knives and forks I was cleaning up that day, as she was going to part with her lodgers—the candlestick and bottle-stopper were in the coal-scuttle, not in my pocket.</p>

               <p>I was going by Mrs. Quantin's house on the 18th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, and stopped the prisoner by Mrs. Quantin's desire—she had a bundle—she went back with me—the bundle was untied in my presence—there was one sheet in it, marked.</p>

On the morning of the 18th of March I went to Mrs. Quantin's house—the prisoner was given into my charge; and a young lady said, while the prisoner was in the kitchen, that there was another sheet in the meat-safe—the prisoner then said that her mistress gave her the keys to go to the wardrobe, and in an unguarded mo<lb></lb>ment she took them; but if she had had an opportunity she should have put them back again—I told her to hold her tongue.</p>

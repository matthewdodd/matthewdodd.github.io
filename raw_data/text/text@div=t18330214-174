On the 31st of January, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the even<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140075"></xptr>ing, the prisoner came into my house and asked for a pint of porter - he paid for it, and asked if he might leave his bundle while he drank it - it had some light brown paper round it, which was rather dirty; I asked what was in it - he said I knew as well as he did, for he had just picked it up; I said it was my general rule if parcels were left, to look at them - I looked into this parcel, and saw these articles; before the beer was drawn the officer came in and took him.</p>

             (Police-constable H 87). I was directed to this house, to make inquiry respecting some other property which had been stolen; there is a lobby door there - I pushed against it, but could not open it; I looked through the window over the door, and saw the prisoner there, and this witness just throwing this parcel into a chair behind her; I went in and said to the prisoner, "How came you by this?" he said it was his own that he had bought it; I said, "You must go to the station" - he made no resistance, for I told him it was of no use, for I had assistance outside; I got a person there to take him to the station, and in going along he said he had bought it; I saw the same kind of print as this in a window in Shoreditch - I went there; they said they had not sold this, but referred me to Mr. Rotherham - and the shopman recollected that he saw three females, who said they lived next door to Old Sal, at Woodford-bridge - this is the parcel, it is dirty on one side, not on the other.</p>

            . Knowles and his wife lodged with us. On the 10th of October, I was at home all day. I heard a strange step coming down stairs, went to see who it was, and saw the back of a man going out at the back door, which goes into the street; I went up and found the room in great confusion. Sometime afterwards, the prosecutrix came home and said she had been robbed. I told her, a tall man with a blue apron went out - I thought it might be her husband. The man was the same size as the prisoner. He appeared to have a fustian jacket on.</p>

The officer and him persuaded me to make it up. The officer said he thought I might do it, as I had not been before a magistrate.

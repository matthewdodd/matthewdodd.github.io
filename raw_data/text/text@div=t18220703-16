            . I am waiter at a gentleman's; I live in Titchbourne-court; the prosecutor's office window is exactly opposite my house. On Sunday, the 2d of June, I got up about ten minutes past five o'clock; I went out at my door, and about ten minutes after I went out again, and saw the window-shutter had been removed, and rested on the cill; I moved the shutter, looked in, and saw a man walking about the place; there was a lad, about eighteen years old, at the bottom of the court, walking about towards Holborn. I watched him for more than a quarter of an hour; he passed my door towards Whetstone-park; I went in, put on my coat, and followed him, and when I got to the top of the court he was gone. I had not been absent more than two minutes. I saw a man shutting the printing-office windows in Whetstone-park; I said it was very improper that he should be shutting the windows that time in the morning; it was then a few minutes after six o'clock; he said something which I did not understand, and went off westward, towards Queen-street; he had a black coat on, and I believe black trowsers. The prisoner is very much like the man, but I cannot swear to him. There was a tall man close to the window while he was shutting it up; he and I examined the window, and found the shutter shut and one bar up. We had seen the man fasten that bar; we took it down, and found the lines cut and the sash taken out; it stood inside. I went and alarmed Mr. Hansard, and went round the premises with him. The stranger went after the man, and I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Castle-street, Oxford-market. On Sunday morning, the 2d of June, about five o'clock, I went out to take a walk; I was in company with Gillon and Fielder, in Old Compton-street, Soho, about a quarter past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner there with the barometer under his arm, wrapped up in an apron, going westward. A boy came after him, and told him to make haste, for there was somebody coming after him; he then hurried on, and kept looking back. We followed him to Crown-court. I went up and asked him if he had the barometer to sell; he said Yes, but he thought I had not money enough to give for it. I then said I thought he had not got it honestly, and asked where he lived, and where he was going with it. He said he would shew me; he went on about fifty yards to an old iron shop in Crown-court, and was going to turn in there. I collared him and said, if that was where he lived, I should take him to, the watch-house. The shop door was open; he resisted, but the other two helped me to secure him. We took him to St. Ann's, watch-house, and while we were waiting for the watch-house keeper to get up, he rushed by and ran off with the barometer. We pursued him, and he threw it away. Fielder picked it up. We took him in Nassau-street, without losing sight of him, and took him back to the watch-house. We then went to look after the boy, and a woman pointed out the clock; it was in a basket, at the corner of Frith-street, in Old Compton-street. I found the maker's name on the barometer, which led me to the prosecutor. He wore a black coat and dark trowsers. I knew him before.</p>

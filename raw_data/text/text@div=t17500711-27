On the second of June, between 10 and 11 at night, I had been out, and when I returned, I found the prisoner in custody in my shop. On Monday he was taken before Justice Withers, there he confessed he conveyed tin canisters out of the shop to his companions; and my wife took him with a 3 d. in his hand concealed behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value the three canisters at?</p>
               <p>Coxall. The tea and all we valued at 9 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is no tea in the indictment. What are the canisters themselves worth?</p>
               <p>Coxall. The three canisters together cost ( second-hand ) 3 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 15th of August I found the articles stated in the indictment at No. 19, Old Pye-street, Westminster, in a back yard in the prisoner's possession - He was in the act of selling them to Mr. Odell - I secured him. As soon as we brought him out of the house, a signal was given, and a gang of thirty or forty persons attacked me and Buckeridge, and knocked me down - He was rescued from us. About three weeks ago I found him in custody.</p>

I appointed to meet him at the Bell, public-house, in Pye-street, at five o'clock. He took me to No. 19-while he was showing me the things the officers took him. They were very ill treated by the gang.</p>

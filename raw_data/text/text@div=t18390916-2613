I am stationed at Hunter-street station-house—I went there about the 20th of July, 1838—I had a box there belonging to me—amongst other things I had a silver watch, which was deposited in my box in my bed-room on the first floor, at the station-house—I missed it on the 18th of July last—I had never delivered it to the prisoner, or authorized him to take it or pawn it—he was a policeman—I never gave him the duplicate of it—he came about last January, and was placed a Hunter-street station-house—he left it in the week beginning the 28th of April and ending in May—I do not know why he left—he went from there to George-street station-house, but was still in the habit of coming to Hunter-street station-house as a reserve, and by that means would have an opportunity of being there when the other men were out on duty, and would have an opportunity of going to the bed-rooms of the men when they were away—there is a kitchen, in which cupboards are fixed, where the men's clothes hang—I recollect the prisoner was once deficient of his cape when was called upon to appear in his clothes, but I do not recollect the day—in consequence of what then passed, he was suspended and taken into custody—Inspector Campbell was informed of it, and he ordered his box</p>

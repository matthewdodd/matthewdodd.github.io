            . I had a little business with Mr. Simpson; while I was there, Mr. Holythorne came in with a few bindings; Mr. Simpson scrupled them; he said he was the real maker, and was forced to cut them out of the loom for ready money; I bought a piece of Mr. Simpson.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Holythorne declared before my Lord Mayor, he had these goods of Mrs. Jones; he said he had had but a very little profit in the selling them; that he sold them for Mrs. Jones, and kept something for his trouble; after that, I was told by the keeper of the Compter, if I would go to Mrs. Jones, she would tell me all; I went to her; she told me she had stole these goods out of my warehouse as often as she could, at four or five pieces at a time, when my men's backs were turned, and that she had a pocket for that purpose; and by Holythorne's and her account, I suppose; I have lost an hundred pieces; Holythorne owned he had sold six pieces to a chandler's shop in the Land of Promise</p>

               <p>When they took me they found nothing upon me; when I was in the Compter, he said if I would confess the truth, he would leave me to God and the mercy of the Jury; I told him I sold sixteen pieces to Holythorne, and never saw a halfpenny piece for them.</p>

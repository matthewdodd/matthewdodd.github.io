            . I am a watchman of Mary-le-bone. I was in Cumberland-mews, Adam-street, West, at two o'clock in the morning of the 24th of November, and saw the prisoner standing under an archway - he came into the mews, and broke open the padlock of a coach-house door, with a stone, but he did not take any thing from there - I pursued him, and took him with a whip, which he had got from some other place. I asked him where he got it - he said he was employed at Mr. Dickens' livery stable-yard, and had brought it from there: he had been out late with a horse and gig.</p>

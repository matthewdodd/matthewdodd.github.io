            . I took the prisoner into a room, and told her I must search her - she objected; I persevered, and said if she would not undress before me she must before her master and the officer; she said there was no necessity for that, for she had got nothing of mine- I said, "Never mind, undress and clear yourself, show me that you have nothing;" after putting her hands about her dress a good deal, she at last took her pocket off, and said, "Are you satisfied now?" I said, "No, you must undress;" she turned her back to me - I said,"Stand still, and undress," and after some time she did undress, but kept feeling about her dress; I said, "You have got something in your hand." as I saw her hand closed - she then produced this paper, with money in it; I called Mr. Shoolbred, and handed it to him, and after he came in, I perceived her hand in the same way, and said, "You have something else in your hand," and whether I took it from her I cannot say, but I thing she threw it on the table - a sovereign came from the table, which came from her; the marked shilling was in the paper with twenty or twenty-one sovereigns.</p>

               <p>MR. SHOOLBRED. Here is the mark on the sovereign and shilling - they were in my purse the night before; the prisoner had 10l. a year - I have lost between 40l. and 50l. since she has been with me.</p>

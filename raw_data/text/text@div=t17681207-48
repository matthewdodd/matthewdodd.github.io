The boy at the bar brought this table-spoon to me, on the 25th of November, about nine in the morning; I asked him, how he came by it? he said, he brought it from his mother; I returned it him, and desired him to let his mother come with it. In the afternoon, the mother, (the woman at the bar) came with it. I asked her, if it belonged to her? she said, she brought it from Mrs. Williams's, in Turn-again-Lane: I said, I would keep the spoon; and desired her to send Mrs. Williams to me. On the Saturday morning, the woman came again; and I insisted on her bringing Mrs. Williams. She brought another woman, named Skeyton; I asked Mrs. Skeyton, how long she had had that spoon? she said, about fifteen years: I asked her the marks upon it? she could not tell me. I asked Mrs. Hines, where her son lived? she said, at Mrs. Hines's, at the

She said, what is this boy come away for? I cannot think what is the matter! A lad that was there, said, he believed he was in at the Baptist's head. When he came in, his mother said, now come along, and let us go to your master; the boy said, my master is not in the way, if I do; I will go with you to-morrow. He again said, come along, mother, I have found something; she said, what is it? he shewed her a spoon. Where did you find it? said she; said he, I found it in Sea-coal Lane. Then she said, I will go and get you a pair of shoes, and you shall go to your master in the morning.</p>

               <p>Hart.

I fastened on them both, and called out for the watch; I brought one down stairs in one hand, and the other in the other; the prisoner fell on me; she beat me and made my face all over blood.</p>

            . I am a constable; about eleven at night, on the 28th of April, I was out about my duty; when I returned, I found the prisoner at the watch-house in custody; the prosecutor accused her of having taken two guineas out of his pocket; on that I would have willingly perswaded her to return the money, but she denied she had it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Castle-street. East, Oxford-market. This lead was stolen from <placeName id="t18220703-138-crimeloc725">No. 7, Holland-street</placeName>

On Sunday morning, the 16th of June, about half-past five o'clock, I was coming up Wardour-street, and saw Harris in company with another person, (not Stevenson) standing against the house in Holland-street. I passed down Wardour-street; Harris came to the corner and watched me. I went to St. Ann's watch-house, and got assistance. I returned in ten minutes with Foxhall and another; and in Berwick-street we saw Stevenson with this pipe on his shoulder, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030048"></xptr>water running from it; he saw us, and went down Maidenhead-passage; we went round and stopped him in Hopkins-court, with it. We asked where he got it - he made no answer. I locked him in the watch-house, and returned to the house, and found the door open. I left Foxhall in charge, while I fetched another officer. The door appeared to have been opened by a chisel; we found part of the lead stolen from the roof of the house, and the pipe gone. The prisoner had fifty-five pounds of pipe, which we compared, and it fitted in every respect, and must have come from that house. The water was all running about the place; Harris came next morning and brought Stevenson his breakfast. I said I had seen him against the house, and suspected he was concerned. I had seen them together before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is Gook here - A. No. There is a warrant out against him by Mr. Parkins; he knows more than any officer in the job. It was half-past five o'clock when I saw Harris. I have seen him with pick pockets before. It was Sunday morning, and I was taking a walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you frequently go out to seek what you call a job - A. No. Stevenson said he knew where he got the lead from.</p>

            . I am the son of the watch-house keeper. Bidgood applied to me on Sunday morning; I accompanied him, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, round Berwick-street, and saw Stevenson with the lead pipe on his shoulder, and an apron round it, and the water running down his back; we went round Hopkins-court, and stopped him with it; he went down Maidenhead-passage; we took him to the watch-house. We then went to No. 7, Holland-street, and found the door ajar, wrenched by some instrument; the pipe had been taken from the passage running from the kitchen to the area; we fitted the pipe to the place, and a piece left in the wall fitted it; it weighed fifty six pounds. Bidgood asked him where he got it; he made no answer. He (Bidgood) then said, he dare say it came from No. 7, Holland-street; he said he knew where it came from.</p>

They said at the watch-house that they stopped me at six o'clock - Gook, the constable, said it was half-past five o'clock, and put it down so.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a quarter past five o'clock - A. I am, for I was getting up, as I had lost the use of my limbs, and was advised to walk in the Park. We had locked the door at night, and kept the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was he taken up - A. Next morning. He sleeps on our second floor, and we in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take particular notice of the time - A. I had some doctor's stuff to take every two hours, and was to take it at five o'clock, and I noticed the clock which is in our room, as I wanted to see how far I could walk, and promised to be in at seven o'clock; I got home by a quarter past seven. I was very exact with my physic - my husband walked out with me, as my foot was so bad. I could not walk without him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to walk two hours with this bad foot - A. The doctor ordered exercise. I used to sit down in the Park.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you walk to - A. I went as far as the bason in the Green-park. I wanted to see Lord Dundas's housekeeper. His house is by there. I was about an hour going to the bason - I sat there half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had not an hour to return - A. I came back quicker than I went. I felt stronger for my walk. I got home at a quarter past seven o'clock.</p>

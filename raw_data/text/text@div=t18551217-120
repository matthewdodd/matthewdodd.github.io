                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby public house in Cando's-street, in the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, at the corner of Bedford bury; I live there. On Tuesday, 13th Nov., I went to bed about half past 10 o'clock at night—I was awoke in the night, I think, between 1 and 2 o'clock by a noise like a window opening—I left my bed and went to the staircase—I listened some minutes, and not hearing any more I thought I must be mistaken—I went back to my bed—I was awoke again in about a quarter of an hour by a cracking and breaking noise—I went again to the door at the top of the stairs and fancied I heard some one on the stairs—I said, "Charles, is that you? who is there?"—Charles is my barman—not hearing any more noise I said, "It is a good thing I have got my gun loaded"—I said that aloud, any one might hear—I heard no answer—I saw that the window had been let down to let the steam or the gas out—I put up that upper part of the window, and directly I heard a quick step in Taylor's buildings—that window looks into Taylor's-buildings—I heard a man singing "Hail, a milling morn!"—I thought I knew the voice—I thought it was Mahoney's—he was going with a quick step, and with thick shoes on—I listened again for about ten minutes—I thought I must be mistaken, and that the noise I heard must have been in the court, and not in my house—I went to sleep again—about 5 o'clock in the morning the policeman rang the bell—I went to the window—the policeman said, "Do you know the door is open?"—I said, "No"—I went down and found the back door open which leads into Taylor's-buildings—that door is two or three yards from the door leading to the bar—that door leading to the bar had been broken open by a</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the House of Correction. I produce a certificate of the conviction of Lawrence (<hi rend="italic">Read: Westminster Sessions, Edward Lawrence convicted, Aug</hi>., 1854, <hi rend="italic">and confined six months</hi>) I took him to the place, and know that he served his time there—he had been in prison previous, and he had three months last April, and two months last Aug., in the name of Jacobs.</p>

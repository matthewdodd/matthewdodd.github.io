            . I live near Sibley, at Hillingdon. Between five and six o'clock on the evening of the 3d of April, I saw two ducks on the river - one was brown and the other white - they were not a quarter of a mile from Sibley's. I saw the prisoner come within about three hundred yards of me, and shoot the brown duck; he waded up to his knees in the water, and got it, put it into his pocket, and went away. I went and told Mr. Sibley, and the prisoner was taken next day - I am certain he is the man there was another man with him, but the prisoner carried the gun, concealed under his coat.</p>

            . On the 3d of April we had five ducks and a drake - one duck was a brown one - I missed that on this day. The river is across the field, about one hundred yards from the house; I have never seen the duck since. The prisoner lived at Uxbridge, and was taken the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Frith-street, Soho. On the 15th of September the prisoner came, and said he called for his watch, and asked if it was done—I asked what name he left it in—he said, "Brown"—I looked over my book, and told him I had no watch left in that name—he pointed to one in the window, and said, "That is mine"—I took it down, looked at my book again, and saw it was booked in another name—he said, "Very likely my brother-in-law left it in his own name" I asked his brother-in-law's name—he said, "Austin," which was the name in which it had been left—I made no hesitation in giving it to him.</p>

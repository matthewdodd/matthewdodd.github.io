             WESTWOOD. I am assistant solicitor to the Bank of England. I produce the certificate of the clerk of the peace of this County, of the conviction of the prisoner for uttering base money. I saw the deputy clerk of the peace sign it. I was at Clerkenwell Sessions House at the prisoner's former trial, and know him to be the person alluded to by the certificate.</p>

            . I procured an introduction to the prisoner in November last. In consequence of that, I made an appointment with him; I met him accordingly at the <placeName id="t18151206-36-crimeloc199">Coventry Cross, Petticoat lane</placeName>

That was meaning tokens. He went away, and in about two minutes returned, with two dozen, which he delivered to me; they were wrapped up in paper. I looked at one, to see what they were. I paid him two pounds for them. I afterwards delivered them to Mr. Westwood. The prisoner said, they were all good ones, and taking three and sixpence in his hand, he said, this is all I get by them, by God.</p>
               <p>Mr. Westwood. I received a paper of counterfeit tokens from the last witness, with paper between each of them, to prevent their rubbing together, and thereby taking off the colouring.</p>

            . I am a City constable, and apprehended the prisoner, on Sunday, the 5th of November; I told him I had information from Mr. Westwood to apprehend him about some three shilling tokens; I took hold of him in Newgate street. He said, I held him as tight as if it was for a highway robbery; I told him it was nearly as serious an affair. He said, he did not care, they could not hang him; they could only transport him.</p>

On the 30th of July, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner inside his shop in the act of secreting a pair of stays under her petticoats - she had not offered to buy any thing; I asked her what she was going to do with them - she denied having them, and dropped them at the same time: I am sure she was trying to conceal them, for I came into the shop about two minutes before, and watched her putting them under her petticoats; the handkerchiefs were not found till she was going to the station; when she had got three or four yards from our house they were found under her things - this shawl was found in her bosom at the station; they are all my father's - his name is Matthew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is quite false that I went to put them under my clothes - I went to look at a pair of stays; there were two young women in the shop when I went in; and when he came to me, he said if I would give him 4s. for them, he would not take me. Witness. No I did not.</p>

             (Police-constable B 4). At half-past two o'clock, on the 30th of July, I went to the shop, and took the prisoner - when we had got a few yards from the shop, I saw what I thought was a handkerchief about the lower part of her legs; I looked, and found these two handkerchiefs; I took hold of them, and pulled them down - I took this blue shawl from her at the station, and this large knife was taken from her bosom.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

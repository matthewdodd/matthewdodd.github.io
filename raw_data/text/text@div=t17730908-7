On the 14th of July last, in the afternoon between three and six o'clock, the prisoner called at my shop; he had a pair of paste ear-rings he wanted to exchange for some other things; I shewed him a number of things; nothing gave him satisfaicton; I shewed him these diamond ear-rings; soon after he was gone I missed a 5 s. 3 d. and then the ear-rings; but before the prisoner went away he said he had given me a good deal of trouble, and would give me satisfaction; he desired me to bring him one of Mr. Cox's tickets next day, and he bespoke at the same time a mahogany case with green handle knives and forks, which he desired me to bring to Mr. Johnson, No. 16, Mead's-court; he seemed by his dress and manner the gentleman; I went there, but I could find no such house, nor no such person; then I naturally concluded he was the person that had stole the 5 s. 3 d. and the ear-rings; I made every attempt to find him out but did not meet with him till about three weeks afterwards, when a young man to whom I had described him, whose shop he had been at met him by accident about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177309080010"></xptr> three weeks after, and had him secured; I was sent for; I was clear to the person of the prisoner as soon as I saw him; he denied it very strongly that night; the next morning he sent for me to the watch-house, and confessed it; he said he was the person; that he was in unhappy circumstances, and that he did steal them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him it would be better for him, or persuade him to confess?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I made him no particular promise, but that I would be as indulgent as the law would allow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I should not be hurted if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Farquharson. He told me if I would say before Justice Welch that I was not sure he was the person that he would go and take the things out of pawn at his own expence, and give them me; I said I would not do that; at last he confessed he had pawned them in Prince's-street; in consequence of which the ear-rings were produced.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you swear you shewed these ear-rings to him?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I believe some hours after.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shewn to any person else after the prisoner had been at your house?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. I am very certain from the time I shewed them to him till I missed them, nobody else had seen them.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to miss them?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. In a multiplicity of things one does not so soon miss things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>Farquharson. Yes, very certain of it; he said he had pawned them at the pawnbroker's in Prince's-street; he named the name but I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know the name, so I could not mention it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in Prince's-street: the prisoner came to me on the 14th of July in the afternoon, about five o'clock, and asked to have a locket that I had lent him a guinea and a half upon a few days before; he produced these ear-rings, and desired to have six guineas in money and the locket, which made seven guineas and a half; I asked him if the ear-rings belonged to him; he said no, they belonged to a lady; he was dressed very genteelly; I had not the least suspicion of their being stole, and was very much surprised when the gentleman came to enquire after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been at your house any other time but the time he pledged the locket?</p>
               <p>Parker. Yes, he had; he always appeared very genteel when he came to our house. (The ear-rings produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. What name did the prisoner go by at your shop?</p>
               <p>Parker. Williamson.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether the prosecutor did not say at the watch-house if I delivered up his pocket book I should not be hurted?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not say so; I said I would go no farther than the law obliged me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. He said I should not be indicted capitally, only for transportation.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said such a thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he on when he came to buy the things of you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. A lightish sky blue, and one of your showy waistcoats embroidered.</p>
               <p>Q. to the other witness. How was he dressed when you saw him?</p>

               <p>Parker. Much as Mr. Farquharson has described.</p>

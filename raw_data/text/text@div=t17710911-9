One night we had been out and he brought in a loaf of sugar in his lap; he swore the boy had watched him, and he was vexed at it. He went down into the apartments in the cellar, and she with him; he came up and said he would make the best of his way home; she asked him to drink some crank; he drank a little he went away and came back soon after. Mrs. Summerayse asked him what the boy wanted him for; he said, d - n his blood only to ask me where I was going? there was nothing more of it. There was fourteen or fifteen pounds of chocolate in the house the day before this was found out; and a week before the loaves of sugar were in the house.

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to Mrs. Summerayse's on account of a quarrel between Mrs. Neale and Mrs. Summerhayse. When I came I found they had been fighting. Mrs. Neale said White had stolen goods from his master and brought them them there to Summerayse. She said this before White, that he had had 8 or 10 loaves of sugar there at a time in the cellar. White said she was a false woman. I put her in the Compter, and then went and told the story to Mr. Saunders; he got a search warrant and we searched the house and found the things before mentioned in the house. The cannisters were found in the cellar, the rest on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>- Rothwell. I found these cannisters in a box corded in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Prostine Snow I lived with Mr. Saunders a twelve-mouth. The prisoner would go up when the rest of the family did; after they were, as he thought, asleep, he would go out. I went back one day into the warehouse; I saw a bag full of tea there. I took it up and saw it was bohea tea. He brought his great coat out with him. Soon after, when I sent him out, I suspected he had the bag of tea. I went back into the shop and looked for the bohea tea I had seen ten minutes before, and it was gone. This was the 24th of August, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of tea might be there?</p>
               <p>Snow. I fancy about two pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else been in the warehouse besides you and him?</p>
               <p>Snow. I sent him out; and immediately as I came out I miss'd the tea; I spoke about it to my master.</p>
               <p>White's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never carried any thing there. I used to call in as I went along with parcels or so; but never wronged my master of a halfpenny. As to the breast buckle, they all denied it to be theirs, time after time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Saunders. How is that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. The breast buckle was lost some time before we suspected he had it. We sent to him for it. My boy said it was his; one of the stones was broke. I said it was better to be tender, so we returned it to him; two of my children said they could swear to it, before they returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. Three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Summerayse's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never received the worth of a penny in my house in my life, but what I justly bought and paid for. Two of my nephews that used my house have brought things in. The tea and coffee was mine. The cannisters were brought into my house last July was twelve-month, by my nephew

            . I met the prisoner in Brick-lane. On last Saturday week, at night, he asked me to pawn a table-cloth; supposing it to be his father's, I went and pawned it for him, at Price's, Wentworth-street. He proposed to sell the ticket; which made me suspect him. I informed my master.</p>

            . I am no relation of the last witness. I am servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came into the house on the last Saturday in January, as errand-boy, and on the Monday I missed two spoons, and on Friday a silver candlestick, and on the Saturday a table-cloth. I went to his mother, to enquire if he had mislaid the table-cloth, I did not suspect he had stolen it. He asked if I meant to make him a thief. I said,</p>
               <p>"No; I thought he had mislaid it." She abused me very much, and I ran home and told the officer how he treated me.</p>
               <p>- BROOKS. I am servant to Mr. Willis, of Bishopsgate-street. On Monday evening, about half-past eight o'clock, a woman came in to sell a spoon. I suspected it was stolen - it was broken in half, and the cypher filed out. I asked if it belonged to her. she said it did - and then she said it belonged to Mr. Brooks, of Spital-square. I went with her to Spital-square, where she said she got it from. I knocked at the door - she ran off. The spoon was delivered to the officer a few days after.</p>

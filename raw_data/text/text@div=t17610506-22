               <p>Q. How long had she lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. She had lodged in my house going on two years in a back garret. She was over the water at work. I went up and missed the bed, and she had nothing but straw upon the bedstead to lie upon; this was on the 20th of April. My wife went over the water to her, and brought her home. I charged her with taking the bed; she said, if I would let her go, she would make me restitution for it?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get it again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say was become of it?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. She said, she had sold it at different places, by taking out the feathers at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I value it at 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she had done with the ticken?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. She owned she had sold that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I left my door tied with a string, having never a lock to it, the bed was lost in the manner he speaks of; there is Mr. Seymour, one of the jury, knows me, if he will speak for me.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seymour. She worked for me two or three years ago, she behaved very well then.</p>
               <p>Frances Fisher. I have known her upwards of 20 years, she lived with my mother and me above three years, she was very honest, and a very good servant; I never heard of her doing any thing amiss before this, she has never been half a year from my house this 20 years, she nursed me with two children.</p>

            . I am eleven years old. I saw Gentry talking to a countryman, and then saw him talking to the prisoner. I saw her unbutton his coat, and put her hand into his breeches pocket. I was only one door off - I saw her take a small purse out - I saw it in her hand - another girl was with her - she ran up Angel-alley, and was taken in a quarter of an hour. I know her to be the girl - she has only one eye. I heard money jingle in the purse.</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. I saw Gentry talking to a countryman, and then saw a short woman with one eye talking to him. I saw her draw his two great coats aside, unbutton then, and draw something out of his breeches pocket - she nearly dropped it as she ran away. The prisoner is the young woman, I am certain - she has only one eye.</p>

             re-examined. I know that the prisoner is the girl. I cannot say whether she had but one eye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the man, or the boys.</p>
               <p>- WEBB. I live in Angel-alley. I was standing at my door on this day. Two girls ran up the alley - one said to the other,</p>
               <p>"Run on;" they ran very hard, and never stopped till they got to the end of the alley. I thought they had done a robbery, and presently Gentry came to my door with these boys - his pocket was turned inside out, and he said he had been robbed. One of the boys said that one was a one-eyed girl. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, do not say that the one-eyed girl did it - she is a bad girl," but she is neither of the two girls. One of them has a cast in her eye, and the other a black patch over her eye - she is not either of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know the prisoner - A. Yes, any one may know her she is so remarkable. I did not see Gentry talking to either of the girls, but as they were running, I suspected they had committed the robbery. I heard, that the prisoner was taken up for it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, she is a bad girl, but she is free from that."</p>

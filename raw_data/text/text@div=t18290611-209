            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner following the prosecutor; the other two were about ten yards behind him - I knew them by sight: I did not see the handkerchief taken; the prisoner went right under the Piazza - the others dodged about, and met at the other end- he spoke to them, and went on towards the Bank, and just before they came down to princes-street, I saw the prisoner turn round; the prosecutor turned round immediately, and I saw the prisoner throw the handkerchief on the railing of the Bank; the other two went on, and took not the least notice.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

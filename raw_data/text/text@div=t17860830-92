               <p>How do you know it was yours? - By the mark and number, that were upon it; I asked him how he came by it, he said he kicked his foot against it in the street.</p>
               <p>What became of the sugar after? - It was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. I am desired to ask you Sir, whether it had not occurred to you before this to have some conversation with the prisoner, about an intercourse between some of your servants, male and female? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you a nephew? - Yes; the prisoner said to me there were such things going on in my house, that he thought it was a shame.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he descended rather more to particulars, and described that there were intercourses between the men and the maids, that were not very fit? - He said there were.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300135"></xptr>Do you recollect his adding to it, that he was reluctant to state to you who the parties were, because he knew the men would be revenged of him on some occasion? - He did.</p>
               <p>I put all these questions to you with all the expectation that your answers warrant? - You shall have an answer.</p>
               <p>Did you take any steps to enquire about it? - I did not, because I did not believe it; I rather think since, he said so to cloak his design.</p>
               <p>Court. That is your suspicion, Mr. Hawes; we take the substantive facts: In what way was this sugar kept; was it in your mill; and if so, how was that mill guarded from the street? - It is in a room over the mill; far from the street; the prisoner said, he stumbled over the sugar, and was going to take care of it for me; but he was taking it a different way; there is no way of getting at the room where those sugars were kept but by coming over the gate; I have two dogs and no man upon earth dare venture but one of the family, and any of them may come at any time; it is not very difficult to get over the gates, except the dogs; the doors were locked over night, but every man knows where to find the keys.</p>
               <p>Then any of your men, if they had been so disposed, could have got into those rooms? - They could; a ladder was set to go into my hay-loft over the stable; whoever took the sugar must have gone out of the window through the hay-loft.</p>

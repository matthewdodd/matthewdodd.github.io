White paid me for the half Ell of Holland, and was going out: Mr. Hodges, who is likewise a Draper, stopped her, brought her into my Shop, and said she had been in his Shop. and had stole a Piece of Cambrick, therefore he would search her: He got hold of both her Hands and held them out; and a Piece of Lawn dropped from her on the Ground in the Shop: These are my Goods, says he, but they proved to be mine, and was marked in the End. I had just shown some Lawns to a Customer, and several Pieces Lay upon the Counter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodges. They had been in my Shop just before; I discovered what they were, and clear'd my Counter, that there might be nothing near them. White came in first, and Jones followed her. I could not keep them together, they would be running one to one end, the other to the other end of the Counter. I had just laid 5 Pieces of Cambrick at one end. White had bought a Quarter of a Yard, it was tore off, and was abruptly going away without paying for it: I made her pay for it, and then they went away. As soon as they were gone. I miss'd a Piece of Cambrick, and pursued them to Mr. Davis's Shop. I let her come out a little way into the Street; then I carried her back into his Shop, and to prevent her conveying the Goods away, I held her Arms open; but she got one Hand at liberty, and shook her Petticoats, and I saw the Lawn drop from her, before it came to the Ground, and she endeavoured to kick and spurn it from her.</p>

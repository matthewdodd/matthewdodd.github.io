On the 24th of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, my child alarmed me, and said there was a man in the first-floor room, I ran up; when I got to the top of the stairs, my street - door was opened, and a person said a man had ran out of my private door with a bundle of linen. I ran out, but lost sight of the person. I sent for an officer, the people said the prisoner was up a passage in the street - we were examining the house, and heard a noise in the street; the officer ran out and took the prisoner. I found my room-door open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone.</p>

I saw the prisoner come out of another door of the prosecutor's house in Thrall-street, I pursued, and stopped him in Fashion-street, and found the sheet tied round his body, and the rest of the things in a bundle.</p>

He said he broke the door open and took the things out of the room; that he lived by thieving, and if he had his liberty to-morrow, he would thieve again.</p>

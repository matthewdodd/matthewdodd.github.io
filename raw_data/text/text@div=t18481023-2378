                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Darker. We left the Fortune of War last Saturday; we kept it on 22nd Sept. On the night of 21st Sept., a large supper-party was given there by M'Laren's brother, in consequence of his having a fight; he is a pugilist—I examined my drawer about nine o'clock that evening; the cash-box was safe in it, with about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and gold and silver of every description—the drawer goes a very long way back; it is lower than the bar, it is under the till—a person would have to stoop down to go to it—it fastens with a nut, not a lock, and you have to pull with both hands—no one had any right inside the bar, but my husband, and I, and my children—M'Laren was my pot-boy about ten</p>

               <p>weeks—he had no business inside the bar—he used to sleep in the house—on that night, he and Boobner, and two or three more, went out together—M'Laren afterwards asked Mr. Darker to let him go home with his brother—he went out a second time, came back, and went to bed—I went to take the cash box out after the people were gone, and missed it.</p>

Was Mr. Darker up stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he came down again before the cloth was drawn, and never went up again—the party had very little spirits—I or my husband were in the bar from nine o'clock in the morning till twelve at night—M'Laren's brother fell down when they came down, and one or two fell on him—I had not taken any thing that night but what I ordinarily take—one of M'Laren's brothers (not the fighter) and another, a friend of his, remained all night in the club-room where they had the supper; one of them slept on the sofa.</p>

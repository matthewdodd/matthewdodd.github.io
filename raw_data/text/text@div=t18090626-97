               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion you had did you on the 3rd of June mark any silver that you delivered out to the prisoner - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What work was he to do - A. To finish a teapot; for that purpose I delivered him a piece of silver plate; I marked it with a diamond punch, in that part that was to be cut off; at six o'clock he left his work, then I looked in his apron, I found materially less cuttings than I expected, the piece that I had marked was not there; I went to the accompting house, where he then was being paid by my father, I went in and shut the door, and told him he had in his pocket what he had no right to; I told him it was not the first time; he said it was the first time, and then produced the silver cuttings, an ounce and fifteen pennyweights. The silver is the property of Mr. Gerrard; here is the marked piece; the cuttings are the produce of that day's work.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I fell in with the prisoner on the 13th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, as I was going home, in Well-street, East Smithfield - I had never seen her before; she accosted me, and I went with her to a house in <placeName id="t18260622-124-crimeloc617">Blue Anchor-yard</placeName>

I have no doubt but a woman, the prisoner was whispering to when I first saw her, was the woman who took my clothes; the prisoner had her clothes on. I had had a share of a pot of porter; I had not given her any money, nor bargained to give her any - I had a little in my pocket; I had not been in bed three minutes.</p>

I received information of the robbery, and took the prisoner into custody, in Blue Anchor-yard (a very bad place) - she told me who the girl was who blew the candle out, and I could have taken her, but the prosecutor could not swear to her; I searched round at the pawnbroker's, but could not find the clothes.</p>

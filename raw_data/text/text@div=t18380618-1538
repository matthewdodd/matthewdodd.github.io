                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tyler, he lives at No. 3, South-row, Carnaby Market, St. James's, Westminster, and is a tailor—the shop is part of the dwelling-house, and we occupy it. On the 1st of June I went to the next house, leaving nobody in the shop—I left the door closed—it has a spring lock, with a handle on both sides—it was fastened—you could not open it without turning the handle—there is a bell attached to the door—I heard the bell ring and looked out, and heard a man at the door say "Make haste"—I then went to our shop and saw a person standing at the door, with his hand on the door, which was half open, and as I got to the door I saw a man inside the shop with his hands on a piece of ker<lb></lb>seymere—I can positively swear to the prisoner Monington—he was inside the shop—I heard the man outside say, "Make haste Tom, or Bill, or Jack," or something, I do not positively know which—I then went into the shop, and Monington had his hands on the kerseymere, which he had</p>

               <p>removed from behind the counter, as it was there when I went out, at"the further end of the shop, but he had got it between the counter and the door—when I went into the shop I locked the door—the paper on the end of the kerseymere was moved a little—I called my husband, who sent a lodger for a policeman to take him into custody—I asked Monington what he wanted with that kerseymere—he said he had come in for the purpose of purchasing a small piece of drab cloth—he denied touching the black kerseymere—a policeman came in and he was taken to the station-house—the kerseymere was about three yards from where it was when I went out—when the other man found I had secured the man inside, he walked off.</p>

I laid hold of the lock and tried it—nobody came in after that—the bell I suppose was struck, for the door was slightly ajar—I am quite certain about where I left the kerseymere—my husband was up-stairs at work—I was not absent above a minute and a half—I found the kerseymere standing I on its end on the floor, and the prisoner's hands on it against the counter—I had left it on the ground against the wall—there had been time to go land move it before I was alarmed.</p>

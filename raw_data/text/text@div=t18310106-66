            . I am a Policeman. I was in Crown-court, Goswell-street, on the 29th of December - I heard Stop thief! called, and ran into Bell-alley; I met the prisoner running, with this bundle under his arm, I suppose three hundred yards from where the prosecutor describes the bundle was lost, which was in Fann-street, near Goswell-street.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work at the Asylum, and the job was stopped for a fortnight - I came away, and brought two shirts and some other articles home with me; I got rather intoxicated going home, was knocked down at the corner of a street, and my bundle was taken from me - I got up and ran; I saw the prosecutor with this bundle in his hand, and thought it was mine - I took it, ran off, and did not know till the next morning that it was not.</p>

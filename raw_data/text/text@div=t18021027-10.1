             sworn. - I keep a school in the prosecutor's house: On Saturday last, a little after one o'clock, our young ladies were nearly all gone, I was going up stairs, and upon opening the door, met a person very much resembling the prisoner, but I cannot swear to her; I believe her to be the person, but she was in a very different dress when I saw her again. I asked her what was her business, she told me she came from Mrs. Peppercorn, in Newgate-market, who wished to know what I had a quarter with a little girl; I said, if she would give me her mistress's address I would wait of her; she said I had better do so; she said her mistress did not live in the market, but in lodgings, which she described very particularly, as also the situation of the shop; she then bid me good morning; she had at that time a bundle in her apron; she had neither bonnet nor cloak on; I then went to Mrs. Peppercorn, but she knew nothing of it; I afterwards went to the prisoner's apartment, and saw her there; there was a gown and an apron found, which I shall know when they are produced; the constable has them.(William Shepherd, a constable, produced the property that he had found in the prisoner's apartment.)(Mary Britchard, the wife of the prosecutor, identified the gown and the apron.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that gown and apron? A. I suppose the gown about 4s. and the apron 3d.</p>

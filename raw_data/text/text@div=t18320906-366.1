On the 30th of August, about eight o'clock in evening, I was in the parlour, and heard somebody in the shop - I got up to wait on them, and as I opened the parlour door I saw a lad come from behind the counter; I was alarmed, but as soon as I recovered I said, "Here is a thief in the shop;" my daughter said, "It is Brown's boy;" the prisoner's father lives near me; I went to the till, and all the money but one shilling was gone - I had seen it safe ten minutes before.</p>

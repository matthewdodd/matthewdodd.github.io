Gratrix, who acted as the servant, opened the door; I told him my business; and he shewed me immediately up stairs. Mr. Sharpless was sitting with his hair a good deal powdered, and his face powdered; he was in a linen gown, to keep the powder from his dress, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was his face powdered?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, a good deal, rather more than there was a necessity for, I think. He asked me if I had brought some silk stockings, and bid me shew them; I opened several papers of stockings; he looked out three pair of coloured stockings, and three pair of white.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gratrix in the room all this while?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He was in and out at the door; he asked me the price; I told him; then he asked me if I had silk pieces, and if I had not some black silk stockings with French clocks; I told him I had; he desired I would fetch some, and be pretty quick, for he should be in the house but a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold him these silk stockings before you went away?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked the price, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He bid me fetch some silk pieces; I put the stockings on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing whether he would have the stockings?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There was no agreement made about the stockings; I did not take the marks off, but put the stockings on the back of a chair till I came back. When I came down stairs, I asked the servant Gratrix his master's name; he said Sharpless, and that he was a Berkshire gentleman. Then I went home, and brought the silk pieces, and the silk stockings; I suppose I was not absent more than ten minutes; I knocked at the door; the woman of the house opened it; she said the gentleman was gone out, and the servant had left word that I was to leave the things there, and the gentleman was to be at home at three o'clock; I told her I did not chuse to leave them, but would be back before three. I went home, and returned at about half an hour after two; I knocked at the door; the woman of the house opened the door; she said he was not come home; I asked her if she recommended them to me; she said she knew nothing of the matter; I asked her to let me go up stairs, to see if my goods were there; I went up; but my goods were not there; I would have taken them if they had; I searched the drawers and bed-chamber; there was nothing there; she told me, as I was coming down stairs, that, if he was a gentleman, I should serve him no more;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290021"></xptr> I met another hosier as I came down, who had brought another parcel of goods; when he came out, he and I had some talk.

I received a letter afterwards from Sir John; I went there; there I saw three pair of stockings; I have seen three pair more since at a pawnbroker's in Castle-street, Oxford-market; I saw them a few days after; they had my marks to them, as I left them in the room.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. These are three out of six pair that I carried to Sharpless that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. From Sharpless to the Prosecutor. Whether they were not agreed for, for half-a-guinea a pair, before you lost them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. I must have sold them for less than they were worth if I had; I sold them for 14 and 13 s. there was no agreement made at all.</p>
               <p>Sharpless. He agreed to leave the coloured ones for half-a-guinea, and the white for 12 s.</p>
               <p>Q. To Jenkins. Whom had you these stockings of?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I had them of Dunbar on the 14th of March in the afternoon; he was alone; I have seen Gratrix and Sharpless, or Hall, with him at other times in pledging goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How near this 14th of March?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I believe both before and after a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was lent on them?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. A guinea on three pair.</p>
               <p>Court. To the Prosecutor. Your marks remain on the stockings now?</p>

            . I knew the prisoners; about five or six weeks before this happened I saw them at their lodgings; they came there the night before this affair; I was in the room when Sharpless gave Gratrix directions to go to Mr. Hudson's, to order some silk stockings; he acted as servant, Sharpless as master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gratrix always the servant?</p>
               <p>Dunbar. No; at other times he has been in the same situation as Sharpless was then.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us for what purpose that lodging was taken?</p>
               <p>Dunbar. The same purpose it answered, to have some stockings there. We were, the day before, in St. James's Park; they had not any lodging at that time as I know of; it was agreed amongst us all, that the lodging should be taken; we had not proposed any particular lodging; we were all together when we found out this lodging; it was mentioned over night to get some stockings of Mr. Hudson. I went to their lodging next morning between nine and ten o'clock; they wanted me to go with the message to Mr. Hudson's; I went out with a pretence to go; when I came back, it was settled between them, that Gratrix should go as the servant, and Sharpless was to appear as a gentleman. Gratrix went, and brought word back that the stockings would come immediately. Mr. Hudson came about a quarter of an hour after; when he knocked at the door, I went into another room; I could hear their voices there, but not so as to distinguish any thing that passed; I came into the room again when Mr. Hudson was gone; I saw the stockings lie loose upon the chair; they agreed then to leave the lodgings; I put some of the stockings in my pocket, and Sharpless I believe had some; Sharpless and I went first; I think we went to the Yorkshire Grey at Buckingham-gate, and Gratrix came to us; we left the lodgings entirely. I went and pawned the three pair of silk stockings that have been produced, for a guinea; the prisoners stood at the corner of the street whilst I went into the pawnbroker's; Sharpless pawned the other three pair in the name of Hall at a pawnbroker's near Oxford-market; I gave him a shilling for the pawnbroker's ticket.</p>

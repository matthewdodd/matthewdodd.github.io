After some time I went to look after the property, I found four shirts were gone, one of which was Mr. Reynold's. On the next day I went to Mr. King's the pawnbroker, I there found the shirt.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, Fore Street, Edmonton. On the 28th of August, between three and four in the afternoon the prisoner offered me a shirt, he asked me to lend him five shillings on it, I took the shirt in my hand and asked him the marks, he said I. B. I looked at it and found it was I. R. I then said, " you villain, you have stolen this shirt off some line," it was damp. I went to the door to call Mr. Steele to charge a constable with him, during which time he was gone, I was not half a minute, I am certain he is the man. The next day Mrs. Starling came and claimed the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Enfield Highway. - A. About four miles to my house. I gave a description of the prisoner.</p>

             keeps the house; he lives in the house; I live in the one pair of stairs frontroom; I went out between two and three in the afternoon; my husband was at work; I left nobody in the room; I turned the key in the lock, and put the key in my pocket; I returned between five and six in the evening, and found the door safe, as I left it; I met a woman on the stairs, with a bundle in her lap; she passed me, and asked me for a strange name; my landlord stood at the door, and had some suspicion; I missed a sheet from off a large bible, on a table, in my room, a white gown, and my long red cloak; I heard no more of my things till five weeks afterwards; I heard that a woman was taken up.</p>



               <p>Q. Do you know if the woman that you passed was the prisoner? - A. I cannot say, for I took no notice of her; I had no suspicion; I went to Pancras watch- house, and there I owned my sheet, that was on Wednesday the 15th of October; and, the same evening, my landlord went with me to Marlborough-street, where I saw the prisoner with my red cloak on; I said, it was my cloak, and a young man took it from her; she said, she brought the cloak from Bristol with her; I told her it was my cloak, I could swear to it; the said, if it was my cloak, they must have changed it where she had been the night before; I attended the Monday following, and swore to my cloak; the sheet was delivered to me at the same time, (produces it); Lovett has got the cloak.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner at all about your premises? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there no violence done to the door? - </p>

               <p>A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the door could only have been opened by a key? - A. I do not know how she got them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure these things were in the room when you went out? - A. I am certain of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the house when you went out?</p>

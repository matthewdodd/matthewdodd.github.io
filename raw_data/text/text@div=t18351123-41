                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Briggs. On the 18th of November, I went into a furrier's shop, in Regent-street—I had my reti<lb></lb>cule, which coutained my purse, with nine shillings and four sixpences in it—It was day-time—I was looking at some boas—I did not see the pri<lb></lb>soner in the shop—I saw her when she returned with the policeman—the reticule was not taken, but my purse was taken out—I had laid on a chair by me.</p>

I recollect the prosecutrix being there—I saw the reticule on the chair—the prisoner came in while Mrs. Briggs was there—I desired her to wait a short time, as I was engaged—she said she would call again, and was about to leave, when she put her hand into the reticule, and took something out—I asked Mrs. Briggs if she had lost any thing—she said, "Yes"—I followed the prisoner, and caught her by the Bull and Mouth—I gave her in charge.</p>

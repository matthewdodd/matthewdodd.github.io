On the 2d of February, I was at work at the border of my garden, where some Sweedish juniper-plants had been growing for three years, and a little after five o'clock in the evening as I left work I passed them again; my man observed to me what fine plants they were - there were twelve or fourteen of them. Next morning at eight o'clock I went to the same place, and missed them all, they had been plucked up, and taken away with a quantity of others. There were footmarks across the fresh mould, which had been dug the day before, clear from the hedge to where the junipers grew. Next day two officers came, and enquired if I had lost any plants; I said I had lost junipers; they took me to Mr. Lees, at Hammersmith, where I saw my plants - there were junipers, hollies, and arbavites, which were all mine. I have known the prisoner ten years, he is a gardener, and lived with Mr. White, just opposite my garden.</p>

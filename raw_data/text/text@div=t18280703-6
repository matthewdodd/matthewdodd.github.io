On the 20th of June, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from visiting some friends; I was quite sober - my handkerchief was safe when I was on Blackfriars'-bridge, and as I turned round into <placeName id="t18280703-6-crimeloc28">Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not meet me in Fleet-street, and beckon me down a court? A. I did not. I told her repeatedly to go away; I did not give her the handkerchief.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. I saw the prisoner standing in Salisbury-court, and knew her before; in about a minute I saw the prosecutor come up to her, ask for his handkerchief, and say, "If there was a watchman or constable I would give you in charge;" I then said I was an officer, and took her; she denied having the handkerchief; as I took her down Fleet-street I saw her put her hand into her bosom, and pull part of the handkerchief out; she then pulled it quite out and gave it to me; she then said the prosecutor had given it to her for a certain purpose, which he directly denied - she had before denied having it - she again asserted at the watch-house that he had given it her - he appeared to be quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say, "Here is the handkerchief he gave me," and I would not give it, and that I would not go down a court with any gentlemen? A. No; she said nothing of the kind.</p>

The prisoners came to my house on Friday, the 24th of August, about eleven o'clock in the day, and called for two glasses of porter—they stood some time at the bar, speaking to each other—Barrett had a note-book in his hand, and appeared to be an agent—the other seemed a kind of foreman carpenter, and Barrett was giving him directions—they drank the beer, and Barrett gave me a sovereign to take for it—they had been about four times before in the week—Barrett laid down the sovereign—I gave him change in silver, taking for the beer—he said he wished to have a half-sovereign, as he was going collecting, and did not wish to have such a deal of silver about him, as the day pre<lb></lb>vious he had nearly half a peck about him, and found it very heavy—I drew a bag from my pocket, and gave him a half-sovereign for the change—I went into the parlour, and they went into the tap-room—Barrett came to the parlour door, and said he wanted to speak to me—he said, "I am very sorry, but I gave you a bad sovereign I took yesterday"—I said, "I do not think you have"—I came out, and turned out 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had in the bag—the two prisoners stood looking into the bar, and I said, "I have got no bad sovereign"—I turned into a little room—Barrett came and dipped his fingers into my hand, and said, "It is the dark one—I see it," and he took it up—I said, "I wish you would not take that liberty with me"—he drop<lb></lb>ped the sovereign, and stepped back, and said he was sorry I had that opi<lb></lb>nion of him—they went away directly—I said to a young man, "I will lay my life I am done"—I turned out the money, and I had only thirty-eight sovereigns—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was gone—I looked into it no, further at that time—I was going to the station-house, but being aware that they would have a look after me, I stopped till three o'clock—I then went and told what had happened—I went in search of them, and found them the same night—they were in a different dress altogether—I charged them with robbing me—they then wanted to speak to me, but I gave charge of them—Human said, "I hope you will do nothing; you know my father"—I did know his father—a few shillings were found on them.</p>

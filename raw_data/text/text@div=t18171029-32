            . I am a night-patrol. On the 24th of October, I was in Fleet-street; I was watching the prisoners, Wells and Buckingham, for a quarter of an hour before, they were going towards Temple-bar and met Spencer by Salisbury-court; they stood talking together for five minutes; Mr. Webster and a gentleman passed on that side of the way going towards Temple-bar; the prisoners, Wells and Buckingham, went after him and beckoned to Spencer - He joined them; Wells went to Mr. Webster's pocket and pulled out the handkerchief about five or six inches - They went on a little farther, and opposite Red Lion-court, Buckingham took it quite out; they all ran across the road together; I informed Mr. Webster, and told him to follow me; I hardly knew which way they turned, but I thought it must be up the court; I went up to the top of Red Lion-court, and found them jostling about; I stopped them and took them to a public-house and found nothing on them; Mr. Webster went out and brought in the handkerchief. I had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290016"></xptr>them that evening before for some time and am sure they are the persons.</p>

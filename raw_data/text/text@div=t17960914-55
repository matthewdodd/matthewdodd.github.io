               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you are now sworn to try the question, not of the guilt or innocence of this man, but a previous question, which is, whether he stands mute, that is, refuses to plead, by the visitation of God having deprived him of his health and faculties, or whether through obstinacy; because, if he stands charged with this offence, and refuses to plead through obstinacy, it becomes a duty upon the Court to record his plea of guilty; on the other hand, if upon the evidence, you think he stands mute, through the visitation of God, you will say so; therefore the witnesses now attend to explain to you, upon oath, the state of mind this man has been in, previous to his being brought to the bar, as to his conduct, here you will judge what effect it has upon your minds.</p>

               <p>Jury. How did he appear with respect to his mind? - A. He appeared to be as well collected as I am, but appeared to be in that little groggy kind of way.</p>

               <p>There was always something very odd about the man, but I never perceived him so deranged as not to know what he was about; when he came into the ward first, he cut his leg, and the first thing I heard of him was, that he shammed madness; his leg has been well some time, and the wardsman has had the care of him ever since he appeared to sham it at the time; I have seen him perfectly aware of what he was about.</p>

               <p>I have been with him three times, and he has never shewn any thing of this kind, but when he has been in custody and brought to trial; he has been passed to his parish by Mr. Kirby several times; I believe he is as great a rogue as any in this country.</p>

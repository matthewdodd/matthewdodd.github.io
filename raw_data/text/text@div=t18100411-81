            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday night, the 20th of March, I was informed there, was a a disturbance in Bell-court; I immediately went there, I saw five men coming out of the court; I saw Murray, he had a scratch on the side of his face; Crawley was the last one that went down the steps, they all five went into Fox-court, and then they told me they would rip my b - y guts out; I drew my cutlass and called a watchman to my assistance; I went after them, they all escaped; they said they could beat fifteen or twenty watchmen at any time; Price came to me, we met Weston and Murray at the corner of the court; I secured Murray, we took him to the watchhouse; I am sure Murray is one of the five; I thought Crawley was one of them, but I cannot swear to him. Crawley bears an infamous name; the neighbourhood is all in terror of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HUTT. I apprehended Crawley last Wednesday night at the Sugur Loaf in King-street, Drury-lane, he made great resistance when I took him; he said he supposed I wanted him for that bawdy house row.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Henry. How did you get these things - A. The men made their escape, and after this was over some men came in the court with a woman, they had the curtains and tea tray, the woman said, I advised these men to bring the curtains back, as they belong to you; the men said they would not deliver them unless I would give them some gin; I told them I had no gin, and made haste in doors, they threw the things in after me.</p>
               <p>Crawley's Defence.

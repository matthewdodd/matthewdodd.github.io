            . I was with the prosecutor on the night in question - I am a stone-mason, and live in Barnsbury-row; I was not sober, but was more so than Farley- he had a glass of liquor at the last public-house, opposite Whitecross-street, and when he came out I asked if his watch was safe; he pulled it out, and gave it to me to take care of - I put it into my waistcoat pocket; a person we had been drinking with, and who had worked with us, was with us; the prisoner came up, and said, "Mr. Farley, I will see you home" - I thought he might know him; Farley said, "You have got my watch, let me have it;" I gave it him, and went away - I am sure I put it into his hand; I heard the rattle spring, then went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner - I cannot say he is the same person as had joined Farley; I saw the watch in the watchman's hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give the watch into my hand, and tell me to see your friend home, as you was going to leave him? A. No, I am sure I gave it to my friend, and to nobody else - I believe it was handed from one to the other before the other man parted from us, but not when the prisoner was with us; I am sure I gave it to Farley - I was angry with him, because he would not come with me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Monday night, the 13th of December, I was coming up Cateaton-street - the two witnesses were very much in liquor; the prisoner was behind them, and said, "My lads, I will see you home;" he turned to Roberts and said, "Give your friend his watch;" Roberts took the watch from his right - hand waistcoat pocket, and gave it into Farley's right-hand - I was about six yards from them: the prisoner instantly snatched the watch from Farley's hand, and ran down Aldermanbury - I pursued, and caught him by the Axe inn; he immediately dropped the watch from his hand - I took him to the watch-house; Farley came in, and claimed it - I had been watching them all the time.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I had been drinking, and as I returned home I met the witnesses and the other, who I had formerly known - I got into conversation with them; Farley was very much in liquor; his friend and the other wished me to see him home - Farley gave the watch to his friend; he gave it to me, and left him: Farley wished for it back again, and I gave it to him again - we walked a little way; his friend came up to us - he gave it to him, and then it was in my hand again; I had no intention of stealing it.</p>

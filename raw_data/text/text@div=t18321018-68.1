            . I saw the prisoner come into the subscription-room; being a stranger I watched him, as several coats and umbrellas had been taken before - he spoke to nobody, but took his seat at the table, and took up the newspaper, but instead of reading it, he had his eye on different persons in the room; then walked about, and read the list of subscribers, which is near the closet door, which was open - he took his seat again; a gentleman, walked in, and put his umbrella in the closet - directly he was gone the prisoner went into the closet, and pulled the door too after him; I watched the room door till he came out, and then stopped him with this coat on his back - he said it was his, and he had hung it up a few minutes before; I said I had seen him come in without one.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

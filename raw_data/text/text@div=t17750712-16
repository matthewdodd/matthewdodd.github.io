               <p>Flack. No, He asked her for my watch and money; she threw the watch under the bed and a case of combs; I gave her some money before I went to bed; she said, she had no money: the money was afterwards found in her shoe.</p>

               <p>Morgan Williams. I am waiter at the Red Lion in Piccadilly. On Monday was se'ennight the prisoner and the prosecutor came into our house at near 11 o'clock, he said, he wanted a bed for him and his wife; I shewed them the bed, and he paid me a shilling for it; they then had a quartern of brandy, and in about half an hour after they had a quartern of rum; the prisoner came down in the morning and offered me six-pence to let her go out; I took her into the room and waked the prosecutor, and she threw the watch and some other things on the bed before she was charged with the robbery. I went and fetched the constable, and she was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was at a house called the New Castle upon Tyne, near Cambridgestreet: after the prisoner was committed there was the constable's wife, the constable and another man; I found four guineas upon her, between the callico and lining of her shoe, in a dirty ragg, pined to the lining of her shoe.</p>

               <p>The money was sent me by my friends in Ireland two days before, to go over to them; the prosecutor met me in Piccadilly, he said, he knew me, he pulled me into the place, and took me into a back room, and gave me two shillings. I said I did not want it, I had money enough of my own; he put it in my bosom and used me ill, he made me drink part of two quarterns of rum.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. Was he asleep when you carried up the 2d quatern?</p>

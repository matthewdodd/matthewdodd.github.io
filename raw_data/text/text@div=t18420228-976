                  </hi>. I am a clerk at Messrs. Hanburys', and have been so better than thirty years. On the 1st of February if Adams collected notes and handed them to the clearing clerk, who gave them to Boone, they would be locked up—they would be handed to the prisoner next morning for him to enter the particulars of the notes in a book which he kept called "The goldsmiths' receivable book"—these notes would not form part of the assets of the bank nor be paid out to the public, till they were entered in this book—they would not be paid away the day they are received, nor till they had passed through the prisoner's hands and were entered in this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280091"></xptr>
               <p>book—notes received by Adams in this way are never paid away the same day, but are locked up and entered next morning—they are never paid away before that—Berry would not make up his clearing till after five o'clock—the notes would go into Boone's hands late that evening—he would lock them up, and in the morning they would be entered before they were paid away the next day—notes brought by Adams would not go into Boone's hands till business hours were over—this entry of the "2nd Feb<lb></lb>ruary," in the goldsmiths' receivable book is in the prisoner's writing—here is an entry of three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—one is "No. 27,341," dated 10th Dec. 1840—the notes are entered in order, according to their amounts—this is the last of the tens—the following entry is, "30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 32427, dated 8th of October, 1841," and there is-another 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note entered next to it—the prisoner makes these entries at a desk in the front, near the window—another clerk sits next to him at the time—as the prisoner enters the notes, which are placed with their faces to him, he turns them down with his left-hand—they are sorted according to their amounts—here is an entry some pages on, under the same date, of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"27347 Port., 10th of December, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the only difference between that and the other is the word "Port." and the figure "7"—Port. meant the Portsmouth branch of the Bank of England, but if the word is "Post," I should read it, "Bank Post, bill"—I was present at five o'clock, balancing the account of the bank on the 2nd of February, and late in the evening, we were found to be 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I and the clerks went through the books to trace it if we could, and after that went through it again to look through the notes received, and missed a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—we ascertained the number and date of it—the prisoner stood close at hand assisting in tracing the deficiency—it was announced that a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of such a number and date was missed, and shortly after the prisoner left the spot where he was, and returned with that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his hand, and pro<lb></lb>duced it—it was of the number and date missing—I did not see where be brought it from—he said he had brought it out of his desk, he supposed it bad got in there with some papers he had before him during the day—his desk is at the end of the shop—that is not the desk at which he was in the habit of making the entries—very great surprise was expressed at what he said—I told him I thought it was rather improbable (as soon as he bad entered the notes in the morning, it was his duty to turn them down with his left hand, and either put them before the cashier, or the cashier would take them himself—he had no authority to do any thing else with them—if Boone wanted any notes which lay before him, he would take them away; in any event, the prisoner would not carry them from his desk to Boone at the counter—they were close together—the desk he spoke of is his private desk, and is quite at the further end of the shop—not near Boone—he had no authority whatever to change any of these notes, nor to get cash for them) the production of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note did not set the account straight—we were then 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over, having missed only 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we tried, but could not find out how it was that night—I have what we call the "daily ticket" of the 2nd of February, which is in the prisoner's hand—we ultimately found that we had got the first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note but none corresponding with the second entry, "Port." or "Post"—we paid we first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note into the Bank of England afterwards—these "daily tickets" are in the prisoner's handwriting, and are prepared by him—they represent a certain, sun of money to be included in the calculations of the day—the total</p>

                  </hi>. On the 11th of February I was with my brother, when the prisoner was called into the private room—I said it would be better for him to explain or tell the truth about this matter—he did not say any thing on this charge before that—before I said that, I merely mentioned about the ticket of a bill sent to Ipswich, and he said he was 101. short, that is all—upon that I said it would be better for him to tell me all—I had seen him on the 8th or 9th—I did not then use any expression at to its being better for him to explain—I asked him to explain bow the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note got into his desk—he said it got it with some letters of his—I asked him to show me the letters, and he brought me some quite small letter and besides that, there was a piece of brown paper covering a book belonging to a customer, which he had by him—I attended before the lord Mayor—I believe the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was not produced or mentioned there.</p>

I was at breakfast in my parlour, at the back of my shop—on turning my head, I saw the prisoner take these boots and shoes off my counter—he went out—I followed him to the door, and called, "Stop thief"—he was stopped just before he got to High-street—(he went along Paddington-street towards High-street)—I laid hold of him, and charged him with having taken my boots and shoes—he said he had not—I said I was certain I had seen him take them off the counter—I took him into my shop, and in a few minutes the constable came—I found the boots and shoes just outside the door—I am sure the prisoner was the person who took them—I lost sight of him going out of the door—I saw him again running very fast.</p>

The prisoner came in, and asked me to drink; we drank a pint or two of beer together, and then I fell asleep; when I waked I missed my watch and my money. I wound the watch up just before I fell asleep; there was nobody in the room with me but the prisoner and the landlord. When I awaked the prisoner was gone: having a strong suspicion of him, I had him taken up, and a pawnbroker's duplicate of my watch was found upon him; he had pawned it in his own name. I was rather in liquor. (The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

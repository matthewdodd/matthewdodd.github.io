I am a master carman, and live in King-street Tower-hill—the prisoner Sandford was in my service—on the 26th of Nov, I sent him with a van and horse to Fresh Wharf, to remove fifty bottles of quicksilver from there, for Mr. Anselmo de Arroyare, and to take them to the South Western Railway, to go to Southampton, to be shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi>—I sent him out about two o'clock in the afternoon, and he ought to have been back about seven—I was out that evening, but I know that he returned about ten o'clock—it was his duty to come to busines the next morning as usual, and he came about six in the morning, and left at seven, but I did not see him—I saw nothing of him after he went to fetch the goods—he had given me no notice of leaving me—he left word with my wife, that one of the bottles of quicksilver was short weight, and they would not receive it—I went to the police-office on the 27th of Nov., about eleven o'clock—I saw Saunders and Robinson in custody—I saw these two bottles of quicksilver which had been found—I went with Thorpe, the officer, to the Southampton Railway on the same day—I found there one bottle that had been rejected as light—this is it—it turned out to be full of lead—I went from the railway station to Southampton—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Trident</hi>—I overhauled the forty<lb></lb>nine bottles of quicksilver there, and found amongst them another of those <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>—this is it—they are both old quicksilver bottles, but filled with lead instead of quicksilver—in consequence of the discovery I had made, I looked out for Sandford, and some days after<lb></lb>wards I received a message—on Tuesday, the 3rd of Dec., I went to a public-house in Jewry-street, Aldgate—I found Sandford there—he said he had been drawn into the thing, by Maynard stopping him at the Woolpack, as he was going up the Minories—he said May<lb></lb>nard gave him some beer and gin, and asked him what he was going to load, and he told him some quicksilver, and where he was going to take it to, that Maynard said he could make it all right, that he had got two <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi>, that could be substituted for two of the bottles of quicksilver, if he would meet him over in the Borough—he said that Maynard and another man met him in the Borough, and there they made the ex<lb></lb>change, arid took the original bottles out, and lifted the <hi rend="italic">dummies</hi> in—he said the cart that brought the dummies and took the bottles away had the name of Richard Owen upon it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 155.) On Tuesday evening, the 26th of Nov., I was in Pennington-street, Ratcliffe-highway, about five minutes before six o'clock—I was near Waypoole's door, and saw a cart standing there, which I afterwards saw had the name of Richard Owen on it—I saw two men taking something out of the tail of the cart, and drag<lb></lb>ging</p>

               <p>it into Waypoole's passage—Saunders was one—the other I did not know—I entertained some suspicion, and went to the passage—I saw Lucas there with alight—I spoke to her, and got her answer—I did not see that she went back towards the shop, for I went and looked into the cart to see what it contained—I, then saw Saunders come out of the house, and turn to the right—he walked first, and then began to run—I stopped him, and took him into custody—I do not know what became of the other man—I did not see him go—Saunders said, "Let me go, I have done nothing"—I said he was dragging something through the passage—he said, "Let me go"—I said, "I will not"—I took him back through the passage into the shop—I saw two bags there—I said, "What have you got in these two bags?"—he said, "I don't know, a carman hired me to help to unload them"—I sent for another constable, and examined the bags—they contained these two bottles of quicksilver, marked with the Nos. 1438 and 1445, on them—they have been unscrewed, and foun to contain quicksilver, and the weight of them is 921bs. each—I took the cart and the quicksilver to the station—the horse was smoking very much—my brother officer took Saunders—it might be about half-past six when I entered the charge against him, and between seven and eight, Robinson and made application for the horse and cart, and I went with him and came the inspector to Owen's, in Fashion-street—I did not say anything to Robinson about it, but in the course of the night I received orders from my inspector to take Robinson also into custody—I think there were some words passed between us—I blamed him very much for not keeping with his horse and cart—as I was afterwards taking him along Church-lane, Whitechapel, to go to Denmark-street station, he complained very much of being ruptured, and said he was very from it, and he hoped I would not lock him up—I told him he would have every accommodation as far as could be allowed in the station, but I could not let him go—he said I was very hard—I said, no, I was not—he said, "I did not do it, but I know all about it, and if you will give me a penny-worth of rum (pointing to the Prince of Wales public-house) I will tell you all about it"—I said I should do no such thing, and whatever he said to me I should use in evi<lb></lb>dence against him—he then said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. About nine 'o'clock at night, on the 26th of Nov., Robinson came to Denmark-street station—he said, "have come about the horse and cart that was brought here"—Mr. Owen's father was in the station, and he said to me, "That is Robinson"—I said, "Robinson, did you go out with the horse and cartthis morn<lb></lb>ing had you charge of it?"—he said, "Yes, I made three jobs of it, but I had not charge of it all day"—I said, "When did you leave the horse and cart?"—he said, "About half-past three a person came and hired it, and said he wanted it for about a 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. job—I accompanied the horse and cart into the Borough, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> then said the hired the horse and cart, who are they?"—he said, "There was a gentleman with the person who hired the horse and cart—I said, "What did you hear next of the horse and cart?"—he said, "I was standing near the cornier of Well-street, about</p>

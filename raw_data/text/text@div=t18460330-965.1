                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Royal Jennerian Institution, and reside in Orchard-street, Hackney—I have known the prisoner for many years—he was our collector up to the 12th of Dec, 1844—he was then dis<lb></lb>charged, and Mr. David Hine succeeded him—it had been his duty as col<lb></lb>lector to receive subscriptions, and to endeavour to obtain new subscribers—our institution is for the purpose of distributing vaccine matter, and to vacci<lb></lb>nate all who apply to the institution—we had a set of regular subscribers—the prisoner would have a report in his possession, containing their names—he was paid a per centage on his. collections formerly, and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as all his time was occupied; but latterly he was only engaged in collecting—he had no authority to receive subscriptions since Dec. 1844—Mr. Reeves has been a subscriber of ours for many years—no subscription of his has been paid to me by the prisoner since Dec. 1844.—I received none in Feb. 1846—this card (<hi rend="italic">looking at one affixed to the receipt</hi>) is not a card authorized by the institu<lb></lb>tion and this receipt is not one authorized by us, it is quite a different form—I produce one of the forms we use, and which the prisoner was in the habit of using when he was collector—I know Mr. Hine's signature—I do not believe</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been the secre<lb></lb>tary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between seven and eight years—the prisoner was collector for upwards of twenty years—the institution is conducted by a board of managers consisting of twelve—one of them has a rope wharf—he is not a ropemaker—one is a chemist and one a tailor, and Dr. Epps is one—we have two stations for vaccination—there is another institution, a government one—we have never represented ours as the government institution, nor pretended that we had a great many stations, for the purpose of getting money—I never heard of such a thing and do not believe it—I was a schoolmaster at Watford before I became secretary to this institution—I left there twenty-three years ago—I have since then held another situation for twenty-two years, as school-master at Hackney—I understand that the prisoner was thrown out of a gig while he was in the service of the society—he is crippled—I do not know whether his lameness proceeded from that circumstance or another—after he was dis<lb></lb>charged he stated that a sum of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to him—I have not seen him since his dismissal—he sent in an account for 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by his wife—I never heard him say, that as I would not pay him what was owing to him, he would col<lb></lb>lect the subscriptions and pay himself—I swear I did not hear him say so—I believe he was a very active collector, and that he advanced the interests of the institution as far as laid in his power—his brother is a life governor—the prisoner is brother to Mr. Chafey, the auctioneer, at Brighton—I do not know of his getting 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a lady of title—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was bequeathed to the society by a Mrs. Wakefield, but I do not know that the prisoner was instrumental in that—it came through another medium—we had sent out letters to the sub<lb></lb>scribers stating the prisoner's dismissal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you know that be meant to collect before you sent out those letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We might suppose that he would do such a thing, but we could not know he meant to do it—I did not know it—it is usual to send out letters to apprize the subscribers of the change in the collector—we only stated, that from irregularities in our former collector we had dismissed him, and begged the subscribers not to pay him—this is the letter that was put out.</p>

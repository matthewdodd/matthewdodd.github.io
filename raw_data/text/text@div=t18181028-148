He lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280056"></xptr>with me until the 10th of March, and then left me without giving any reason. He went out one morning, said he was going to look for work, and never returned - I did not know he was going to leave me. I was with child by him at the time; the child was born two months ago in St. Martin's workhouse. The prisoner took a few of my things, and made away with the chief of my clothes to support himself while he was with me.</p>

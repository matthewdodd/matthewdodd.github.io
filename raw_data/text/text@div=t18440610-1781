                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Bridge-house Place, New<lb></lb>ington Causeway, in the parish of St. George. On the 11th of May, Edwards and another man came to my shop—Edwards asked what I would charge him to make a pair of trowsers—I told him the price—he said he had a friend in the drapery business, that he should get the stuff of—the other one, who is not here, said, "Perhaps Mr. Summers can show you some patterns of summer trowsers," which I did—Edwards remarked they were very hand<lb></lb>some, and if his friend had not anything to please him better, he would call in the course of the morning and be measured for a pair of them—they then went away—about ten minutes after, the shop bell rang again, and this letter was brought in to me—whilst I was reading it I heard a bustle on the stairs—I ran up, and ran out, bawling "Stop thief"—I ran to the coach-stand at the corner of the Borough-road, and saw the two prisoners in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was standing—I said to Edwards, "What, is it you, sir?"—he said, "Yes, it is me, I know nothing about it," he did not know what I meant, or some<lb></lb>thing</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and work for Mr. Summers in a back shop, the parlour is between the front and back shops—I can see through the parlour window into the front shop. On the 11th of May I heard the bell ring, and saw Johnson admitted, and saw him deliver a note to the ser<lb></lb>vant—she went in the direction of the kitchen—I saw Johnson pass round the end of the counter towards where the cloths are kept—I kept my eye on the shop, and saw Johnson return with a piece of cloth—Iran through the passage into the front shop—I saw the direction in which he went—he had the cloth under his arm—the <hi rend="italic">cab-stand</hi> is about forty yards from the door—part of it is in view of the shop—I should think that a person standing at the nearest extremity of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—stand, could command a view of a person going out of the shop into the street—I saw Johnson put the cloth in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and then get in—I and some neighbours, with Mr. Summers, sur<lb></lb>rounded the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the prisoners were kept there till the constable came—I saw Edwards inside the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

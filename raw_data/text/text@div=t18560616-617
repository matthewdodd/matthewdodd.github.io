               <p>could be done—he said, "Who is there here that you care about; there is nothing here but a lot of old b—s, that ought to have been out of this world long ago"—I then asked him bow he was going to manage it—he said, "There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog; give them a dose, and they will not know of it, and we will put them all right; the look-out, we will pass him overboard, and then we will cut the back rope, go aft, and ask the second mate, the officer of the watch, to come for'ard, and serve him the same as the look-out, and they are settled with, out any more noise"—he then asked me if I was frightened to take a life—before that he said, "There is no one but the boatswain and the carpenter then to fear about; a small bit of steel will settle them"—he then said, "Are you frightened to take a life?"—I said, "I never have done it yet"—he said, "I won't ask you to do that, I will do all that myself; do you think another one would do better, so as to have one on each side of the deck?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Who can you pick on?"—I picked on a man of the name of Whittington, it being his next look-out to relieve me—I did not tell him that Whittington was the next look-out, but I picked upon Whittington because it was his next look-out—before this passed about Whittington, he said, "After the captain and mate is out of the way, we will then go aft, and haul up the ladder, and lay it across the; hatch, so as no one can come up from below; I know who sleeps in every berth, and where the arm chest is, and I will load everything in the arm chest, and then tell the passengers that the ship is in the hands of the crew, and they will think all hands are in it; then I will go into the rooms, and pick them off as I want them"—he said be would shoot the captain and mate, and he should have twelve shots left after he had shot them—I asked him if he would kill the women too—he said, "Only the old women, we will keep the young ones until we get on the coast of Peru, and when we get the gold in the boat, we will scuttle the ship, and let the women go down with her; we can then bury the gold in the sand, and we can either go to the Salt Lake, or take the steamboat to Panama, and then we are all right; it is only a bold stroke, and it is ours as easy as anything"—he then began with Whittington—four bells struck, and Whittington came—during this long talk, I drank twice with the prisoner, it was brandy—the prisoner had it, he get it from a keg standing on the forecastle head, where we were standing—he took it out of that—when Whittington came up, the prisoner said to him, "We shall be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with, <hi rend="italic">Tom"</hi>—that was the first thing he said to him—he gave Whittington a pannikin of brandy, and said, "How would you like to have your share in it?"—Whittington drank the brandy, and it made him sick, and he said, "D—it, that is brandy sure enough"—he said, "Yes, that is the real stuff"—Whittington said if we were taken by the Russians be would volunteer until we fell in with a British man-of-war, or else we should get <hi rend="italic">cooked</hi>—the prisoner then said to Whittington, "What do you say, will you join? there is a way of getting of it, if you will only stick to me, I will sign the contract with my heart's blood; what do you say to that, Tom? will you join? for there was never a better ship came out of Melbourne or Hobson's Bay, that will be easier took, for when the captain and mate is out of the way, I will have charge of the ship in ten minutes"—he said, "There is not a man in the forecastle that will refuse a glass of grog, is there?"—<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> said, "No"—he said, "With some stuff, I can give them a dose, and she won't know of it; they won't get over it just directly"—Whittington asked me what I thought of it—I said I did not think it could be managed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160063"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner asked Whittington how many he wanted to join—he said, "Not lees than half a dozen"—the prisoner laid, "Who can you depend upon?"—Whittington said, "Not one"—he said, "It has got to be done, and it must be done, for I have come on board on purpose for that, and nothing else, and the sooner it is done the better, for the ship shall never take me round the Horn, nor neither to London'—he said, "I shall load my revolvers to-morrow, and I shall not unload them until they hare done execution"—he said to <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> "You load yours, but clean it first; you need not be frightened at a pistol; you have been in the Ballarat riots"—Whit<lb></lb>tington said he was no more frightened of a pistol than he was—the prisoner said he knew that, and that was the reason he put it to him—he said we would get the gold in the boat, and bury it in the sand—he told the same to Whittington as what he had told to me, and after the gold was buried in the sand he would scuttle the ship—eight bells then struck, and we sepa<lb></lb>rated—on the following morning (Tuesday, 19th) Whittington and I were on watch together on deck from 4 o'clock to 8, and we had some talk together about this; the prisoner was not there—he was in the same watch till we went below—I had no talk with the prisoner till we went below—that was from 8 o'clock to 12—we were then off watch—he was then kneeling over his hunk, after breakfast; he beckoned to me, and I went there—he took out two revolvers, and said. "What do you think of them I"—there were six barrels to each revolver—there were also two single barrelled pistols, and two daggers, and two or three small bottles—when he asked me what I thought of them, I said they were <hi rend="italic">stunners</hi>—I said "I see you are well prepared for it"—he said, "By G—, they have never deceived me yet, and they are not going to do it either; I am a dead shot with either of these pistols"—he showed me how the pistols worked—he said, "I can discharge every one of these barrels as quick as I can Work my finger"—I then saw him feed the pistols—he loaded them with balls—in some barrels he put two halls, and in some one—he did not load them all—I only saw him load the two six-barrelled revolvers—I did not see him load the single pistols; I do not know whether they were loaded—lie then put them into his bag, and put it into his bunk, where he slept—it does not shut down or shut up in any way; it stands about five feet off the deck—I asked him what was in <hi rend="italic">them</hi> bottles—he said, "Ton can judge," and carefully put them back again into the bag—I saw that the bottles were full of something; it was a liquid—in the course of that day one of the crew went to the boatswain for some spun yarn—he gave it him, and said he must be very careful of it, for they must soon begin to make some—the prisoner laid to me, "Do you hear that? if he lives to see any span yarn made, I am deceived"—on the following day (Wednesday, 20th) the prisoner came to me, as I was coming from the wheel, and said he was frightened that Whittington would have nothing to do with it, "but b—him, we will get his revolver, and then we don't care whether he joins or not; we will talk it over in the next watch; we can settle Whittington; don't you think you and I can manage it?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I will go and sound Jonathan," meaning a seaman of the name of Hugh Kent, who went by the name of Jonathan—he then went over to Kent, who was on the other side of the deck, and had some conversation with him, which I did not hear—while he was with Kent, Whittington went over to him; he came back, and said that they had some brandy there, and the prisoner had asked him to have some; after that the prisoner came over, and said, "It is all right, I find he is staunch as a piece of iron, and we don't care whether Whittington jobs or not now;</p>

               <p>what do you say now for to-morrow night? we are far enough to the south'ard; she is just under the canvas I want; that will do all the way to the coast of Peru; there could not be a better time; they are all sick in the cabin; I hope you are not <hi rend="italic">funking</hi> upon it; we will have it to<lb></lb>morrow night"—I said, no, I was not <hi rend="italic">funking</hi> on it—he said, "That is right, for I have got everything ready, everything prepared"—he said, "You are not frightened of a pistol? I have stood before four armed men, and told them to stand, and made them deliver up everything they had got, and they were glad to get away with their lives"—I asked him where about was that, and he said it was on the Avoca diggings—I asked him how long he had been out here—he said, "Four years, but I have been in England since"—after this I asked him what he had in the bottles—he said it was laudanum, and mentioned some other stuff which I forget the name of—he said that he would put that in the brandy, and that would make all hands quiet enough—with this brandy he was going to have a birthday, and the laudanum and the other stuff he was going to put in this, and hocus the crew for'ard—he said, "There is <hi rend="italic">Jack, Long Jem,</hi> Phillips, and Harry Bluff; we will give them an extra dose, so as to make sure of them"—on the following evening; Thursday, the 21st, I was on the look-out, on the forecastle end, from 6 to 8 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "Well, my chief officer, what do think of it now T—I said, "As much as ever I did"—he said, "What do you say for to-morrow night? there can't be a better time, and we are far enough to the south'ard"—I told him that he had better leave it alone altogether, for I should have nothing at all to do with it—he then said, "I would as soon go down now and shoot myself as not; it is Whittington that has been persuading you off it"—I said, "No, I wanted no persuasion"—he said, "I will be revenged on him; if it had not been for you and <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> she would have been in my hands long before this; all that I am sorry <hi rend="italic">fat</hi> is that ever I spoke to a soul on board"—he then said, "If I can depend on you and Whittington, she shall be in my hands before Saturday morning, at 4 o'clock, or else I will be a corpse in that cabin; I have been stopping on shore six weeks, waiting for the Hong Kong escort, but, as there was no gold shipped for China, I took this, being the first chance"—Whittington was not present at this conversation—when I came off the look<lb></lb>out at 8 o'clock, I told Whittington to look out for himself, and told him what had passed between me and the prisoner—on the Friday morning I saw the captain and mate, and made a disclosure of this; Whittington went first, and reported it to the mate, and then we were both called in together to the captain—it was on the Thursday evening that I had the last talk with the prisoner; I came off the look-out at 8 o'clock, and saw Whittington that same night; I think it was from 12 to 4 o'clock—it was about 9 o'clock on Friday morning that I saw the captain.</p>

I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Stebonheath</hi> I joined at Melbourne, the day before Bolitho—I had not known Bolitho before joining the ship—we sailed on Sunday, the 17th—on the following day I relieved Bolitho at the look-out, at 10 o'clock at night—he remained on the forecastle after I relieved him; the prisoner was there, and he remarked that it would be a fine prize for the Russians to fall in with—I said, laughing, "Yes," and that I would volunteer till we fell in with a British man-of-war, or else we should get <hi rend="italic">cooked</hi>—the prisoner said, "Here is a nice pile here, how would you like your share of it?" at the same time he held a pannikin, and told me to take a <hi rend="italic">robber</hi>—I drank, and it made me quite sick, and almost took my breath away—I said, "D—it, that is brandy, sure enough"—he said, "Yes, that is the real stuff;" he then asked me again how I should like a share of it, and told me there was two tons on board—he did not say particularly of what, but he was speaking of money or gold, and there was a way of getting it—he said, "There are three of us, and if you two will stick to me, I will sign the contract with my heart's blood"—I then asked Bolitho what he thought of it—he said he did not think it could be done—"No," says I, "I must see clearly before me before I go in"—I then told Lewis that we were not strong enough—he asked me how many we wanted—I said, "Not less than half a dozen"—"Well," said Lewis, "it has got to be done; I am prepared, and came on board for nothing else," and he swore that he would never go round Cape Horn or to London in her—he said, "I could do it alone, but it is too much for one; by G—we will have it without a soul for'ard knowing about it; I</p>

               <p>again next night (Wednesday) from 8 to 12 o'clock—the prisoner came to me in the latter part of the watch, and said, "I spoke to Jonathan, and he is firm"—I said, "You have?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then it will go aft, don't you see how he is always praising the ship up?"—he said, "Oh, that is nothing"—Bolitho came up to us then, and Lewis told us again the same as he had been telling to me; but said he did not tell Kent that we were in it, but that he was going to do it, only tried him whether he would do such a thing; and he said, "I am sure he will join"—I said, "I will have nothing to do with it," but I told him it was safe, and it should go no further—that was all that took place then that I recollect—I then turned in—this was on Wednesday night—on the Friday morning I went to the mate, a little after 8 o'clock, and told him what had happened—the prisoner was then at the wheel—the mate was in his state room—before I went to the mate, I had seen and spoken to Bolitho, a very few minutes before—I was told by the mate to come into the cabin and report it to the captain—I and Bolitho went in together, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">that he was not compelled to answer questions which might tend to criminate himself</hi>)—I have been talking about the note in the forecastle—there was a house burnt down—I had nothing to do with the burning of that house, I swear that—I never told the prisoner that I had, nor anything of the sort—I was present when it was burnt; I saw it, I was looking on—at one of the conversations Bolitho said it would want a good scholar, to navigate the ship, I understood—I said I could run her down there—we had a dispute about more help; Bolitho said the help was not strong enough—he did not say, "We want more help;" he said there was not help enough—Walter, and me, and Lewis were disputing about more help—Walter held with me that there was not enough, Lewis said there was plenty—this was on the Tuesday, from 8 till 12 o'clock—it was on the Tuesday, in the dog watch, that Lewis said he would try Jonathan, and I said, "Don't do that, or else you will sell yourself;" or something of that sort—I told him that because I was frightened it should go further before it went aft—T did not know anything about whether Kent would join; I was afraid it would go further among the crew, before it went aft—by "going aft "I mean going to the captain—I have heard Kent praising the ship in the forecastle—I do not know that he was always doing it, I have heard him very often—it was true that he was in the habit of praising the ship.</p>

He then again said, 'How would you like your share of it? it can easily be done; there are about two tons of it' I replied, 'I could not think of it' He said, 'I will have another to join; I have pistols; I will shoot the captain and mate, and then shall have twelve shots to spare; I have a keg of brandy and a bottle of laudanum to set the crew to sleep; we can make away with them after securing the captain, ran the ship down to the coast of Peru, and scuttle her, if you two will stick to me; I will sign with my heart's blood a treaty for you to share; you will have nothing to do but stand at the gangway with a pistol; I will manage the cabin; you must shoot the first man that comes out of the forecastle, if they are not sufficiently dosed; by G—, I will have charge of the cabin before Saturday morning, 4 o'clock; it is time the old mate was out of this world.' William Lewis being at this time at the wheel, sent Mr. Harris, the second mate, with Whittington and Bolitho, to seize the arms in his bunk; they exactly agreed with their description of them, consisting of two six-barrel Colt revolvers, loaded, and in perfect order, two single-barrel pistols, two bowie knives, bullets, caps, and powder")—I made that entry on 6th March, copied from one taken down at the time the statement was made—I took it down at the time from their mouths, and afterwards made an accurate copy of it into the log, and read it over to Whittington and Bolitho—I have not</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner complained, did he not, after this statement was read over to him, of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been taken out of his belt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till we got before Mr. Yardley, at the Thames police court; that was the first I heard of it—there was a belt, I think it is mentioned in the official log—it appears to be a belt for carrying gold dust and money—the seamen do not carry these kind of knives; they do carry knives, but not bowie knives—we do not search their chests—I never saw them with a bowie knife—I think it is very unusual for a seaman in our service to have a bowie knife—I do not know whether the gold diggers carry them; I have never been to the diggings—the Colt's revolvers are still loaded—I do not know whether there is a difficulty in withdrawing the charge—I kept them loaded to produce—I scarcely know whether or not there is a rule against discharging pistols in the Bay of Melbourne.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know anything of a China escort being ex<lb></lb>pected with gold about the time your vessel sailed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a vessel to sail for Hong Kong with gold—I do not know whether or not the gold had come down from the country—it does come down to the banks under escort.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the gold that you bring home come in dust or in quartz? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In dust; it is deposited in the after run of the ship, not in my cabin—it does not occupy a great space.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second mate of the <hi rend="italic">Stebonheath</hi> on her homeward passage from Melbourne. On Friday, 22nd Feb., by the captain's direction, I went to the place where the bunks are—I went to the prisoner's bunk, and there found the whole of the things that have been produced—I took them to the captain—I afterwards loaded the two single-barrel pistols by the captain's direction—I kept possession of all these things until the vessel arrived at Gravesend—I then handed them over to inspector White when the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector.</hi>) The prisoner was given into my charge on 24th May, by the captain, on board the vessel, at Gravesend—I told him that he was charged with mutiny, and he must consider him<lb></lb>self my prisoner—he made no answer—I received the articles produced from Mr. Harris, in the presence of the captain, in the cuddy—I conveyed the prisoner by rail to London, and took him to the Thames police station,</p>

               <p>Wapping, where the charge was taken by superintendant Evans, and read over to the prisoner—I have the charge sheet here, it contains a list of the things I had to take care of—when the part was read which describes the single-barrelled pistols as being loaded, the prisoner said, "I did not load them"—the list describes the revolvers as being loaded, to that he said nothing—when we came to the belt, he said, "There was fifty sovereigns in that belt"—he had not said anything to me about the fifty sovereigns before that—I had travelled with him all the way from Gravesend—I said I would have some inquiry made about it—he said all the articles belonged to him—inspector Shane was with me—I left the prisoner in his custody for a short time at Gravesend, while I went to take the tickets—I handed this bottle to Mr. Boss, it was then full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital I have examined the contents of this bottle which I received from inspector White—it contains laudanum—I have not tested the strength, it appears to be commercial laudanum, which is a little more than half the strength of the best which we use in our hospitals.</p>

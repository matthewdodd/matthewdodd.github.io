               <p>On the 26th of September, about three o'clock, I was cleaning down the kitchen stairs, I heard a strange foot in the parlour, I called out, who is there? nobody made me any answer. I immediately went up stairs and met the prisoner coming out of the room with the gown in his hand; I said, that is my gown; and I took the gown from him, and I called to my husband, who was in the kitchen, that a man had taken a gown and ran away, and he immediately pursued him, and then called out stop thief! and he was taken and brought back. The gown has been in the hands of the officer ever since, but the officer was ill and could not attend. This is the gown. The house was open, and the children were playing about the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Be so good as to ask her whether I did not ask her if there was any owner for that gown, as it lay at the door? - I do not recollect any such circumstance.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was walking along the street, and I see the gown lay at the door, and I picked it up, and this lady came, and I asked her if it was her property? and she said it was; and I gave it her, and walked deliberately away.</p>
